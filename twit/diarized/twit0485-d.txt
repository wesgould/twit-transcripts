Transcript:  Close. It's the same thing. Software.  Also with us, Tim Stevens, former editor-in-chief at Engadget.  He's now doing car tech at CNET.  And very timely to have you on. Welcome, Tim, because the LA Car Show was this week.  Thanks for having me.  Yeah. And I want to welcome somebody who hasn't been on our air since we decided 2008.  But he's an old friend and I think one of the great guys in the valley, Sam Lesson.  You may remember him from drop.io, which was just my favorite thing.  It allowed you to share files online, just create these ad hoc file sharing sites.  Facebook came along, bought it, put it out of business, put Sam to work.  You did the timeline, right, when you were at Facebook?

Transcript:  I'm a huge believer in Facebook. I'm very excited about the company.  Love the people that work there. But I decided at the end of August, it was time for me to move on.  So I left and I am now the intern at The Information, which I'm having a blast doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Before you say, oh, Sam, you've come down in the world, we should point out that The Information is Jessica Lesson,  and I think it's her and his wife's really great publication, kind of a new form of tech journalism aimed at people in the know.  It's a subscription only online site and newsletter.  And we've had Jessica on several times and it's really great. We think the world of both of you.

Transcript:  Is this something you've always wanted to do is be a journalist? Because I know you're writing a weekly column now.

Start time: 263.56
End time: 287.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm writing a weekly column and I wouldn't consider myself a hardcore journalist the way the rest of the team at The Information are hardcore journalists.  I'm more writing a kind of an opinion column, but I'm having a lot of fun and figuring out kind of the next steps.  But I think what they're doing is awesome. And so beyond being a supportive husband, I'm having a lot of fun working with the team and putting out some content and helping where I can.

Start time: 289.06
End time: 310.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's great. I have to say, you know, speaking as somebody who never worked in the business, I know that Kevin has, of course, and you have both kind of entrepreneurial software guys and so forth.  The nice thing about covering it is you don't have to pick sides. You don't have to, you know, you can cover the you see everything.  You have ringside seats at all the stuff that's happening. It's so much fun.

Start time: 312.00
End time: 332.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a blast. I mean, I think I'm loving kind of the perspective.  I think also, honestly, you know, having spent four years at Facebook and being a VP of product there and it's just a different perspective that really, really changes how you approach a lot of these things just because you have so much more context for what a lot of these big companies are going through and how they evaluate decisions.  So I don't know. Life is good.

Transcript:  I think it's great to get an entrepreneur on this side because, yeah, you know more than a lot on exactly what's going on inside.  So I'm glad you're here because, of course, our top story, unfortunately, has to be Uber.  And but I think it's a I don't want to cover the we will cover a little bit the kind of what happened.  He said she said thing. But more importantly, I think maybe a culture clash between the go go startup culture, Silicon Valley and and the rest of the world.  And you've been in the middle of it. What's your take? And I know you've written about this at the information.  What's your take on what's going on at Uber?

Start time: 374.10
End time: 444.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have all the respect in the world for Uber. I think it's one of the most exciting companies probably ever in terms of both what it represents for the future.  But I also think they said that this very interesting spot and kind of are the poster child for this new generation of Silicon Valley companies that actually have meaningful and immediate impact in the real world.  You know, I think the last generation of companies actually I'm ready to call it this tomorrow.  But like the last generation of companies existed in this world where they're working on productivity or communication or things where you can have great impact, but you're not changing the day to day in an immediate way.  The way a company like Uber is. And I think that, you know, when you look at Uber, Airbnb, a lot of the things that are going on now, there's such a dramatic impact in the real world immediately that it really raises raises the bar of attention that's put on them.  And kind of the professionalism that needs to happen in a lot of areas.  So, you know, my kind of take is they're a company that's figuring it out.  They're fundamentally good people from my perspective and the ones I know that that are there.  But, yeah, I mean, there's a lot to figure out and you have to grow up quickly in this day and age in terms of just the amount of attention that's put on these things.

Transcript:  Jessica Lessons lead story at the information is that there were in the Ubers saga.  There are no calls for adult supervision.  I don't know. I'll call for adult supervision.  It seems like something odd is going on.  There is this he said she said back and forth.  And I'm not sure exactly what actually happened.  There have been.  You can't we can't know because it was at a private dinner.  Uber has been accused in the past of being kind of high handed with privacy.  There's the God mode an Uber that tells Uber employees exactly where every car is and who's riding in those cars and that information could theoretically be gathered to pinpoint locations of people.  A couple of journalists have accused Uber of misusing that one pointed out that he got a text from somebody was in an Uber party said you're on the big map right now.  We know exactly where you are.  Uber unwisely decided to put the God mode up on a big screen at a party.  Another said that Uber in an effort to put pressure on this journalist one of an Uber executive was waiting for him when he arrived or her in the car and said well I know exactly where you are at all times because you're riding in an Uber.  That scares people.  There have been several cases of there's a case of assault by an Uber driver.  There's a Uber driver in San Francisco is accused of having killed a six year old running over a family.  But the ironically after all of that the big story really is this Uber executive and meal mich Michael who at a private dinner.  Speaking to the editor in chief of BuzzFeed.  According to the editor in chief at BuzzFeed said that Uber should do opposition research on journalists who are critical of Uber and attempt to dig up dirt on them in particular.  And then there's another.  Sarah Lacey from Pando Daily.  And apparently according to Ben Smith the editor at BuzzFeed he said that Emil told him that there's some particular information that would be very damaging to her.  Lacey immediately took umbrage and has made the rounds.  Some have accused her of capitalizing on this.  Another journalist who was sitting next to the two at the same event said nothing like that actually happened.

End time: 593.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She basically confirmed the narrative but said he didn't mean it.  Well she didn't say he threatened.

Start time: 594.06
End time: 614.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.  Okay let's find this article then because it's complicated.  And at this point I'm not sure who to believe.  Ben Smith of BuzzFeed may be exaggerating this.  He did one thing that was a little suspect.  His initial story referred to it a BuzzFeed journalist that was there not saying it was himself.  Which was odd.

Start time: 617.90
End time: 643.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think there's a big question of just in this day and age especially the relationship between a lot of these publications that you know and again I have all the respect and love in the world for BuzzFeed but you know they exist in this zone of publications that need to attract a lot of attention.  Because they're paid for attention.  And so I think there is a lot of mistrust right now from all angles.  I think that she said who knows.  The reality is you can't trust anyone on this stuff.

Start time: 644.36
End time: 654.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll be honest I trusted Ben Smith until I read Nicole Campbell's post on the Huffington Post.  She worked at the Obama White House with Emile Michael.  Was at this dinner.

Start time: 655.00
End time: 664.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Michael hasn't disputed that he said it and she doesn't dispute that he said it.  They're just saying but I was joking I was drunk.  There is you know no one has actually.

Start time: 665.50
End time: 697.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nicole said there was no anti-feminist sentiment no attacking families no attacking children no anger no threats against anyone no action plan nothing.  It was clear to me this was all a vague civilized conversation.  I'm a woman I'm sensitive to any talk of this kind.  Now she says I admit I'm a friend of Emile's.  But she said I believe Ben's comments the BuzzFeed editors comments caused Sarah some understandable angst.  Sarah take it from me what Ben reported is not true.  That's this is the article.

Start time: 698.60
End time: 703.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look I think what's what's clear out of this episode is that when you have hyper growth companies.

Start time: 703.36
End time: 710.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So why did Ben admit it on the day and apologize to them all.  Emile.  This is this is like subsequent spin.  Emile admitted it.

Start time: 711.00
End time: 714.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's very confusing.  Yeah.  Nobody at Uber has said Emile didn't say this.

Start time: 715.29
End time: 721.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Exactly.  He said he said he's apologized.  And Travis is sort of semi apologized.  He did apologize to Sarah but he.

Start time: 722.46
End time: 733.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's missing a little bit though.  I mean it's all just hearsay.  We don't really I mean it what's missing is context.  We don't know what the context was what the spirit of it was.

Start time: 735.13
End time: 789.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the tone of it you know the tone of it is the problem.  And I think this this sense of you know this this God mode sense is part of the problem.  I recognize part of where that comes from because it comes from when you start a startup you.  There's a very small number of you and you're working against these enormous forces in the rest of the world and it feels like you're going to take everyone on.  And then you as it grows that pressure only grows on you and then eventually you have a large company if you're really lucky and things go well.  And you don't you don't always realize that things have changed.  You're now a big company.  We've we've seen it happen with Microsoft.  We see it happen with Google.  We see it happen with Facebook where the founders have started out with this sort of massive self belief in us against the world model and then eventually realize wait a minute we are actually big enough that this is this is a factor where we impact the world.  And it's how they behave after that that makes the difference.

Start time: 790.00
End time: 838.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well I agree and I think I think that's a really that's a good point which is just like these companies grow up so fast at this point.  You know unwind Uber two years and let's talk about kind of the way you'd operate a company at that scale versus the company at the scale they're at now right now they're moving so quickly.  That's not to apologize for it.  I mean I think there's things that they obviously should be doing better at and need to get on top of.  But the reality is these questions of tone these questions of what was meant it doesn't matter.  The reality is they're a big company with a big footprint.  People watch what they do and they have to probably they have to level up very quickly much more quickly than almost any other company in history in terms of how they approach these situations.  Because of the scale of their operations and the responsibility they have.  So they're going to figure it out.  I mean I again like I think they're going to they're going to figure it out.  This is an unfortunate situation.  It was an unfortunate episode.  And the reality is it doesn't really matter what we said.  What matters is what comes out of it on the other side.

Start time: 839.20
End time: 892.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well it also matters how they behave and that that's why the God mode stuff is actually scarier.  And that the reason I deleted Uber this week was I was like OK I don't actually feel confident that you that you are good custodians of this data at the moment.  Maybe after you've got some processes in place that make me feel more comfortable I'll come back.  You know we've had that we had this with we had this with with with Facebook and the ability for everyone to see everyone else's profile that Kate Lossy described in her book.  And I don't want to put you on the spot about that Sam.  But you know I know how this stuff works as well.  When you've built the thing for the first time everyone can see the database because you've only got one database.  Anyone anyone who's an engineer can write queries against it and you end up writing little tools to understand what's going on.  And it's only later you realize actually this can be used for negative things and letting people have access to data like this is a is a policy problem and something we have to build structures around.

Start time: 892.08
End time: 909.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think I don't think anyone would contest that including Uber frankly.  I mean I again like I don't speak for them obviously but I think that's absolutely it's true.  You have to build these tools when you start going from having 20 employees to a thousand the the internal controls you have to place and put in place are real and need to happen.  So that's pretty clear.

Start time: 910.32
End time: 923.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just have to wonder where is Uber's PR in all this.  Why are they allowing for vice presidents to sit at dinners with journalists and say things like this without someone stepping in and saying hey by the way just to remind everybody this is off the record.  Well it wasn't off the record.

Start time: 924.12
End time: 936.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Me apparently wasn't off the record dinner.  I haven't been Smith was invited by Michael Wolf who knew it was off the record.  But Michael said I just assumed Ben would know it was off the record.  It wasn't.

Start time: 937.16
End time: 976.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean he didn't treat it that way really to be there at that time to say just to make sure that everybody knows.  And I've been at these sorts of dinners and it's always repeated.  This is off the record.  This is off the record especially when something as sensitive as this would come up.  So I'm wondering if that's again part of the learning part of the maturation that's required here for Uber is to know exactly when they need help.  And I think they need help in this regard.  And you know I'm sure that they have people who are helping them but maybe they need more help.  Maybe they need a little more sophistication and maybe they need to dial down things a little bit until they can get everything in check till they get a little bit more media training perhaps too until they can get a little bit more comfortable knowing what they can and cannot say even in what seems like a casual environment.

Start time: 976.28
End time: 1002.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hate to let them off the hook but then at the same time I'm not sure I trust Ben Smith.  The whole thing is a mess.  It's and it's and by the way John Hodgman tweeted he's not going to use Uber anymore.  Gina Tripani and Jeff Jarvis on this week in Google said they're not going to use Uber anymore.  I certainly wouldn't if I had but my only experience using Uber was in Paris.  I got ripped off by the driver and I haven't used it since then.

Start time: 1002.00
End time: 1005.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you should check in with those people in a year.  Yeah.

Start time: 1006.66
End time: 1081.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well I think it's hard not to use Uber because the truth about it is all this aside the experience is generally very good.  You rate the driver the driver rates you.  I don't know what it's like to drive for Uber.  I'm hearing ads on the radio every day saying we'll give you five thousand dollars in your first month to become an Uber driver.  And yet I also hear drivers saying it's you know it's terrible experience being a driver.  I want out.  I don't know what to think.  There's so many conflicting stories and this is an interesting.  I think the larger story to me which I think is more interesting from my point of view is that this is going to be the way things are going forward is that there will be many  because of the Internet because of social media because of the speed of the news cycle because there is no longer a single source of truth in it.  You know there used to be the Journal of Record the New York Times or CBS.  There's no longer a single source of truth.  So I think more and more stories are going to be like this.  We're going to hear different things from a lot of different people.  Everybody has suspect perhaps has suspect motivations.  Ben Smith wants to get clicks you know and the whole thing.  The whole thing it starts to become very difficult for an end user and end consumer of news to know what's true and what to do.  This is always true.

Start time: 1083.14
End time: 1098.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think it's more true now.  The news used to be objective is a myth and I know Jeff Jarvis would take you to task on that as well.  The thing is there was always the agendas being pushed.  It's just the question of how many people were able to speak about them and have them have the forum to post.

Start time: 1099.04
End time: 1138.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think something is fundamentally different now.  And again this is a little self-serving on behalf of my wife.  But like you know what's different now is the business model and how people get paid.  When you get paid for clicks when you get paid for getting people attention through social media and your site that incentivizes a certain type of discussion and reporting and sensationalism that I think isn't true if you're running a subscription service or you're actually paid to be a trusted source of knowledge.  So yeah I think it's always a spectrum.  I mean the news aren't black and white in the world but I think it's a little bit simplistic to say nothing has changed.  I mean the business model is that people are running and therefore what types of information moves around is dramatically different than it was you know 20 years ago.

Start time: 1139.72
End time: 1172.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well now I don't want to say that the only model is the information's model.  Certainly there's a benefit to that because the information only has to respond to its subscribers.  They don't have to generate clicks.  They don't have advertisers.  But I would hope given that we're ad supported free media that there's a role for ad supported free media which is a kind of a more traditional way of doing things.  And I would hope that there I mean BuzzFeed I'll put Vice in this category are different ways of doing journalism but they've done some good journalism.  I just think it's very hard for the consumer to know who to trust.

Start time: 1173.20
End time: 1223.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very hard as a journalist to maintain that independence from you know an intent of trying to get more traffic you know.  Back in the day if you're writing for a big newspaper or big outlet you didn't really worry about how many people were reading your story.  You wanted to get in the front page for sure.  But it didn't matter to you if your story helped to sell more newspapers because ultimately your job was secure regardless.  Now you know a lot of these outlets a lot of these operations are much smaller and you really feel the pressure to be able to drive those clicks to drive that traffic to help the money coming in.  You know there's always supposed to be a separation between church and state we say you know where you don't know what the advertising is you don't know the advertising dollars and you don't worry about that sort of thing.  But ultimately if you're at a smaller outlet or you know some kind of a startup journalistic publication you have a pretty good feel for what is doing well and what is not doing well.  And you know if these stories aren't doing well then you know that the writings on the wall things aren't going to last too long.

Start time: 1223.26
End time: 1231.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's that pressure for sure and I can you're in the hot seat you were in chief at Engadget at AOL.  I can't imagine more of a hot seat.

Start time: 1233.30
End time: 1261.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah and there was certainly a lot of pressure at AOL to do a lot of things that I didn't want to do within gadgets which which may be why things are the way they are right now but that's OK.  So you know there's a lot of pressure for sure whether you are a journalist or whether you are the editor in chief of a site like that or whether you're indeed someone who's running on the business side of things and responsible for ad revenue and everything else.  There's a lot of pressure to get the traffic up there and to make these things work.  And ultimately I think that that pressure is now more closely felt by journalists than probably ever in the past.

Start time: 1261.04
End time: 1289.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It worries me because I think as a consumer there's now an undue burden on me to determine the truth.  There is innuendo flying right and left and it's kind of the natural thing I'm speaking for myself to say well where there's smoke there must be fire.  So something happened here but but maybe the right risk it's not the right response to say well I'm giving up on Uber because maybe we don't really know.

Start time: 1299.98
End time: 1313.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because it's a great service and because honestly you don't know what went on and hopefully they're going to mature.  I'm sure they will.  They'll get more controls in place.  You know these things they're moving fast and again that's not to apologize.  I think clearly mistakes were made in just in the fact that there was a huge cycle around this.

Start time: 1316.66
End time: 1327.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well but maybe that what they'll get under control is the is the the news cycle not their own internal policies.  Maybe God mode won't go away.  They'll just learn how to hide it better.  That's the thing.

And then those posts did have did evoke an attitude and they were two years old.  OK. So but you don't just say let's just delete this from the site and it didn't happen.  You know I discussed what what what you change rather than what.

If you if you actually read young adult novels these days that half of them is about media narrative and understanding.  If you read the Hunger Games and half of it is like fighting and the other half is how is this presented in the media.  That's true.  Harry Potter there's that there's the entire Rita Skeeter thread.  If you read the the Uglies trilogy a big chunk of that is how how they're perceived discovering what's wrong with society and then how they're perceived once they once they do it.  So there is this sense of necessary and Cory Doctorow has written like three young adult novels that have massive components of media explanations and government cover up and what it means to be growing up in this world.  So I think that the literature is already there for them but also it's it's pervasive in their world.  But I'm when I got my sons to sign up for known which is a blogging website that lets you connect to different social networks.  I was surprised how reluctant they were to connect it to Facebook because from their point of view they've been burnt before by connecting things to Facebook and they didn't know what it would send out there.  And Facebook for them is is not their their communication mechanism so much as the public space that the notice board where other people can see things and they were very aware and they're very aware of managing what they post on Facebook as opposed to what they send in in more cover channels.

Transcript:  And the question that I've had all week was just how much is this story resonating with those of us outside of the journalism startup community.  That's a good because obviously it's been a huge story amongst us and you know the close circles around around us.  But I still haven't gotten a good feel for how many people were aware of it.  In fact I was in L.A. this week and I did use an Uber and I feel guilty about it but I do use an Uber.  I talked to the driver a bit and just kind of asked him how business was and he indicated that things were a little bit slower than usual but he didn't know anything about any of this controversy at all.  And here's a guy who's you know livelihood is dependent on Uber and he wasn't aware of this story at all which made me wonder just how many people outside of of this you know inner journalistics and startup circle actually are aware of any of this at all.  And realistically how much does it impact those people.  That's probably the biggest question I've had you know this is it's almost inside our baseball this sort of thing.  It's a big indicator of the culture of the company for sure.  But do people outside of the circle really really care about that.

Transcript:  I mean here's the way I would look at it is I mean again and again I have a bias here.  I have an opinion about kind of you know how I think about you know media consumption.  I think the thing that has really changed is who do these who do media organizations work for in the end of the day and whose side are they on and who can you trust.  And to me I think I strongly believe and it's obviously self-serving that that the future of the world is going to look a lot more like the past and that you will be paying agents to do serious reporting for you and you'll just pay them.  Like you'll and you'll trust them because their entire incentive will be aligned with providing great information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean you're whenever I think starting companies is kind of a crazy exercise right.  Like I think you have to have that delusion and that drive to ever even rationally go off and try to start anything.  So I think it's I think it's actually an important part of like early startup culture.  I think the question is how do the things that do really work mature.  How do the controls come into place.  What's the timing on that.  And when you will wake up and realize oh my God we're winning and we're having a real impact and there's responsibility that comes with that.  You have to grow into rapidly.  And again I think it's been said by others but you know this is not a new pattern.  It's just honestly I think this is probably the fastest one of the fastest you know growths at least in evaluation that I think has ever probably ever happened in the world.  They're three years old.

Transcript:  How old is Uber three or four years more than three.  2008 it was started.  So there's there more than that.  There's six years old.  They currently have the I think the most venture funding of any startup at a Silicon Valley probably of any startup in the world.  They're valued at what a couple of billion more than that.

I mean this Uber X driver who almost killed the guy with a hammer last week.  I mean it seems to happen more in San Francisco I guess because there's more rides in San Francisco.

Transcript:  Look and I guess I'm playing my part as the guy sitting in Silicon Valley.  You're the startup guy.  You represent the startup guy.  So I'm playing my role perfectly I feel like on the show.  But like look you know the reality is there's a lot they're going to have to figure out and a lot of responsibility that comes with being as successful as they have been and will be going forward.  So I think there's a lot to learn there.  But I have less sympathy for people sensationalizing the driver incident.  I mean you drive enough miles right.  You're going to have an incident.  I mean that's what Uber says.  Every cab in every country and said is there ever an incident.  Of course there is like there's no way not to have that happen.

Transcript:  And look if that ends up being an issue then a company like Flywheel which I take frequently and doesn't have surge pricing or will win.  I mean there's competition.  There's competition.  It's not like it's you know there's a one stop shop here.  But again like I think these things are going to shake out and it's an unfortunate episode.  I think it says more about kind of the media culture and than anything else.  But it also like is a wake up call to I think a lot of executives of these companies that like look you're not some baby in the corner anymore.  People are paying attention.  They care and you got to be really careful about the message and image you're putting out because it matters.

Transcript:  It's also it's also the case that as consumers of news we are now have to look behind every place you go.  Yes. Well are they an investor.  For instance Peter Thiel the well-known Silicon Valley investor said Uber is the most ethically challenged company in Silicon Valley.  And then you learn Peter Thiel is an investor in Lyft.  So it's all then now everything he says has to be suspect.  It seems like everybody's got some allegiance to one side or the other.  It's even I mean that as a compliment you know from Peter Thiel that might be like a good thing.  I don't know.  But I have to I do have to point out that Sergey and Larry brought in Eric Schmidt a Mark Zuckerberg brought in Sheryl Sandberg that it is not unusual for companies as you.  I think you said it Kevin.  They have to have this go go attitude us against the world when they're first starting up.  But eventually they do bring in adult supervision.

Interesting.  If you think if you think if you think about the stories that have come out and that having to post piece and things like that that's that's for me that's the sign that's product placement.

I was driving back home and I got a check engine light or some kind of a warning light on the dashboard.  I called up the PR rep at Tesla and she said hang on I'll connect you over to an engineer and about 30 seconds later said oh yeah we're watching.  Don't worry it's just a pressure thing.

So you know I always have a pretty good idea that if I'm reviewing a smartphone or if I'm reviewing a car that that company is watching everything that I do at all times.  And that's the big thing that I don't know about this old god mode thing is OK this guy was out front waiting for the journalists to show up.  Was that journalist using a coupon code from Uber for a free ride or were they using their personal account.  You know there's some details that I don't know there but I always assume as a journalist that I'm being watched pretty much everything that I do even Gmail things like that.

It's like even if you could do that that's like clearly a terrible idea.  Right. And I think that's like part of like becoming more mature as a company is just being like oh like that seemed like a fine idea when we were a tiny company and now that we're not.  That's just like a bad idea.

Transcript:  You know Airbnb had its big meeting global meeting here in San Francisco.  Liz Gaines was there talked and kind of compared Airbnb and how everybody who has an Airbnb service loves their CEO and contrasted the two.  And then at the same time Airbnb has announced a device that as an Airbnb host you can put in your house that listens anytime you want to see if they're having a party in your house or if they're smoking.  And it's like oh well I'm not going to use Airbnb anymore they have a listening device in the house.  So the landlord can say and I.  All right.  What a world.  Let's take a break I want to talk about shaving.  How about that.  We have a great sponsor and I don't think there's any conflict of interest here if I say that I shave every day with Harry.  I have Harry in the shower I have Harry in the bath.  Sometimes I'll even use Harry here at the studio you've caught me a few times shaving this is Movember.  A lot of you are growing facial hair and in it is to raise awareness around men's health issues.  That's fine I just want you to know that Harry supports Movember.  Absolutely.  And they're even going to give money to the Movember fund to show their support but when it's over.  Come December.  And Jessica's saying it's time to shave that ugly ass beard.  Think Harry's Harry's is the best kind of shaving experience you'll ever have.  Harry's makes their own razors they bought the fact is a startup that I like when when Jeff who was he was a multi serial entrepreneur he did the Warby Parker.  When he started looking into you know I think we could do razors better.  He's interested in kind of reinventing these these old school businesses.  Well it's a classic you know story.  We give away the razors and we make it up on the blades these blades you go and you try to buy a Gillette blade.  It's like what it's four bucks a blade.  There's there's there's so expensive they lock them up at the drugstore.  That's ridiculous.  So when Harry started they said we want to give you quality razors better than better than the razors you get at the drugstore.  Half the price.  So what do they do they bought the factory there it is in Germany.  They found out there were two factories in the world that made the best blades in Solingen Germany.  They bought one and they engineer their blades for not just for sharpness but for high performance.  They ship them for free to your door and because they make and ship their own blades there they're more efficient.  That means that you get basically you're getting factory direct pricing.  Get a Harry's kit to start yourself off the kits are an amazing deal.  You get you get the razor with a handle that looks and feels great three razor blades the foaming shave gel it smells so good.  The Truman set $15.  I got a Winston that's the metal handle engraved just even just a little bit more.  You get all that 15 bucks and then you get your blades delivered to you.  I was getting them every other month.  I'm getting a monthly now plus the because I shave more because it's easy.  It doesn't cut me up doesn't a braid.  It's great.  I want you to try Harry's.  This would be a great gift.  Ladies if you want to convince your Movember man to drop the beard and mustache come December.  H a r r y s dot com do use the offer code twit five and you'll get five dollars off your first purchase with Harry's and you'll be supporting Movember.  They'll give a little donation in your name and then get those blades delivered monthly or or every other month.  It's awesome.  H a r r y s Harry's dot com for this Movember.  You're watching this week in tech.  Kevin Marks is here.  Old friend of the show.  We've got him on regularly on twig.  Also Sam Lesson from the information and from CNET the wonderful Tim Stevens.  So you wanted to come on Kevin.  You tweeted me to talk because last week I thought we had a very important show.  We talked about net neutrality about President Obama's request.  The FCC used Title 2 of the Telecommunications Act to regulate ISPs broadband providers as common carriers.  We had a couple of I thought the best way to handle this was have ISPs on one on each side.  We had Dane Jasper of Sonic Net who thinks that's a good idea oddly enough.  And then we have Brett Glass who is a wireless Internet service provider in Laramie Wyoming.  He thinks he doesn't want that extra government regulation.  And I thought we had a very good conversation.  I thought both were very well spoken.  Frankly, it didn't help me because I agreed with both of them.  What are your thoughts?

Start time: 2347.94
End time: 2360.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think I mean, the what you what you find is that the ISPs that have a local monopoly aren't in favor.  And the ones who are in a competitive market are in favor.  And I think that that played out with your show as well.

Start time: 2361.04
End time: 2363.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, because Brett was in a very difficult market.

Start time: 2364.10
End time: 2492.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know, Brett is doing something that's very difficult, which is trying to do it be an ISP over wireless in a very sparsely populated area.  And so a lot of the issues around competition that arise in urban areas don't really apply.  But the challenge is the challenge for me is there is a sense that this is a natural monopoly and that is how it's historically regulated.  So therefore, the local authority gives permission to certain companies to lay cables in that neighborhood in return for something.  It may be a network for them. It may be taxes.  It may be something like that.  But then they don't license anyone else or they only license very few companies to do that.  So, you know, I'm in San Jose, the self-named capital of Silicon Valley, and my choice is Comcast or AT&T.  Oh, isn't that nice. Aren't you lucky.  It's given me a lovely twisted pair internet that's not that's, you know, said, oh, we later find us sort of three streets away and we'll run some twisted pairs over to you.  It's like, hmm. So there is a physical infrastructure challenge.  And so the way that's been handled in other places is what we call structural separation where and this is this goes back to my BT experience.  This this happened in the UK. BT was originally the post office, the UK post office.  And then it was British Telecom. And it took over the telephone network.  And then it basically had all the cables that have been laid.  It had the terrestrial monopoly of existing cables.  And so to create a level playing field there, what the government said was, OK, you need to separate out the piece that the company that owns the physical infrastructure and sell connectivity to that to your your network.  Company that's selling to customers on the same terms as you do to everyone else.  And that's regulated by government. So there's an explicit separation between the physical layer and the services, the services layer.  And that was the case in the in the US for a while.  And that was the piece that was overturned by the change in regulations when they moved from different title to title one.

Start time: 2493.52

Start time: 2536.24
End time: 2547.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. So they were they were they were they tried to do it in a regulatory way rather than in a structural way.  So the thing that I wanted to bring up was the idea of structural separation where you where you where there is a there's never going to happen in the US.

You know, the cost of laying a cable from here to the central operating thing from my house will be approximately what it costs to replace the fence at my house.  You know, the the physical cost of that is not that high.  And I replace the fence every every few years or so.

Comcast has as all cable companies do a regional monopoly, a franchise awarded to it by the local municipality.  And Comcast had promised all sorts of things, delivered none of it.  But but the city government was very reluctant and I don't blame them to pull the plug on Comcast because the last thing they want is every voter in the town of Petaluma pissed off at them because their cable doesn't work.  You don't want to mess with it.  It's worth it.  We have this house of cards.  It's kind of working.  And this is one of the things that the folks who advocate no government interference always say.  Where's the problem?  There hasn't been a problem.  You're you're you're regulating to protect against something that hasn't happened yet and probably won't happen.

We work with them first and we'll iterate through that.  That's a good idea.  And then then find then put pressure on the others get basically get pressure from people like me and say, hey, San Jose, can you sign up for Google to do this?  Because it sounds like Kansas City got a really good deal compared to what we have.  So I think that that is a good strategy, but it's a 10, 15 year strategy.

Transcript:  The more you know about this, the harder it is to come up with a good answer that's not either having government take it all over.  I mean, competition would solve this.  That's pretty obvious.  But how are we how are we going to foster competition?  We need somebody needs to invent a great wireless service that is easy and cheap.  Maybe Project Loon.  You know, Google announced that they can now do 20 balloon launches a day.  They've got Project Loon is the crazy idea of putting balloons basically weather balloons up in the stratosphere twice as high as airplanes higher even than weather.  And the nice thing about the stratosphere is there apparently there are winds in a variety of directions at different levers layers.  So you can just control the balloons movement by moving it up or down into the layer you want.  So it'll go in the direction you want.  And they launched these in New Zealand, the idea being to provide Internet access via balloon.  Something like that would really would really change things.  It wouldn't. It wouldn't, though.

But I think if you step back for a second, you know, I really I think people sometimes have a hard time believing this.  But I at least fervently do and represent that like the Facebook is a company whose mission first in the end of the day.  Mark, I think when the company went public had a great line about how Facebook is organized as a company to fulfill its mission, not the other way around.  And the fundamental mission is to connect the entire world.  So, you know, can you talk about long term business?  What does it mean for the long term business to help connect, bring another billion people online?  Of course, like that's like obvious.  But I think that the bigger thing is that this is like from a mission standpoint first, not a company standpoint, fundamental to like what Facebook is meant to represent and do.  So it's pretty cool.  I think a lot of the efforts that are going on in there, but they're all, you know, again, very early in terms of how they're playing out.

Transcript:  I like this.  I thought this was interesting.  Speaking of this notion of a paywall and journalism that's paid for by its consumers, Google is experimenting with this Google contributor service, which I think is a great idea.  And I'm curious what you guys think about it.  The idea is you I guess that you pay a certain fee and Google feeds that money out between one to three dollars a month to sites like Mashable, the Onion, and by doing so eliminates the Google ads on those sites.

Start time: 2974.00
End time: 2996.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the best application of that would be YouTube.  And I'm surprised we haven't seen something like that already, because people hate pre-roll on YouTube with a passion.  I think it's a great opportunity for them to roll something like this out if you pay, you know, 10 bucks a month, five bucks a month and no more pre-roll ads on YouTube.  I think a lot of people would pay for that, especially if they knew that that money was going back to where it belongs, which is to the content creators.

Start time: 2998.03

Start time: 3002.25
End time: 3051.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's a very unlikely possibility.  Why is that?  Well, the problem with these plans, honestly, like YouTube, which is obviously a really important service for Google in terms of where they're going, is you get all the people who are most valuable opt out of your ads.  Right. Like in the end of the day, it's exactly the demographics that are willing to pay money for these things that people want to reach.  What you're doing is you're creating this like reverse incentive, right, where basically you're removing the most valuable segment of the advertising population you're moving towards.  So I would go on record saying that I would be shocked if they did this on something like YouTube, whereas I think in the content network on sites, et cetera, it's a service people have talked about for a long time.  There's no reason not to offer it and see what happens. I personally am skeptical that it will work, but we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'd be kind of capitulation, right, to be saying, well, I guess this ad thing ain't going to work, so, because it'll undermine your ad model.  Yeah. Now, interestingly, Google has in a way tried this, this music key.  If you are a Google Music All Access subscriber, you probably already have this.  You can apply for beta when I click the music tab, the new music tab on my YouTube site, I get ad free music, mixes, playlists.  It's kind of like Spotify or Google All Access, except they're videos too.  And I can even do these offline on my phone.  So I can say I want to hear all the pop music tracks. It'll start playing.  There'll be no pre-roll. This is a playlist and it'll just play forever on my phone or on my device.  See, no pre-roll.  Taylor Swift's getting nothing for this.

I think it's around like $40 billion. Is that about right? Yeah.  These are such rounding errors.  And so the reality is, sure, maybe you can do something on a side project around music, removing ads, etc. Fine.  But let's be really clear. For the things that are core to their business, which is search and YouTube,  they have to figure out how to make an ad model pay and focus on that.  And everything else is really just noise.

Transcript:  I think they're trying to get more people to subscribe to the Google Play Music subscription thing.  And this is magnifying the audience for that.  I went to SF Music Tech last week and the head of the Google Play Music was interviewed there.  And she said that their subscriptions are growing and doing well and they expect to grow further.  And I suspect that part of that was behind this.  The thing is that YouTube is a place people go to play music.  It has been for a very long time and the labels know this.  And they've previously, if you upload a song, if you upload a video that has a song on it,  they'll content ID match it and they'll put a buy this song link on it.  Google will get some referrer for that.  And the labels will post videos up there with the assumption that people will play them there  and then potentially buy the songs.  But they also want some of this ongoing subscription revenue,  which they're already getting from Google Play Music and from the other services like that.  And this is a way of extending that into that mode.  So that one makes a lot of sense to me.  I think the Google contributor makes a bit less sense,  but I can see why Google is doing it because the crowd-sourcing,  the crowdfunding models are starting to get some more traction.  And this is a way to keep it inside their ecosystem.  And the advantage they have is they already have the financial relationships with these publishers  because they're running ads for them.  And they can actually achieve micro payments.  Whereas a lot of the value of the crowdfunding things is that they succeed better without micro payments.  So I think Google's one fits in with their model.  I'm not sure it necessarily fits in with the consumer's mental model.  There's been a series of these things where you say,  I will donate $10 a month to the sites I read.  People have built those over the years, over the last 10 years, several times.  And they don't tend to work that well because you have to get a lot of subscribers for that.  And the actual successes in crowdfunding have been the ones where you let people pay very little amounts of money.  So people can say, I really like this artist. I'd like to give them a lot of money.  I really like this site. I'd like to give it a lot of money and work on that basis.  So the fixed price aspect of it is, I suspect, a downside to it.

And I did a really long term comparison with that in the iPhone 6 plus just because I really couldn't kind of make up my mind.  But for me, actually, the productivity stuff they've added in, especially in the S Note application, has really come in handy.  You can, for example, take a picture of a slide in a presentation if you're sitting in the audience and it'll capture the slide.  It'll reformat it to make it flat and then pull out the individual elements within that slide so you can then drag them around in your notes.  It's amazing. It's pretty impressive stuff.  And the voice recording is really good for interviews, too, which is handy for me because I do all my interviews on my notes.

It does, but there's been so much blowback against Apple with the Bengate stuff  that maybe Samsung will draw the line and say, this is thin enough.  We don't need to go any thinner.  We're going to continue to maintain one of our biggest selling points, in my opinion,  which is the removable battery.  But yeah, I mean, it doesn't feel anywhere near as nice in the hand as the Galaxy 6 Plus does, that's for sure.  No, or frankly, the Nexus 6, which really is got the rounded back.

This really pisses me off because here's the Droid Turbo and the Nexus 6,  both of which have monster batteries in them.  And instead of saying, oh, great, let's make a long life phone.  We'll keep the 1080p screen.  Instead, they say, oh, well, we got so much battery life.  Why don't we just let's put in a quad HD screen?  And then the battery life's back to the same 12 hours everything else is.  I want to go all day, darn it.  And we know this is the case because the OnePlus One, which is a 1080p screen,  fine screen, does go 20 hours with a big battery.  So it's possible, but they just have to say.

And in every other respect, I don't know how long it's going to be before Lollipop  because it's Cyanogen, but Cyanogen Mod is great.  That is the phone. If that were widely available, I would say without hesitation,  that's the Android phone to get this year.  I think it's great. When I first got it, I didn't have a SIM card in it,

And lollipops, awesome.  That's why OnePlus 1 sounds attractive, because having that many pixels in a slightly smaller size  with a battery that lasts longer sounds very attractive.  The latest DisplayMate results are in today.

Transcript:  DisplayMate makes, of course, software to rank color accuracy and help calibrate your screens.  Raymond Sinera, who's the president over there, loves doing these.  And I think we could, I don't know, I feel like, look, it's got charts.  We should be able to trust this.  See, there's charts. It's got to be true.  But he says that if you look at the six flagships of the Nexus 7,  the clear winner is the Note 4 by far.  Now, I think it makes sense because Samsung makes their own displays.  So it makes sense that they probably reserve the best displays for themselves.  And they also give you the power to tweak the display settings on the phone itself,  which is a big advantage.  And Samsung has a lot of great displays.  And Samsung has a lot of great displays.  And Samsung has a lot of great displays.

Transcript:  Yeah. The most accurate color, very beautiful.  The Galaxy Note 4, when it's set in the basic screen mode, has the best full gamut color accuracy.  Skin tone accuracy, far beyond that of the other phone.  Same with organic color accuracy.  You know, it's pretty impressive.  If you look at the white point, .0007.  Compare. I mean, that's so much ahead of anybody else.  It's not even close. The iPhone. I'm sorry.  Where's the iPhone on here? The iPhone is .0087.  So it's like 10 times better.  Anyway, there you go. There's the results. The results are in.  The standard full color gamut is best.  Does that help on the Note 4? Do you care? Does anybody really care?  How important is color accuracy, really?

End time: 4116.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, photographers for sure.  But you have to remember that color accuracy doesn't necessarily relate to an appealing design or appealing display for a lot of people.  If you walk into Best Buy and look at TVs, the color settings on those TVs are terrible.  But they're designed to really catch your eyes as you walk in by.  Make everything look warm and comfortable.  And that's kind of what we're seeing here.  Accuracy doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be the best looking display to the naked eye necessarily.

Start time: 4127.52
End time: 4193.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not quite, but it's definitely getting bigger and getting more important over the years.  Detroit is still the big US show for sure.  And one of the biggest shows internationally.  But LA is definitely getting big, especially with a lot of tech announcements.  You know, more and more auto manufacturers are choosing to make their tech related announcements at CES these days.  But we just see quite a few here in LA or there in LA.  I'm back in New York now, thankfully.  One of the big ones being Android Auto, which is Google's option for being able to connect your phone to your car and use it in a safe way.  They opened up the APIs for developers.  They announced them back at Google I.O. over the summer.  But now they're publicly available and you can actually start to launch and deploy your apps that will run within the car.  So they announced quite a few apps that have been out there that are compatible now.  Spotify on the audio side is a nice one.  WhatsApp on the text messaging side.  And, you know, you're probably thinking text messaging while you're driving is not a good idea.  It is.  But what Google's done is basically defined templates for each of these apps.  So as you go from Spotify to Songzo or SoundCloud, all the apps look exactly the same.  And so basically these app developers just kind of plugging in their functionality into the template that Google has defined.

Start time: 4201.34
End time: 4245.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Basically, all this does is it turns your car into kind of a dumb terminal for your phone.  It's a screen. It's a second screen.  Right. And then everything really happens between either a very simple interface, which would be on Spotify, for example, skip track, you know, next track, thumbs up, thumbs down, that kind of thing.  Or in text messaging, it would all be read to you through the text to speech.  And then if you wanted to do a simple reply, it would be again voice, step back to text.  So there'd be no distracting displays on there, no emails popping up, no text messages on your car that you need to read.  It would all be read to you.  Or if it's too distracting, it simply wouldn't happen at all.  So the idea is you put your phone down, you connect to your car, the phone is disabled, so you have no temptation to pick it up whatsoever.  And you get these simplified interfaces that allow you to play your Spotify playlist or listen to your text messages.  That kind of thing.

But could you imagine personally, if you told me that when I got in my car, my phone would be turned off, I'd freak out.

Start time: 4263.08
End time: 4272.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's not turned off, though.  You just have a different interface to it.  Right.  Yeah.  But it's not turned off.  That sounds like a less expressive interface.  Well, yeah, because you're driving, Sam.

Transcript:  Don't pair it.  You cannot.  Yeah, exactly.  If you don't want to use the service, then you certainly don't have to.  But ultimately, this now is giving you some incentive to actually have your phone be disabled, because before, you know, there are apps from other companies that will disable your phone while you're driving.  But you don't get anything out of it.  Now, at least when you plug it in, your phone is charging and you can get an interface to your apps in a safe way.  You can still listen to Spotify.  You can still get your emails read to you.  You can still get directions to your next meeting and things like that without having to pick up your phone and crash into a school bus and kill innocent children.  I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, you're at a stoplight.  That's that's the time you should do that.  What about the helium?  I'm sorry.  Hydrogen fuel cell cars.  I think they're going to start selling in Japan that has the explosive power of the Hindenburg.  That's exciting.  It was interesting.

Start time: 4372.04
End time: 4468.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a big show for fuel cells and fuel cell cars are something that we've we've known are interesting,  but ultimately weren't really sure if they were ever going to come to market because there's the huge question of where do you get the hydrogen to put into your car.  Right now, there are all of I think 12 stations in all of California to fill up your car.  There's 18 in the entire country of Germany to fill up your car if you have a hydrogen powered car.  So that's the big issue.  But the technology that was the big story of the show is that technology for hydrogen for fuel cell cars is there is ready.  I got to drive the Volkswagen.  There was also an Audi there and yet Toyota showed up there your eye, which will be available for sale next year.  They didn't say how much it's going to cost.  Probably very expensive in the order of sixty thousand dollars.  But you get a full fully featured car, basically 300 miles of range on about five kilograms of fuel.  And that equates to roughly 60 miles per kilogram, which is actually roughly equivalent to 60 miles per gallon, which doesn't really sound good.  But it doesn't really sound that great compared to a lot of hybrids out there.  But the thing is, a kilogram of hydrogen costs about two dollars right now.  So that's roughly half the cost of a gallon of gas.  And that's with such limited supply.  You can imagine if there are hydrogen stations on every corner, they think that cost could drop significantly.  So these cars are going to be very expensive.  It's going to be very hard to fill them up.  But, you know, there's zero emission.  The only thing that comes out the tailpipe is it is water vapor.  They have decent power.  They're, you know, as comfortable and as easy to drive as any other car.  And they're significantly cheaper to run.  So there's a lot of potential there, but we're still waiting for that that supply to be there for hydrogen.  So, you know, who knows when that's going to happen?  I have so many questions.  So it's not burning hydrogen.  It's a fuel cell.

Start time: 4470.53
End time: 4471.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the hydrogen goes into the fuel cell.

Start time: 4474.24
End time: 4481.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So the hydrogen goes into a fuel cell, which gives you a constant supply of electricity, which isn't a lot of electricity, but it's enough to power the car.

Start time: 4481.36
End time: 4482.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's essentially an electric car.

Start time: 4483.93
End time: 4512.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, these these cars are all EVs.  Basically, just think of instead of having a big battery pack, you have hydrogen tank connected to a fuel cell.  Same idea. They do have small batteries, though, because the, you know, if you put your foot down, the demand is going to be greater than that fuel cell can supply.  So they're kind of like hydrogen powered hybrids almost.  In fact, the Audi that they showed off is a plug-in hybrid.  So you can actually plug that in at home and drive it for, I think, about 30 miles before it even starts to sip from the hydrogen tank.  But yeah, they are all EVs, just like a battery powered car.

Start time: 4513.08
End time: 4521.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they're like the Volt then that they have an engine as well or they'd be plug-in hybrid.  I mean, nothing's just hydrogen fuel cell only, or is it?

Start time: 4524.93
End time: 4541.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The only source of electricity for most of these cars is from the hydrogen fuel cell.  The Audi can be plugged in to to give you a little bit of extra range on top of that.  But they have a small battery just to meet peak demands.  If you're going up a hill, if you're, you know, if you're racing so many the stoplight, that kind of thing, the fuel cell won't be able to give you enough juice to get good acceleration.

Start time: 4542.81
End time: 4550.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And is there another consumable?  I mean, doesn't a fuel cell require some sort of electrolysis process?

Start time: 4551.11
End time: 4591.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, the the maintenance on these things is remarkably low.  There are some fuel filters and things that would need to be replaced every couple of years.  So there's no catalyst or anything?  No, you don't have to drop in copper into the fuel tanker or anything like that.  They're pretty self sustained.  And, you know, these are still early days for these cars.  So even at sixty thousand dollars, Toyota is probably taking a bit of a loss just to get them on the market to see how they hold up to day to day wear and tear and weather and seasons and that kind of thing.  But ultimately, you know, they're based on production technology.  In fact, the Volkswagen cars are basically the same thing as the Volkswagen E-Golf.  They're all electric golfers selling now.  Just instead of having a battery pack, they've got a hydrogen tank.

Start time: 4592.84
End time: 4600.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I was being I was being jocular referring to the Hindenburg.  Of course, a gas tank is also highly combustible.

Start time: 4601.36
End time: 4615.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. It's way worse.  If hydrogen leak, it just goes up in the sky and vanishes.  Petroleum goes across the ground and right because it's heavier than air.  And then you light it and you get a flame that's spread sideways.  So, yeah, but petroleum gas spillage is one of the scariest things there is.

Transcript:  Anything that has enough stored energy to motivate a three ton vehicle is going to have some explosive power, even lithium ion.  I mean, it's just you're storing a lot of energy in a compact form to drive the car.  It's going to have some explosive potential.

Start time: 4632.65
End time: 4645.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've seen plenty of battery packs go up in smoke.  And when they do, they go very quickly and very violently, not as violently as a hydrogen explosion, obviously.  But these tanks are very, very well designed.  They're carbon fiber for the most part, and they can survive a pretty significant impact for sure.

Start time: 4647.08
End time: 4658.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then the refueling, I guess Toyota said they're going to put in more stations.  They say it fills in five minutes, which is pretty fast.  It's faster than a Tesla, but not as fast as a gas fill up.

Start time: 4658.00
End time: 4688.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not quite. Yeah.  You can figure you can probably fill up a typical car in about two minutes.  But one of the nice things is there's actually already a standard defined for hydrogen filling stations.  So they don't need to do that.  If you look at EVs, there are I think about three or four different standards as you go from one country to the next, which is a major headache for everybody.  Tesla's got their own thing that they're doing.  This is one standard defined across the entire industry.  So that's nice. That's one of the things that you don't need to worry about.  You plug the car in, it takes about five minutes.  You've got to go up to I think about 10,000 psi, which is pretty high.  But then at that point, you're good to go for another 300 miles.

Start time: 4689.44
End time: 4702.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then finally, I guess the question that really we should be asking is how do you produce hydrogen?  And is it produced in an environmentally friendly way or is it just deferring the environmental cost to another location?

Start time: 4702.20
End time: 4759.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And that really depends on where you are and where your electricity comes from.  You can get hydrogen pretty easily from alcohol, from ethanol, that kind of thing.  And that's pretty straightforward conversion in a pretty efficient way.  You can also basically make it straight from thin air just by using electricity.  But of course, the question there is where is your electricity coming from?  Right now, that is basically just kind of passing the buck from one source of contaminants, one source of pollution to another one.  But the hope is at some point in the not too distant future, we'll have much more efficient sources of power to the grid.  And then at that point, hydrogen production could in theory become free or close to free.  And we're basically solving a lot of problems, which is all these cars on the road polluting.  And then kind of moving that problem up the stream a bit to power plants.  And at that point, we can solve that problem and move along.  But again, it depends where you're from. If you're in the Northwest, for example, there's a lot of renewable energy up there.  But if you're coming from a coal fired power plant kind of place, you're probably just passing the buck.

Transcript:  Yeah. So the GT350, which is Ford's new.  It's the first.  Ask this guy anything.  It's their new. It's the first of what we'll probably see dozens and dozens of special edition Mustangs over the course of the run.  But, you know, they've just launched the new 2015 Mustang. This is the Shelby GT350.  They didn't give us a lot of details about it.  But basically the shape of the crank in the V8 means there's going to be a higher revving motor than what we've seen in the past.  You know, usually think of the Aces being big kind of throttling engines.  You wouldn't want to rev too high. This one will be designed for high revving and it's basically designed to be a bit of a track toy.  They're going after the Camaro Z28 in a big way. It's going to be over 500 horsepower.  They didn't say exactly how many horsepower, but it's going to be going to be a very nice car.  Sounds very nice when it revs.  And that crank that the flat plane crank gives it a different sort of sound to the ignition as well.  But a very different sort of Mustang than what we've seen in the past.  I'm curious to see how it is on the track, especially with the new independent suspension, which is pretty sweet too.

I went to Detroit to talk to the designers and kind of get a feel for things.  Like I said, this is the first big special edition of the Mustang that they've done, but they'll be doing a lot more.  And we hope to be spending some time on the track with that thing and not too distant future.  That sounds awesome.  And the new Corvette too.

Our show today brought to you by Stamps.com and kind of in a way by the post office, the US Postal Service.  Because if you are doing mailing in your business, if you're sending out brochures or if you sell on Etsy or eBay or Amazon,  you don't want to go to the post office this time of year.  You don't have time to go to the post office. It's going to be packed. Everybody's mailing holiday gifts and packages.  I got a mailer from the post office on Friday saying how to be a postal pro, how to navigate the traffic in the parking.  Stamps.com. I should have just said, hey, you don't have to send me this anymore. I have Stamps.com.  I don't have to go to the post office anymore.  I can I can buy and print my own US postage on demand from my computer, my printer.  24-7. I can print postage for any letter, any package, the instant I need it.  The mail carrier comes to my house, picks me up. And I love this USB scale.  Because that means you always have exactly the right postage.  I'm the kind of guy because I don't want to send stuff postage due. So I'll always put an extra stamp or two on.  You know, that's a waste of money. And of course, a lot worse if you send stuff postage due.  That is not not that's frowned upon. I think bad, bad etiquette.  If you're trying to promote or talk about something cool and exciting and the poor customer gets a postage due envelope, that doesn't bode well for your business.  Use Stamps.com. You'll even save money.  You can get discounts. You can't get it to post office, a priority mail, a priority mail express shipments.

Remember, Apple was a primary investor in a company called Rockstar.  They bought the North was it Nortel patents. You would know about this, Kevin, being a telecom fellow.  And they in fact, up in Canada, they had a Rockstar had a lab with people reverse engineering, all sorts of technology looking for patent infringement.  Apple was a big investor.  And I think Microsoft was involved in Rockstar and was suing everybody, especially Samsung.  The Rockstar lawsuits were kind of the latest in a nonstop lawsuit mania going on in Silicon Valley.  Apple and I have to think this is Tim Cook has decided to end this war.  Remember, this was Steve Jobs who declared thermonuclear war on Google and Android.  Good news, Kevin.

Transcript:  Well, the notion of intellectual property itself is a problematic one.  So that there's oh, you're just a commie.  No, it's a post-hoc construction.  There were there was three separate things that have been tied together as intellectual property and promoted as a form of property,  as opposed to government granted monopolies designed to have a function.  And once you treat them as property, then then people's metaphor for them is broken.  The point of patents was to protect the invention for a limited time and then make it public.  That was also the point of copyright. Copyright.  They kept the same term to the point of ridiculousness so that that making it public thing doesn't happen anymore.  Thank you, Walt Disney.  Yep. With patents, what's what happened is that they effectively changed the definition of invention from something that has to sort of practically exist to the ability to patent abstract ideas.  And that's that's when we had the explosion of idiocy there.

Transcript:  So design patents as well.  So the challenge with part of this is a culture clash.  So the reason that the telecom companies are very big on patents was because the model that they had for standardization was that all the they want.  They very much wanted the whole industry to have the same standard.  As you were talking about with the fuel cells, you want everyone to be on the same standard for something like that.  And so the model they did come up with was that you would get every engine, the engineers from every company together, agree the standards up front, create a patent pool, cross license it.  And that was their work around for that.  And that worked. That works well in their domain where you have to express these things in hardware.  And there are very long lead times in building them.  So when you want to go from GSM to 4G, you want everyone to be building the same chips and actually have them interoperable.  So that's the sort of world where they came from.  And that sort of leaked into technology at the point where we were working with audio video codecs and things like that.  And that became the notion of standardization sort of leaks across from there.  So as these technologies shifted from being implemented purely in hardware to being implemented potentially in software, there's a culture clash between the two modes.  And that's where a lot of this comes from.  And so in the software world, we long ago realized that this was unworkable and came up with other models for getting people to converge, which is open source and open standards models, open standards groups like the IETF and the ICT.  Where we all agree, we still go and argue about it, but it's not an upfront agreement where we say we will agree on how this will work before we build it.  It's much more often a post-doc agreement.  We're saying, OK, we've all built these things that are fairly close.  If we make a few small changes, then we'll actually interoperate better.  And if you look at the difference between the ISO, for example, and the W3C or even the IETF, the ISO is this effectively behaves like a legislative body.  And the W3C and the IETF behave much more like documenting what has happened and agreeing so that future people can do the same thing.  So they've taken the responsibility for documenting the invention from the patent, which was designed to let someone else replicate it after it expired, into this much this publicly shared process where we can replicate it before it's expired so that we've got a layer of stuff we can agree on.  So that that difference is key to the heart of this.  And a lot of these patent wars were sort of leakage from that hardware centric worldview into the software worldview.  And I think what the promising thing we're now seeing is that is the leakages going the other way as we're starting to get more open source hardware, but also as software replaces a lot of the things that we used to do in hardware, the ability to use open source stuff for that and open spec stuff for that becomes much more viable.

Transcript:  I am which is the the blog arm of the IP media group Richard Lloyd writing says that Rockstar reached a settlement with Cisco.  They have now settled with Google.  He calls them an NPE, which is the modern term for patent role non practicing entity, somebody that bought patents but has no desire to use them merely to sue.  They've also apparently dropped lawsuits against others.  Apparently the investors in Rockstar, which include Apple, which put $2.6 billion into it in 2011, have kind of lost their appetite for suing for fighting.  The real question is what will happen to Rockstar? Will it be sold to another non practicing entity?  That would be bad.  But it seems to be that the parties involved, the investors, don't want that to happen.  If they do sell Rockstar's assets, they'll sell to somebody else who's not going to sue Apple, Ericsson, Blackberry, Microsoft, Sony and EMC bid for it.  I think EMC was not involved, but Sony, Microsoft, Blackberry, Apple and Ericsson are the parties.  And since Ericsson and Blackberry are resting, it's probably really more up to Sony, Microsoft and Apple right now.

Transcript:  I mean, I think it is a change of tone.  Apple has been historically fairly litigious and also been the target a lot of Patent Laws as well.  So they've got a very strong legal team and it's a question of which way they decided to point them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so I mean, the other thing is the way to think about Apple.  And this is the thing that the area that Tim Cook is extremely good at is they want to commoditize the stuff that they're that they're putting the layer on top of.  Right.  So for any given Apple model they make, they will have multiple suppliers for the different components and they'll decide as they ramp up to production, which ones they're going to go with.  And that was that was that was definitely true when I was at Apple when they were building new machines.  They were they were always multiple builds with different hardware components for the different pieces so they could try them out.  We could get the software running on all of them and they could swap out supplies as needed.  And as they've scaled up that that may have been harder for them to do.  But it's something that this is the piece that Tim Cook was with grew with the supply side of Apple and understands that.  And in some ways, that's what Apple is doing with with other industries as well.  If you think about the way Apple pay works, in effect, they're doing the same thing.  They're saying, OK, the payment model is all interchangeable.  We're just providing a layer on top of that.  That's smart. You sort that out.

The idea, I guess, is to put political pressure on the European Commission to take a tougher stand on Google.  Antitrust and anti-privacy investigations.  The Financial Times report that saw a draft motion from the European Parliament that says,  quote, unbundling of search engines from other commercial services should be considered as a potential solution to Google's dominance.  Sam, that must be frustrating for a company when you have all this success and all you get is, well, in that case, we're going to break you up.

My sense is like, look, I think it's actually not that dissimilar to the Uber situation at some abstract level,  which is when you get big enough, everyone says a lot of different things and there's a lot of opinions.  And the question is, how do you manage that scale and kind of move forward?  Is it unfathomable that at least one or more people in Europe think this is a good idea?  No, there's a lot of people in Europe.  Like, the question is, like, how does it actually end up netting out at the end of the day?  I don't know.  I don't know how, it's not clear to me how serious this is versus how much this is.  There's a lot of drafts of a lot of things in the world.

Transcript:  The other thing is that this sort of maps a bit to the structural separation solution that I was talking about for net neutrality.  That's a model that Europe understands.  For that side, they're trying to apply it in this field.  And the challenge is, is that analogy that works or is there another analogy that makes more sense?  And the question needs to be which is better for the end users, for the people.  And most of these suits in the EU have not been by people saying Google Search is really bad.  It's been by people saying it's too good.  It's saying Google Search is too good, it's locking us out.  And that's the pattern there.  And so that's the challenge for the EU Commission is to come up with a way that says, OK,  what we actually changed that would make this better for customers.  The other parallel may be the Microsoft Consent Decree where they said,  we didn't like you bundling the browser with the operating system.  And so we're going to mandate that you give the users a choice of browsers at launch.

But, you know, the browser market has changed since then.

Aereo, which is only three years old and was beloved by people who use the service,  has basically been put out of business by the television networks.  They didn't like the idea.  One bit five months ago, they lost in the Supreme Court and they haven't really been able to find a way out.  So they're going to seek bankruptcy protection.

This is from the a bunch of ex Nokia employees.  And the chairman of the FCC says we're not going to rush.  We're going to take our time.  Don't don't rush me, man.  Our show today brought to you by hover dot com.  The best way to get those domain names that you understand how the domain name system works.  There's a I can, which then gives registrars the ability to register domain names  and take that registration and then send them to the big, you know,  canonical DNS servers where prog propagates down.  But you have to get a domain. You can't just go to I can say, give me a domain name.  You have to buy it from a registrar and you have many choices of registrars.  But I got to tell you, after trying them all, I love hover.  Hover is the easiest, the best way to not only get the domain names, but to manage them.  It's there's you don't get all that upsell and all that extra clicks.  Some of these places you buy a domain name, you don't get all that upsell and all that extra clicks.  You buy a domain name and then you have to click 53 times just to get to the checkout.  Hover is fast and easy. So if you've got an idea for a domain name, you go to hover dot com.  You're going to get that domain name right away.  Right now is a great time to start a new project.  Hover has recently lowered prices on more than 200 domain extensions,  including many of the top level domains.  They also reduce the price for new dot com domain names.  It's 12.99, but that includes who is privacy because they know you don't want your name  and phone number and address published on the Internet.  So they give that to you for free with every domain that supports it.  Hover is so great. Takes the friction out of registering a domain name.  Their valet transfer service makes it easy. I used well, I should have used it.  I did it myself. That was a nightmare.  But I did transfer all my services over to hover.  If I'd used the valet transfer service, they would have taken care of the whole thing for you.  Let you know when you some domain registrars are loathed to let go of your business.  They'll lock your domain for months and say you can't transfer out of here, boy.  They're supposed to let you, but believe me, they don't make it easy.  Hover will take care of it for you.  And then they'll tell you when your domains are in there, they'll transfer the DNS settings.  And it's free no matter how many domain names you have.  You pay $10. You get a year extension no matter what the domain name is. I love it.  Hover, honest, straightforward.  They have the best customer support around.  They're famous for their no wait, no hold, no transfer phone service.  And they offer volume discounts.  So if you're buying a bunch of domains, as few as 10, they'll give you a discount on your renewals.  Hover.com.  I invite you to use them today on your first purchase.  You'll get 10% off when you use the promo code TWIT11.  TWIT11, it's the 11th month, at hover.com.  You're going to love them.  I watched the video and I forgot now how you pronounce it.  Is it Jola?  It's Yola.  It's Sailfish OS, which is a skinned version, I believe, of Android.  They're doing, here it is, the Indiegogo campaign.  They want to make an iPad alternative.

I went into Windows Phone after that.  But the tablet looks nice.  I think it's a nice price point.  Obviously, a lot of people are interested and excited.  It's kind of interesting to see.

So people are willing to build by an extra one and take a chance.  Who cares?  Right.  But on the flip side, it's especially in this world, you guys are playing with your huge phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Especially these small tablets.  This guy's seven point seven point eight five inches, which is, you know, very, very close to the bigger phones.  These are the Nexus six or the Note four.  If anything, I think we'll see the iPad and it's kind of getting bigger, moving up to the 12 inch, the 14 inch size, you know,  to maintain some sort of a some sort of a niche.  Ultimately, that's still going to be a smaller niche.  I think the tablet sales are going to continue to decline.  But ultimately, if you've got a six inch phone in your pocket, why do you need an eight inch tablet in your hand?  You'd want something significantly different.  And that would be the only reason to have a tablet, really.

Start time: 6435.34
End time: 6479.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, I mean, my point of view on this is that these things are actually converging.  It's not that the the the phone tablet dichotomy was basically a design decision that Apple made a few years ago based on the technology at the time.  And that sort of got baked into the way people thought about these things as separate entities.  Whereas now there's there's a continuum.  You can you know, Samsung has a thing at every measurement between three inches and twelve.  And people can pick pick the ones out they want to use.  And the software is now is moving.  Now Apple has finally shipped some bigger phones from that dichotomy to this continuous responsive design model.  And I think it's just a question of picking which which size thing you want to be using at the moment.

Start time: 6480.38
End time: 6520.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's fair. I think that the only argument I would make contrary to that is just that there is a very different relationship you have with your phone versus a tablet which might be shared in a family or kind of used in a home by multiple people.  To me it's you know you guys are and I myself I'm here too.  You know I have two phones massive exception to the rule.  Like people are going to have like a device and that's just a very different pattern of having a device that's your persistent identity and log in and experience of the world that's with you all the time and has to be ready to be carried with you everywhere versus a tablet which is a casual use at home around the couch shared by a family whatever.  So I think there is a different pattern of interaction at least historically.

This is the there's the most the most intimate technology in history.

Transcript:  But I think the other thing is that we're starting to get them the notion that you can move the stuff between the screens is becoming much more obvious and smoother.  And we've had we had bits of that with Apple TV and Chrome and it's very obvious.  What you're saying about the car stuff where it's like OK the car just becomes a screen for your phone.  So there is this sense that you've got you may be carrying this thing but it can take advantage of the screens that are around you or the other places that are there.  And that's an obvious thing that people quite like. But you've got to be careful how you don't actually want as you say your intimate messages appearing on the television screen in front of everyone else in the room.  So you want to have some control over which one you're using for what I would say the analog is music.

Transcript:  Think how we've changed how we consume music. We used to listen in groups at concerts or within we would have our stereo.  It's got more and more intimate. The phone is very much like the iPod where the music now is a very personal connection one on one.  Despite the Microsoft squirt ads where people were sharing their head earbuds I think really people pretty much their music they consume solo in a solitary way.  And I think computing is rapidly moving that direction.

And so this is the question is like where is the the nexus of software and information and communication.  And you know I'm sure there'll be things that look the size of tablets or bigger tablets that I'll be pushing data to.  But I just I don't think the companies I think it's an interesting decision for a company to focus on those right now.

The coolest things we ever used to print is I actually used to have it in my conference room at Facebook and I'd actually the teams would print out three dimensional DAU and MAU reports on it.  So we'd have like we'd say I have a meeting. No no you have little graphs little 3D graphs.  It would be a picture of the world. It would be a globe of the world. Yeah.

Transcript:  Yeah. Wow. That is very cool. Hey congratulations to Jerry Ellsworth and her team at Cast AR.  Remember Jerry left valve and convinced Gabe Newell to give her this. These are augmented reality glasses that project the game space in front of you.  You're still looking through the glasses. You still see the world around you and your opponent but you also see the game space.  It was a one million dollar Kickstarter project a year ago. It has just shipped.  The Cast AR has shipped their first pair of augmented reality glasses.  Congratulations to Jerry and Rick and the team at Cast AR. They showed us an early prototype.  What games is it run? I think that I don't know. That's a good question.

Transcript:  Right. Part of it is like taking tabletop gaming to the next step.  So each person has their own perspective and a 3D view of a virtual tabletop for example.  But you can also play like a flight simulator for example. It'll project on the wall if you hang up the rights of material.  So you'd have a 3D flight simulator where you can kind of look around or you know a driving game that kind of thing too.  So it's definitely a very different sort of technology than VR but it's got a lot of potential.  We're going to have Jerry writing our next big thing panel at CES this year and Jerry is going to be on there talking about Cast AR.  She is the greatest. I am. So I'm pretty excited about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah it would be great. It's like a retro reflective surface effectively.  So whatever your Cast AR glasses project they get reflected back to you but not to anybody else.  So that's how it gives you a personalized display and everybody else has their own display.  Ultimately you're seeing the same world but from different perspectives.

We do tweet every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern Time, 2300 UTC on Twitter TV.  We love it if you watch live because I watch the chat room and snicker.  But if you can't, don't worry.  On-demand audio and video is always available after the fact.  You can also get it on all your podcasts, clients, and all that stuff.  It's on YouTube too, youtube.com.  If you want to share it with your friends, you can do it from there.  And if you want to be in our studio, our live studio audience, it's kind of fun today.  We started with 20 people.  There's six left.  What happened?  We chased you all away.  If you want to be here, you don't have to stay the whole time.  Nobody does, really.  If you do, bring snacks and maybe a catheter.  Just email tickets at twit.tv and you can be in the audience.  And pay special attention.  New Year's Eve is coming up.  And we are going to have a New Year's Eve benefit marathon for UNICEF.  We're raising money for UNICEF.  We are going to go from 3 a.m. New Year's Eve to 3 a.m. New Year's Day.  And we will say Happy New Year to every time zone around the world in that time via Skype calls.  We'll have a balloon drop.  We'll have champagne.  It'll be a lot of fun.  We've got bands.  We've got fun.  You can be here if you email tickets at twit.tv.  Tickets will be limited because a lot of people want to come to that.  Most of our hosts will be here.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  The week before we do our Best Of, and I encourage you to submit any ideas you have for our Best Of.  Tweet.tv slash Best Of for any of the shows.  We put Best Ofs together during Christmas this year.  If you know the episode number, that'd be great.  I hope you know the show name.  But if you don't, just write in the comments.  There was this thing that happened with the thing, and it would be really good to have that in a Best Of.  It'll help our producers, Jason Howell, our hardworking producers and editors, put something together.  If you want to be on our New Year's Eve show, there are some unfilled time zones.  You've got to figure we've got the East Coast covered.  We probably have Sydney covered.  I know, Sam, we are going to cover British Standard Time for us, right?  But I imagine there will be people.  If you're in the Solomon Islands, if you're in...  It was Bekistan.  If you're in Tuvalu, go to Tweet.tv slash NYE.  Anywhere like that.  If you're in a faraway land, let us know what time zone you're in so we can Skype over to you and you can have a little party for us.  There's all the time zones.  There are 27, right?  Something like that.  Because some of these balloon drops will be a quarter after and a half past.  They're so weird.  Anyway, we'll be doing that.  Also, we still have a few shirts left.  If you would like to get a holiday gift for the geek in your life, we've got tuit dress shirts and tuit polo shirts at TeeSpring, T-W-E-Spring.com slash twit.  We tried to come up with something people would like for the holidays.  So we have embroidered polo shirts for men and women and embroidered dress shirts for men and women.  Maybe that wasn't the best thing to choose.  We've only sold 200 of them.  But you only have seven days left.  So get on over there.  I know everybody's waiting.  You don't have to snipe this.  The price doesn't change.  It's going to be the same price in seven days.  But after seven days, it's gone.  T-W-E-TeeSpring.com slash twit.  Thanks for being here.  We'll see you next week.
