Transcript:  Only for you, Leo.  It's wonderful to have you.  We met Rebecca when she and Corey Doctorow joined us to talk about their new book, Choke Point Capitalism.  And completely coincidentally, Corey Doctorow happens to be here as well, which is amazing.  Hi, Corey.  Hi, Leo. It's nice to be back.  Always a pleasure to have you on.  I was telling Rebecca, it's always hard to get Corey on because he's so articulate and so smart that most people just clam up when he's on.  And so I thought, who could I get on with Corey that would be able to stand up to him?  And I think Rebecca is the best bet for that.  Sure.  So at any time, Rebecca, that you feel you want to say something, you just start talking.

Transcript:  How is Choke Point Capitalism doing?  We had you on when that came out on triangulation.  Really brilliant book that I think for many of us crystallized something we felt was happening, but explained it in a way that made it possible to kind of not only understand it, but do something about it.  Choke Point Capitalism dot com.  If you are interested in getting a copy, highly recommend it.  How big tech and big content captured creative labor markets and how we'll win the back.  This is something I like about you, Corey.  You always have a subtitle that implies there's something we can do about it.

Start time: 219.01

Speaker: Cory Doctorow
Transcript:  Well, that's the plan.  I mean, as to how the book is going.  So I have some news that even Rebecca doesn't know, I think, about it, which is that I got a text from David Goodman today, who is one of the people who blurbed it.  And he hosted our launch for it.  He's showrunner.  He was running the Writers Guild during the strike against the agents.  And he wrote to me to say that he wrote a special episode of Futurama about it that airs tomorrow.  What?  And that I'm not scabbing by mentioning it.  So there is a there is a choke point capitalism inspired Futurama episode that goes out on Monday the 21st.

Speaker: Cory Doctorow
Transcript:  It's pretty cool.  And we got it.  We got a great shout out in the in the acknowledgments for Janis Varoufakis's next book, which comes out in the autumn.  It's called Post Capital or Techno Feudalism.  What killed capitalism?  And he gave us quite a good notice in the in the further reading section at the end of the book.  Very good.

Start time: 304.02
End time: 325.12
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I will give you a plug because you have a new book out, the Internet Con, how to seize the means of computation.  And I'm going to do it early because the clock is ticking.  There's only a few more hours, 15 hours left to to get on Kickstarter if you want to support the DRM free audio book.  I mean, I think you've raised enough to do that, by the way.  Well, yeah.  No.

Start time: 326.10
End time: 430.00
Speaker: Cory Doctorow
Transcript:  And to be clear, right, this is selling preorders.  If you're watching this later in the week or listening to this later in the week, you could just get the book.  I mean, this is just this is just a way of pre-selling it so that all of these sales, as we did with Chokepoint Capitalism,  so it supports the independent audio book, which we can only do.  We have to do these independently because Audible won't carry DRM free audio books.  So basically you exempt yourself from the market that is 90 percent of all audio books, Audible being this giant monopolist.  But it's also a way to pre-sell a lot of books that on the on sale day go over a book scanner.  And so they all register as sales at once.  So from a from a kind of promotional perspective, it's a very good way to do it.  I would be ecstatic if you if people want to go to Seize the Means of Computation dot org and see the book.  I would be ecstatic if you if people want to go to Seize the Means of Computation dot org and see the book.  But if the Kickstarter is done by the time you get this, you just get the book.  Comes out on September the 5th.  I will be in lots of places with it.  I'm going to be in L.A. on September the 6th with Naomi Klein launching her new book Doppelganger and my book at the L.A.  Public Library.  And then on the 12th of September, I'll be in Toronto.  I'm going to be there not for the book, although I'm doing a book event.  I'm going to be there because Talking Heads are having a reunion.  What?  And I'm going to and it is their first and only reunion since they broke up.  And I'm going to the reunion at the Toronto International Film Festival where they're doing a special screening of Stop Making Sense.  Oh, my God.  But but yeah, I'll be at another storybook shop on Roncesville in Toronto on the 12th of September, the day after that Talking Heads reunion.

Transcript:  So Rebecca, of course, professor of law at Melbourne, the University of Melbourne in Australia, co-author, super smart.  Corey, you probably know from our shows and from his sci-fi.  By the way, Red Team Blues, which is the story of a 67 year old forensic accountant named Martin Hedge, is hysterical.  This is fiction.  And as a as a 66 year old podcaster, I really look up to Martin.  I think he's the next James Bond, by the way.  So Will Reaton reads that.  Are you going to get Will to read the Internet Con?

Start time: 488.53
End time: 532.80
Speaker: Cory Doctorow
Transcript:  No, I read it.  Oh, you read it. Oh, good.  I read Internet Con because it's basically all the applause lines for my speeches.  So it's like I can do this.  And I use the director I use for my other.  I'm glad you admit it.  Oh, yeah, no, 100 percent.  I use the director I used for all the other books, Gabrielle Dequeer, who's amazing.  And she is semi-retired.  The only people she directs now are Will Wheaton, LeVar Burton and me.  That's a nice group. Yeah.  Yeah, it's quite a good company.  So I did that.  And then she was she was like, I have never said this to an author before, but I think you should read your next novel.  So I literally spent the last week in the studio reading this one, which comes out in November.  This is the sequel to.  This is just another one.

Speaker: Cory Doctorow
Transcript:  So it's my Green New Deal, white nationalist militia counter-reformation adventure novel.  It's gotten great quotes from Bill McKibben.  Bill McKibben called it the first great Yimby novel.  And Kim Stanley Robinson comes out in November.  So that I've just finished recording the audio for with Gabrielle at Skyboat Media.  Good Lord.

Speaker: Rebecca Giblin
Transcript:  Corey writes when he's anxious.  So it's been a very fertile period.

Start time: 564.22
End time: 595.80
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I think based on what's going on in the world, you might be doing a lot more writing.  We are Twitter listeners are familiar with Corey's phrase that we use on almost all the shows now because it's so brilliant.  In certification, we change it to in certification, but we don't really need to because in certification isn't it's not a bad word.  But I do just for you know, just to so people don't cringe because I want them to hear the concept.  And this what this new book is all about is in certification.

Start time: 596.90
End time: 622.24
Speaker: Cory Doctorow
Transcript:  Yeah, it explains how in certification works, but much more importantly, what to do about it, how we how we, you know, halt in certification and throw it into reverse and dis-in-certify the internet.  Make a new good internet that is a viable and worthy successor to the old good internet and turns the internet that we have now into a kind of intermediate step that we can put in our rear view mirror.  Hallelujah.

Transcript:  It does seem to be going downhill.  I'm sure you're following with interest.  Elon Musk's antics over at X.  Dramatic, overly dramatic attempt to ruin $44 billion.  I mean, you could just set it on fire, but this is so much more interesting.  I mean, thoughts you're still on Twitter.  Rebecca, do you use Twitter?

Start time: 652.29
End time: 669.98
Speaker: Rebecca Giblin
Transcript:  I used to use Twitter.  Now it's sort of just tumbleweeds and screaming into the void.  It's been really tricky as well.  I really noticeable to see the lack of like the engagement just actually sort of dropping in real time.  And I'm not sure.  Corey, is it true that you are shadow banned?

Start time: 670.00
End time: 680.67
Speaker: Cory Doctorow
Transcript:  I think I still am.  I am most days like at Doctor Who doesn't autocomplete.  It just completes with the 75 impersonators.  But not me.  Oh, Lord.

Start time: 681.00
End time: 721.52
Speaker: Rebecca Giblin
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.  And so when Corey got sort of silenced and then my tweets also stopped, obviously I had quite a lot less engagement.  But then they also they just stopped getting seen by anybody.  So it's really, really interesting to see what we've been writing about Interpoint playing out in real time and the dangers,  particularly the dangers of allowing one person or corporation to have such outsized control over who gets to talk to who.  And then now seeing the fragmentation, you know, we obviously we haven't sort of all decided on a different playground to go to together.  Everyone's trying to figure that out.  And in the meantime, people that used to be able to have conversations together, not able to have that anymore.

Start time: 722.00
End time: 735.60
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's sad. I mean, it's I grieved the loss of Twitter back in October, but people are really going through grief.  How does this run me through, Rebecca, how this incorporates is an example of chokebook capitalism.

Start time: 737.18
End time: 859.84
Speaker: Rebecca Giblin
Transcript:  Well, I suppose what we're seeing is the unwinding. Right.  And then so in that respect, it's actually kind of inspirational.  So those of you who aren't familiar with choke point capitalism, what we're talking about here is this phenomenon where you get one or two powerful corporations that manage to capture a market.  So they take a market that should have been like a sort of a free exchange between buyers and sellers, creators and audiences.  And they turn it into like this hourglass shape where you put, say, the the the buyers at one end, the sellers at the other and themselves squatting at the neck where they use their power to mediate access to kind of shake down everybody for more than their fair share.  And so we see this in a whole bunch of different markets.  We really focus on where you've got really powerful buyers, which the technical word for that is monopsony.  But we try not to say that word too much because people think it's hideous.  But Amazon is a really powerful buyer, for example, in its in its relationships with publishers and authors and the way that it controls access to readers.  But in the whole second half of the book, which is the much more interesting part, we talk about how you unwind these hourglass markets, how you widen those choke points back out.  And we talk about the reasons why it's really tricky to do that.  But what's kind of exciting that the exciting bit in the in the death box that is Twitter at the moment is to see how the network affects having unwound in real time.  So network effects are, you know, the fact that, you know, when you've got one person is on a phone network, it's got no value at all.  You need somebody else there before it gets valuable.  So two people, it's more valuable.  Ten thousand people, it's more valuable still. And when you've got millions of people, you need to be on that network in order to talk to your family and friends.  And what we're seeing now is the unwinding of network effects and seeing how quickly it can actually happen when people have got the right incentives to move away, even though in this case, as we've seen, there's no compelling alternative.  And I think there's some really important lessons in that for what we can do about these these other choke points as well.

Start time: 860.08
End time: 913.27
Speaker: Cory Doctorow
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, there's a wonderful article by Dana Boyd.  I'll see if I can dig it up and paste a link in here where she talks about how when she was an embedded anthropologist with MySpace, how she could she could look at the network structure of MySpace and see that there were people who were very densely connected to other people.  So it might not just it might not be they had more connections, but like they were the only way that, say, two people would connect to each other was through this one person as kind of an important connector node.  And she saw how when those people left, even though the total number of users wasn't falling by much, the ability of people to connect to each other was falling.  And she predicted that the whole thing would collapse.  And the MySpace people were very sanguine about it.  And she was like, No, this is going to happen.  And then it did happen.  You know, network effects are a double edged sword.  People join because they want to be with the people who are there.  But they leave when those people leave.

Start time: 915.56
End time: 934.72
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's really an interesting point is the connections that that give it the value.  Do you think that it's also in a way it's part of the insh**tification cycle too, isn't it, at Twitter?  It's late stage, though.  It's not.  It's step four of insh**tification where it all falls apart.

Start time: 935.16
End time: 947.85
Speaker: Rebecca Giblin
Transcript:  That's the thing with insh**tification.  The whole point wasn't that, Corey, that they try and keep it just not enough that everybody stays.  But it's a knife edge.  Right.  And if you go too far the other way, then there we go.

Start time: 950.87
End time: 1146.72
Speaker: Cory Doctorow
Transcript:  I mean, the Individification Playbook assumes that you've got some surpluses.  Right. So you've got like your your investors capital or something else that you can kind of allocate as you as you choose.  And because it's a digital platform, you can allocate it and withdraw it really easily.  Right. You can like give people a lot of traffic one day and then take it away the next because you can adjust the way the filters and the algorithms work.  And that's the thing that's much harder to do if you're like, you know, selling bread.  Right. Or cars or something.  There's a there's a it's a lot clunkier, but you can do these fine grained adjustments constantly.  And you can be like a fisherman with a fishing pole that you're kind of jerking the hook up and down.  It's bouncing up and down.  And so you start by using that very flexible digital mechanism to tempt in a bunch of users and then find a way to lock them in.  And if it's social media, you don't even have to find a way users just lock each other in because they now they can't agree on where to go next.  Right. And so they're all just stuck there even though they all hate it.  Right. And and once those users are locked in, you're like, OK, well, now I can start making life worse for them in order to make life better for someone else.  So I can make things better for advertisers or publishers either by spying on my users or increasing the portion of their feed that is suggested stories.  And then once the users and the publishers or the users and the publishers and the advertisers are all locked in, then you want to withdraw all the surplus that you can, leaving just enough of a residue that they stay locked in and give it all back to your shareholders.  That's kind of your fiduciary duty at this point.  Now that everyone's on the hook, you want it, you want to strip into the bone.  And the problem is that, you know, the difference between a service that is so bad that you want to leave it, but you can't and a service that's so bad that you're leaving is like one scandal.  Right. One whistleblower complaint, one live stream mass shooting, one privacy rupture.  And then people just like in an instant go from God, I hate this, but I can't give it up to, oh my God, what am I still doing here?  I'm out. And I think that's what Twitter is experiencing.  It just keeps, you know, everyone's got a different version of that point.  But as Dana points out in that article, it's self-excelerating.  You know, once people start to leave, the value of the system goes down.  And so you don't need as much of a push to go because there's less holding you because the people you were staying to hang out with are already gone already.  So it's easier for you to unstick yourself.  And when that happens, you know, platforms start to panic and the term of art in the tech cycle for panicking is pivoting.  And so, you know, Mark Zuckerberg is like, we are going to pivot to a company that will turn you all into heavily surveilled, low polygon, sexless, legless cartoon characters in a virtual world I stole from a 25 year old cyberpunk novel.  And it can be pretty hard to convince people that the guy who just made the service that they actually liked into something terrible is someone they should follow into something even more implausible.  I mean, threads did better than Metaverse, but it remains to be seen whether threads will be durable at all.

Start time: 1147.30
End time: 1170.76
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it almost feels like he's pivoted again from the Metaverse.  Yeah, I think he has.  Maybe to AI.  It's so funny because every week, you know, I'm looking at news headlines and almost every case I look at it and say, oh, yeah, there's some more in shitification.  Oh, yeah, there's some more.  It's happening again.  And I suspect some of the stories we're going to talk about this week will.  Yeah.

Start time: 1187.00
End time: 1194.00
Speaker: Cory Doctorow

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, she really knows more about what's going on.  She would be another good person to have on with the two of you.  She would be.  What if failure is the plan?  And a great illustration.  It's a good piece.  Not AI, I don't think.  No.  What's sad is that all of these platforms seem to forget that the reason they exist is because of us, the people putting the content on there.  And I guess that's also part of the process, isn't it, of squeezing people?

Start time: 1231.58
End time: 1297.94
Speaker: Cory Doctorow
Transcript:  I mean, so that's why I think a new good Internet is not the old good Internet revived.  I think it's a new Internet that is a worthy successor to it and whose primary characteristic is that it's operated by and for the people who use it.  I think that's the thing that the tech sector fears the most is the idea that the people who use the technology would have the final say in how it works,  because it means that you can't, you know, put your thumb on the scales and say party's over.  I'm mixing a metaphor here, but say like parties over you for a long time.  You got to hang out on here and have a nice time talking to your friends.  But now it's time, as Kat Valente said, to stop talking to each other and start buying things, which was a thing that Prodigy told its Prodigy told its investors in the 80s.  Right. That like we have reached the point where our users have to stop talking to each other and start buying things.  That's saying the quite a lot.  I'll come to that Kat Valente one and put it in the chat in the spreadsheet too, because that is a banger of a piece.

Start time: 1298.58
End time: 1310.83
Speaker: Rebecca Giblin
Transcript:  But you know, we're seeing as we're seeing the latest data come out in climate and we're seeing exactly where we are.  I think we're getting to the point where we need to really reverse that.  We need to stop buying things and start talking to each other.  Indeed.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Unbelievable. Unbelievable.  So many things to talk about with these two.  It's just it's hard for me to pick, but I'll give you a few stories ripped from today's headlines.  The dream was universal access to knowledge.  The result was a fiasco from the New York Times.  We're talking about Brewster Cale's emergency library.  He got sued by publishers.  Now Brewster Cale is the Internet Archive is being sued by the record labels because he also asked people to donate their 78 digitize them and offered them.  I think there's clearly a societal interest in having an Internet Archive and preserving our history when companies don't care whether it's game roms or old movies or books or well, I can go on and on websites.  But at the same time, and I remember asking Brewster this, what about copyright?  Aren't you in trouble?  He said, well, worry about that later.  His attitude, I guess, at this point is we're a library.  Libraries don't worry about copyright.  You are a published author.  Both of you are published authors.  So you maybe have a dog in this hunt.  If the I guess, Corey, you allow digital copies of your all your books.  They're online.

Start time: 1392.02
End time: 1554.98
Speaker: Cory Doctorow
Transcript:  Most of them. My publishers haven't allowed me for a couple of books.  I have to say, Leo, I work for Electronic Frontier Foundation.  We are of counsel to the Internet Archive.  So there's actually very little I can say about this without first talking to our legal director.  But I can say I think Brewster is good.  Yes.  And I think the Internet Archive is good.  And I think that the factual record about the National Emergency Library is thin and that what we know about it, it doesn't support the story that a lot of writers have been told about it.  So here's the thing that I think has been poorly understood about the Internet Archive is that after the Patriot Act passed, when the librarians sued over the Patriot Act and the thought that they were going to be forced to give up their patron records,  Brewster went into the Internet Archive and ripped out everything that would tell him what people were accessing on the Internet Archive so that no one could ever make him give it to anyone else because he respects his patron privacy.  And after the National Emergency Library kicked off, he just didn't have a lot of good usage statistics.  But once he started finding ways to build aggregated statistics that would allow him to have a lot of good use of the data,  and allow him to help people understand what the impact of the National Emergency Library was and more broadly of the lending library that the archive operates,  it became pretty clear that what was going on here is that people were using this the way that you might use a reference library.  The average checkout was for a few minutes, and it was to look at a couple of pages, looking up a quote, looking up a passage, looking up a recipe, looking up some technical information, trying to find the name of something, and putting it back.  And there was a lot of concern that this might be eroding the sales of books during lockdown.  And I don't think the factual record supports it.  And I hope that my colleagues in the writing profession understand that and understand that the Internet Archive is a library.  It was used like a library.  However you feel about whatever liberties you think Brewster took during the brief period in which the National Emergency Library was operating,  the record doesn't support the story about how that might have affected our economic fortunes, and that is no longer operative.  And so there is a much more conservative version of it operating that looks effectively identical to the library at the digital lending program at your local library, which I hope no writer objects to.

Transcript:  Yeah, look, there is a maxim in law that says hard cases make bad law.  And I think it's really important to remember the circumstances in which this was happening.  Do we all remember how insane it was in those early days of 2020?  Nobody knew what was going on.  I know that a lot of our students suddenly didn't have access to books anymore.  We have very restrictive access for e-books, and that's something that I've worked on for many years.  People don't necessarily know this, but the way that libraries have always been able to lend physical books is without anybody's permission.  But when it comes to e-books, that involves making copies and transmissions, which means copyright gets involved and you do have to get permission.  And that's all well and good.  Authors and publishers should be remunerated appropriately for uses of their books.  But a lot of publishers have responded to the fact that they can control e-books by saying, well, we don't think that you should be able to hold these in libraries at all.  So Hachette, for example, it does license its books to public libraries in North America for e-lending,  but it won't allow any libraries in the Commonwealth to lend those on any circumstances at all.  And there's other things too.  We see publishers saying, okay, you can license these books, but we're going to charge you more money and they're going to wear out after 26 loans.  And then you're going to have to buy a new one.  And so there's all of these things are happening in the background.  And so those policies can make it really difficult.  We also see it was really common as well to have a bundling where you had to buy like a thousand terrible books that you didn't want in order to get the one book that you did want if you were a library.  And so all of that's happening in the background.  And suddenly people are not able to get to the university library and access those physical copies anymore.  And the policies might have been somewhat different in North America, but we still had that same kind of that sudden shift.  And it was really important to respond to that.  And I think that probably people might have forgotten those circumstances and just how difficult it was.  And I also believe that Brewster is trying very, very hard to do good.  And that he's very he's quite devastated, I think, by the way that this will end.  And everybody was doing their own thing.  But I think that the most important thing we should turn our mind to right now is thinking about how do we make sure that we have got sensible, appropriate e-lending policies so that publishers and authors are looked after.  But libraries also got the right to be able to lend books.  And that's really, really important because libraries are the ones that preserve them.  Often it's publishers that will go to the Internet archive and go, actually, can we get a copy of this?  Because we forgot to keep it ourselves.  And we need to have we need to have people in organizations whose role it is to preserve because that's not the case for everybody's role.

Speaker: Rebecca Giblin
Transcript:  Corey only published what like eight.  I published I published one hundred and sixty one on a single day plus choke point capitalism.  Well, so one of the remember I said, remember I was just saying, do we remember how crazy it was in those early days of the pandemic?  Some of the things that I did to survive being locked in my apartment for two years was one, write a book with Corey Chokdaro to start a publishing house that is called untapped.  It's the Australian Literary Heritage Project.  And we did this as a an experiment.  Basically, this was in part my response to the fact that libraries were struggling so much to be able to access books.  And Amazon has been whispering in publishers ears that they should not allow libraries to lend out their ebooks and saying that it was cannibalizing their businesses.  Now, one of the problems with that is that there's no public data that shows that that is the case.  And the data that does exist through the the the e-lending aggregators that sit between libraries and users suggests it's not the case.  Amazon is the one that controls the data that says that would allow us to figure out whether this was actually happening.  But it's a notoriously secretive company and it refused to make that information public.  And so I really I really wanted to know, you know, is library e-lending of books cannibalizing book sales?  Because if it is, we need to know that we all need libraries and publishers and authors and readers.  Guys, I'm going to get on my desk because there's an earthquake.

Transcript:  It's not going to be safer under the desk. I just want to point out there's quite a few books in there.  I hope those bookshelves are strapped down. I think he's going to be all right.  It could be related to Hurricane Hillary. Who knows?  So you're a law professor. So let me help me understand because what it seems to be is an eternal conflict between the interests of society and the interest of property holders.  Right. And this is a constant tension.  So in this case, writers and publishers who've created content want to control that content and make sure that they get paid for people to read it.  Society has absolutely an interest in public libraries. I think we can agree on that, even if publishers and Amazon might not.  But those are in tension. Are you saying that if we if we can prove that it's not costing publishers that much money to have digital rights, that it'll be okay?  Or or is it really that the property owners don't ultimately want you to have them at all without buying it?

Start time: 1953.62
End time: 2043.74
Speaker: Rebecca Giblin
Transcript:  No, look, what I really want to draw attention to, Leo, is not this idea that there is a tension between publishers and the authors on one hand and society on the other.  But even authors with publishers, like most of America's and Australia's literary heritage is out of print and lost forever.  Right. Right. Nearly every book is out of print and we don't have copies of them anymore.  The only places we're going to find those copies are in libraries and preservation libraries in particular.  And so what what what really inspired this project is when we realized that, well, we can't get this data because Amazon controls the sales data for ebooks and libraries have the lending data.  But that's all siloed. We thought, what if we start and what if we start our own publishing house and then we figure out what's going on?  And so what we did is we found one hundred and sixty one really culturally important Australian books and we worked with the authors to help them get their rights back.  These are all books that were still in copyright. They were some of them.  You know, half a dozen of them were winners of our most prestigious literary prize, the Miles Franklin.  And on top of that, we had amazing books by First Nations writers, women writers, really important local stories, lots of other prize winners as well.  All of it lost. And we worked with those authors to help them get their rights back from the publishers and then to republish these books.  And so how hard was it? How hard was it to pry these away from the publishers?

Start time: 2044.00

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Clearly, the publishers aren't publishing these books anymore. They're out of print.  Was it as easy as saying, well, you don't want this, do you? Can we buy it for a dollar?

Start time: 2053.00
End time: 2182.46
Speaker: Rebecca Giblin
Transcript:  Well, sometimes the publishers were really happy to give them back. Publishers are book people as well.  Right. And this is this is one of the reasons why I find a lot of these debates is really frustrating because we're all book people.  Sure. We all ultimately want the same thing.  And we've got different ideas about how we might do it.  And I mean, ultimately, the big problem is there is not enough money.  Right. So we get distracted fighting over scraps, fighting over whether the Internet,  the National Emergency Library is taking away some of those scraps from authors and publishers when we should be like asking a much bigger question of where is the money?  And do we actually want to people to be able to write books and people to be able to read books?  And if we want people to be able to write books and people to read books, we need to find money for books.  And that's all there is to it. And if we found more money, then there would be a lot less fighting over scrap.  The problem is, yes, it was. Go ahead. I'm sorry to interrupt.  It was it was quite tricky, but not because the publishers didn't necessarily want to give us the rights.  In most cases, they were really happy to. But because it was really hard to figure out who even owned those rights.  Sure. Often the publishers have been acquired three or four times.  You know, in one case, we asked every single publisher that was plausible and they were just like, well, we really don't think we own it.  We'll give you a letter saying if we own it, you can have it back.  But we don't know that we do. Sometimes the contract.  And this is like we're talking about, you know, contract copyrights can last 100 years and publishers take the rights for the entire time.  We're regardless of whether they are going to need them for that whole time because they think maybe this time is going to be the one that is, you know, the Harry Potter or the whatever that goes really huge.  But other times they had lost the contracts and the author didn't have the contract either.  Sometimes the contracts are being lost in a flood.  Other times they really did play hardball and they wanted to insist that they had the rights.  And then we had to try and interpret what a contract written 50 years ago meant today with the very different technologies that we lived in.  So it was hard to get the rights, but not for the reasons that you might expect.

Start time: 2183.10
End time: 2204.62
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting, too, because you have you have the three stakeholders, libraries, authors and publishers, who are all book people.  But you've added a fourth stakeholder who is clearly not a book person, which is the choke point, Amazon.  And right. And that's a they have very different incentives than the first three.

Speaker: Cory Doctorow
Transcript:  So I think you're getting onto something important there, Leo, because one thing that I think we lose sight of when we talk about books and copyright is that not only are books older than copyright, they're like older than printing.  They're older than the codex form, right?  They're older than binding.  They're older than commerce.  And there is a kind of penumbra of virtue that surrounds books.  I mean, there's a reason apart from the fact that I just own a lot of books.  In fact, it's the same reason that I own a lot of books and that I appear in front of a lot of books and that anytime someone wants to show themselves being learned, they stand in front of books.  And if you're making a hacky student film and you want to show that society is collapsed, you light a bunch of books on fire and everyone knows exactly what it means.  You're then simulating like roasting a dog, which would be the only other way you could show how far civilization had fallen.  And I think for book people in general, there is this sense that there is something quite special about books that goes beyond the pre vegetable matter sprayed with ink and that the drive to turn books into a commodity.  I mean, they are a commodity, right?  But to strip them of all the non commodity elements and to make them into just a widget, to make them into like something that is has the same shrink wrap license as an old CD ROM might will turn them into something that has the cultural cache of a CD ROM, which is to say none.  Right.  When was the last time you had a CD ROM?  Right. Right.  There is this danger that we will someday convince people that the entire contract that relates to how you and your book should should get along is is is contained in like, you know, a 50,000 word garbage legalese novella that you have to click I agree to and that all the unspoken cultural stuff is just not important.  And if we actually convince people of this, which we might, it will be a really bad day for writing and book selling and publishing economically.  Right. Like, like we, we buy books for kind of like social and cultural reasons that are not the reason that we buy granola bars.  And if we turn books into granola bars that you read, it will be to the great detriment of the publishing industry.  And Amazon really wants a book to be an ASI in right.  Just a skew.  Just a just a like a nine digit alphanumeric that is like sequentially between a plumbing fitting and Chinese sex toy with dangerous contaminants in its plastic.

What makes a book important as opposed to a granola bar is the conversation that the author is having with its readers, with her readers.  And it is the connections that make the difference.  It's very interesting.

Transcript:  But this is the thing.  I as a child, I grew up in a house without any books in it.  Right.  So I did.  And I was I was one of those kids that was always starving for something to read.  And so I would go to the library.  I would read libraries like a locust and I would go to the local charity shop and I would negotiate with the softest touch volunteer to get the books about boarding schools and ponies for like one cent each.  And I would totter home with this huge pile of them.  And so I remember what it's like to be starving for something to read.  Like my to read pile up there right now is oppressive in a different kind of way.  But I'm never going to forget just absolutely being starving for new stuff to read.  And I don't think that there are many authors out there who don't think that we should have libraries.  Authors feel like they are on the same side as libraries.  Authors want their books to be read.  But we do, like I said, we need to find ways of paying for them.  And so, for example, there's something in 34 different countries in the world called a public lending right, which says, OK, we really want libraries to be able to have books in them.  But we also really want authors to be able to eat.  And so there's like a state subsidy that says thanks very much for writing these books when they're held in libraries or buried in libraries.  We're going to give you some money from centralized revenue.  We have this in Australia.  We've just extended it to ebooks and audiobooks.  It's a great thing, right?  Because it's not it's not attached to who owns the copyright.  We give a certain proportion of it to the author, which is the lion's share.  And we give a bit to the publisher as well.  And we say thank you very much.  That's one way that we could do it.  If we if we wanted to actually make sure that libraries had books, people could read them and authors could get fed.

It's authored by several academics from NYU, including some good friends of Rebecca's and mine, Jason Schultz, Michael Weinberg, Claire Woodcock and Sarah Lambdon.  It's called the anti ownership ebook economy.  And it really gets into the how the sausage gets made in ebook lending and libraries and the fact that there's like one monopoly platform that does most of that lending that's owned by a terrible, rapacious private equity company, KKR.  That who did they just buy? They just bought someone.  They just bought somebody. Yeah, I just saw.  God, I'm blanking on it. Hang on.  I know I blogged it.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, publishing firms are and like the reason that publishing was always sort of genteel.  It's funny. You can contrast two different genteel professions with their two different genteel bases.  Right. One was banking, which for a long time was the three, six and six rule or six, three and six rule.  Borrow three percent, lend at six percent.  No, Borrow three percent, lend at six percent, be on the golf course by three o'clock.  And it was this incredibly boring trade that was heavily regulated that you went into if you were the fail son of a rich person.  Right. It was like what replaced the priesthood for the spare son of the American aristocracy.  And then publishing was what you did if you just love literature and wanted to eke out a bare existence  by by bringing literature to the world and making sure that books and authors had a home.  And both of them got supercharged in the 21st century.  And, you know, with private equity and giant conglomerates owning publishing,  publishing is down to five giant firms that operate as a cartel and with the finance sector completely taken over  by people who do not want to be in the golf course at three o'clock.  They want to sleep under their desks so that they can make more exotic derivatives and destroy the world economy.  Like both of them have really taken a turn for the worst in this century.

It is very early, I know, in Melbourne right now,  but I'm so glad that both of you could be with us.  I'm going to go check on the family.  Go check. While I talk about our sponsor, Express VPN,  we got to thank these guys because just like a publisher, you know,  it costs us money to do these shows.  And thanks to our sponsors and our Club Twit members, we can do them.  So thank you. Express VPN is the VPN I use, the best VPN on the market.  I'll tell you why I trust Express VPN.  And maybe you saw this article a couple of,  I think it was maybe almost a year ago now about Express VPN.  And I'm trying to remember where it was,  but it talked about how their technology stack works to protect your privacy.  So you all understand a VPN is a virtual private network.  It encrypts your traffic from your computer to a server somewhere in the world,  and then nobody can see what you're doing between your server and the server  at the other end, your computer and the server at the other end.  Now, of course, this assumes that the server on the other end is respecting your privacy.  That's very important that they don't log,  they don't keep track of what you're doing on there,  that they are there as a privacy forward service.  Express VPN is. And this is how we know.  All our servers run on a custom Debian distro that wipes the drive entirely every single day.  Reboot, wipe the drive, start fresh.  And if that weren't enough, they created their own trusted server technology that runs in RAM.  So when you press that big button on the Express VPN app,  when you launch your Express VPN and you start a server up,  it whips it up into RAM, sandboxed, it cannot write to the drive.  And then when you close the connection, it's gone.  No trace of your visit exists.  We know this Express VPN has regular third party audits.  We also know it from stories in the news about law enforcement  without a warrant, no-knock seizing Express VPN servers and finding nothing.  Now, I can't say this for other VPNs.  If you're getting a free VPN, they're making money somehow,  and it's almost certain they're doing it by selling your data to advertisers, not Express VPN.  They do everything in their power to assure you, to reassure you that your visit there is private.  They're also fast.  And this is really important because you can use Express VPN to go, let's say,  to go to Melbourne and start watching Netflix in Australia or go to Tokyo and watch Netflix.  Because they have servers all over the world, you can consume content all over the world.  So fast is important because you might be watching HD video.  They use Lightway, which is a new VPN protocol they engineered to make user speeds faster than ever.  Now, I can tell you, and I know you probably have this experience, other VPNs,  you might feel sluggish and slow.  You go, well, it's OK because of privacy, blah, blah.  No, why suffer? You don't need to.  Express VPN is blazing fast.  Stream in HD video with zero buffering.  It's also very easy. You don't need, it's not, it sounds, I'm making it sound technical.  It's not. It works on everything you've got.  iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, Linux.  You can put it on your router.  In fact, they even sell very good, by the way, very good routers with Express VPN built in.  So you don't need any technical skills.  Put the app, I'll give you an example.  Put the app on your phone.  Fire it up. You press one button.  It connects to the fastest server near you.  Or choose the locale you want to emerge onto the Internet in.  You can do that very easily with a little drop down.  And you're in.  So easy. Everybody can use it.  And that's important because privacy is important to everybody.  Security is important to everybody.  Not just me. Mashable, The Verge, many tech journals.  Express VPN, the number one VPN in the world.  Frankly, it's the only one I use.  So protect yourself with the VPN I use and trust.  Use my link, expressvpn.com slash twit.  Right now, you'll get three extra months free with a one-year package.  Expressvpn.com slash twit.  If you want to learn more, thank you ExpressVPN for supporting the show.

Transcript:  The locust fighter.  And Rebecca, it looks like it's a beautiful morning in Melbourne  and you've got an ice cup of something.  That's good. I'm glad to see that.  Is that, is that cup?  Is that an RBG cup?  What is RGB?  It is an RBG cup.  Oh, that's fantastic.  That's great.  Well, anyway, we're glad to have you both.  I really appreciate you spending some time with us.  Let's move on to another fine example of Chokepoint Capitalism or something.  I don't know what this is an example of government kind of making a mistake.  You're both Commonwealth types.  Corey, born and raised in Canada.  Canada passed a law a couple of weeks ago, C18,  that required companies like Google and Facebook to pay for links to news media.  The response from Meta was immediate.  They said, well, fine, you don't need news.  It's only only 3% of our users read news on Meta platforms like Instagram and Facebook.  So see you, Canada.  Now the Canadian government is pissed off.  They call this ban reckless because of wildfires in the West.  Horrific, we know.  But some people fleeing wildfires in Yellowknife, for instance,  have complained there that the ban prevented them from sharing important data about the fires,  I guess links to the local newscast.  And of course, for some reason, I don't know why the Heritage Minister of Canada,  Pascale St-Ange, is responsible for all of this.  She posted Meta's reckless choice.  I should do it in a bad French accent, but I won't.  Meta's reckless choice to block news is hurting access to vital information on Facebook and Instagram.  We're calling on them to reinstate news sharing today for the safety of Canadians facing this emergency.  I mean, more news right now, not less.  Who's at fault here?

Transcript:  Australia has done this, we should point out.  Rupert Murdoch and others said, you got it.  This is not right, mate.  So they passed a law.  Excellent Australian accent.  It's terrible. It's the worst.  I know. I'm sorry.  And it's worse than my French accent.  Good Logan Paul.  Really? That bad?  And then I guess they've toned it down.  They've negotiated.  It's been settled in Australia, although I think, I understand Google is negotiating and making some payments to news publishers down there.  Canada watching this and paying no attention to Spain and France and Germany said, yeah, we should do the same thing.

Speaker: Cory Doctorow
Transcript:  So I think that the mistake that they made, the big one, was not failing to pay attention to what happened in Spain and Germany and so on.  It was the category error that the problem with what tech is doing to the news is that it steals its content by allowing people to link to and discuss the news or to index the news so people can find it.  And I think there's no reasonable world in which that is bad for the news or where it's something that you should need permission for.  I think if you're not allowed to talk about the news, it's not the news.  It's a secret. But what they ignored is what tech actually does steal from news companies, which is money, which is a lot less ambiguous.  Right. And the way they steal money is by having an ad tech monopoly.  So like the two big ad brokers, which are Metta and Google, they are the sellers agent, the buyers agent, they own the market.  They are also sellers and buyers in that market.  So this is like if you were getting a divorce and you and your wife had the same lawyer who was also the judge and trying to match with both of you on Tinder,  they came out with 51 percent of your marriage estate, which is what the share that the two ad tech companies get, 51 percent of the ad dollars.  You know, if you're a subscriber-supported news entity, then two tech companies, Apple and Google, take 30 cents of every subscriber dollar that you get through your apps.  There are there's just sort of rampant ad fraud.  There's price fixing in the market programs like Jedi Blue where Facebook and Google illegally colluded to rig the market.  So ads cost more magazine. The publishers got less and they got more.  And all of these things are actually pretty easy to understand.  And if we solved like any of them, right, like so imagine that we fix the app tax, which is currently 30 percent for processing every payment made in an app.  So the finance monopoly, which horribly gouges on payment processing, charges about three percent.  And that's like way too high. And it's got it went up 40 percent during the pandemic.  The tech companies charge 30 percent. So they're charging 300 percent of the extremely inflated rate.  So imagine if every publisher that collected subscriber fees through an app could just get 25 percent more or more out of their subscribers.  Right. It'd be like growing your subscriber base by a quarter overnight.  That would be massive for them. And it's the kind of thing that governments could step in and do that would put a lot more money in the pockets of every news entity, not just the ones best situated to bargain with the tech companies.  And it would mean that the way that they made money was by making more news, not by profit sharing with the tech companies, which are the companies that we really want them to be watchdogging.  And so, you know, Tor Star, which is the biggest news publisher in Canada, had a long running, really good investigative series called Defanging Big Tech that ended as soon as Google agreed to start profit sharing with them.  Maybe it was a coincidence, but I think that it was.  Right. And so I think that that and I wrote a thing about this called Saving the News from Big Tech for EFF that has four recommendations.  And I think that this was, as you say, a foreseeable outcome that we would go from you must bargain to you must publish because as soon as you say to the tech platforms, you must bargain for the news that's on your platform.  They're like, fine, no news. And then they're like, oh, no, you have to carry the news.  And they're strong speech interests in publishers not being told that they have to carry certain news.  There's a lot of extremely objectionable news in Canada.  There's that, you know, Canada is the birthplace of many of the far right conspiratorial movements that we think of as being American.  It's where, you know, Proud Boys was founded by a Canadian and so on.  And we have some of the most egregious, xenophobic, awful and extremely popular news entities.  And if we're going to say to tech platforms, you must carry the news, even if you find it objectionable, that is going to be effectively a way to force tech platforms to carry disinformation, xenophobia, conspiratorialism, racial hatred and so on.  So I just think that it was like I'm all for making the tech platforms stop ripping off the news companies.  I just think we should focus on the thing they steal, which is money and not news.

Speaker: Rebecca Giblin
Transcript:  No, I don't disagree with that.  But I do have a few things to say about the news media bargaining codes and how successful that is.  You know, when in TrickPoint capitalism, Corey and I talk about the things that don't work to widen these trick points out and the things that do work.  And one of the things that we know that does work is to directly regulate buyer power.  So we don't have anything against that per se.  But there are some we can learn a lot from from how it's been done in Australia.  So for one thing, yes, it has injected a bunch of money into the news ecosystem, but there's been there's no transparency requirement.  And so we don't know where that money is gone.  But we have a pretty good sense that it goes mostly to the Murdoch press or a lot to the Murdoch press, which is the big media in Australia.  And there's also no requirement that it actually be spent on more journalism, more journalists actually creating high quality content rather than into investor pockets.  And so that's another another really big problem with this kind of intervention.  We've got to think, I think, much more clearly about what it is that we we want to encourage.  And if it is just money being shifted from some shareholders to other shareholders, then OK,  but don't pretend that it's about supporting journalism if that in that case.  And also really, really important that we don't cement these trick points in most of the money that has been injected into Australia via via the news media bargaining code has come from Google.  And that relies on Google saying big enough and powerful enough, unprofitable enough to keep putting this money in there.  And I think that Corrine and I both agree that that's really dangerous as well.  So, yes, if we want to get quality journalism and we want journalists to be able to be paid and and we want to have again an ecosystem where everybody can be paid fairly for their work, this is not necessarily the best way of doing it.

Transcript:  And I think it's fair to say that Google and Facebook drive traffic as well.  And there is some benefit to being linked on on a Facebook page or to be show up in a Google search that has that has some value.  I have to say, though, I'm a podcaster.  Podcasting is absolutely dying because Google and Facebook have eaten up all the ad dollars and advertisers understandably say we only want to buy ads where we can know everything possible about the person who's seeing those ads.  And that's the kind of thing that Facebook and Google offers.  So there's a whole privacy component there as well.  And something podcasting cannot do unless you listen in an app like, let's say, Spotify or I Heart.  So it's hurting podcasting.  I don't know if that's journalism, but it's definitely hurting podcasting.  And I, by the way, I'm not asking for any money from Facebook or Google.  That's not what I want.  I want to I want a market where we can compete fairly.  That's not going to happen.

Speaker: Rebecca Giblin
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's really important that advertisers I think that we educate advertisers as well, though, that they are also getting screwed by Google and Facebook.  And that context based ads, we know, like we've started seeing some really interesting natural experiments once the GDPR came in in Europe and stopped them from surveilling their users quite so intensely.  The context based ads were OK, somebody's reading a news article about weight loss and you put an ad for a local gym in there.  It does as well or better in most cases than the surveillance based ads.  And making advertisers realize that they're getting screwed on the other end as well.  And then just reconnecting local people to local businesses.  But this is where you actually this is where you actually convert and click to a sale.  It's not like, you know, how often are you getting ads for shoes like three weeks after you finished buying your pair of shoes?  You don't need your shoes anymore.  But those context based ads can really convert.

Speaker: Cory Doctorow
Transcript:  If there's one thing the ad sector has proven itself consistently very good at selling its ads to people who want to advertise things, not not the products, but the ads.  Right. Yeah. And the whole story about surveillance advertising being an incredibly effective tool, you know, the the margin is about five percent more effective than context ad at the outside.  And that's with this massive apparatus for spying on people that costs a lot more than five percent.  And so advertisers and publishers lose out on the surveillance ad systems.  It's just the surveillance industry that makes money.  You know, John Wanamaker, who owned Wanamaker's department store, is famous for having said half my ad dollars are wasted.  I just don't know which half.  The amazing thing about this is that his ad salesmen were so good they convinced him that only half his ad dollars were being wasted.  Right.  The number is more like 90 percent, as we know now that we have metrics.  And, you know, the thing that the press could do to really level the playing field here and get on the same side as their readers is to go all in on banning surveillance advertising because there isn't a reader who likes surveillance advertising.  And there used to be a debate about this.  People used to say, oh, people like ads.  They just don't like ads that aren't relevant. Blah, blah, blah.  And then Apple added a tick box to iOS that if you clicked it would block Facebook tracking and therefore personalized ads.  And 96 percent of iOS users clicked it.  The other four percent either worked for Facebook or got confused.  Right. Nobody is like, yeah, give me more of those spying ads.  And so the if you really want to like do a thing that your readers will love you for and will join you in fight for banning surveillance ads and then all that's left is context ads.  And the thing is no publisher will ever know as much about their readers as the surveillance industry.  Right. Publishers like even the ones that are doing their own ambitious tracking platforms are not going to have a mobile operating system.  Contracts with one hundred and fifty data brokers, SDKs that are used in the development of all the apps, like buttons or share buttons or sign in buttons on every Web page in the world that are going to be gathering these dossiers on people.  So when a publisher's intermediary, when their broker is a surveillance company, they will always be on the on the wrong side of that negotiation.  They'll always have less negotiating power.  But the one thing publishers will always know more about than surveillance companies is their own content.  And so if we structure the publishing industry around content based ads, context based ads, then the publishers will always be an advantage relative to these middlemen.  There's nothing wrong with middlemen.  We are our New York launch.  We had a Kate Judge as our interlocutor.  Kate wrote this great book called Middlemen about intermediaries.  Like, it's fine that intermediaries exist.  I grew up in Toronto where there was this cult writer named Cradd Colodny.  He used to stand on a street corner selling his books with a sign that said very famous Canadian author, buy my books and love Cradd.  He was very funny.  I used to stop and talk to him.  I found out later he secretly recorded conversations with people who stopped and talked to him when he started selling mixed tapes of the weirdest conversations he had.  Very entrepreneurial fella.  He also used to just wear a sign that said Margaret Atwood, which is very funny.  And when he died, they made a doc about him and Atwood stood on his corner wearing a sign around her neck that said Cradd Colodny, which is great.  But like not everyone has to be Cradd Colodny.  Like it is fine that there are intermediaries out there that help different parts of the supply chain connect to each other, that help writers meet audiences and so on.  The problem isn't the intermediary.  The problem is when the intermediary usurps the relationship, when the intermediary becomes more important than the publisher and the reader or the driver and the passenger.  Or any of those other relationships that are so important in the way that we live our lives.

Transcript:  This brings up the subject of Google topics.  But before and I'm sure you will have something to say about this.  But before we get there, I want to do a very nice context based ad that I think will very much enhance our listeners lives.  And we know because you listen to this show, you'll be interested in this topic.  And we don't know anything about our listeners.  And so this is all we can do.  We're stuck with it.  But I think it's a good thing.  What I should mention, by the way, and I don't know if it's a choke point, but there is a middleman in all of this, which are ad buyers and ad agencies.  And honestly, I think most advertisers would understand this notion because almost all the ads we have are context based as opposed to surveillance based.  I think most advertisers do get it.  And I think that the problem often is agencies that are the people in between the advertiser and the podcast or the newspaper or the blog.  And those agencies have a completely different incentive system.  They really, you know, the bigger the check, the bigger their commission.  And they don't and they and they love to push the surveillance based ads for some reason.  So that's what's pushing us towards direct ad insertion and other technologies that I don't want to use.  But frankly, that's I think what we're going to have to do is one of the topics this week at the podcast movement in Denver.  And my wife, Lisa, is going to be speaking there about this kind of thing.  So we are so happy to have this partnership here on the show.

I'm independently publishing just the audio, but I am independently retailing basically.  So I am I am I become one of the bookstores that sells my books.  And so I started doing that many, many years ago just for e-books, having that on CrapHound.com slash shop  just as another way to sell my books.  And I made a deal with all my publishers that I could carry books for them.  That has been going really well.  CrapHound.com slash shop to the point where it's actually outgrowing the software that I had custom written many years ago.  And I've been talking with Matt Mullenweg and Automatic has an agreement,  at least in principle, to rewrite that code and we're going to open source it so that anyone can run their own bookshop as well.

As I said, contextually based, we know you're interested in security.  We know you need to know about NetSuite.  Once your business gets to a certain size, shall we say, the cracks start to emerge.  Things you used to do in a day now take a week. Tell me about it.  And there are way too many manual processes to keep track of.  If that's you, you should know these three numbers. Ready?  Thirty six thousand, twenty five and one. Maybe I better explain.  Thirty six thousand. That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite from Oracle.  NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system.  Streamlining accounting, financial management, inventory, HR and more.  All those things that are bogging you down.  So that's thirty six thousand. What about twenty five? NetSuite turns twenty five this year.  I can't even believe it.  That's twenty five years of helping businesses do more with less.  Close their books and days, not weeks, and drive down costs.  And one, well, because your business is one of a kind.  So you get a customized solution for all of your KPIs in one efficient system with one source of truth.  Manage risk, get reliable forecasts, improve the margins, everything you need, all in one place.  And having a single source of truth transforms everything you do.  You know where to go to find out what you need to know to run your business better.  Right now, download NetSuite's popular KPI checklist.  You can get this right now.

Zero.  netsuite.com slash twit.  Thank you, netsuite, for supporting this week in tech.  So Google keeps... I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt.  And say it in a positive, nice way and then you can tear it down.  Google is trying to balance the needs of advertisers to know more about the people they're advertising to,  to make sure that their ads are hitting the right audience.  With the absolutely clear desire from users for privacy and incidentally governmental requirements for privacy.  They keep trying different ways of doing this. They've already said we're going to kill the third party cookie.  Chrome will not support that anymore.  A lot of ad tech kind of relies on this third party cookie to follow you around the net.  Facebook kind of perfected it with the like button.  But they don't... they said, no, people don't like that. We don't want to do that anymore.  So they've tried a variety of things. Flok was the last one.  The newest is called Topics because Google loves acronyms.  Or is it an acronym or is it a initialism? I can't... initialism.  I always confuse the two.  So topics, if I can summarize and correct me if I'm wrong here.  Mozilla, by the way, wrote a very powerful screed against this.  But remember Mozilla makes the competing browser Firefox.  A privacy analysis of Google's topic proposal by Martin Thompson.  Can I tell you? They don't like it.  But the idea is, I think, if I'm saying this correctly, when you visit a website and this is in Chrome,  or interestingly, because it'll be part of the Chromium project and all the open source code,  it'll be in all the... and Corey has some good things to say about open source.  He calls it open washing. We'll talk about that in a second. Google's a prime candidate.  But it's in Chromium, so that means I presume that unless Microsoft works to eliminate it,  it'll be in Edge, it'll be in Opera, it'll be in Vivaldi, it'll be in Brave,  it'll be any browser that doesn't take that code out.  The idea is you go visit a site. The site is registered with topics.  And Google says a handful of topics, but it's already 349 topics.  And it's probably going to be closer to 1,500 topics. Those are the official IAB categories.  Like fitness or travel or transportation or whatever.  So the site will say we would say tech, networking, security, something like that.  And then the browser will keep track of your top interests for that week based on your browsing history.  Topics are kept for three weeks. So after that, old topics are deleted. They want them to be current.  Is it another earthquake or just the tea?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, every nerd in the audience does exactly what you just said.  He's Sugruing the challenge coins to the monitor.  Yeah, let's talk about it.  Much more interesting than this BS.  So topics are selected entirely on your device. They don't go back to the Google servers.  So it's in the browser. The browser keeps track of it.  When you visit a participating site, Topics picks three topics, one from each of the past three weeks to share with the site and its advertisers.  So it says, well, and it doesn't say Leo because it doesn't know it says that doesn't know it's Leo.  Browser 16439 recently visited travel and intestinal surgery and hormone replacement.  So maybe you'd like to give him an ad for medical tourism.  I don't know. The idea being you're anonymous, but advertisers get some information about your interests.  On the surface, this seems OK.

Transcript:  Is it? Yeah. So the Mozilla analysis, which I confess I haven't done a deep dive into, is really about asking whether users can be identifiable based on this.

Transcript:  We know de-anonymizing happens and it happens surprisingly effectively with a lot of these technologies.

Start time: 4690.12
End time: 4736.94
Speaker: Cory Doctorow
Transcript:  Yeah. Google's making a claim that it's hard to de-anonymize people using this system. And that's an empirical claim.  It's hard to prove the negative, but you can prove the positive.  So they suggest a method again, just reviewing the math here.  It starts on, I think it starts on section two one, I think. Is that right? Yeah.  They're just like they're just saying, you know, like, look, your your math is wrong.  Here is the likelihood that I can re identify a user.  So if your claim is this is preferable to third party cookies because it allows for anonymous browsing while delivering the benefit, which, you know, will stipulate to maybe it is, maybe it isn't.  But assuming, arguing that there's a benefit to having targeted ads for the user and that the user should want this.

Start time: 4737.04
End time: 4748.94
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. That, which is, as we said, debatable. But go ahead. Yeah. It's debatable. But like, sure. Let's let's just assume that arguing.  Look, as somebody who sells ads, whether they're wrong or right, advertisers want it. We got to we got to we got to answer their need.

Start time: 4749.54

Speaker: Cory Doctorow
Transcript:  So does it does it do it right? And and you know, I my most instructive story about this comes from the pop up wars and you are like me a veteran of the pop up.  Yes, we are. And we remember right when when there were pop ups that would respawn as soon as you close them.  Pop ups that were like one pixel by one pixel and ran away from your cursor pops up pop ups that played music pop ups that spawned 50 pop ups if you close them.  And like the way that we resolve this wasn't by publishers taking a brave stand on behalf of their users because like you say, right, you are not in a position to say to advertisers, I'm sorry.  My listeners don't like it. We tried when I read to them when I tell them what when I tell them what to buy.  We think you should just give me money and I'm not going to tell them to buy your product.  The advertisers are unwilling to go along with that.  So you you have a limited amount of bargaining power, even if there are things that you might just prefer that the industry requires of you.  You end up doing it. But once it started with opera and then Mozilla started bundling always on on by default pop up blockers, publishers had a different story.  They told to advertisers, which is, look, I know you want pop ups and I want to give you pop ups.  But the problem is no one's going to see them. Right.  I can put all the pop ups you want in there and they're all going to be blocked by default.  And it's going to be zero impressions, not like more impressions.  And, you know, that speaks to a way that equilibria are arrived at in marketplaces where buyers are given offers by sellers.  And one of the things that buyers can do is make a counter offer.  And that counter offer can be how about no. Right.  How about now? And that's what ad blocking is. Right.  Ad blocking is how about now? And, you know, it's it there is another counter counter offer that publishers can make with advertisers, which is what about a less invasive form of advertising?  What about a DJ read? What about an ad that served natively and not from a third party domain?  What about an ad that doesn't track you? Right.  Like it's very hard to block context ads that are first party served because they're served from the same server as the web page you're looking for.  And so generally speaking, they're going to show up on the user's browser.  Now, like, will the user seek out a plug in that does something much more exotic with the DOM to block the ad?  It really depends on how obnoxious the ad is.  And so the equilibrium that we arrive at is not an equilibrium that arises merely from publishers and advertisers negotiating amongst themselves for what users should want.  It comes most importantly from users and the toolsmiths who serve them, who produce the tooling that allows users to express their own preference and that acts as a kind of veto over whatever it is that the publisher and the advertiser would like.  And that's how we get equilibria where the ads are a little less obnoxious.  Strip away the power of users to push back against ads and you get, well, you get apps, right?  Apps are basically the ultimate expression of it because to make an ad blocker for an app, you first have to reverse engineer it.  And that's a felony punishable by a five year prison sentence under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.  And so whereas the web is now about 30 percent ad blocked, 30 percent of browsers have an ad blocker installed.

The rate of ad blocking in apps is basically zero unless you're doing weird things like you've got a pie hole where you're sinking those domains or something.  You're getting ads in your apps and they're terrible.  Right. App ads are awful.  And that's what it looks like when the only answer the user is allowed to give is like, thank you, sir.  May I have another?

Transcript:  But everything is Chrome based unless it's WebKit based except for Firefox.  And so we've got we've got very little diversity in web ecosystems.  One of the interesting things about the UK Competition and Markets Authority is they have a proposal to force Apple to support third party browser engines on iOS, which might produce some more not browsers, but browser engines, because little understood fact is that every iOS browser is just a skin around WebKit.  Right. So they're all Safari.  Right.  Firefox on iOS is Safari with a Firefox skin and Chrome on iOS is Safari with a Chrome skin.  And so this proposal would would produce a little more diversity, at least in back ends.  And, you know, I think that, like, the lesson that we've learned over and over again is that companies themselves are not good custodians of their users interests.  Like Apple did roll out that ad blocker for Facebook, but they simultaneously rolled out a secret and hidden tracking program for iOS that replicated all the tracking that you opted out of with Facebook, but for Apple's ad network.

But then there's the economic question, which is like, why does Google want this?  And I think that the answer is they want it because they want to own the web.  They like Facebook and Apple want you to live inside their walled garden.  Google wants to make the web the walled garden.  Is AMP an example?

Is topics a way that's going to widen these trick points out?  Like, I don't think so.  I think that it's the exact opposite.  So then how how do we want to do that?  How do we go about loosening that?  I think that's a much more interesting question.  And at the moment, we're giving these really powerful private corporations the ability to dictate how our online life looks and works and the economy of it.  And I just don't think that that's good enough.

Start time: 5175.18

Speaker: Cory Doctorow
Transcript:  Yeah.  And this is, you know, part of the part of the thesis of incitification and the Internet con is that so much of what we do when we talk about the failures of technology is about trying to make them better.  Instead of making them easier to leave.  And oftentimes, those object those objects are or those objectives are intention.  And I sometimes liken it to the California fire problem, where it used to be that indigenous cultures did control burns in California woodland.  And it meant that there were new openings in the canopy that old wood was being consumed, that you didn't have fuel buildups and the fire was manageable.  And you got continuous renewal.  And when the settlers declared war on fire, they didn't create a fire free California.  They created a fire, a fire indebted California that periodically erupts into absolutely uncontrollable wildfire.  And with tech, we interrupted the cycle that allowed tech to turn over all the time that allowed like digital equipment company to turn IBM into used to once was and then for compact to turn deck into a used to once was and then for compact to basically disappear.  Right. This this endless renewal that we had because we had vigorous antitrust enforcement because interoperability was presumptively lawful because we didn't have rules that allowed the people who won the lottery last time to decide who is going to win the lottery next time and make sure it was always them.  And when we got rid of that, we started to accumulate technology debt.  And so we have this kind of rampant gigantism in our tech companies.  And they're always on fire.  And, you know, here in California, we've put a lot of energy into trying to make it safe to live at the urban wildlife interface, which just makes the problem worse.  Right. It just increases the population density in the fire zone.  And we keep trying to make it safe to be a Facebook user or a Google user, which just means that Facebook and Google can now say whenever we say to them, well, here's a rule that's going to make you less powerful.  They're going to they can say, well, we need all the power because we're defending all these users.  Right. We've now got three billion users in our wild garden, four billion users in our wild garden.  And what we need to do is evacuate the fire zone.  We need to have interoperability that makes it easy to leave so that you can leave a social platform but still send messages to the people who leave behind or you can leave a mobile platform and still use the apps and data that you had before and so on.  In the same way that we need to get the people out of the fire zone in California, we need to let the platforms burn.  Right. Preserving them is is not going to make them better.  There isn't a future in which Google is even bigger.  And the fact that it's even bigger makes it better suited to being the unelected permanent overlord of how we use the Internet.  That's the real ultimate.

Transcript:  So, you know, this is something that you mentioned before that you like this approach in my work and it's something Rebecca and I really put a lot of emphasis on and choke on capitalism that I also devote a lot of energy to in Internet Con.  So people who reach out on capitalism, they often report that by the time they get about halfway through, they have this alarming ringing in their ears.  That's like an incipient rage aneurysm.  Yeah, because the first half of the book is just explaining how all these awful scams that rip off creative workers work.  Right. The underlying kind of accountancy fictions that are used to make them go.  And then the second half of the book, which we really have to urge people to read, is shovel ready, detailed, technical proposals on the theory that because this is so unstable and it's so unfair and so untenable, it will continue to erupt in crisis in fire.  And that when the fire comes, if we have in our minds better ideas for how to fix it, what my arch enemy Milton Friedman called good ideas lying around, right?  When Milton Friedman was like trying to create the Reagan revolution out of the New Deal, people would say like, Milton, how are you going to convince people to give up like social mobility and health care and a dignified retirement and, you know, subject themselves to like being for for log tucking for lock tucking boot blacks in your future?  He would say, look, there will become there will come a crisis.  And when the crisis comes, ideas lying around can move from the periphery to the center.  And so we try to create these ideas lying around.  And in in the Internet con, I talk about what what policies we could do that would open up interoperability straight away.  And there's, you know, legislative you said this both books.

Start time: 5466.06

Speaker: Cory Doctorow
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah. Can you explain what that is?  So it's one of those ideas that's both incredibly simple and incredibly complicated.  So incredibly simple in the sense that like you can put any water in your kettle, you can put any shoelaces in your shoes, you wear any belt with your pants, you can put any gasoline in your car trunk.  Right. They're interoperable.  Right. And and sometimes things are interoperable because they conform to standards.  So you can screw any light bulb into any light socket.  Sometimes they're interoperable because a new manufacturer comes along and figures out how to do something the original manufacturer didn't intend.  So you can put a USB charger in your car cigarette lighter.  And sometimes they're interoperable because a new manufacturer comes along and does something that the original manufacturer objected to and tried to stop.  So you can read and write Microsoft Office files with the I work suite, pages, numbers and keynote.

Speaker: Cory Doctorow
Transcript:  They said you were mechanically attaching unauthorized equipment to the Bell system and that that endangered national security.  And it was a big as like a bake a light cup that went over your phone so that you could talk like this.  People can read your lips.  It was just like they finally found an abuse of corporate power so egregious that the judiciary wouldn't go along with it.  That was the beginning of the end for them.  And so, you know, computers are interoperable in a way that like nothing we've ever had before is interoperable because computers are universal touring complete von Neumann machines.  They can run any program we can write.  And that means that you can always write a program for your printer that will cause it to accept third party ink.  You can always write a program for your car that will allow it to do third party diagnostics for an independent mechanic.  And you can always write software that will convert one file format to another.  And you can always write a scraper that will take data out of a social media service you left behind and put it in the inbox of social media service you went to.  And what we've done is we've created this thicket of laws that we call them IP laws, but they're really not used as copyright or patent or any of the things that we call IP laws.  They really add up to what Jay Freeman calls felony contempt of business model.  They're just a way like you can think of an app as just a web page that you salt enough IP onto that you can make it illegal to reverse engineer it right in every other regard.  It's just like a like a JavaScript page.  Right. But but you you shake you shake the IP on it.  And now it's illegal to compete with it, modify it, add to it and so on.  So everyone's trying to find the hook IP, the skin that they can wrap around it.  So how do you pierce that skin?  How do you get rid of that thicket?  Legislative reform is a long haul.  We should do it, but it's a long haul.  There are some shortcuts to it.  Like we have rules that are requiring tech companies to start allowing interoperability in Europe.  There's the Digital Markets Act, which forces the largest platforms to expose APIs so that third parties can connect to them.  And then we can restore the right to do the kind of reverse engineering that used to be allowed through things like, say, procurement laws for governments.  So right now, governments buy digital equipment, including things like cars that have computers in them, without ever securing from the manufacturer a promise that they can hire other people to maintain and extend them.  And this is really imprudent, bad public administration.  And like Lincoln did not follow this principle.  Lincoln only bought rifles for the Union Army that had standard tooling and ammunition for this like incredibly obvious reason.  Like you never wanted to have to go out to Gettysburg and say like, wars cancel, boys, the manufacturer is not making any bullets.  Right.  And so, you know, the we could just say as a matter of prudent public administration, no government in America buys anything unless the manufacturer promises not to legally attack people who are doing interoperability.  And like they'll complain.  But like if you're so emotionally fragile that you can't bear to sell stuff to the public purchaser on terms that accord with the public interest, like find another line of work.  Right.  Like no one no one forces you to sell to the US government.  The US government's priority is not your shareholders interests.  It's the public interest.  And so, you know, the book has got several of these kinds of shortcuts that we can take to kind of attack the problem at the margins as we make this frontal attack on legislative reform.

And some people want like labor rights because they just want more consumers to sell to.

I love my Mint Mobile.  Oh, man.  How much?  Just look at your your cell bill.  Just, you know, if you really think about it, if you know, most of us, what we do is we we don't we put it on the charge credit and we intentionally do not look at it.  Is it $80, $90, $100, $200?  From the gas pump to the grocery store, from utility bills to your favorite streaming services, inflation is everywhere.  Everything costs more.  Well, fortunately, one thing can cost a lot less.  There's one company out there that's giving you a much needed break, Mint Mobile.  Now, keep in mind that big number that is your cell bill right now.  And let me tell you, as the first company to sell premium wireless service online only, Mint Mobile lets you order from home.  There's no stores.  You save a ton.  Their phone plans start at, ready, $15 a month.  That's all in.  All plans come with unlimited talk and text, high speed data delivered on the nation's largest 5G network.  It's T-Mobile.  Don't tell them I told you.  It is.  I mean, you are paying too much.  I could tell you that right now for people looking for a way to balance the budget.  Mint Mobile is amazing.  Premium wireless, $15 a month.  I actually saved even more because I wanted more data.  So I got 10 gigabytes a month and I bought the year plan.  But you get, look, just go and take a look at the plans.  They all start at $15 a month.  They all, even the 20 gigabyte.  They all start at $15 a month.  The unlimited plan, $15 a month.  The 5 gigabyte.  I think 15 bucks for unlimited nationwide talk and text and 5 gigabytes of data, you're not going to get a deal like that anywhere else.  Nowhere else.  Nowhere else.  But you could try the other ones.  Go ahead and see.  Or look at your existing cell phone bill if you can stand it and look at how much data you used last month.  And that's the amount you should buy.

They will send you a SIM for free or they do eSIMs too.  So if you have an eSIM phone, it's easy.  You'll be up and running in note time.  You could port your old phone number over.  They do it very quickly.  Keep your same number.  Of course, keep all your contacts and everything.  They also sell phones.  I got a nice iPhone SE from them.  Also $15 a month.  That was great.  I don't know if that's still the deal, but that was a, I felt like I'm getting this is heaven.  For a third of what I'm paying right now, I'm getting a new phone and five gigs of data a month.  That's one thing that Mint Mobile does inflate.  More data all the time, it seems.  Switch to Mint Mobile.  Get premium wireless service.  $15 a month.  To get your new wireless plan for $15 a month and get the plan shipped to your door for free, go to MintMobile.com slash twit.  MintMobile.com slash twit.  Cut your wireless bill to $15 a month.  MintMobile.com slash twit.  We thank them so much for supporting this week in tech.  And you're doing the same when you use that address.  Please do.  Because as I said, we don't, you know, we don't know anything about you.  So the best thing you can do is go to MintMobile.com slash twit so they know you came from the show.  That helps us an awful lot.  So many stories and there's so many things.  Every time I see this, I want to ask you about.  Maybe this is the the legislative crack in the iceberg that we were.  That's probably not a good way to put it.  The sea these days.  We don't want any more cracks in our icebergs.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  I didn't even know they were still around.  The CFPB is going to crack down on data brokers, they say, at a White House event.  That's when I get nervous when I see that.  Says at White House event.  At least they're recognizing that data brokers are one of the big problems.  You know, we talked about the fact that Apple and Google and Facebook have first party data.  But there is this even bigger issue that data is then sold or somehow given to these third party data brokers, of which there are now hundreds.  And they will sell it to the highest bidder, including we know the NSA.  And we I suspect other nation states like China, everybody's worried about TikTok.  China gets whatever it wants.  It just has the data brokers here.  Here's a buck fifty.  What's Leo been up to?  So maybe we're going to do something about this.  These are proposed rules under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.  That was clever.  That's something that's a law from, I think, the 20s that they are going to kind of slightly manipulate to apply to data brokers.  The actually from the 70s, the FCRA.  It promotes privacy of information and data collected by the consumer reporting, credit reporting agencies, credit bureaus, tenant screening services.  And so by making these data brokers.  Responsible to the FCRA.  Maybe we can do something about this.  Are you are you bullish on this, Corey?

But what so I think, you know, the way to understand the Biden administration is they're kind of an empty vessel that different factions of the party are like get to fill up in proportion to how much power they have in the party.  And so the left of the party got some really good appointments where they got really Chopra.  Tim Wu. Tim Wu is gone now, but he was at the White House and Lena and you have Rebecca Slaughter on the FTC.  You have Jonathan Cantor at the DOJ and Rohit Chopra, who cycled out of the FTC and into the CFPB.  We like Jessica Rosenworcel, the chair of the FCC. She's been great.  Yeah, yeah, 100 percent. Although they're deadlocked two and two and they can't make any rules.

Transcript:  I don't know. She's going to have like a 15 minute term by the time she gets in there.  Yeah, I don't know. But but you know, it's and like anyone who would go in the hot seat after what they did to Gigi is nuts.  It was I mean, it wasn't as bad as Anita Hill, but it was in a yeah, it was in the neighborhood.  So so to answer your question about this, like what all of these people have in common in addition to being principled is that they're really skilled bureaucrats.  And I mean that in the best way possible. They've read their regulatory authorities, right?  The regulatory enabling instruments that give them their authority. They know what's in there.  So like Section five of the FTC Act, which has not been enforced in 40 years, has been there between Section four and Section six all of these years.  And it basically says that the FTC has broad latitude to prohibit any deceptive or unfair business practices.  And it was on that basis that Khan promulgated a rule banning noncompetes.  Right. And and as well as many other rules. Right. And like any FTC chair had that in their power for all these years and just never did it.  She's also using that, by the way, to treat privacy as a consumer welfare violation and bring it within the FTC's own purview.  So they're going to be looking at privacy and considering it. And and so this is what Chopra has done is he's gone and looked at the enabling legislation that gives him his regulatory powers.  And he said, I already have it in my power to do something about these data brokers and data brokers are just the bottom feeding scum of the surveillance industry, worse even than the ad tech companies and so on.  A lot of them have been acquired by ad tech or other big tech giants like Oracle owns more than 80 data brokers that it acquired.  And they just spy on you with every hour that God says one would be enough.  They just rolled up. Well, all a data broker is, is it's just like a siphon that is stuck into someone's data source.  Right. There's someone who has a relationship with a medical supplier or a taxi company or someone else who can give them data about you and your conduct nonconsensually under the fiction of privacy.  And that's the question that you consented when you clicked. I agree before doing something right.  And and so what she said is what he said is that data brokers sell enormous amounts of data to credit bureaus and credit bureaus themselves are also incredibly awful.  The first one, Equifax, very famous for having doxed the entire adult population of America a few years ago after insider trading to sell executive stock before it became public that they'd had this horrific data breach.  Never really paid a significant price as a result of it. You know, fines and whatever, but they're still in business.  Their origins are in the late 19th century as a company that hired private investigators to follow people around to figure out whether they were political subversives, queer, so-called race mixers so that banks and merchants could discriminate against them.  And that was like their high watermark. They've only gotten worse since then.  And and you know that the the so so here you have you have Chopra saying like I have regulatory authority over these firms.  These firms acquire mountains of data in a complete opaque wild west, you know, free for all from these data brokers.  I can reach into that relationship. Congress does not need to pass a new law. Congress already gave me that power.  And you know, a lot of people get very defensive about Pete Buttigieg and you know, the great transportation failures we've had with railroads and airlines, a million people stranded last Christmas.  And they say, you know, Buttigieg does is not like the IT manager of Southwest Airlines.  He can't fix their computers, but he sort of can. Right.  Right. He's actually got enabling legislation that it was copy pasted from Section five of the FTC Act.  And it requires that he do certain procedures, right, like he has to have an investigation and public inquiry comment and so on.  And then he can issue an order. Right.  These top regulators of these large government US government agencies are among the top.  Zero point zero zero one percent of most powerful people that have ever lived in the history of the human race.  They have more power to affect more people's lives.  And what's what you've got in the best of the enforcers in the Biden administration is a willingness to use that power in a way that is firmly in the public interest.  I think we should be really glad about this. This is an amazing turn of events. Good.

Transcript:  Let's talk a little bit about our club. One of the things to me that is important to our future.  I've already talked before about advertising being a tough road a hoe in podcasting.  It's getting harder and harder. Thanks to the giants like Spotify and I heart.  Thanks to Facebook and Google. We don't know a lot about you.  We're an RSS feed, but still advertisers demand something.  We have little redirects when you download a podcast that go through a site that then we take, you know, take it your IP address and they match it to the IP addresses of the advertiser site to see if you visit if you heard the ad and then visited the site.  That's all we can do. I apologize for that. I don't want to do it.  But it's really pretty much all we can do. And your privacy is still protected by that, I think.  But wouldn't you love to get all of these shows without ads without any tracking?  That's what the club is for. And it also helps us a great deal to to kind of monetize and keep Twitter on the air.  It's very affordable. Seven bucks a month. It's kind of like Patreon. In fact, it's it's through a Patreon division called memberful.  You pay seven bucks a month or eighty four dollars a year.  We also have family plans and corporate plans. You get ad free versions of all the shows.  You also get access to the Club Twitter Discord, which honestly, I had no idea what a great community discord was until we started using the Club Twitter Discord.  And now I'm just a huge, huge fan. All the animated gifts plus more.  We're reorganizing our discord now to use the forums section to make it a little easier to participate.  It's not just conversations about the shows. It's conversations about everything geeks are interested in, including sugruing all the things to your monitor.  That could be there. We can have a sugrue. In fact, let's do that. Let's get a sugrue section in our Club Twitter Discord.  We also have lots of events, great events coming up.  Our photo walk is August 26th. Aunt and I will take you through Petaluma if you're in the area. Stacey's Book Club at the end of the month.  Daniel Suarez, science fiction author Daniel Suarez, will join Hugh Howey. Hugh is of course the author of Wool, which Silo was based on.  Two great sci-fi authors will be talking with them about their books, their process. That is coming up September 7th.  So if you're not at Burning Man, that's going to be one you can watch live and participate with live. Ask questions, join in.  We also use the Club. Oh, good. You booked a Renee Richie fireside chat coming up.  And apparently Jeff Jarvis, Doc Searles and I will be the old farts fireside chat.  That's also I love the AI art. Thank you, Anthony Yeltsin. That's also something to look forward to.  We try to do these events. We do. In fact, we should probably get Cory and Rebecca in there. We did when we did the triangulation.  We also have a Club Twitter feed, which has stuff before and after shows, things we didn't make into the podcast.  All of that seven bucks a month. I think it's a very good deal. We would love to have you in our club.  Participate with us. We're going to have more events, more meetups. Just go to twit.tv slash club twit.  If you're not already a member, we would love to have you join and enjoy. Thank you very much for allowing me to talk about that.  All right. We're going to get back to our great guest, Cory Doctorow, Rebecca Giblin in just a moment.  Before we do, though, we had a great week this week on Twitter. We've even made a little movie for your enjoyment.  Watch. And now it's time for waffles.  Well, we're not celebrating. No, really.

Final segment. Got to talk about AI.  First of all, let's talk about open washing, which isn't really just about AI.  It's about the use of open source to make people feel good about you.

Start time: 7235.76
End time: 7566.86
Speaker: Cory Doctorow
Transcript:  Yeah. So this is a reference to a great paper by David Gray Whitter, Sarah West from the AI Institute,  and Meredith Whittaker, who used to be with the AI Institute and is now running Signal,  called Open for Business, Big Tech, Concentrated Power and the Political Economy of OpenAI.  And they just make this point that open AI doesn't have a very good, crisp meaning.  And the companies that call themselves open and AI are not delivering any of the benefits that open is supposed to deliver.  They're not creating an ecosystem where you can study how these things work, where you can replicate them yourself,  where you can improve them, where you can improve their quality by auditing them.  What you get instead are these things at the margins where you can run a model on their hardware.  And some of that is not their fault. Some of that is just like these models require a lot of hardware anyway.  But for them to then turn around and kind of cloak themselves in openness and say, don't regulate us, European Union.  We are open. And it is because we are open that you will get all kinds of benefits that you wouldn't get if we were closed  when they know very well that those benefits don't accrue to this kind of technology because it requires that you have a bespoke data center.  And, you know, they get into some nice gnarly detail about this, about how the tooling for open AI, things like TensorFlow and PyTorch,  are not just generic tools that you can use to do development.  They're tools that cause developers to be specialized in their proprietary environment.  So even though they're open source, the thing that you learn when you master these open source tools is how to be a sharecropper  in a system that they have 100% control over and can pull the rug out under at any moment if they don't like how you're doing things  or if they want to rip off your idea and clone your product.  And it also means that whatever you build is really easy to integrate into their product and can't be integrated into their competitors' products.  So the idea that this is a pro-competitive force is pretty narrow.  And then on top of that, which I think is a very good analysis, I wrote my own analysis, as you mentioned on my blog,  and I tried to understand open AI as part of a kind of denaturing, progressive denaturing of the free software movement.  And so free software, you know, we've all heard, I think, the phrase free as in speech and not as in beer.  And free software was kind of deliberately a bit of wordplay that it was meant to be like a conversation starter.  People would say, you mean you give the software away for free?  And you say, no, I give you freedom with the software.  And, you know, if you're explaining, you're losing. Right.  Only Richard Stallman thought that was a good, you know, Richard's done some amazing things and some things that I'm less fond of.  But the along comes open source.  And the claim about open source was that it was just a way of kind of resolving this ambiguity.  So you wouldn't scare the normies. Right.  So that the business people would not think, oh, well, this isn't something we can make money on.  But there's a really important shift from free to open or from freeze and freedom to open or freedom to openness,  which is that you go from talking about an ethical proposition that people should have technical self-determination because they have software freedom  that allows them to build and operate the technology that they depend on and to, you know, have the freedom to move from one platform to another, to not be locked in and so on.  All of those really important freedoms and the and that you replace it with openness and openness is like the instrumental benefit of being able to like look at the code.  Right. And and being able to make code better, faster.  And this leads up to something that Benjamin Mako Hill, who's a great free software theorist and practitioner,  talked about in a keynote at the Libre Planet Conference in 2018, where he says, you know, the end result of this is that the largest companies in the world have software freedom.  Right. If you're Google, your software doesn't lock you in at all. Right.  Your cloud is completely under your own dominion. You can change how it's configured at any moment. It's all yours.  But if you are someone locked in the Google ecosystem, you've got open source. Right.  You can see what the code is that's running on that back end.  You can suggest changes to it, but you don't have software freedom.  If Google wants to make a change, if they want to build flock, not build flock, build topics, not build topics, do something with their cloud, not do something with their cloud, that is entirely their own purview.  You have no freedom. You only have openness.  And that that itself was quite a profound narrowing of the promise of software freedom into software openness, but that we narrow it again in an even worse way.  When we go to open AI, because open AI doesn't even deliver the benefits of openness.  It just delivers the story of openness that can be used to get lawmakers to forbear from treating these companies with the regulation that they really richly deserve about being forced to tell us what inputs went in and how they got them and so on.  And this leads us, I think, well into this next thing about about authorship and copyright and so on.  I think there's an area where Rebecca will probably have some important contributions to make too.

Transcript:  Before we do that, because it is a very interesting, this is a piece that just came out in the Atlantic, Revealed.  All articles should begin with, Revealed, the authors whose pirated books are powering generative AI.  And those authors might have something to say about this.  But let me before I even get to that, I ask everybody this now, because I don't know.  I'm on the fence.  I'll ask you, Rebecca, is AI a gimmick or is it gen is there genuinely something going on?  I mean, on the one hand, you could say it's an existential threat to humanity.  I'm not sure I'm on that side.  On the other hand, you could say it's more of just like a parlor trick or a toy that ultimately we're going to realize.  Yeah, this was just yet another silly thing thrown up by the tech industry.  Where do you stand on that scale?

Start time: 7619.56
End time: 7810.98
Speaker: Rebecca Giblin
Transcript:  Look, it's not an existential threat to humanity for the reasons that the people creating it want us to think that it is.  Like there's very much a bit of like stage magician, like misdirection.  Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain. Yes.  But look, I do think it's capable or it's got potential.  And by the way, when we talk about AI, I want to just say we're talking about predictive statistics in this context.  Yes, that's right.  It's not going to become sentient.  Yeah, exactly.  And it's going to be useful for some things, not at all useful for others, like already transcriptions, like automatic translation.  Some of the students in my classes that don't have that don't have a really strong English proficiency live translate me on their phones, which is really, really cool to watch.  So like there are minutes in meetings like these systems can be way better than the humans that already were taking minutes and meeting.  So look, it's got use cases.  But where I think that the threat really is, is that it's going to be the people who are creating these technologies, the exact same people with the exact same investor mindset that we've had that have been taking over all of these other big corporations to date.  So they're interested in transferring ever more value from labor to capital.  They're going to be using these technologies to make jobs worse.  I don't think we're going to see half of all jobs disappear, but we are going to see greater surveillance.  We're going to see removal of the creativity in jobs and like our flexibility to do them in the ways that we think are best, because if we can de-skilled them and and make it possible for them to do it,  if we can make it possible for kind of anybody to do and modularize them, then we don't have to pay people as much to do it.  We're going to continue to be able to drive down the value of human labor.  I think that those are the real dangers that I'm interested in.  I don't want to live in a world where the humans do all the drudge work, so the machines are free to make the art.  I want to be living in a world where we're able to kind of celebrate rising unemployment and that that's because we're using the machines to do the drudge work.  I think that's freeing us up to do that higher level sort of thinking and creativity that the early industrial age philosophers told us was what was going to come.  I don't think I would agree with either of those.  That was a false dichotomy you gave me, but somewhere in the middle, we need to be really thinking about what kind of world we want to live in and what is I think really what I'm excited about with this sudden popularization of generative AI technology.  I think humans are really, really bad at responding to crises until like not one minute to midnight, but like one second to midnight.  And I think that this is going to precipitate that the labor disruption is going to come is going to precipitate some really important questions.  And for us to really ask what is due to us as humans as distinct to what is due to machines.  And from there, it's only the shortest possible route from asking the question and to what is due to corporations.  What kind of life do we want to have and are we doing it right now?

Transcript:  That's a really great recontextualization of all of this.  IBM surveyed CEOs, 40% of according to the CEOs, 40% of workers in the next three years will need new job training due to AI.  Now, IBM was one of the early AI hype monsters with Watson.  But I don't know is that 40% of workers is a lot.  We're going to use AI and I think we're going to use it appropriately.  We're going to use it to transcribe the podcasts and create show notes that are valuable.  And that's a real simple thing that AI can do quite well.  A human could probably do it too.  But we just we don't have the manpower to do that.

Exactly.  And the reason they're deserving of criticism is that they're going to exterminate the human race when the predictive sentence machine wakes up,  and then comes sentient and turns us all into paper clips.

Transcript:  Yeah, Lee Vincil is great. You should get him on.  He's a very smart tech critic at I forgot what university he's at.  But yeah, he's terrific.  Gosh, no, I can't remember.  And Georgia Tech, that's the one.  And I think that like we've seen versions of this before.  As you said, there was another hype bubble with IBM where the robots were going to come take all of our jobs.  And the story we're all told then is that it was going to come and take all the truck drivers jobs.  Right.  And it was the story when truck driver is the most common job in the Bureau of Labor Statistics and truck driving is easy to automate because you can give them a dedicated lane on the interstate and have them set a following distance and then they'll drive.  So there's a bunch of problems with this story.  The first one is that that's just a train.  Right.  And like in the same way that ride share weirdos just like reinvent the bus over and over again.  Oh, it's like ride share.  Yeah, it's like ride share.  But we'll come and pick up several people and then we'll drop them off and we'll have a central depot to make things more efficient.  It's like, great. You invented the city bus, but we're small banks.  Yeah, really small bus city bus driven by unlicensed person.  Excellent.  That's that's what this city needed.  And they built the city on unlicensed drivers.  So that was the first problem.  The second problem is that the most common job in America is not long haul truck driver.  Right.  The BLS statistic or the category for heavy goods vehicle operator incorporates everyone who drives a thing that's like a big commercial vehicle.  Right.  That's the UPS drivers.  It's the truck drivers.  It's the other kinds of couriers and delivery vans and moving vans.  So like automating a moving van does not put the important workers out of out of work.  Right. The hard part of the moving van is not the driving.  Yes.  It's like packing and the unpacking and the carrying.  And like a UPS van that drives itself needs exactly the same number of skilled humans in the van because the UPS van does not have a catapult that fires packages through your window.  Right. Like there is a human.  Hey, that's a good idea.

Speaker: Cory Doctorow
Transcript:  And Rebecca lives like on a very high floor.  I can really see the catapult coming in handy.  You run out of windows pretty fast, though.  But yeah, I mean, it's not like it is a like literally you've just eliminated zero jobs.  Right.  Right.  Even if you can get all the UPS vans to drive themselves, which you can't because a UPS van driving itself is nowhere near the same thing as a bunch of 16 wheelers with dedicated lane on the interstate.  And so, you know, I think that doesn't mean that our bosses won't try and use that to discipline the workforce to use as an excuse to cut our wages, to threaten us, to make us feel precarious.  And I also think that our bosses have proved over and over again.  Indeed, since the Industrial Revolution, they are happy to replace skilled laborers who make good things with machines that make substandard things.  And, you know, you don't have to look any further than the progress of what happens when you call a company switchboard, where it used to be that you spoke to a human who could try to solve your problem.  And then you spoke to a human who was a subcontractor in the Pacific Rim who could only read out of a three ring binder and not solve your problem.  And then they dispensed even with that person who was really just an abuse sponge right there to absorb your anger.  And then you'd hang up in frustration.  They replace that person with an interactive voice response system whose only job is to get you to say 17.  No, 17. No, 17. No, 17. Operator. Representative. Representative. Operator.  Right. Like our bosses would happily replace us with that robot and have them write all of our movies from now on.  Right. Yes.  And so workers should be worried about it.  But we don't have to like stipulate to the claims of the tech firms themselves that they have designed the thing that's better at writing fiction than we are because you can give it a prompt that looks a lot like a bad studio executive note.  Like, you know, make me ET, but make the hero a dog and set it in the 19th century and give me a steamy sex scene in the second act and a gunfight in the third act.  And like that, the robot will just do it and not even roll its eyes at you the way a writer would if you went and gave them that note.  And, you know, it really just like it really you can see why they love it.  Right. You can see why studio execs love it because like they are the living embodiment of that joke where the writer and the executive are dying of thirst in the desert.  And they come across an oasis and the writer drops to their knees and thanks the fates for rescuing them from from thirst and then looks up and the studio executive is pissing in the oasis.  And the writer says, what are you doing? And the studio executive says, don't worry. I'm just making it better.  And, you know, like executives love the idea of replacing humans with robots that just take their bad ideas and turn them into scripts.  It doesn't mean that they would get good scripts. Right.  And like we know that and we know that because we know what it looks like when you hire scabs to write scripts during strikes and they're not good scripts.  So, you know, I think that that we should be worried about it, but not for the reasons that Sam Altman says we should be worried about it.

Yeah, highly, highly recommend this for anybody.  He he refers to historian David C. Brock.  He calls them not critical, but wish, wishful worries, worrying about things that would be nice to have in contrast to the actual agonies of the present.

Like, why should I be worried about starving people today when there are 10 to the 53 hypothetical angry virtual intelligences 10,000 years in the future?  Yeah.  Any utility I can deliver to them multiplied by 10 to the 53 is more utility than we would ever realize for the, you know, paltry seven billion, eight billion people alive today.  Because like any number that you make up that you multiply by an even larger number that you make up can be a very large number indeed.  And if that's your basis for prioritizing your concerns, there's always a reason not to deal with the stuff that matters.

Transcript:  The article from Alex Reisner in the Atlantic this week turns out that and we knew I think we kind of knew this is certainly Sarah Silverman is suing open AI because she said clearly it's it's ingested my.  Book bedwetter because it regurgitates it to me and a loss that that's the lawsuit from Sarah Silverman Richard Cadry and Christopher Golden.  Apparently turns out it's more than that.  It's Stephen King's 80 Smith and Michael Pollan.  Thousands of writers with copyrighted works are being used to train these AIs.  But you know what?  A judge has just ruled on Friday.  Supporting the finding from the US Copyright Office that AI created art is not copyrightable so it can ingest copyrighted material and create content that anybody can use.  Leo, can I just make a distinction there?

Speaker: Rebecca Giblin
Transcript:  Because we've got a difference between what's happening on the sorry just to put my like super wonky copyright on.  We've got what's happening at the input stage and what's happening at the output stage.  So at the input stage, they're training these systems on all of this copyrighted material and then that raises particular questions about whether that might infringe that material.  But then there's the output stage.  You've you've put in the prompt.  You've had an image sped out or a bit of text.  The output stage.  They're saying that that's not copyrightable as of itself.  But that doesn't mean that what happens at the input stage doesn't raise its own problem.  Oh, yeah.  And so problems are both there.  Yeah.  So I think that nobody's saying that there's no infringement on that side.  And certainly you see really different licensing attitudes.  So Adobe, for example, when it created its new Firefly AI powered tool, it made sure all of that was licensed.  All of the training data was licensed.  So that and that raised its own problems because not all of the artists who provided the stock images knew that it was going to be copyrighted.  But it was in the fine print.  And so Adobe's like, hey, guess what?  You've got nothing to complain about.  And by the way, we're going to figure out some way of paying you for this.  But there's other ones like Mid Journey where they didn't license this and they've just ingested everything.  And they're just like, well, we couldn't because how do you do that on massive scale?  That's going to take years to play out.  And it's the same thing with the with the language models.  That's the ones that are being trained on Stephen King and and so on.  But what's going to take?  It's going to take absolutely years, maybe a decade or longer to figure out the extent to which that's infringing and what the consequences of that are going to be.  But in the meantime, these technologies might become super entrenched and these companies become enormously wealthy and powerful and have kind of walled off a bunch of human knowledge as well.  So we've got to be really thinking very critically about what we're going to do about that and what we're going to do about it quickly before they do get too entrenched.  I think. And this is another area where open AI is not open because while they say they're open, they will not tell you where they got their training data from.

Transcript:  Reisner analyzed a data set used by Meta to train llama.  It's large language model.  And he says he found one hundred seventy thousand books in the training data.  Yes, Silverman's. Yes, Pollan's.  Crack our James Patterson, Stephen King.  And what's interesting is a lot of this actually came from pirate sources because, you know, you can't this material is not in general, unlike Cory's books is not in general online.  So they were obviously scanning pirate sources, I guess.  So, yeah, I want to get wonky here, too, and say, like, I think that there is there there is a whole bunch of different stuff going on all at once.

Start time: 8532.02
End time: 8848.00
Speaker: Cory Doctorow
Transcript:  So the first question that we need to ask is, is making a temporary copy of a work and then subjecting it to mathematical analysis and then embodying that mathematical analysis in a model.  Are any of those steps infringing?  And in the US, at least, it's pretty clear that they're not.  And it's not an area of real controversy among copyright scholars that, like, make a copy of a work.  It's not an area of real controversy among copyright scholars that, like making a temporary copy of a work in order to do some kind of mechanical analysis on it is not an infringement.  There's a bunch of settled law about this.  And if it turned out to be, it would overturn a lot of stuff that we do.  The amount of work that remains in the model, at least in the main is quite small.  There is this problem with Silverman's work being memorized by a model.  But we could like Silverman wouldn't be happy if they just tweak the model so it didn't memorize her work.  She's angry about the training.  And so, you know, when you look at like mid journey, it ingests a whole image and it retains a single byte.  So, you know, a megabyte image and you retain one byte, you've retained a million to the image.  Again, this is like very clearly like not what we think of when we think of copyright infringement.  Now, the model can produce infringing works, but that would generally be the problem of the model user, not the model's manufacturer.  We generally, you know, there's that law is a little muddy after Grokster, but generally if your tool is capable of making non infringing works as well as infringing works,  that's the problem.  The infringing works are the problems of the people who are infringed, not the problem of the people who make the tool.  That was the decision that came out of the VCR, right?  If you can sustain a substantial non infringing use, you're lawful.  And so this raises this question of like this stuff is probably not copyright infringement or at the very least to make a copyright infringement in a case is a copyright infringement.  In a case is a real long shot.  What is what is it that these lawyers are doing when they round up these people?  And I should say Kadri is like a dear friend of mine.  I don't know Silverman, but I really admire her work.  And what have they been told by these lawyers and what are these lawyers telling themselves when they create these cases?  And my guess is that the lawyers are making a calculus that the training data itself was acquired in such unsavory and potentially ways that these companies just don't want to go through discovery.  And they are wash in money, tens of billions of dollars, and they will just write a check for hundreds of millions of dollars to make the discovery.  And just like Rupert Murdoch gave Dominion 400 million dollars, so you wouldn't have to go through discovery.  And and that's fine.  Like it's OK with me if plaintiff side lawyers want to take like 10 figures out of the you know, overinflated AI economy and hand it to artists.  That's great. But I worry that if we convince artists that training works is or should or training a model is or should be an infringement that on the one hand, we're going to create a lot of collateral damage.  Like that would basically be the end of the entire field of computational linguistics, which is a really important field that some of the best critics actually come out of.  So Emily Bender, for example, co-wrote the Stochastic Parrots paper as a computational linguist.  And on the other hand, I don't think it's going to help artists because, you know, as Rebecca just described, it's not hard to acquire licenses to all the works needed to train a model to put the artists out of work.  For one thing, you can just alter the contract that you present to all of your artists to say, hey, if you want to work for us, you have to assign that new right that you just you just got Congress to give you to control model training.  And now we have that right. Academics don't, independents don't, but we do.  We can make the model so we have means, motive and opportunity to fire your ass and replace you with a shell script.  And like this raises this very important question.  If you care about artists livelihood is Rebecca and I do.  We wrote a whole book about it, Chokepoint Capitalism.  What do we do? And I think that, you know, this US Copyright Office and DC Circuit decision that says that works made by AIs aren't entitled to a copyright, their public domain, is very important.  I think that it will act as a major discouragement to firms to firing humans and replacing them with software because as much as these guys are like insatiably horny for firing all of us, they love copyright even more.  In fact, it's the only thing they love more than firing workers is getting more copyright.  And if you say to them, your choice is pay writers or everything you make is in the public domain and anyone can copy it and reproduce it.  They're just going to pay writers.  There are other things we can do like have a picket line.  And, you know, I'm speaking to you from Burbank, California, and I am walking those picket lines at Universal Disney.  Yeah. Are you in the WGA?  No, I'm in the animator scale, but I go out in solidarity strike.  Our mayor, Constantine Anthony, who's now he's going to run for county commissioner and he's a SAG AFTRA member himself.  And he goes out and pickets as well.  You know, it's a union town and like they're demonstrating that if artists think of themselves as like LLCs with MFAs who are, you know, in a business to business  negotiation with big companies, they just lose every time.  But if artists think of themselves as workers who get our power from collective action, then that's how we win.

Speaker: Rebecca Giblin
Transcript:  Yeah. And that's what I'd really like to see.  I want us to see I want us to be thinking about what the problem actually is and what kind of solution that we need.  If what we're interested in is getting artists paid and ensuring that people can live with economic dignity from doing creative work, right?  Then that's a different kind of answer to are we interested in shareholders of these existing big companies earning more money?  Right. And I think a lot of these copyright approaches to this solution are just aimed at doing a better job of achieving the latter and not doing anything to fix the former.  And so what I really want us to be thinking about and that ties back into when I was saying what's due to us as humans, I don't think we should be thinking about more copyright rights,  which is like always been alienable, transferable and extracted the moment that it accrues.  I want us to be thinking about maybe rights to self.  You know, the fact that that these technologies can now make make make your voice say things that you never said and make your body do things that you never consented to.  Those are intensely personal things.  We can understand that they shouldn't be transferable.  I think as well that we can start thinking about certain kinds of creative work as being really personal as well.  And we should start thinking about rights that people can't transfer and that do get kept for humans rather than go to corporations or have them forbid go to machines.
