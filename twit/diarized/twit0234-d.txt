And honestly, that's my fault, not the fault of the panelists.  We've got a great panel today, even though it's Super Sunday.  Joining us right now from New York, Mr. Baratunde Thurston.  Hey, Baratunde.  Brooklyn, Brooklyn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's not New York?  It's Brooklyn.  It's part of New York, but it's Brooklyn.  But I'm happy to be here.  I'm not trying to waste a whole bunch of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  From the borough of Brooklyn, ladies and gentlemen, Baratunde Thurston.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Planet, technically, but who's kitchen?  Planet of Brooklyn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The planet, its own planet.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I'm glad we got that straight, because I'd hate to get that wrong.  I'm here to educate.  Also here for the first time, we're really glad to have her, Kara Swisher of All Things  Digital, AllThingsD.com, Boomtown columnist, and one of the most astute observers of technology  out there.  So good to have you, finally, Kara.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thanks for having me.  I'm sorry I haven't been on at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm trying and trying, but that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, I've got dogs and children, so that's sort of my Sunday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't blame you.  Yeah.  In fact, you're probably grateful to get away from them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Indeed, I'm thrilled to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Also here, speaking of dogs and children, dogs and Englishmen, Will Harris.  What is it?  What is it they say?  Mad dogs and Englishmen.  Mad dogs and Englishmen.  Will Harris from Channel Flip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't have dogs or children, thankfully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is a show we had to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can have one of mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How old are your kids, Kara?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Four and seven.  Oh, they're little.  And one is actually here with two dogs, too.  So yes, they're little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Indeed.  You know, we have teenagers now, and we avoided the dogs until we got the kids to stop peeing  on the furniture.  I figured once they...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I cage trained my children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, very smart.  Do you use a newspaper trick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, cage training works.  Just cage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The cop is going to show up at your home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Shaking his head.  About five minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If they were that good, that would be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This panel is unique because we had to find a panel that cared not a whit about...  There's some big game going on, I don't know, in New Orleans.  It's in New Orleans, right?  No, it's in Miami.  It's with New Orleans.  We have no idea.  It's the Baltimore Colts.  No, wait a minute.  The Indianapolis.  People are going...  You're such a geek.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People are going crazy right now.  Baltimore Rabbits versus the...  It's the Indianapolis Colts.  Baltimore Rabbits versus the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Johnny United is in his Baltimore Colts against the New Orleans Saints.  Who dat?  Who dat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's all I know.  That's all I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would actually love the Super Bowl if it were just all the football scenes from Friday  Night Lights strung together.  That's good.  Victory for the Dylan Panthers.  That would be a great game to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, I think even you, Will, would appreciate American football if you were lived in Texas  and you saw Texas high school football.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think so, probably.  It has a very unique part in your culture, which nobody outside of America can quite  appreciate.  Oh, come on.  Maybe Britain and cricket.  Maybe it's kind of the same thing.  Maybe America cares about cricket, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or soccer hooligans.  Didn't Britain invent soccer hooliganism?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's getting a little bit drogatory now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they did perfect it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There you go.  Perfected is the word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You meant hooligan in a good way.  In a good way?  What's wrong with that?  Yeah.  So, Baratunde does have to go before the game begins.  Okay.  But for an odd reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll be live tweeting this cultural event.  I like to take moments where everybody comes together and mess with them.  So I don't know much about football.  I picked Alabama in this bowl game because I just like the state of Alabama over Texas.  It had nothing to do with the players or the stats.  So I'll be tweeting about the commercials and about very uninformed sports analysis  coming from the top of my head.  It'll be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, I think this is, this was the idea of Luis Oliveira who runs, is my engineer  for the radio show.  He said this is upside down TiVo day is what this is.  This is the day you DVR the game so you can skip the programming and go right to the commercials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's true.  They're good commercials.  They're up on all the websites.  They have them all up, all the commercials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you remember?  I haven't looked at them yet.  I'm surprised.  They're not up yet, are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some of them are.  I think they're previewing some of them on Yahoo.  Yahoo usually has the best collection of them typically, but they're all over the place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Yahoo does it.  YouTube does it.  Hulu does it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they all do it.  It's funny.  Don't you remember way back when that, in fact, this was well before YouTube.  There was a site and I can't remember the name of the site that just was ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I know exactly what you're talking about.  Ad critic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ad critic.  Thank you.  It's been driving me crazy all day.  And then this is the funniest thing.  This is what really dates it.  The advertisers said you have to pull the ads down.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.  What are you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We don't want people to see the ads.  Those are our ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they were mocking them though, more than anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well originally ad critic was for ad agencies and artistic directors to say what's wrong  with this ad or so forth.  But most of the time I went there, I just wanted to watch the ad.  I wasn't reading the critique.  How crazy is that for Budweiser to say, well whatever you do, we have the copyright to  the Bud ad.  You may not air it in an unapproved forum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Accidentally buy some Budweiser as a result.  That would be an accident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You say it sounds crazy, Leo, but how many times do we see the exact same thing or at  least a very similar thing these days?  Something that's designed to be out there and enjoyed by everybody where someone pulls  it down and says, you're not enjoying it in the exact way that I kind of meant you to  enjoy it.  So just ditch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hulu.  NBC and Fox.  The reason I bring it up is because it just shows you that what is now in hindsight, 10  years later, obviously foolish, persists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well they put them back.  They sometimes release them when they want to.  The Susan Boyle stuff was interesting.  It kept coming down and being pulled off and coming down.  I don't think they have a lot of control over it, but they're certainly trying to control  it.  The Conan stuff has been interesting.  There's all this debate over whether they can put up these Conan things that were sort  of insulting to NBC or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is there a fair use argument that it's somehow editorial?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, probably not.  I mean just a tiny clips of it.  People are putting up the whole four or five minute thing.  So no, not four or five minutes.  Probably one line would be all right, but not four or five minutes.  That's kind of crossing the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And yet, let's face it, Saturday Night Live was dying on the vine until people started  putting up clips on YouTube.  And of course, immediately NBC says, oh, you can't do that, but it's good for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, some of it is.  I mean, I think all the media comes, they're probably going to try to pull back fair use  now.  It's a debate going on between News Corp, which owns our site actually.  I don't agree with them on this.  I think they're fighting, going to try to fight and restrict fair use even more in their  fight with all the websites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Murdoch wants to put some paywall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they want to actually, they want to do that.  That's fine.  He can do whatever he wants in that.  Strict fair use, that means going to Washington and paying for lobbyists.  And Google will have their own group of lobbyists doing the same thing.  And so that should be an interesting fight this year, what's going to happen to fair  use and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The lobbyist off.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the lawyer off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Murdoch claims that Google is sucking the lifeblood out of journalism.  You guys are free.  Everybody always accuses Google of free riding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Takes one to know one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I mean, I have to say there's one of the mags that I read in the UK is a  man called Broadcast, which is for the kind of TV industry.  If you get a broadcast, any of the top stories, it's behind a paywall, which is, you know,  it's like a few hundred quid a year, I think.  If you go to Google and you type the headline of the story that you want, you can just read  it all on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it'll be interesting.  This year is going to be the big year of content.  Sort of the idea of how much content is worth and what they can keep back and what's available  and how that impacts them.  I think there'll be more and more paywalls.  They're going to try it.  And then we'll see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does the iPad change any of this?  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the sad, I mean, kind of the sad thing, possibly, or, you know, at least  the kind of insufferable thing was that all these old media companies that have had their  head in the sand have been going, oh, you know, the web is killing our business and  we've got to find a way to make people pay for everything.  And that actually, if all this kind of stuff about digital subscriptions and the Kindle  and the iPad kind of takes effect, that actually they'll have just sort of ridden out 10 years  of pain to get to a point where they're just selling the same thing, which is 50p for a newspaper  every day, except it's on your iPad rather than on paper.  But that's how, but that's how insufferable it's that if they've actually been right the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  past decade, that's how these companies want it because that's their been their business  model from time immemorial, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Well, no, they of course they like the internet to go away.  I think that's really the first choice.  OK, I remember the first the first decline, I think it's in the 2000 when they had the  dot com bomb.  They all were like, oh, thank goodness, Carol.  So I was like, get ready, my friend.  I mean, it was really that was this sort of attitude like, few that we missed that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that was close.  And I was like, get ready to really die now.  But I think they would like it to go different, but they like to have some modicum of control  over it.  And they're not used to that in the way they've set up their businesses.  And so what will be interesting to see is what happens when they with this iPad.  I think Steve Jobs, who has sort of an enemy of the music industry in a lot of ways because  the pricing fights he's had with them is now the savior of the print industry or the book  industry or whatever, because, you know, Macmillan is pointing to the iPad for fighting Amazon  and the 9.99 book price.  So it should be it's interesting.  I mean, none of unfortunately for the media industry, none of these people are their friends.  I mean, they either Amazon or iPad or Apple because they're going to control these these  distribution devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they do prefer the agency model that Apple uses where they set the price.  Apple takes 30 percent of whatever that price is to Amazon's model, which basically says  Amazon sets the price, tells you how much you're going to get and take it or leave it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we call it for now.  I mean, what if everyone's using an iPad?  What could they do then?  I mean, that's the thing is they're just trading one potential problem for another.  I mean, because if they look at what happened in the music industry, the music industry  has been fighting Apple to raise from ninety nine cents to a dollar twenty nine.  They eventually did it, but there wasn't a lot of options and paid music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they had to make a concession, which was removing DRM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Exactly. So huge concession.  You know, if this thing catches on and we'll see if it does or hopefully there'll be lots  of these, which would be great.  But if this thing catches on and they have, you know, most of the New York Times, for  example, comes over the Wall Street Journal or whoever they're talking to comes over these  things, they're in a they're in a deleveraged position, I would say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I read a great, great blog from Dave McClure, fantastic this week on how sort of the future  of all these companies will be who can build the biggest, most ubiquitous micro payment  system that Google.  Sorry, that Apple is already a long way there with this.  You know, what is it? Eighty million people who have I have credit cards registered in  iTunes, they can aggregate the purchase together.  They charge you once every few days.  So you they pay less money and that the big competitor to that won't be Amazon, in fact,  but will actually probably be Facebook and Facebook's alleged, you know, kind of  micro payment platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Well, they have a lot of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Fake flowers and gifts, the Facebook gift economy.  Well, you can already buy real stuff with Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Money. Yeah. Oh, man, I wish I were in the business of selling bits for real money.  I mean, boy, you know, they make a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't laugh at that. High margin, high margin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You don't have to make anything inane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I got like a cupcake.  It did. I was like, fruit. Screw that.  But I gave you a cupcake.  Whatever I did. They make a lot more money than you think.  Oh, of course they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know who makes money is Mark Pinkus of Zynga.  Yeah. Makes hundreds of millions of dollars a year selling virtual farm

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  implements and chips and whatever.  He has a bunch of games, but I think he probably makes more money in the poker area.  But yes, the farm, whatever the farm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't don't don't.  Don't insult the farm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because of it. Yeah.  Just don't have to click their weights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hunger. We've had our Farmville moment on this show.  Yeah, I gave up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The funniest, the funniest farm building is the Jason Calacanis fraud or whatever.  I did an interview with Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You didn't fall for that, right? You know, I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of course, really, it would we would weigh one hundred and twelve pounds  and cost four million dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was stunned that anybody fell for that.  And I was surprised at how much opprobrium was heaped on Jason  for doing it when it was obviously a joke.  What was your opinion on that, Kara?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did an interview with them and I agree.  I thought, you know, it was so obvious that it was a joke.  And if you read them all together, I mean,  it was ridiculous. He was putting solar panels on it.  He was having three cameras, you know, and the farm animals.  You could throw them from iPad.  Now, that's a feature I want, though.  I know. But really like, oh, take my cow.  You know what I mean? Yeah.  Plus, it was Jason. Please.  Let's just start with let's start with it was Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And yet CNN and others ran it as if it were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, the Wall Street Journal did, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a journal. Indeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oops. Oops.  You know, it was, you know, what it just they should have checked.  They should have. And in fact, none of them called him,  which was amazing. Or Apple, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They may have tried. But well, you're not going to call Apple.  But if you call Jason, the first thing you'd say, I call Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They do. Who answers the phone at Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Someone who's like, I'm sorry, you use the Google phone to call me.  We can't talk to you like that companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You may not say the word the A word or the G word  or the M word when you're speaking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can't even use the letter G in a combination with the letter O.  If you're doing any business with Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do want to talk about this because there is a shooting war  that has just erupted between Apple, Google and Adobe.  This this is this is this is nuclear annihilation here.  We went to the nuclear option and it's only going to get worse.  I want to talk about that in a second.  We've got three great panelists here on Super Bowl Sunday.  We're going to move fast today because Baratunde's got to live tweet  the bowl game.  Baratunde Thurston.  It's great to have you. Baratunde.com.  Kara Schwisher from all things D.Com.  And of course, from Channel Flip.com.  My good buddy, Will Harris.  But today's show and by the way, the smoking light is on.  Smoke them if you got them.  The I have to tell the panelists that so they know they can light up.  We actually had a guy.  I won't name names, but a well-known industry maven.  Who started rolling a joint during the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you know, it's not 420 yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And what country was he in when he was doing it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was in the well, you know, he's in California,  which is, in fact, the nation where marijuana is virtually legal.  Yeah. I mean, only a matter of time.  I suspect this November.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, we don't know what you're talking about.  What are you talking about? What? What? What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When I was in China over the summer and I asked our guide,  tell me about drug use here.  So what are you talking about?  I said we were walking by a head shop that had bongs.  I'm not kidding. In the window.  And I said, well, those things, those are used to smoke marijuana.  She said, I don't know what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Said, OK, you lot love the Chinese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's exactly that's that's what they do when you say  Internet censorship says, no, no, I don't know what you're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Someone I know was at a meeting at one of the big search companies  with with the Chinese officials, and they said, you know, when you call up  Twin Tinaman Square or Tibet, it never no pictures came up.  And the guests, the official there was like, oh, that's the  that's the choice of the search companies.  They wanted that. And they were like, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They feel it best not to offend our cultural sensibilities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they have like something called three T's and an F.  It's Tibet, Taiwan, Tiananmen and Falun Gong.  Falun Gong. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so don't talk about that.  In fact, this show just got banned in China. Thank you very much.  That's OK, because they're not interested in carbonite pro,  our sponsor of the hour, carbonite pro brand new, by the way,  from the folks at carbonite.  You've heard me talk for years about carbonite online backup, a great system  for backing up your data on your computer.  But many people have asked me, what do I do in a business?  I have multiple computers.  In fact, I know people who have individual carbonite accounts for each computer.  There's a better way now. Carbonite pro dot com, the same great carbonite  online backup for PC or Mac.  The service developed to back up your stuff automatically to the Internet.  More than 100000 people use it to back up computers in their offices already.  And we thought maybe we should tell you about the pro version just came out.  Carbonite pro dot com.  You could try it free for 30 days.  And by the way, we always do this with our sponsors.  We really want them to give you the free trial to make sure this is right for you.  And I think anybody who's got a product that they're  willing to stand behind is going to do that.  And that's what's great about it. You can try it.  You can see if it works for you. I can I could tell you you're going to love it.  AES 256 bit encryption before the file even leaves your computer.  You choose the key so only you can unlock it.  One hundred twenty eight bit SSL wallets being transmitted.  It's kind of the belt and suspenders technology there.  And prices for businesses with many computers as low as ten dollars a month.  In fact, it will cost you less for those of you, those 100000 of users in carbonite  in the office now to back up individual computers.  You'll save a lot of money by going the carbonite pro method and a unified dashboard  for all your systems so you can see what's going on.  You can make sure it's happening.  And if there's ever a data loss program and I like this,  each employee can access their own backup files.  You'll be notified, of course, as the administrator, but individual employees can,  you know, let's face it, people throw stuff away by accident.  They don't have to be embarrassed and go to you and say,  you know, that report, my TPS report, I threw that out.  They can just get it back. Carbonite pro dot com.  Try it free for 30 days. It is awesome.  Kara Swisher, Will Harris, Baratunde Thurston, we're talking about  the latest tech world stories.  Google supposedly will be watching tonight on the Super Bowl.  It's got a got a third quarter ad.  Speaking of credulous journalists,  John Battelle on his search blog posted a ad from YouTube, a Google ad  that was, I mean, something that's never going to run in the Super Bowl.  It was an ad for France, for one thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you seen it?  You know, they had a bunch of ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing. These were ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They ran on Hulu like a year and a half ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we put them up, I don't know, November.  You know, it wasn't a year ago.  They did a bunch for Chrome and then a bunch for search.  They had a whole bunch of search ads.  Exactly. Yeah.  You know, you they keep clicking and they tell a story of romance or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. French romance, which, you know, is going to go over well  with those bee feeders watch Super Bowl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The best one was the Tiger Woods one.  And it shows kind of what Tiger should be searching.  It shows the evolution of his downfall through search.  You're kidding.  It's like, how do you repair the grill on your SUV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. It's on the front page of Gorka.  It's really funny.  Are you?  I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did the onion do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, the onions do not do that.  It sounds like an onion ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, in any event, you know, in Gadget and a number of other blogs  picked up John Battelle's posting, oh, this will be the third quarter ad.  Of course not. This is an old ad.  Yeah.  The best Google commercial you're never going to see.  This is from Gawker.  Yeah, it's awesome.  Slate V. Oh, this isn't this is not an official one.  It takes off on the ads that  Google did run, the official ads that Google did run.  Yeah, it's like a great pair.  Oh, we got to watch it. I'm sorry.  This is from Slate.  I'll have to talk you through it because it's all music.  How to hide facial lacerations.  Google search.  Band-aid.  Escalade grill work.  This is mean.  Oh, this is so mean.  How to get blood stains out of clothing.  Out of a green jacket.  See, this is this is the style, though, of the ad.  Oh, dear. Oh, dear.  Now he's searching for the girlfriend.  Derek Jeter. Oh, painful.  Derek Jeter. Oh, no. OK, I'm stopping right there.  This is this is gone too far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The title of the video is called Is Tiger Feeling Lucky Today?  I'm feeling like later in the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, my goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They also where we supposed to get his wife a diamond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How much for a Zales diamond ring?  How much for the entire Zales company?  He's getting Mark Sanford's apology.  That's a good that's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That didn't work.  Did you see her?  She's all over the web and everywhere with her new book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, really? The tell all Jenny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jenny. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not not not the girlfriend from the block.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, the wife, the wife, the wife.  Really? This is Mrs.  Stanford. Yeah, she's quite a strong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mrs. Stanford. Mrs.  Stanford, not not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's like back in Brazil.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not this week in affairs, but sometimes we just get sucked  into these things.  Anytime I talk about that would be a good show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll invite me on.  You know all the dish.  You know, Walt Mossberg and I are huge celebrity gossip site fans.  We're just crazy about them.  I have to say it's our share and one of our many things in common.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now I find that fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like I'm superficial.  That's our favorite one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you got a great scoop.  You got a great superficial is better than Perez, right?  I'm superficial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm an idiot.  Now, please.  Sorry, Perez, but you are.  But superficial, a guy who writes it.  I'm trying to meet him.  He's he's hysterically funny writer and he is, you know,  he's hysterically funny and there's bikini shots all day long.  So pretty much all it takes for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I like the title.  I'm the superficial because you're ugly.  Is that it? Yeah, exactly.  Oh, bikini shot and half the way reveals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I'm reading it for the text.  Let me just tell you. Of course you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Of course you are.  Not the bikini. No, no, of course.  The articles. It's the articles.  It really is.  That's why I'm looking forward to the Kindle version of Playboy magazine,  because it just gets all that, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that even really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the black and white renditions will be spot on.  It's all those 16 scales of gray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even more artistic in black and white.  Why even put the pictures in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And we've degenerated just because of me.  Sorry, let's move on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I'm Kara. I'm going to thank you because I can go way low.  If it weren't for you, I would never have found out about it.  I'm superficial. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's here's here's a segue from from Playboy on Kindle back to Apple  and Google's fight over this application for approval.  So for those who don't know, there's a guy who has I don't remember  the name of his game. It's an SAT.  It's an SAT flash card.  Yeah, it's a flash card program.  Help you prepare for studies.  And it did really well in an Android developer challenge.  So he wanted to list that in the meta information about the app  as far as some marketing to say, hey, it did really well over here.  So you should trust this app more than apps that didn't do really well over there.  May I do a dramatic reading?  Please. Apple kindly responded as follows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'd like to do a dramatic reading of the Apple response.  During our review of your application,  we found that your application contains inappropriate or irrelevant  program information in the application description and or release notes section.  While we hasten to say your application has not been actually, you know,  I'm not reading it right. It should be more like you're reading like Masterpiece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why we would like to say that your application has not been rejected.  That's better. It would be appropriate to remove the words finalist  Google's Android developers challenge from the application description.  Please log in to iTunes Connect to make appropriate changes  to avoid an interruption in the availability of your game.  This is like heavy handed to be interrupted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We would hate for that.  So first of all, screw you, Apple, very loudly and with a hashtag.  Yeah. Second of all, this, you know, this capricious, like inconsistent process.  It's so opaque. It's it doesn't scale.  And ultimately, it hurts the world of ideas and it hurts innovation  because you're blocked.  It's down to subjective things about fonts and specific words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They've blocked applications for for an ugly icon because the icon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's normal for Apple. I'm sorry.  I mean, you know, he's he's obsessed with fonts and look.  I mean, unfortunately, it is his world and he and you just live in it.  Now, I have to say, I like it, but that's the way it is there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, this one is not because this one is clearly a response  to Google, which responded to Apple.  So I think this started two days after the iPod  iPad announcement when Steve Jobs held an all hands meeting and said.  Google's slogan, we're not evil, is bull.  I mean, I mean, you can't get this is aggressive.  He also said, by the way, Adobe is a lazy and stupid.  This means war.  Yeah, it's a declaration of war.  So what does Google do?  Google immediately, they were holding off on multi-touch in the Nexus one  pushes out an update within days to the Nexus one that puts multi-touch back into it, saying, OK,  you know, we were going to be nice.  We weren't going to challenge your patent.  Go ahead, Apple sue me.  So I think that this Apple Android thing is completely a response back.  We're in a shooting war, don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's it's fun to watch.  And I think what's interesting is, you know,  Jonathan Zittrain wrote this great book, The Future of the Internet and How to Stop It,  where he talked about the risk of tethered devices and even marketplaces  that are tied to single companies that can influence the types of ideas and applications  we have access to. It's a great read.  I don't get any percentage for saying that.  It's just a good, thoughtful book.  I think what's interesting here is Apple has such control.  They've been super successful.  They're really pretty.  And we talked about this before.  Oppression is often beautiful and very aesthetically pleasing.  But it is a form of a mild form of injustice and oppression.  And what I'm hoping is a more competition from Google is better for us.  Right. It's going to force Apple to do more.  But even this whole concept of a gated community of apps that requires  ultimately a person to sit behind a desk like an old school operator  with cables to connect point A to point B is foolish.  It's 2010. We're in the 21st century, for goodness sake.  There are billions of web pages and billions of apps to follow.  And that just doesn't it's not going to fly.  So what it's forcing developers to do is to think about, you know,  do I want to enter a business with such a high level of unpredictability  where I have to create a whole app before I find out that they're going to say no.  And it's pushing them to look at other alternatives.  So that might be wishful thinking.  I don't know if they are.  The Google Voice app is a mild example of this because there is no Apple version  because Apple said no.  But so they just made a web app for it. Google.  And the web app. Yeah.  Google and the web app is super functional.  You don't need to go through an app store.  You just point your browser and you use this crazy thing called the internet,  which was designed to deliver goods and services and it was a workaround.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a workaround to what Apple is doing.  I mean, on one side, you could say, well, they do have the most successful device,  smartphone device around.  And it's been years before anyone's really competed with it.  And even still, you know, as as nice as the new Google phone is,  it's still not quite a competitor yet to the iPhone yet.  That doesn't mean it's not going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's only sold 80,000.  But I have to say, as far as I'm concerned, it's better than that's what I use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And well, everyone has a different opinion.  I'm just saying it's not a killer.  It's not an iPhone killer is what people are looking.  Nothing is an iPhone killer.  And it's still, you know, it's been years now.  People haven't competed with this phone yet, and they should.  And they certainly should.  But I think the issue is, will Apple get into the same situation  where it was in with the Microsoft,  with Microsoft years ago with everyone?  Apple will be more of the precious, precious, smaller one  versus the the big, wide mass market Microsoft within the computing space.  The same thing happened before.  They did a lot of gating.  They did a lot of we're only developing on our thing.  You can't have more than this kind of computer.  We're designing everything from soup to nuts.  And the question is, will will that matter or will they will they respond  and and maybe avoid that for the for the habit to have the second time?  Because you've got this massive lead right now.  Well, and they've struck this really good evil genius balance

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  between open and closed, much more open than they were in the past,  but closed enough to still play the a-hole card and invite  screw you, Apple hashtags to fly, which they are on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So everybody on some levels and some levels, this guy doesn't care.  I mean, he's creating what he wants to create.  And so, you know, they're massively profitable now  and doing very well with a lot of their stuff.  So and their stock, of course, which can go up and down, of course.  But they certainly are massively profitable with what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's why a lot of developers are still in the Apple store.  I mean, they just follow the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We made ours. It was no choice.  We did the iPhone first because that's what everybody's using.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's the heartbreaking.  What you just said is so heartbreaking.  And my heart was like broken.  It's just human.  You know, this guy, he had to pull the word Android out of his apps description.  And that horrible piece, the Apple gods.  Like, that's absurd. Yeah.  You know, it's not right.  And that's what just bothers me.  I know it's not business wise.  He's probably doing great.  But it's just a sad statement to the level of power Apple has  and the flippant ways in which it abuses that power.  Which again, this is not new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is his entire history is what he's done.  And, you know, I'll tell you, his him being sick, probably and surviving it,  it probably is probably strength in his like, you know what?  I'm going to do what I want. This is my vision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It sure seems like that.  I mean, he was I've never heard him so outspoken is that this all hands meet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he's like, I don't care.  You know, I beat cat and I beat liver cancer.  Right. So what can Eric Schmidt do to me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I would love to see all our war between Apple and people.  Let's just bring it. It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is, you know, and I could.  And by the way, throw Amazon into the mix because they're at war  with with with Google right now.  In fact, I thought it was very it was a huge mistake.  Jeff Bezos made a very rare tactical blunder when he pulled when he yanked  McMillan's books because he was forced.  Well, he but then he was forced almost immediately to back down.  And that's the opening that has shed and every other publisher.  There's only five big publishers.  Yeah, they're going, oh, the guy, this guy's doesn't.  Powder's wet. Let's let's go.  And so everybody's going to go to the iPad and go ahead.  Go ahead, Will. You haven't said anything in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, yeah.  I mean, that was Jeff Bezos is real kind of,  you know, staring down the barrel of the gun and gun and blinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And he's and he this is rare jobs blinking.  No jobs. Jobs will go down in flames before you'll blame.  Absolutely.  They'll be beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I want to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like Amazon basically retaliated against McMillan by pulling not only all their  e-books, but all books for a time, right, from their entire online.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  So I want Google to do the same to Apple.  Like you want to play this game, Apple?  We will erase you from the Internet like you've done now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kara, don't they have to worry about the Department of Justice or somebody kind of  Apple? Anybody?  You can't start doing all of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, Google probably is the one in that crosshairs of the  Justice Department at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Apple's not Apple's not a monopoly, but yes, they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's just at least people that are not being smugness  have have the backbone of like a jello.  So they're going to they're going to they're going to do what the case  they're going to win. And I know that's going to be a tougher case than the Google case.  And the Google case eventually is something they're considering.  Various things is going to be tough, too.  So they're going to have to pick the one they're going to not look like idiots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The good thing, at least from the point of view of users, is there is a clearer  and clearer choice between open and proprietary, although there is certainly  some proprietary stuff in Android and Google has not always been pure goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I'm not sure it's always that clear cut.  I mean, although we do think of Google as being sort of very open,  I think I think they're less open and more looking to scale efficiently.  I think what always strikes me, my personal anecdote,  the difference between Apple and Google is that when Apple's looking to scale  something like the app store, it scales it by just having hundreds of people  sitting in a room approving apps really, really, really quickly.  And that getting it right and making sure that every single app  meets sort of all their approval processes down to, you know,  the text that goes along with it is the most important thing for them.  It's getting that quality of experience.  If you look at someone like Google, we've had a personal experience with YouTube  where there's you know, you can get licenses to sell your own ads  against YouTube videos.  You're talking about channel flip, your business.  Yeah, and YouTube has rolled it out to maybe like two people in the UK.  And the reason they haven't rolled out to more is because they can't  scale it without machines. They haven't built the technology yet.  And so rather than scale up and just throw people out the problem,  they would rather do it in an efficient manner.  And that's no less open or closed than anything that Apple has in the ecosystem.  It's just they want to scale it using technology, not using people.  And I think that's what Google is doing with, you know, looking at Android as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You also have to think about all these companies.  You'd like to have these.  You don't have to. We turn everything to a ridiculous horse race  that they're once against the other.  You know, Google's all over Apple Maps.  It did not come off the iPad in this iteration, at least the launch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although Steve didn't really mention Google when he said, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He did. It was at the launch. They showed it.  They showed the map. I saw the word Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I saw the word Google. He said our maps.  He was very clear.  Say our. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But this is, of course, with technology, people like parse over ridiculously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, that's my job. What are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's still in there. Maps are still in there.  And they're very. I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He didn't pull it.  Although what about this rumor that they want to replace Google with Bing?  I mean, that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They could. That, of course, rumor. Thank you.  You need to actually report a story out and find out if it's actually true  before you write it. That's just so nobody's confirmed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is another one of those tech magic tech crunch stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I mean, I think that putting them one against the other  is just typical of us as reporters to do that.  The fact of the matter is, you know, I used to go.  I used to send a friend into like a Best Buy and they and, you know,  people come up to you and I turned to the person.  I said, this person is not your friend.  How friendly they are.  And I tried to get I said, this is not your friend.  They don't want to help you.  They want to sell whatever stupid device they want to sell today.  And so none of these companies are your friend.  They want to do it's, you know, these are not your friends.  They want to do whatever.  In fact, they have a fiduciary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're all publicly held, publicly traded.  They have a fiduciary responsibility to their stakeholders to maximize profits.  Period. The difference. Period.  And you don't have to say more, except that the difference is in the business model.  And Google even pointed this out in a recent blog post.  They said, however, our business model, we succeed when you use the web more.  And so openness is almost built into Google's business model,  because all they really care about, they don't they don't so much care  that you use Chrome versus Safari versus Firefox.  At least I hope today, today, they care that you use the web more.  And the point of Chrome is to give you a better experience.  But all they care about is that you surf the web because they're going to win  no matter what. Whereas Apple wins when you use Apple products and only Apple products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the fact of the matter is Google is 70 some.  Listen, I mean, let me just make disclosure.  I live with a Google executive and I'm frightened of the company.  You know what I mean? It's just like, you know, they have 70 some percent  of the market share in search and you have what, 90 some in Europe.  I don't know. What is it?  It's some ridiculous amount in Europe.  And most countries, they have these these massive things.  They can do whatever they want.  And so whether or not they do or not, or whether it's in their interest to be  that way, there's still this massively powerful company.  And it's not who runs it today. It's who runs it in 10 years.  I mean, if they decide all of a sudden in their algorithm that everything  that has pink in it is what we're going to, you know, it's just, it's just  no, you're right. It's a situation.  It's a situation where they I think they don't accept the fact  that they have such power over the Internet and they think they're benign.  And whether they're benign or not depends on who's running the company at the time  and what they're what they're what's going on or anything else.  So I think more competition against your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you're exactly right.  I think Apple in in, you know, maybe a decade's time when when Steve is perhaps  not the person at the top running it, it's going to be a very, very different company  from from where it is now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Google, maybe I should point out at this point, the The New York Times editorial  that came out on Thursday from former Microsoft executive Dick Brass,  who was the guy who ran the tablet division at Microsoft,  really hanging out some dirty laundry at Microsoft saying, well, you know,  we create a clear type that we were told by a Microsoft executive  that they'd only roll it out if he could have the employees  and the technology in his division.  The office guy said clear type makes me sick.  It'll never appear in office over my dead body and on and on.  But the point that Dick Brass made was, and I think probably a good point,  that Microsoft is essentially a dysfunctional company.  And I wonder if that's just I mean, look, it's almost like a business cycle.  Look what happened to IBM dominant. Yeah.  Over time becomes less dominant.  It doesn't go away. Microsoft never going away.  They made six billion dollars last quarter, but  they're not in this whole conversation.  They're not a player.  They're kind of becoming relevant.  And I wonder if in ten years we'll be saying the same thing about Apple  or the same thing about Google. I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think what's really interesting is that nobody has the ability right now  to kill anybody else off.  If you look at, you know, Google's market cap is what it was.  I just quit Google is ironically, I Googled it.  Is about one hundred and sixty eight billion.  Wow. Apples at one hundred and seventy seven billion.  Neither of them has got enough cash to make a dent in the shares of the other.  So so they're kind of locked in.  But you would have said the same thing about Microsoft ten years ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and the same thing about IBM 30 years ago.  This is not on.  It's hard for us to imagine their hegemony being shattered.  But these things happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe. I mean, Microsoft's market is still above, you know, almost double.  It's kind of above three hundred billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is which is crazy.  So, you know, if if if Microsoft chose to to realize a lot of it,  realize a lot of assets, but that's the point either of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, it would be amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the point, though. They're just like, oh, I mean, they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although you have to give them credit being is a nice effort.  It is no matter how you slice it.  I mean, it's something Yahoo should have been doing for years now.  But they are trying to make some efforts that are actually innovative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Talk about damning with faint praise, Kara.  A nice effort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like when I use it.  It's really it's I'm saying it's something that they can't get much traction.  Although they've had they've added market share a couple percentage points  because they're so small.  It's really difficult.  And I think that if they had if Yahoo had done this  and tried to differentiate themselves from Google,  that would probably be a different story.  But I think they're I mean, they're trying on some levels.  And I think it's real.  They're just really good at operating systems is what they were good at.  And Google's really good at search.  And so that's what that's what the problem is.  You become really good at one thing.  It doesn't mean you're going to be good at anything else.  Well, particularly successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The operating system is being replaced by the cloud.  It's become less important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is a problem.  That except for, you know, that's a little problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We are all care bears now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that is that a tweet?  You're getting ready for the game.  We are all care bears now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, we said we live in the cloud.  That's what the care bears. Oh, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Apparently, I missed that cultural reference.  I'm sorry. Yeah, it's cool.  We're going to help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You didn't enjoy Care Bears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am younger than you fellas.  And apparently I missed the Care Bear Revolution.  Yeah, I'm I was Captain Kangaroo.  Oh, dear. Yeah.  If you make a bunny rabbit reference, I'm ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, just a great show title.  You could be Mr.  Green Jeans if you took off the glasses and wore some jeans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just need big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Great. Thank you, Kara.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On that note, let me take a break.  We're going to come back in just a second.  A great panel, Kara Swisher,  Baratunde Thurston and of course, Will Harris,  talking about the latest in tech news.  We're going to talk about the Facebook redesign  that's upsetting people so much.  You know, every pixel counts  when you're a big time website, apparently.  Speaking of websites, I want to mention our friends at Squarespace.com.  What a great New York based company.  Young guys who in college said  there's got to be a better way to do a website.  And Anthony and Dane and the gang said we can do better.  And they started writing some really amazing software.  And now they become more than just a content management system.  They're a web hosting company that just does a fantastic job.  We've moved our our Twitter blog over to Squarespace.com.  I know many people, many of my friends have also gone to Squarespace  for several reasons.  You use it, Baratunde?  Yeah, I love it. Tell me why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it allowed me to focus on just creating  instead of worrying about coding.  Yeah. And even I was on WordPress before,  and I still have a lot of love for WordPress.  So this is actually no slight against them.  But I, you know, I wanted my blog to change from 700 pixels wide  to 900 pixels wide, and I just slid it.  And it's that beautiful. Yeah, it's just easy.  It's kind of like that big red staples easy button.  But for real, it was like just a lot easier to focus on the creation  of the content and not so much the coding and design of the infrastructure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  With Squarespace, you start, I think, I don't know,  they have 10, 15 templates, beautiful templates.  But the point is that you're not stuck with that  because you immediately with drag and drop can modify.  There are 14 templates, 60 styles.  You can so easily modify your site.  And if you're a CSS whiz or a JavaScript whiz,  there's no limit to what you can do.  You're never you're never boxed in with Squarespace.  Beautiful sites.

Squarespace dot com slash twit.  We love them. And I think you're going to you're going to want to give them a try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They have a pretty good iPhone app as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, well, that OK, just between us, that's the one that Apple blocked  because they didn't like an icon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are you kidding me? You say just between us, just between like me, you and the Internet.  Is that just between us kids?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a beautiful app.  They had to change one icon like three pixels and then Apple said, oh, yeah, now it's perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's awesome.  Our future is going to be determined by people who get upset about the pixel size of the icon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But but Steve has an incredible design sense and you can't.  I mean, I know you held that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's great. I think he wants to do that.  It's just, you know, don't use it.  I don't know what to say. Like he does.  This is what matters. You have a choice.  When we were at the at the demo room at the iPod launch, he was.  I got some of it on video.  I know you flipped it, which is so cool.  There's a whole two minutes of him talking about naming the iPod that I totally.  I had iPad, excuse me,  that was talking about the naming of it, which I, of course, pushed the wrong button and it didn't.  He was talking about fonts.  He said, why? So we I think Katie Barrett asked him why he wanted an iPad.  He goes, well, the fonts look great.  I had iPod, iPhone.  They look terrific together.  And that was one of his things that he of the many things he mentioned.  It was right in there. So it matters to him.  He was a design. He was a font.  He did that in college, right?  Something like that. He studied font design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That and he worked in an apple orchard.  That's the only thing I know about it.  And he was barefoot much of the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's never going away.  I got to tell you, no matter what, I don't care how it's never going to be ugly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, and I admire him immensely for that.  And I guess you're right.  The you have a choice.  You can you cannot use Apple.  The problem is, as much as we geeks may moan and groan about the closed system,  Barrett Tunde, do you use an iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I absolutely do.  I told you oppression is delicious sometimes.  And it was the best tool.  I mean, I had the G1.  I had the my touch.  And both of those were severely underpowered devices  that just couldn't handle what I needed them to do.  But this this device needs to be a mobile media production studio.  And they didn't have enough RAM or enough processor power  to do all the live coverage and photo taking and tagging and everything I wanted.  So I got in bed with AT&T very reluctantly and very sadly.  And I deepened my relationship with Apple,  a company that I both love and hate in equal parts,  depending on the moment of the hour of the day that we're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can I say that sounds like a lot of my past relationships.  It is. It's pretty complicated.  It's complicated.  That's the best one.  It's complicated.  The very best one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a love hate thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why are you torturing me?  So I have switched.  I have switched.  I switched about three weeks ago to the Nexus one and have not looked back.  I'm really happy with it.  There are a handful of apps I miss, but I can't when I get the iPad.  I'll have those apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a terrific phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love the Nexus one. It's fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a what do you do about synchronizing media with iTunes,  especially like audible content, podcast, the one exception is audible music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a program from DVD, John, the guy who cracked the CSS code.  He wrote it. That's nice.  He wrote it.  Hey, no, no, this is legal.  No, there's nothing piracy in this.  He wrote a program called Double Twist that looks just like iTunes.  It synchronizes the phone.  It moves media over photos.  It works perfectly.  It even does playlists.  The only thing it doesn't do is audible because there's audible DRM is not supported on Android yet.  But I have it on good authority.  It will be very soon.  That will be the last piece of the puzzle for me.  I mean, multitouch was big.  And once they added multitouch, I'm very happy with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you don't buy TV shows or movies from iTunes that you want to see portably.  Do you watch those on your iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I watch most television.  Hell yeah.  Oh, see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you can strip the DRM out.  There are a number of ways to do that on both Windows and Mac, basically using the analog hole.  So you play it back.  iTunes, you actually do it in iTunes.  They're plugins for iTunes.  It will take a while.  It takes it's faster than real time.  Oh, it is.  Yeah, yeah, depending on your Mac.  But that doesn't bother me.  And see, to me, this is why the iPad is going to be a great.  I'm not going to carry the iPad on the subway.  But there's a lot of to me, I can see carrying the iPad to do that.  This phone is kind of small.  So but, you know, I do have the iPhone with me.  You know why?  There's one is this words for friends, a Scrabble thing.  I can't stop playing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A game forces you to carry an entirely extra device.  Sad, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's not worse than carrying that game or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Say again.  Isn't it worse than carrying a DS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like, yeah, this is my game machine.  I think the iPad will be a very good solution for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, your iPad is the ultimate commuter machine.  Someone who commutes four hours a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's it's it's going to be it's going to revolutionize my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's it's a lot.  You know, it's fascinating to watch a lot of the I was talking to a teenager  the other day, an actual teenager about the iPad.  And he was like, it sucks.  And I said, really?  Have you touched it? No, but it sucks.  And it was really interesting.  I was like, actually, I spent many hours with it.  It doesn't suck.  And but they were convinced that it does because of the flash issues  and things like that around it.  But I think people will be pleasantly surprised when they use it  because it's you know, someone else told me, well, you know,  it's just like the iPhone or the iPod.  And I'm like, what's wrong with that?  You know, my mother can now pick it up and use it.  That's exactly what I want.  It's not it's not a negative.  He's right about a computer device, a computer device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the iPod and the iPhone were both reviled by many.  Absolutely.  And, you know, I kind of think here because I also I was in the petting zoo  and held it and had a different experience  as most of us who did hold it did from those who didn't.  And when you look and I realize that when I looked at the Apple site,  it's kind of like the fat nano, it looks like there's something wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It looks up close, you know, it was it's funny that people, you know,  the thing is, everyone expected to be some magic device.  It was you know, there were no unicorn tears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, better than Viagra.  Right. You know, nothing's better than Viagra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry. Well, I wouldn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That expectation was fed by Apple using the word magical  like 50 times in the presentation.  It didn't come out of nowhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, in fact, I think in some ways you could say that Steve  made a few strategical errors in the speech.  He shouldn't have brought up netbooks at all because this is not a netbook.  If you want if you want flash and you want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We say hello. That's Louie. Hey, Louie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, is he cute? Oh, my.  Oh, stop being so cute. Get out of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's a dog. Here's a dog. Hello.  All right. And move along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For those of you listening at home, we've just seen a small child  who is very cute with a missing front tooth and a dog of undetermined breed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a terrier. Terrier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a papillon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He loves the iPhone. He can't wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's so easy. A terrier can use it.  Exactly. It's the eye paw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The eye paw. That's a good name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hmm. A whole new category of pet appliances.  I think a lot of the correct me if I'm wrong, and I'm not the only person  who's said this, but I think some of the  negative response to the iPad is from people who don't like  the idea of an appliance computer.  And that's why I think it was a mistake to raise the net book,  because you can still buy a net book, buy a net book if you want.  Multitasking, flash, camera, you know, buy a net book.  It's 250 bucks. It's not a computer.  But this is not a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And a lot of people are annoyed that it's not a computer.  It's as you say, it's an appliance. It's a device.  It's it's not a real computer.  And some people will want a real computer and be disappointed.  Some people will not care and will be very happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think a lot of people. And I think, by the way,  contrary to past experience, the 499 price point is the one that's going to sell the most.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think part of what's happened to people were  Apple has yet to fill a hole that people want, which is the MacBook Air  for all its beauty is still a somewhat impractical sized small notebook  for true portability, because it's so broad and wide that the depth is really thin.  But that's about it.  And we've got a touch screen device already.  So it's all this is just a this is a big iPod touch.  So there's something missing from the Apple lineup and a lot of people's eyes.  They don't have a super light notebook.  Plus, it's just easy to mock things that you haven't touched or used.  And how much work do you do on the iPad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How much I'm just curious of your work on the iPhone.  Yeah. What do you on the iPhone? Excuse me on the iPhone.  What what do you guys do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Everything you know, I use mostly especially a lot of like live events.  I go to a lot of events and I try to cover them in certain  and semi journalistic ways and sometimes comedic ways.  Photo posting is a Facebook app.  Really regular basis.  We on a regular basis.  You're going to like this email. Yeah.  But I would say there was a great post on a site called Emergent by Design,  which a woman, Vanessa, I don't know how to pronounce her last name.  A memis M.I.E.M.I.S.  She has a post called Ipad overhyped flop or case of great design thinking.  And she waited to weigh in, which I think also a lot of people didn't do.  They saw the keynote or they saw a live blog covering the keynote.  And they're like, I hate it.  And just like you were saying, Karen, have you touched it?  Have you used it? No, but it's like, I know that.  I don't need facts.  So she waited and read all of the top criticism and praise.  And it's really a smart and thoughtful post in defense of the iPad.  The key hook being it's not just the device.  The iPod didn't explode in sales until iTunes was launched.  It's all about that way to connect content to the device and channel.  So it's the I bookstore will be an interesting test for this.  The connection with the existing iTunes app store will be a big test,  but we won't really know is the ultimate truth that no one can really ever admit to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's got to be out in the wild.  I think people have to see people using it to see if they like it.  I mean, there's one from Plastic Logic that's coming.  That's quite beautiful, too.  I mean, it would be great as a lot of these things.  That's what you are.  I mean, gosh, there were 12 of them.  Yes, they're going to be great.  And if they start to come down in price to a much lower price point,  it becomes really interesting.  That's, you know, beyond the iPad and the lead is attached to it.  When these things get to be really inexpensive, it becomes  incredibly interesting and as they develop, I think personally in these.  Is mobility the key element here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that what's is Kara?  Is that what pushes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so you'll be able to move around a house with one instead of being  tethered to all kinds of things.  I think that's, you know, in a perfectly wireless world.  I mean, it's got to sort of weirdly enough, give Bill Gates some credit  because he's been talking about I found an old piece I did from a CES  from a billion years ago where he, you know, kept pushing the tablet format.  And unfortunately, when his problem was he did, he really did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, he loved it.  I feel so sorry for Bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, he had a stylus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was running windows and don't feel sorry for the world's richest man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but he was really, he was really way behind.  That's just a rule of life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He was really behind the notion of mobility and portability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you remember Kara, that CES was the one that they dropped a house  like the Wizard of Oz in the parking lot of CES.  It was a whole house and they had in each room, they had a mom in the kitchen  with her tablet. They had dad in the living room with his tablet.  They had junior in the bedroom with his tablet.  And they were all sitting there, these Stepford people.  And the journalists would track through and look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There is there is a great video called Future Vision or Future Productivity Vision.  I have to send you the the thing.  It's on YouTube that Microsoft did.  I use it a lot in speeches because it really does show a world where this is  where a tablet is at work, a tablet and other devices, especially screens  on walls everywhere, which I think is also a thing that is coming  in a very big way. And you should watch it.  It's called Microsoft Future Productivity Vision or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is this the one from 2019?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What I think so. It's just because kids like kids in India and kids.  Yeah, that one. And they're you know, they're trading back things.  And then there's a really funny spoof that IGN did, you know,  about the whole thing that was.  Oh, I've seen this. Yeah, I remember seeing.  Yes. Yeah.  There's one where they have the guy with the little.  Anyway, it's a great video.  But you should all watch.  I put it up as that one and then the spoof at the same time.  Which was even fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All things D.com, if you want to see that.  And that's it.  Microsoft's always been good at making concept videos, not so hot  at getting these products out into the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I should maybe go into video production.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They've you know, they've always always had that great.  In fact, that was one of the things Dick Brass said is that he knew that  the company was in trouble when they got the CEO of the company  to to wiggle his tush with Jerry Seinfeld in the commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it was like, this is not good.  Oh, that was bad.  This is not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, team, I actually I've got to go comment on things  that I don't understand right now.  It's time to play football. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that is web commenting on things you don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's all. That's what we all do.  Really?  Tunde Thurston is at Barrett Tunde dot com catches comedy act in.  Is it in Brooklyn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Perform all over.  I host a weekly show in Times Square.  Times Square.  Check that out at Sage Comedy dot com or just, you know, find my website.  The latest gigs are up there under live appearances.  And thank you again. It's always a pleasure.  Really an honor to be on here with you, Kara and Will.  I've listened to you and read you both for a long time.  So thanks for letting me play.  Really great to have you enjoy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Enjoy watching the hand egg grown man.  Yeah. Hand hand egg.  Is that what you call it? Hand egg. Yeah.  OK. Remember, Kardashian Kardashian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have to see you to put a poisonous name into my head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's they're going to cut away to her a hundred times.  You know that her and her butt, they're going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, she's sitting down.  Very good. Unless she's unless she's going to get out.  Knowing her, she will in fact get up, turn around and wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She'll get up and cheer. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. Thank you. Thank you, Barrett.  And it's great to see you.  What do you what are you doing there?  Well, what is that? What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was saying, that's definitely the best thing about  about the Super Bowl is the cheerleaders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I just saw a study of NFL football that said that the total action  on the field part of the three hour television broadcast is 11 minutes.  And the total amount of cheerleader time, will you be very disappointed  to know, is about 20 seconds.  They don't sit on it very long. Wasted opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, they actually had a last year, they had a big NFL event in London  at one of the big London stadiums to try and sort of, I don't know,  turn turn English people onto NFL.  And one of the big selling points was the cheerleaders.  And every one of my friends that I know went went to go and see this sort of thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of American cheerleading, which you don't have cheerleading in Britain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I guess maybe it's sort of considered a bit gauche or something.  Not at all.  Also, maybe, maybe.  No, I love to see British cheerleaders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Two, four, six.  How exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You would be all men, actually, would be all men.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess the British equivalent of kind of, you know, sort of polo girls.  What?  Who sort of turn, you know,  if you have polo matches, there are always legions of slony ponies.  So slown rangers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So so you're saying that in a in a whatever passes is the equivalent  of high school in Great Britain.  They and the team is playing on the field.  There are there's no accompaniment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cheerleaders, no cheerleaders.  They don't exist. They don't exist.  And having played in quite a lot of high school sports teams,  I was very disappointed to find no cheerleaders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm kind of.  And so I wonder if this is only in America.  I know Canada must have cheerleaders because they're.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, there's actually a British cheerleading association, I have to tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Look at Kara's the Kara's the reporters.  She immediately Googled Britain and cheerleaders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look at them. Oh, look at them.  It's cheerleading.org.  That UK. Yes, indeed.  Dedicated to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, now that we've lost all our viewers, those who went to the Super Bowl  and those who went to the cheerleading site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am on it.  As a crack reporter, I am on this.  You are so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was impressed that you whipped out your flip phone  when Walt is talking to Steve. Are you kidding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What are you kidding?  No, that's great.  Cotton tried to give me an elbow, but I managed to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's what I was wondering, because Steve, first of all,  Steve doesn't normally talk to people.  He tries not to talk to people on the record.  And especially he's got a known antipathy to journalists.  But then did he not notice that you had probably didn't even notice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, there were there was a crowd around him.  So and everybody was taking pictures.  And I think he was trying to ignore it.  And probably if he hip checked, Walt's partner would be a problem.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know. They like.  There was a lot of people behind him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Apple likes Walt.  They don't want to mess with him. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I don't think he noticed.  I should tell you, I don't think he noticed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He noticed me. I was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am small. I am small and tricky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am not small.  And I was in the keynote holding up a laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I think he did notice me because I gave me the stink eye a couple of times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. He may have given. I don't care.  I won't be going back. I'm sure they won't invite me back.  So who has seen the Facebook redesign?  Because maybe I've seen it and I just don't know. I have.  What does it look like?  What is what is new? I don't notice, honestly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The stories about Facebook's redesign, I mean, I know it matters a great deal,  but it's just, you know, every time they redesign, everybody hates it  and then gets used to it sort of kind of thing.  And it's just it's not that big a deal.  I don't I don't think it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I would say why does it matter a great deal?  Why why why even say that?  I mean, people matters, I guess, to people who use Facebook constantly  and they can't find a button. Yeah.  So yeah. So this is my Facebook.  Is this the new designer? I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That looks the same with the old one.  And they made some tweaks in a variety of areas.  I just I think what's more interesting is the stories about them doing email,  which they should have been doing a long time ago.  And that's important because their email is just the most atrocious

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  product on the planet. They're going to have.  Is it going to be like Yahoo or Gmail where they have a Facebook mail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean, it would be nice to be able to forward their mail.  You know, it's you know, I keep saying, you know, it's it's 2010.  You might want to have forwarded mail, but  so we don't know. We'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We have the the crappy Facebook inboxes, how they do it right now. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't use it at all for mail ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, because stuff gets disappears and there's no way to manage it.  It goes missing.  So I guess if they had like real email, but it doesn't make any sense.  If it's I guess you could beef up the inbox or you could have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or you could have an email come into it, I guess.  You know, like regular email works, I suppose.  I mean, that would be an improvement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is Facebook as dominant as they were?  I mean, last year, it looked like it was a Facebook world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, four to a million.  I don't know. What's it like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Four hundred million, four hundred million users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It seems like everybody you know uses Facebook.  I mean, there's a ridiculous statistic that, you know,  was it last year, sort of a third of all page views were generated on Facebook,  like on the Internet.  And for a lot of people, I mean,  all it used to be that sort of Google was the Internet.  It was where you started for everything.  And that kind of seems like increasingly Facebook is the Internet.  Yeah. Which is terrible, but kind of true.  When I when I talk, you know,  I would say probably 90 percent of my friends  use the Internet 90 percent of the time for Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there's a guy named Larry, I don't know, is it Ponymon?  Ponymon? You have the Ponymon Institute.  Pokemon?  It sounds like that, but it's not.  He's actually quite serious.  And he did a study of what he calls the privacy centric population.  About eight percent of the population don't sign up for.  Don't sign up for supermarket loyalty cards.  You know, stay away from all that stuff.  He did a study of them.  Most of these will still post pictures on Facebook, will tell stories on Facebook.  They do not go to their privacy settings.  They don't spend more time than others tweaking their privacy settings.  And there's an interesting article on MSNBC's Red Tape Chronicles  about this.  Bob Sullivan's talking about the fact that Facebook seems to encourage people  who are normally private people to go public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, just your friends, right?  I mean, that makes sense.  Well, that's the illusion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it really your friends, though?  I mean, this is part of the problem with Facebook is you get the feeling  that only your friends are seeing it, but in fact, marketers can see it.  Quizzes can see it.  Your stuff is really wide open to everybody except people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is part of it, right?  I mean, part of the original appeal of Facebook was that you could share  all this stuff and you were only sharing it with your friends.  And so it wasn't like sharing with the Internet.  It's like, you know, it's the same as having a mobile phone  text conversation or something.  I think what Facebook has been, you know, arguably disingenuous in doing  is opening all that stuff up to the wider world, because now you kind of get  a more web like experience in terms of sharing your private stuff.  But you think that you're sharing it in a much closer confines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sullivan talks about one of the issues being in some studies  they've shown that people will put information such as how many sexual  partners they've had on Facebook, but not give it to not give it to a researcher  to put on Facebook because they don't want a human to see it.  So there's this kind of illusion that you're well, it's not really a person.  I'm just putting it on a website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't consider Facebook for a lot of privacy.  I mean, that's interesting.  But I mean, most people really don't care what they put on Facebook.  It seems especially younger, younger people don't care.  They put everything on there and it's there.  It's where they live.  It's their little address book of the Internet.  It's their little home on the Internet.  You know, I think someone like me who's been around for 109 years,  I get Facebook fatigue. I don't have time.  But certainly, if you've grown up in that paradigm,  it's the way you interact with the Internet.  It reminds me a great deal of how people used to interact with AOL  a million years ago, because that was sort of your home on the Internet  for a long, long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You wrote a great book on AOL, didn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, two of them, in fact, because I'm a glutton for punishment.  But I did the rise and the fall pretty much.  Right, right.  And, you know, AOL had all these things, a lot of the social profiles,  they were very crude, but they had the buddy list.  They had the chat.  They had the they had a wall kind of thing.  So they really did start a pioneer.  A lot of this stuff is just a question of if once people get used to it,  they move off. They certainly did off AOL within seconds  when something better came available.  But Facebook's been really effective at creating this home on the Internet  that I think is really interesting.  I mean, I think it's a really another interesting thing that's happened,  has happened that people do want to feel a place that they're safe and  and at least they feel they're safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's an illusion. It's just an illusion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they know, of course, that could be scraped so easily.  I mean, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pew Pew  study came out  called Social Media and Mobile Internet Use Among Teens and Young Adults.  They did two telephone surveys in September focusing on teens  age 12 to 17 and then 18 and older.  Blogging among teens and young adults is plummeted to half what it was  three years ago.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they're using basically they're using Facebook and Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's probably right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's where everything is going these days. Yeah.  And there I think there is this kind of lowered expectation of privacy.  I think people just say, well, it's out there.  I don't care really if it's out there, especially young.  One of the reasons I'm paying attention to this is  besides the fact that I have teenagers, I'm going to do a seminar  in a couple of weeks for families about  what kids are doing online and what the consequences and risks might be.  And we still don't know, do we? Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they do a little bit.  I mean, it's like any kind of humanity.  It's just a younger version of them.  But I mean, one of the things that I just did an eighth grade class  at my kid's school or older kids.  And, you know, they there was a lot of name  call the name calling stuff goes on on these things between the schools  and stuff like that.  You know, very typical of what you'd expect them to do  when they had other means of doing it.  It just gives them super tools to be doing the things that they should  and shouldn't be doing.  But a lot of it was just where are you at?  What are you doing? Right.  Here's my picture.  You know, a lot of it's really mundane.  And then it moves into dementia, like demented behavior  and a very small group of people.  So I don't know if it's so different.  It's just the tools are really good to be able to share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to talk about some a grownup who used Twitter to resign his job  this week in just a moment.  But before I do, I want to mention our friends at Citrix,  who do a great product called GoToMeeting.  You know, they do the wonderful remote access stuff.  GoToMyPC, of course, the high enterprise stuff.  GoToMeeting uses that same backbone of technology  to make it possible for you to meet,  accomplish stuff without the numbing, mind numbing and bankbook  breaking travel that normally is involved in business.  You know, business travels could just be so expensive,  not to mention the stress and strain.  I use GoToMeeting all the time.  We actually use it on some of our shows.  It's a wonderful way to share sales presentations,  product demos for training.  You know, you can have the program on your system.  The other guy doesn't.  You show her how to use it on your system and say, OK,  now I'm going to give you control.  Go ahead and play with it, even though she hasn't installed it.  The nice thing also is it's very simple for somebody to use.  If you don't want a client to be jumping through hoops,  if you want to show them a PowerPoint sales presentation,  you're not going to make them say go through three,  you know, install software and all this.  This is very easy.  You send them an invitation in email.  They click a link or you can even do it while you're on the phone.  You say, go to GoToMeeting.com. You're there.  OK, press the join a meeting button.  Now they're seeing your screen.  They see your presentation just like you're there in real time.  You can give them control. Mac, PC, doesn't matter.  And at forty nine dollars a month for as many meetings you want,  as long as you want, this is really going to save your company money.  I want you to try it right now.  Absolutely free for 30 days.  You go to GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  Give it a try. Show your boss.  Do it with the clients.  The unlimited meetings, by the way, also includes voice over  Internet and free teleconferencing with this.  GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  I hear a dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's just two of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm actually going to meeting dot com slash twit.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're today. Yes, we'll go ahead.  I have to say, I have to say, I actually was on a GoToMeeting last week.  I think more and more people are using the experience.  I know we've had pretty miserable weather here in London  and the idea of trekking across London to go to a meeting was pretty grim.  And so I had a GoToMeeting and I got everything done and it was it was pretty camp.  Carol, are you in New York?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm in San Francisco. Oh, you're lucky.  See, those those people back east all snowed in.  We don't care. Yes, they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Walt sent me some great pictures of it's like four feet of snow.  It's amazing.  Yeah, it looked like crazy, like his driveway looked nuts.  He sent pictures of his driveway and the walkway and the street.  And it was pretty that was I used to live in D.C.  So it was a big snowstorm for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is Walt in D.C.?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, he lives in D.C.  Oh, I didn't know that.  He used to cover the Defense Department.  Oh, really? Yeah, he did.  He just became sort of this geekish person and he  he was covering the Defense Department and wanted to do this instead.  And everyone thought he was nuts because that was like a big beat covering defense.  So and a good choice for Walt, I'd say. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I always say that to technology been very, very good to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He covered national security more than defense.  He covered State Department.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, that's a fascinating beat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, he did. He covered Jim Baker, I think, during that time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. So it's been kind of sad to watch the  transfer of power and the demise of Sun, which was one of the great  you know, the great companies it was created by hippies  had kind of this hippie mentality and yet did servers that ran the Internet.  They still run much of the Internet. Yeah.  And but just struggled in recent years and finally went out  to basically went out of business acquired by Oracle.  The acquisition is now going as Scott McNeely wrote.  What I thought was a surprisingly personal  and a little indulgent, but that's what you'd expect from something highly personal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Scott McNeely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He was totally Scott McNeely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's been so shy over the years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was very funny to read it.  It leaked out, I guess, the farewell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It leaked out. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Scott Scott leaked it out over his Facebook, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now he's sent it out to like 400. Oh, did he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I'm assuming I got it from a employee, actually.  I have a son.  But, you know, it was it was let me see if I can find it because I could read  some passages. But then the funniest thing is is the CEO.  Jonathan Schwartz. Yeah.  Resigns via Haiku on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know My Little Pony was very amusing.  I have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why do you call him My Little Pony?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I don't think Steve Jobs does.  It's really good. It's the ponytail.  He calls him My Little Pony.  It's a perfect nickname.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is kind of, you know. Yeah.  Schwartz Twitter Twittered financial crisis,  stalled too many customers, CEO no more.  Yeah. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like Haiku Thursday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a new deeply moved.  Yeah. Touched.  Yeah, touched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This it is said, you know, I have to say,  Sun was started by very well-meaning people, brilliant technologists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That last line could be CEO at fault, but I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, we won't say that.  Good point. It works the same.  Well, that was interesting because Scott McNeely really threw himself on the sword  a little bit more than Jonathan did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, he shouldn't have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Scott McNeely, Farewell Gang.  When I interviewed many of you for employment at Sun over the years,  one commitment often made was that things will change above, below and around you  faster than any place you've ever been.  While it was never our primary vision to be acquired by Oracle,  it's kind of an understatement.  It was always an interesting option.  So what do I say to you now that this is happening?  And it goes on for many more paragraphs of nostalgia and  and strange references to the Eagles.  The dress code, it's quite it's yeah, it's interesting.  Did you guys publish it on your blog or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John might have. I don't probably he did.  Yeah, I think he probably did.  It was a good night. It was I read it. I did read it.  It was a good note. It was you know what I liked about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It would have been very easy for him to write something impersonal and right.  And what he really did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you know, he's always been a character.  He's always you know, when he posed in an outfit like a superhero outfit.  You know, we had him on stage at D a couple of years ago,  the very beginning, maybe eight years, a long time ago, seven, eight years ago.  And he was, you know, he was as usual hysterical and very forthcoming.  And at the time it was just starting to really decline.  And he was pretty forthright about the situation then.  So I found him always to be that way, not that I don't know if they could have done  anything about it, but they certainly he certainly didn't hide from  what was happening. What did happen?  Well, I think they got jammed really pretty much from both sides.  I mean, from all the different sides.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And she PCs kind of moving up in power so that they could do  what the service from Sunday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, his was the network is the computer.  That was his famous quote.  And he was right. I never got it until now.  He was completely right.  He had two famous quotes. The network is the computer is the computer.  And there's no such thing as privacy.  Get used to it. Something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Get over it, he said.  Get over it. Yes.  Scott McNeely fashion.  And by the way, both were right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, he definitely was right.  I think they just got jammed.  I mean, it's hard to be in that sort of muddy.  It's in any kind of business to be in that muddy middle.  It's really tough.  They probably should have gotten acquired on their terms many years before.  There was some possibility of Apple buying it at one point and IBM.  There are all kinds of rumors.  I think they definitely weren't talks with all these people for many years.  And they just didn't take the opportunity when they should have  because of all they sort of were proud of themselves  and thought a lot of themselves.  So that always happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's where that's coming back to that.  The discussion we had earlier about the fact that there's a kind of natural

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  lifecycle to technology companies and to some tech to some technology companies.  Certainly. I mean, Microsoft is for for has been around for a long time,  considering, you know, since the early 80s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it is moving faster.  You know, I think that we're it's accelerating so much that you cannot.  It's very hard because what happened to Microsoft happens very quickly.  It's happening to Google, which is you succeed wildly beyond your wildest  dreams, you grow immensely, you suddenly get huge market share.  And then you find it very difficult to innovate because suddenly it's all about  protecting what you've got.  And and a smarter, younger, brighter, hipper company comes along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And well, I always subscribe to the Kenny Rogers school of the world,  which is, you know, you got to know when to fold out, no one got to know  when to hold them, know when to fold them in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nice, no one to walk away, no one to run.  I was a DJ. Very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is one hell of a song.  It is the best song ever.  It kind of says it all, doesn't it?  It does, man. I was never I'm thinking I'm like, no one does.  Anyway, just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's see. Most E.  This is a PC World article, this NPD group study that says, I was surprised  this most e-reader owners are satisfied.  Ninety three percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They like that. They love them.  Well, do you have any reader? I don't yet.  You don't use I use them.  I don't like the Amazon.  I don't like black and white and no touch screen.  I'm sorry. I'm just not going to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why you're going to love the iPad. What about you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I was tempted by a Kindle.  You guys are a bunch of Luddites.  I held out for an iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I read every night on my Kindle.  I love my Kindle.  And I but I currently the the iPad,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the iBook store is not going to launch in the UK alongside the iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's too bad. That's a nice, beautiful scrolling.  It's elegant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although I talked to Philip Ryu, who wrote the classics app on the iPhone,  which is exactly, by the way, what the iBook store book reader looks like.  Oh, interesting.  And he said, no, nobody ever.  He said, in fact, I looked when I saw the announcement, I said,  maybe I missed an email.  He went back through his email saying, did Apple contact me? No.  No, no.  Nor did real shipply.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if you can patent page turning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm no and a wooden bookshelf.  So wooden bookshelf. Come on.  Exactly. Apple does that.  But I think a little tip of the hat.  Give him a few bucks, because I mean, it looks exactly. However.  Now, let me ask you this, Kara, because you and I have both held the iPad,  but you spent a lot more time with it than me.  And I guess the one question people have is, is it going to be easy on the eyes?  People say, no, an LCD you cannot is not easy on the eyes.  You cannot read it for hours.  The Kindle, that's its chief advantage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is that is an advantage.  Definitely the technology is is very easy on the eyes.  It's definitely easy on this.  I don't know. I haven't used it for nine hours.  So I'll get back to you when I've watched a movie.  But I've used my iPhone, certainly for many, many hours watching.  Well, yeah, I watched all of heroes across going to Europe one time.  Yeah. The first season.  So I didn't have a problem with it. I don't know.  I don't know. I haven't.  Reading is more onerous on your eyes. It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I love the page turn.  I love the aesthetics of it. The little the little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We'll see. We'll see. I haven't used it for enough time.  You know, I don't I can't imagine reading nine hours in a row.  But I mean, I think more more games.  I think games will be interesting, but I think it's quite beautiful.  The games are quite beautiful that I saw.  We'll see. I don't I don't know if anyone's going to use it for that long.  I don't know. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. My suspicion is that it'll be easier on the eye for longer than I can sit still and read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, as Steve Jobs very famously said, and I'm sure he now nobody wishes he did.  Nobody reads any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, he does. He did. He said a lot of things.  He said he wasn't going to do a phone at our conference and we pressed him.  And he said, you know, nobody he didn't want to deal with.  I was cell phone companies. He said, I don't like going through orifices.  Oh, geez. What a great line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And also said nobody wants to watch video on a two inch screen.  Yeah, he said a lot of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You had you you you had a great  interview with Bill and Steve together.  That was that was wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was awesome. Indeed. Yeah.  We were lucky. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, that was a moment. And you handled it quite well.  I mean, you really. Yeah.  Yeah. That's a that's a that's a potential minefield.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, we talked to them before because we wanted it to be  we wanted to be bigger.  You know, we wanted them to have good to be.  I mean, although, you know, a cat fight would have been very entertaining for people.  And I think there are there's definitely tensions between them.  But I think that we wanted them to be on a higher level.  We thought it was important for historical purposes  and because they hadn't been together in almost any interviews ever  to really talk about the big the big the big ticket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I loved it.  And then there was a great bit of nostalgia talking.  Yes. Very touching.  I really enjoyed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My favorite line was when I said, is there a secret  that people don't know about the two of you?  And Steve Jobs said, well, Bill and I have married for many years.  And Bill Gates's face, he didn't know was coming like turned like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they both you know what?  Look, they're both smart guys. They're very successful.  They have a good sense of humor sometimes and not always.  Once in a while.  I think if you got you got them in a nice, relaxed state, which really worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We tried before because Steve Jobs has had some somewhat negative things about.  Someone asked why.  I think Walt had an interview with him before our big interview saying,  why do people use the eye?  Why do people use iTunes on Windows?  Why is it the most popular app?  And Steve Jobs couldn't resist himself.  And he said, well, if you gave someone ice water in hell, they'd be happy to.  And Bill Gates was sitting in the front row and I was like, oh, no.  Like all of us, the PR person for Apple, we're like, oh, that's the end of that.  Our interview is going to be ugly.  And definitely Gates was not happy about that quote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, Steve said.  Steve said the problem with Bill Gates, he has no taste.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Well, yeah, he said that.  So he does that all this. He likes to tweak.  He's sort of like that kid in school that likes to tweak the other kids.  You know, he can't.  Then, you know, jobs isn't a mute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're going to look back at, you know, something like the iPod Hi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, God.  And job saying, oh, I've replaced my high five.  I mean, that was such a crock, wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know. I hope he didn't replace his high five with that because.  Yeah, it was a big mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's a very tricky dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good and bad. He's a good he's a brilliant marketer.  He's a brilliant businessman. He has great taste.  There's no doubt about it.  One last story, the Olympics are coming up, the 2010 Olympics  in Vancouver, the Winter Olympics.  And a number of athletes have said, I'm not going to be able to tweet  because it's against the rules here.  An article in Wired magazine says American skier Lindsey Vaughn,  one of the potential stars of the 2010 Winter Olympics,  told her 35000 Twitter followers she would not be tweeting.  Oh, there is, in fact, no Olympic rule that sets up a blackout period.  They are allowed to tweet.  They're just not allowed to act as journalists, apparently.  So they can't say like the results are in from the, you know, hockey game.  And it was three to why?  That's a good question. Antiquated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's ridiculous. There should be tons of tweeting.  I can't imagine why wouldn't you?  And let them tweet the results.  But putting stuff on Facebook.  Yeah, this they're going to do pictures.  There's going to be like a ridiculous flood vomiting of information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's what that's what one of the the Olympic guys said.  This is going to be the Twitter Olympics.  But they did publish a four page document, the IOC blogging guidelines  for persons at the 21st Olympic Winter Games.  And defines a blog, personal information, no sound or moving images of the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, my God. Bite me.  Yeah, bite me. That's a good word.  Come on.  It's so what if someone uses like a little flip camera?  So why?  Oh, you can't.  People behind the scenes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They've sold those rights to Pepsi Cola.  You can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some skiers behind the scenes where they go down the slope and they go, hey,  I'm about to go on the slope.  Wish me luck.
