Um, so  Really just hoping to make something that uh,  you know, we wanted to see in the world, which is  A reader supported tech publication. I mean we were inspired by sites like defector and hellgate in new york city  And I think not that there were a lot of strings at vice. We did have a lot of freedom, but I think  We just we just really want to talk about how technology impacts people and sort of the personalities behind technology that are changing  Different power structures, etc

End time: 605.76
Speaker: Jason Koebler
Transcript:  That's the vibe. Yeah, and uh, they're really easy to find on instagram  Like i've shown this to instagram several times. Um, all of the ads are going directly to telegram like telegram chat groups  Uh where it's one click from instagram to  Would you like to buy a pound of weed? Would you like to buy?

End time: 610.44
Speaker: Leo Laporte

End time: 629.88
Speaker: Jason Koebler
Transcript:  They some of them do some of them do which I don't know if you have the article up, but I do a lot of them  A lot of them just have wads of stacks of cash like people in ski masks standing in front of an atm  But as you'll see here this uh, you know, this is psilocybin. That's directly on instagram

Start time: 632.00
End time: 640.34
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is this because the ads are sold on on instagram like they are on facebook and many many other sites  In an automated fashion. It's like a vending machine. There's no human

Start time: 642.04
End time: 646.84
Speaker: Jason Koebler
Transcript:  I mean they not they nominally have a review process, but something about the review process is broken

Start time: 647.48
End time: 656.86
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm sure there's so many there's thousands, you know hundreds of thousands of ads a day  They just can't right? I mean it looks like oh my they must be selling mushrooms. Okay

Start time: 657.68
End time: 664.92

End time: 666.29
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, they can really do that

Start time: 667.32
End time: 706.44
Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  No, I just I wanted to say um, yeah, I was talking to uh a famous person  There's a right wing commentator this week  Uh, we're talking back channel about how disturbed we were with some of the extremism  and this person was telling me about how  they have nothing but um in their instagram feeds like uh, uh posts about like how to construct pipe bombs  Uh for like domestic terrorism and stuff like that like constantly in their feed  so  it's um, it's just absolutely amazing to me the stuff we get zonked for and  You know the stuff that just makes it through the the the you know, the nlp filters

Start time: 707.86
End time: 738.31
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Uh the excuse given uh, well actually this comes from an interview subject  From the integrity institute is that the harm isn't on the platform  It's a link to instagram and so it's hard to police these although  I'm looking at the video that you posted at 404 media.co and it looks like there's some harm  Uh here that just off the top of my head  um  Looks like they're showing you how to like this is a codeine  solution, I mean

Start time: 739.72
End time: 820.01
Speaker: Jason Koebler
Transcript:  Yeah, and the thing is is i'm not offended by this stuff  It's like I was purposefully reinforcing the algorithm once I started seeing them  I started clicking on them because I was like wow like why is this on here?  But like I said in that in that follow up  Our article about this problem was caught right away because it used the word meth  It used the word drugs and it was prevented from having grief. They stopped the article. They didn't stop the ads  Right and and you know, you have like sex workers on instagram  You have marginalized people you have all these sorts of people who have their platforms and their reach limited all the time for these  you know  pretty inscrutable rules sometimes and then you have  Instagram taking money to inject ads for coding and I got a lot of ads for guns even  um, and they're taking money for this and they're not doing a great job of stopping it. I mean, I don't want to direct your  listeners to go  see where to find this but uh meta has an ad library and  And you can see thousands and thousands of these ads if you search for a telegram link like a telegram link shortener  And i've shown this to facebook time and time again  And they say okay. Well, we delete it when we find it and I say, okay  Well, I can find it over and over and over again. No problem  um, you know

Start time: 820.66
End time: 830.48
Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  Have you tried actually ordering it and seeing if it's actually that stuff because it seems to me there would be very little  Incentive it might be a scam negative incentives. Yeah, which is even worse

Start time: 831.20
End time: 832.90
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm not even gonna get my shrooms

Start time: 834.10
End time: 914.28
Speaker: Jason Koebler
Transcript:  Exactly exactly. So some of it is definitely a scam like it's some of the stuff you can tell like this is someone trying to  heart  a naive person from their money  But there are other other ones where there's a lot of videos of the product and then there's you know photos of the receipt  And they're they're willing to facetime with you to show you that they're walking to the post office to mail you your drugs  stuff like that  and  I've spent enough time in these groups to think that some of them are real and by real I mean  They're actually selling drugs  and then I also talked to an academic who sort of traced the  Online drug trade from the dark web to telegram  um, so obviously there's still dark web markets where this stuff is getting sold but a lot of  a lot of the most popular sort of vendors on the dark web have moved to  Telegram because then they're able to have sort of like a one-to-one relationship with their  Customers and so i'm pretty sure that a lot of this stuff is quote unquote like real  legit not a scam  but I did not buy any of it because that's illegal and  We're a new publication. So, you know  Probably best not to go to jail in your first week. I want to last more than a week. Yeah  Yeah, do you even have a lawyer on staff? Jason? We have a lawyer. Yeah, we did

Start time: 915.66
End time: 920.90
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How did you fund this? Did you go out and get vc or investors or is this all self-funded?

Start time: 921.84
End time: 969.06
Speaker: Jason Koebler
Transcript:  This is all self-funded. I mean you might think it it makes us sound a little less serious, but we each put in  $1,000 like and I think that's one of the big reasons why we did this is because  The tools to actually set up a site like this  Are much more accessible now. We're using this product called ghost which is open source love ghost. Yeah. Yeah, it's really good  It's a blogging platform. Yeah  Really fast lightweight site. Um, and then yeah, it's a subscription model. So from day one we had revenue coming in  We obviously like have savings from  So that we're able to do this  But we didn't take vc money because we didn't want to get on a hamster wheel where good  They want returns right away that sort of thing  We want to sort of do this on our own terms and see if we can make it

Start time: 993.60
End time: 1009.06
Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  Exactly. It's got to make you feel like you're at such a disadvantage though  I mean, you know not to go to elon right away  But you know you look at what he did with twitter and you know  He he gets it and he and all his bc buddies like tilt the alco towards when you say he gets it by the way

End time: 1053.72
Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  To a certain extent to be really honest all my favorite group chats are there. So that's the main reason

Start time: 1053.74
End time: 1084.27
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, that's true still and that's part of the problem is if you guys don't leave then  There's a reason to go there  I'm a terrible person. I'm a terrible person. No, you're not. I'm not I am not berating you  You're judging a little but it's a little judgy. I think but can I just say that my wife is still using it regularly and  and and we still use it as a company because  We use all that we have to promote on all the platforms anybody with a company has to promote everywhere  um

Start time: 1085.16
End time: 1126.15
Speaker: Jason Koebler
Transcript:  that's been the big thing for me is  Uh, I had not been tweeting or really using social media much at all over the last few months  Um, which was very nice for my mental health  Yeah  But then you you launch something like this like you go out on a limb and you launch something and it's like well  Yeah, my audience is on twitter  but the one the  The audience that I have so far is on twitter and i've been working to build an audience on threads and on mastodon, etc  But really have gone into a posting mode that I have not uh  sort of twitter brain mode that I haven't been in for a few years because it  It is a kind of noxious place. Um  But eric you

Start time: 1128.10
End time: 1143.38
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You said to use your blue sky profile you you prefering blue sky looks just like twitter, but it's a of course  Uh, it's jack. Uh jack's um  Open twitter dorsi. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean i'm definitely still on twitter

Start time: 1143.50
End time: 1189.26
Speaker: Eric Geller
Transcript:  I definitely still use it a lot i've seen that it still has some of that juice that it used to have  Certainly less of it. Um, but you know, I think that diversity in this marketplace is valuable  also, you know another thing i'll point out is  um  I was I was talking to somebody about the kind of misinformation problem on social media and one of the things they said was  If we had more of these platforms that were sort of more  Equal in terms of stature as opposed to just twitter and facebook and everybody else  There would be more incentive for companies like instagram to clean up the platform to get rid of misinformation to get rid of drug markets  Because they would actually be worried about losing market share to other sites  So i'm trying to be a bit more conscious about using these other platforms as well  Um, not as anything against elon personally, but just you know, I think there's value in having multiple healthy communities

Start time: 1189.26
End time: 1256.06
Speaker: Jason Koebler
Transcript:  I think that's really smart, but I also have this theory that um  Elon by sort of saying I am basically not going to do content moderation  Like i'm i'm not going to do it in the same way that twitter used to do it  I feel like that almost gives  zuckerberg  the permission to  Be much more lax on facebook and much more lax on instagram and I don't have any like data to back that up  but it just feels to me  like  Facebook  Has gone through waves where it's taken  content moderation super seriously  and over the last few months it feels like it hasn't and I feel like part of that reason might just be because  Elon's barely doing it on twitter. Like what are you gonna do? Like what are you gonna do and leave instagram? I mean  a lot of people do but a lot of people  Are kind of used to just start seeing junk on the internet all the time on every platform they go to and so maybe they're  maybe there's some like less incentive to  You've like have a very strong content moderation team

Start time: 1256.18
End time: 1279.38
Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  So it's not just your feeling on this uh, washington post had a fantastic piece that came out just a couple of days ago by  Sarah ellison talking about how elon basically  Set the way for not doing anything about disinformation on these platforms and the rest of big tech is following the way  Which is very much evidenced by your instagram ads. So it's it's not just your feeling  This is an objective reality. It's happening

Start time: 1279.96
End time: 1312.22
Speaker: Eric Geller
Transcript:  And you know just to bring in the the washington dc element  You know, there's a big fight right now in the courts about how much the government can be  Talking to these companies about election disinformation about covet 19 disinformation  Um, the the the white house was for a little while actually legally prevented from having certain conversations with the tech companies  That ruling has been paused but it's going to give these companies cover to do less of this if there are groups  Taking them to court for even talking to the government about taking stuff down and i've been saying I find this route

Start time: 1312.52

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, go ahead. Go ahead brian. No, no

Start time: 1314.50
End time: 1360.30
Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  no, I was just gonna say I find this really frustrating because do you really think twitter or facebook are in the  best position to go out there and  Determine which accounts are isis?  Propaganda or run for recruitment out there. Of course, it's their natsac agencies, right?  And I find no issue whatsoever  With them going and compiling data and just handing it over to a twitter or a facebook saying look  We have the resources to look into this stuff. This is our determination do with it  We will if you're serious about these problems though, but this is what we think  Uh, this is what we are finding. I think that's utterly legitimate for a government to do and I just uh, I think it's  I think this practice is really bad news for national security

Start time: 1360.40
End time: 1378.10
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I always love this, you know, uh  One way to kind of keep your finger on the pulse of this is to watch ads on tv  And I well, I remember last year on the super bowl. There were a lot of ads about jesus getting us  And I was really interested, you know, who's who's paying for those ads. Maybe you've seen these ads lately

Transcript:  In the army for 27 years today. I'm retired and living on a pension  Instead of lowering our costs and tackling inflation congress is going after american technology  This misguided agenda will threaten the technology we use every day and it could cost public pension plans over  100 billion dollars seniors like me will pay a heavy price  Tell congress to leave our technology alone

Start time: 1407.38
End time: 1460.45
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How many how many of these have you seen lately and who do you think's paying for that? I know but i'll see if you guys know  That's a facebook ad  Well, it's clearly the american edge project  It's the american edge project the the people who bring you uh, all the good stuff in the in the life in life from the silicon valley  um, they are lobbying really hard  uh to keep uh congress out of uh  Out of their pie out of the trough  Uh, this is uh, sarah ellison and naomi nix's article you were talking about following elon musk's lead big tech is  Surrendering to this information  Uh, and I think you're right  I think it's partly because it's easier to do so but also partly because the government's kind of seems to be encouraging that they  Take a hands-off policy  That's coming by the way from the american right that says oh stop censoring conservative voices  um

Transcript:  Well so much of the content moderation  Like the reason these platforms do content moderation is because they're worried that advertisers don't want to be next to disinformation  They don't want to be next to drugs and they don't want to be next to sex

And so I think that that's like since elon isn't doing it, you know  No one has to a lot of advertisers have pulled away  But  They're not going to pull away from facebook and instagram because those are you know, very high  They're very effective places to advertise

Transcript:  I I think this is uh, I don't what I can't say the word. I really want to say so I think it's horse duty  I think I would say um, you know  It's the idea that facebook and twitter and all these companies are not actually publishers  I find it fairly laughable and I understand it's it's kind of easy to fall back to like a profit motive argument on this  You know, it's bad for advertisers is bad for the bottom line fair enough  But you know, i'm old enough to remember an age where you know, I think politics was better because there was some editorial judgment  placed with uh, you know what what we saw and what we were talking about is not to say we  Didn't miss a lot of really important stories or the biases that exist in those newsrooms didn't have really serious policy effects  Look at the aids crisis. That's a really good example of that  Just not being covered for a long time the way it needed to be  But I I just don't I think if you have a media environment where the best argument they have is it's about the profit motive  and not about what makes this a  Just our civic virtue forget republican or democrat, but just what makes this a  What is good for civil society? I just don't think we can operate it that way

Uh, robert carrow's book about uh,  Robert moses the guy who paved new york city  Uh with parkways, uh, and one of the reasons moses could operate for 40 years as an unelected official  with a massive budget  Uh in the face of political opposition is because the new york times loved him  And would not write a negative thing about not one. In fact to his death wouldn't even panned this book  Called it venomous  because it criticized this guy  And so I think that we have we have I agree with you  I mean, I always thought well, I trusted walter cronkite the new york times a paper of record and all that but maybe  Maybe it's not a perfect

I'm gonna play a little bit of devil's advocate  But sure aren't we a little bit better off having everybody have a voice and  Trusting this is something that seems to be lacking in all these conversations  trusting people  to judge  What's good and what's not what's good content?

I think it's a fantasy because I mean look we we've seen this  We see every single day in the algo most people are going to believe stuff that you know  It is what they already agree with right the stories that you most need to read sometimes in like say wall street journal  This is a paper I subscribe to it has a point of view  I generally don't agree with but is well researched is

You could trustworthy reporters  You could trust the news, but i'm seeing more and more of a big anti-big tech slant  From the wall street journal constant anti-google so forth  And I think that they are just as biased in the news division at this point and that that's

It's going to be four of us and it's going to be shoestring  But we're gonna but we're going to give you the good reporting  You're used to without an axe to grind  I think that's very exciting

Start time: 1819.34
End time: 1966.14
Speaker: Jason Koebler
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean we're excited about it and then also it's like the numbers can be scary  It's like we need thousands of people to subscribe to us in order to make ends meet and to have a life  But then you start thinking about how many people are out there and you just need a tiny fraction  of the people who read us to support us in order for that to work  and  One of the things that I saw advice  Which I i'm not gonna ramble about this too long is that there's astronomical overhead  In the news business right now. It's like vice had an office that they just announced they're leaving in prime williamsburg  In brooklyn that office is millions and millions and millions of dollars something like 40 or 50 offices all over the world  paying consultants all of the time to come in and you know  Reassess what the business strategy should be changing tactics all the time  and I think that when you have  This astronomical overhead it makes it really hard for the journalism  not that not that we had this in mind the whole time, but as part of the bankruptcy proceedings, we sort of saw the  financials and  vice owed millions and millions and millions of dollars to a variety of companies  And it's impossible for the journalist to outwork that I think and if you start with something very small  That doesn't need millions of dollars to succeed. You can still do really impactful work  And you can make it financially sustainable because you don't have this insane overhead and I mentioned ghost earlier  But one of the reasons we're able to do it is because it has this it has stripe built in which is a payment processor  It's like we don't need to hire an it team like ghost is just rock solid there  There's just all the barriers to entry to make a website. I mean, you know this you started a podcast over 20 years ago  Um, they they don't exist anymore  and so there's a lot of benefits to being in a big newsroom or being at a big media company, but  you know  Me and my co-founders have done this for over 10 years. We know how to do the journalism  Uh, and now there are enough services and soft pieces of software and open source tools out there that we can do all the  logistics and back-end business stuff  Pretty easily and pretty inexpensively. So yeah

Start time: 1967.24
End time: 2050.06
Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  I I think I would have two concerns about that. Um, the first is uh, look at uh, you know, so i've done uh twit with  A fair number of times paris martinette, right?  Uh, if there's not a pipeline for people to come out of college when come from professional journalists and everything is like these smaller blogs  Maybe it's okay for a while  But I think in five ten years, I think this can be a real lack of institutional knowledge, you know, that's going to really um,  Affect like the the the talent that's coming next. I think the other problem is you know, we've seen this  I really love cars for instance  Um, you know, we had a bunch of people from gelatnik and a bunch of the other  Car periodicals go and start a website called the autopia, right?  Great site  But what they have to do to get the money they need to continue  Is write the kind of silly stories people like me are going to pay for they're not doing the nuts and bolts journalism  that um, you know really informs the car market or even performs a watchdog role  It's more like look at this guy that you know ls swapped this crazy engine into a miata, right?  Because i'm gonna click that so  I I think there's like a there's certainly a model for some journalists to survive of what you're talking about  But I think it's it it's gonna leave the country weaker overall in my estimation

Speaker: Eric Geller
Transcript:  you know when particularly because it's hard for small news organizations to  Have the funds to pay interns, right?  I mean there's there's a lot of just a discourse in the news business about the need to pay interns so that you can have  a more diverse candidate pool so that you can foster journalists from  different backgrounds that's difficult to do if you are  Paying your operations, um, but don't have a lot left over and so, you know legacy media organizations  Have a lot of money in the budget and if they can put some of it toward  Paying interns to get them their foot in the door  You know that that is one thing that for better or worse legacy organizations can generally find money if people at the top  Want to do it now, that's a separate question  But to be a cnn to be in new york times means that if you decide that you want to pay your interns  That's no problem for you, right?  If you're a smaller organization, no matter how great your journalism is  You could want to pay your interns the same as a senior reporter  But you just don't probably have the money for that in in most cases  And so it means that there's fewer places for a young person to go when they're getting into this industry  I would however say to to leo's point about trusting certain news organizations and and not trusting others  I think the new model for being a savvy news consumer is trusting specific reporters  Because there there is so much churn in the industry, right?  So if you say I know this person and I trust them and i'll follow them wherever they go  Then you know that this person is not suddenly going to become untrustworthy  No matter where they are  They're going to still do the journalism that you respect them for and so that can be a shorthand for you to still get high quality  Journalism without having to figure out if this entire company has a slant that you agree or disagree with excellent point

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah  In fact, that's kind of what you were doing brianna because when I did wall street journal and I don't trust them anymore  You mentioned four names of people you do trust and I do trust them as well  And so yeah, I think that's exactly how we should do it eric. I think that's  That's really smart and unfortunately, uh until recently  Big media did not want big bylines because that's expensive  So it's going to be up to us as individuals to find those names and find those voices and sometimes it might not be  The washington post the new york times it might be a substack or or a ghost blog  Um, do you think brianna's point about?

Start time: 2188.90
End time: 2243.75
Speaker: Jason Koebler
Transcript:  Yeah, I I think brianna's point about um  Sort of the inside jokes of a site like autopian is a is a really good one though because  A lot of the most popular substacks are incredibly niche and they're like they're they're hyper specific  And if you're not interested in that topic, you're unlikely to subscribe to it, obviously  Uh, and I think that that is a big concern if you have all of these  hyper specific  media outlets writing to a couple thousand people  You know, how does a story break through you might see you might see something every now and then you know crop through to the mainstream  and affect policy, etc, but you also then have  people who are getting their news from  You know just a variety of substacks about hyper niche things and then aren't able to follow some of the bigger through lines that connect  All of these niche topics

Transcript:  So so if it's a story if it's an important story, I think people are gonna  Pick it up and in a way, that's the  Market of ideas a marketplace of ideas if it's if it's niche and nobody's interested then the people who are most interested  We'll know it and the rest of us will just  Blithely go on our way without knowing it. I think these inside things are as voice and I think voice is really important  That's the other side of having following a person  You also follow their voice and you want to hear their voice and know their voice.

Transcript:  No, that's fine  you know this is part of what made twitter so valuable when it was in its heyday is that if you are a  One person shop as a journalist and you've got your substack and you break some news in a pre twitter era  It's very unlikely that that will ever make it to the editors at the new york times  But if I have five followers and I tweet out this link and two of them retweet it  There's a good chance that that will make its way up the chain of journalism through a social media website until somebody at the new  York times says hey we should dig into this too and in a world where there aren't where isn't that critical mass on one site  I don't know that that's going to happen as frequently

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a good argument though for why we need something like that. Not necessarily is the  Uh  The place you read those articles  But the place you keep your finger on the pulse of the zeitgeist like what are people talking about and I think that's absolutely  How I use twitter and I bet most people who read twitter maybe don't post twitter  That's what it was most valuable for if somebody if you heard somebody died you'd say oh you'd go right to twitter  Um now it's very fragmented

Transcript:  One of the things we're really working on for this  Election cycle is the democratic party is looking at the sinking ratings for cnn and msnbc  And yeah traditionally this has been where at least half of the money for a campaign has been spent  There'll be over a billion dollars spent on this presidential election this uh, you know in 2024  Probably more like 1.2 more 1.3 1.4 billion  Um, and at least half of that is going to go to television ads  The democratic party is looking at the ratings for cable news  And for local news is realizing holy crap people are not tuning into this anymore  How can we get our message out and that's why they're finally investing in the project i'm doing  Which is a streamer project, you know taking uh people like destiny and vosh and you know young turks and majority report  More seriously as news organizations that millions of people watch that they need to go get their message out on  You know my friend taylor lorenz  Uh, she very famously has been she's been shouting this from the hill for the last decade about how younger people  Do not read news. They do pay attention to influencers and if you're interested in getting a story out there  You've got to be talking to influencers and you know the the future. Oh god. I hate that word influencers  I know that is the reality. I hope she's wrong on that one  And it's objectively right and studies have proven it. So I think about where the politics is going as a whole

Transcript:  remember 2016  Sure where where donald trump and brad parscale particularly?  won an election arguably  2016 didn't win the popular vote but won the election through a strategy on facebook of hundred dollar ad buys  Yeah  That was a very interesting point of view and that wasn't influencers, but that was highly targeted small ad buys  That were very very effective  Uh, I mean, I don't I think through stolen information  You know, I don't think it turns out that cambridge analytical thing was maybe a little overblown  Um, they didn't have to steal information. All they had to do was say facebook. I want uh, you know high school educated  Middle-aged guys living in  Appalachia and i'm going to show them this ad and it's going to try it's targeted highly targeted  It's going to do very well with them  No one else is going to see nobody in the city is going to see that ad those those people are going to get different  That really worked  So I think that this that's very old school the idea we're going to spend a billion dollars on cbs  Or or your or in the case of statewide campaigns on our local radio station, by the way, I used to work in radio that  Can't every two years big windfall with political ads  Because but that's going to go away.

We're gonna we have to do what you know, what you're doing jason  Uh, and and actually the messenger is doing it too  Reach out to our audience and get them to fund what we do  But I think that's a good thing. I don't I don't see that as a bad thing at all  Why why is that bad brianna? Why do we want mass media?

It's that you know  You know neil steveson wrote about this in the diamond age where you know  This is the diamond age is a story about what happens after the snow crash world and they're trying to figure out how to make  Society work again and the victorians one of the lessons they take is it's not necessarily good for society  For everybody to read a different newspaper every single day like because it's hard to find a consensus on what people believe  Everyone's leaving in their own reality. It's hard to like set a national group of priorities  We're kind of seeing that aren't we? Yeah today. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so I think I think it's good and it's bad  I think if you are  You know a lgbt person. I think it's good that media exists to get out the stories about your rights

Propaganda being susceptible propaganda and that we all kind of bought into the same story because it was told so convincingly  Drummed into our head by mainstream media that we believed it  That doesn't mean it's a it's the best way to go. I agree. It's hard for a politician to know where to spend their ad dollars  But I don't care about that  That is not on my agenda  The only problem is this now puts the burden on the consumer  the reader the listener to  Find those voices they trust and to go out and look around instead of just saying well i'm gonna go to channel four  Uh, and that's there's definitely a discover ability issue. I mean

You're I want to talk to your audience  You know, and it's discover ability. That's I mean eric brought this up earlier, but it's like twitter was a spot  where at least  It's like people on the left people on the right people in the center were all on the same platform  Just basically doing battle all day every day  and it wasn't always that the best idea is one but  You could be certain that if you did something  Noteworthy it would like rise to the top of twitter as and it would become a conversation it would get an audience  now it's like I think that the  uh  Most number of followers anyone has on blue sky is like 200k or something like that two or three hundred thousand and it's like  That's fine. Blue sky is fine mastodon is fine threads is fine, but  When people are splitting their time across all of these things discover ability becomes an issue and it becomes an issue for  Someone like me where am I going to have my own persona on 15 different social media networks?  And am I going to put myself?  You know, is it going to be unique on each of them?  Am I going to put my heart and soul into like growing an audience on blue sky and mastodon and twitter and on the website and  tiktok and instagram and a podcast like that's  That's what i've been doing the last week. I've been posting to all of these things and it's been fun  But I don't know how long I can  Keep that up in an authentic way. No, you have to start automating some of those things

Obviously and it's already so hard for those stories to break through  And get people to take them seriously like I can think of very few natsec issues that people care about less than cyber security, right?  So I don't think it helps the situation when it's more fragmented  When you've got the best reporters that are out there working for smaller publications and they're just praying  That the new york times is going to cover something and then cable news will cover it and there'll be some angle enough that twitter  And facebook and blue sky and mastodon and all these other things will somehow grab that story and get people to understand it  Like let's just be honest here the thing that twitter and the twitter-like products are good at  Is snarking on people it's good at making you the worst version of yourself just a flaming anger all day long

Transcript:  The real problem is mastodon especially is not a promotional place  It is a place where you have conversations and if you're trying to promote a product  Mastodon is not the place to do it if you want to have a conversation with people. It's a great place  to do it and  I kind of prefer that for my social network, but yeah our our marketing department may not be happy  on mastodon  Um, in fact, i'm pretty sure they're not um  I I know I think in the in the long run it's a net positive  Because I just and maybe this is very old-fashioned as I said polyana ish  But I just think the more voices the better. Yeah, it makes a lot more noise  But at least everybody has a voice  And it's not somebody in an office building  In midtown manhattan making a decision for all of us about what's important  Yeah  That doesn't seem like a very good way to do it either

Transcript:  I I think you need a balance of  the ability for anybody to get into the conversation and the ability of people who have demonstrated critical thinking skills  To have some informal moderating role in that conversation, right?  So so you need some ability for people who have degrees in very complex subjects  To be able to not just say well that's wrong  But then to get that debunking picked up and taken seriously and amplified as opposed to the guy who doesn't have the degree  And is just lying saying this is totally true  Just trust me and then that gets amplified a system that can't distinguish between those two types of people even if it's in an informal way  I'm not saying that there should be some  Twitter run service of you get to be trusted you don't but informally there's got to be some way for  Expertise to play a role in circulation

Oh, yeah, you mean somebody went to med school and studied this stuff those medical elites  Yeah, i'm not gonna listen to them  But that's the world we live in now as people don't like expertise they're actively  avoiding expertise  So I think there's good signals if you are looking for expertise there's signals you can I mean for what it's worth  You can trust academic credentials  publishing in peer-reviewed  magazines things like that  Experience somebody's been you know doing something for 23 years probably knows a little bit about it  But we've got a much bigger problem where people as true expertise  And say I you know, I I just I much I just saw a poll  actually on this  Where the majority of people would prefer somebody  Who doesn't have any expertise they prefer quote common sense  to expertise  By a large margin. Let me see if I can find that  That's the world we live in now and that's part of the reason we have a problem

Transcript:  And from another relatively new publication started in may with the messenger senior cyber security reporter eric geller  Great to have all three of you  I can't this is a perfect group to talk about this  This episode of this week at tech is brought to you by collide. We're talking about a lot about authentication  you know logging in and a lot of people use octa as a way of  Single sign-on or two-factor authentication  But there's one more step  One little extra step you might want to add to your octa authentication and that's collide  Collide is a device trust solute device. Listen to this device trust solution for companies with octa  Collide ensures if a device isn't trusted and secure it can't log into your cloud apps  If you work in security or it and your company's using octa, this is a message for you  If there is one thing in common with all the breaches and all the hacks we hear about lately  It's the employees now. I don't I don't want to dis employees  But but honestly that's that's the tax surface these days sometimes an employee's device gets hacked because of unpatched software look at last pass  one of their  Devs one of their system  Administrators had an unpatched version of plex  Running on his network that was all it took for the hacker to get into his computer and then get into last passes network  Sometimes an employee leaves sensitive data in an unsecured place their public key and their private key  In the download folder happens all the time  and of course  All the time spear phishing hackers break in using credentials. They fish for an employee  The problem though. I don't want to say I don't blame the employees. It's not the end users  It's the solutions you're using to prevent those breaches  It doesn't have to be that way  You're using octa to authenticate your employee add collide to authenticate. It's the device  the hardware  The imagine a world where only secure devices can access your cloud apps fish credentials are useless to hackers  You can manage every os including linux mac windows all from one single dashboard  And one of the things i've always loved about collided it enlists your employees  As part of your security team, they fix their own device security issues  They learn how they learn why they become part of the team and it doesn't create more work for your it team  Well, this is not a world you have to imagine this is a world that exists when you start using collide  K-o-l-i-d  E visit collide.com slash twit book on demand demo today. Look at the demo see how it works  K-o-l-i-d-e collide.com  slash twit for companies that use octa you gotta have collide let me thank you so much for their support of  This week in tech you support us too, by the way when you use that address, so please do  collide.com slash  twit  ronan farrow whose the last target  Was harvey weinstein  ronan ronan's pieces in the new yorker really  Took made the me too movement take off  He has  Re-aimed his canon now. He's talking about elon musk  The story elon musk's shadow rule how the u.s  Government came to rely on the tech billionaire and now is struggling to rein him  In farrow points out in the article that it's, you know, historically, you know, john d rockefeller jr  You know supported the league of nations. There's been a long history of billionaires  Getting involved to mention william randolph first  Using his newspapers to start to foment the spanish-american war  During world war one jp morgan lent vast sums to the allied powers. So this is not new  But it's a little scary  he says musk  Took advantage of a vacuum created by government pulling out of for instance the space race  And musk moving in  and uh and creating dominance space x  has launched more  Satellites than every other country every other commercial entity combined by a factor of 10 10 times more satellites in china  They just put uh four more people up on the space station  We used to use russia to supply the space station now  We're using space x and the problem is  that the ukraine  Army also uses space x for their frontline battle communications  It costs according to ronan farrow 400 million dollars a year  uh  Initially, I remember elon says i'll give it to you for free and then elon calls the defense department says hey  This is killing me here. You gotta pay up  the threat being that he would  disconnect frontline forces from their comms  And and effectively end the war  And so the department of defense is handling elon  with kid gloves

Transcript:  I think the the issue that this raises is it's far more disturbing than just not having an invoice paid, you know elon  um, you know, obviously during the obama administration  Russia illegally annexed at kremia, right?  Which is part of ukraine and now the current war going on is a continuation of that where vladimir putin is trying to take  over the rest of ukraine, right?  Um, so what happens is those telecommunications are geofenced so as soon as they cross that border ukrainians cross the border  Into their own territory elon musk has decided they're not going to have frontline communication meaning battlefield commanders  Uh cannot order strikes or pass intelligence back and forth. Uh, you know, we've had network-centric warfare of last uh, you know  20 years  Which really puts that kind of total intelligence environment  And uh, uh, like our our warfare is based around that where are the targets?  Where do we send cruise missiles? Where do we attack? Where do we send drones to?  um, and elon musk is really  in this position because we have chosen  to not uh  Basically defund nasa and to not play a role in putting this telecommunications equipment into space ourselves  Where this billionaire gets to decide who wins and loses this war?

That's exactly correct in ways even more troubling and  Farah points this out in the piece is there are very valid concerns  about uh musk's  Relationship with putin I personally found his talking points on the crimea  Really disturbing because they are word for word, uh repeating russian propaganda, uh straight from the kremlin in this article

Transcript:  There is a there's a throughput through all of this where you know america america's government decides to under invest in a certain industry  Right, whether it's electric cars or telecommunications equipment or space infrastructure  All of these things musk moves into the space  And creates a company that kind of creates a near monopoly, right?  This is a pattern. This is exactly why we've had to move to uh, you know, uh electric car companies using the tesla standard  Uh, and that's exactly right up in recent months. That's exactly right elon has built all the infrastructure nationwide for charging

He was treated like a visiting celebrity, uh with flattery and feasts  Yeah, he met with senior officials including china's foreign minister  Pose for photos the awkwardly smiling formal photos that are more typical of world leaders  Now partly this is because of a vacuum created by uh american  politics  Believing in uh, you know for the free market as opposed to government investment  but partly it's because of uh elon's uh  I guess you could say business acumen  Moving into those arenas. I mean you you can't fault him for building building a  Very very successful business in the absence of uh government  investment  But at this point good reason. Yeah, go ahead at this point where he's got us over a barrel  And his motives again may not just be what's best for america or what's best even for ukraine

Transcript:  It's what's this why I have such a problem with when people say oh just ignore elon  Like it doesn't matter what it does. You can't he's critical infrastructure. I mean this article shows that he's he's been  Building he is america's access to space and he has internet that can he can turn on and off  And a whim and it's not I mean there's a point in this article where it's not like you're dealing with north arp grumman  or one of these massive companies that  you know  have been working with the u.s. Government for decades and decades and have  Probably more standard ways of sort of doing things. It's like there's the one guy  There's elon you call him up and you kiss his feet and beg him to keep the internet on and hope  You know hope he's having a good day, I guess and that's a really scary. That's part of it position to be he's very mercurial

Transcript:  He seems to lie a lot  We don't really know what his motives are. It doesn't even seem to be making money. I mean he threw 44 billion  dollars away, uh pretty  easily  Um  Yeah, i just ronan farrow does not have an answer in this article. It's uh, it's just here's what's here's what here's what it is  And you know, it's easy to make to blame. I mean I blame the fcc for letting  SpaceX put 42 000 satellites in low earth orbit. I mean, I think that in hindsight was a bad idea  I celebrated it at the time because I thought oh, this is great.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Uh points out a lot of um in 2018 the times reported that members of the tesla board had grown concerned about musk's  Use of the prescription sleep aid ambient which can cause hallucinations the wall street journal reported earlier this year. He uses ketamine  Uh common depression treatment party drug  uh  Elon has not admitted it, but i've talked to people who have done ketamine with elon  And he doesn't have to admit it. It's it's a known  It's a known fact  um  He said from what i've seen with friends ketamine taken occasionally is better than ssris may be true  But it also can cause a kind of erratic behavior  um and uh  farrow interviewed a leading ketamine researcher gosh darn it another expert  Who said a little bit of ketamine has a similar effect to alcohol it can cause disinhibition  Where you do and say things you otherwise would not  And sounds familiar at higher doses. It has another effect which is  Disassociation you feel it detached from your body and surroundings  You could feel grandiose and like you have special powers  Or special talents people do impulsive things  They could do inadvisable things at work. The impact depends on the kind of work for a librarian  There's less risk if  If you're a evil genius billionaire well big problems  No, he actually said if you're a airline pilot, but still similar  um  I don't know. You know, this is another example where there's no answer to this  It's just the world as we uh, as we know it

Start time: 4088.40
End time: 4139.18
Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  Why I think there's a very clear answer. I mean first of all, um, you know if you're talking about telecommunications  infrastructure in space, um, you know, I don't care if we save a few dollars with having  Spacex send up a rocket or not if you're talking about national security  We need the capability to put that up ourselves  As far as oversight in who gets to put all kinds of sample satellites in an orbit  We need a better process for that spacex should not have a total monopoly in putting that infrastructure into space  Uh, you know, I think the pentagon and our national security apparatus needs to  Have a piece of that pie itself and the good news is we are investing in that infrastructure  But this is this is going to be a long term infrastructure play  To make sure that we are not so reliant on someone that's undermining our own national security interests

Start time: 4140.10
End time: 4231.58
Speaker: Eric Geller
Transcript:  There are ways for the for the government to kind of use regulatory tools and i'm sorry for bringing up regulatory tools on podcast  No, I think we have to  You know the the the the infrastructure bill had a ton of money for things like electric vehicle charging infrastructure  And one of the things that the government said was if you want this money  You have to promise that the charging infrastructure that you build  Will be interoperable so that I can bring any car and I can charge it. It's a tesla charger  That's great. If I don't have if I have a non tesla car  I still have to be able to charge there and so texas I think it was recently  Which is going to get the largest share of this of this particular pot of money  Agreed basically to sort of capitulated almost to the white house and said yes  Give us the money. We agree that we will make these companies  Add interoperability into the charging infrastructure because we desperately want this money  We want to be a place where you can drive your tesla or you can drive your other ev  And plug it in at any stop along the road  So that's one way for the government to kind of use again the power of the purse to say we are the titan in the room  We are the we're the funding source behind everything. I thought it was interesting  We're talking earlier about how you know elon musk built space x and tesla in a in a in a void of government investment  Well government investment is the reason that those companies exist at the current stature governor  They are the primary customer for a lot of these things in addition, of course to early stage grant funding  So the government does still have some power  The question of course is whether the people in power want to use the power right or throw their dollars

Transcript:  towards a  private industry  And I guess really that's the real issue is there's been this ideological move towards privatization  And and that's the real problem once it's once it's private industry. You don't really control it  I guess you might with your if they need continued funding  It's interesting your interpretation of the texas story  Varies a little bit from reuters interpretation  Reuters says exclusive tesla wins as as texas requires state-backed charging stations to include its plug  So it's both it's ccs and nacks  But uh, I guess it was just going to be ccs and then the texas  Legislator said, you know, we really ought to have tesla's and nacks connector as well  In effect that made nacks the new national standard and ford gm. Rivian  Many other car makers said okay. We're going to make sure our future vehicles also are in nacs  Um, which means at least according to sammable sam at our car guy the end of ccs charging in the next five to ten years  And tesla and by the way the stock market also believed there was a win for tesla because their stock went up that day 1.2  Oh my gosh, it was a win. It was a big win  um  Yeah  All right  What else?  Let's change the subject. How about this?  more billionaires at work  For the longest time since 2017, you know, we we're about an hour away about 60 miles  Uh west of a county called solano county. It's one of the nine bay area  Counties, but it's primarily agriculture. It's beautiful rolling hills kind of arid. There's one two lane freeway that leads there nothing else  But for some reason since 2017  Somebody oh there is one thing there travis air force space  Since 2017 somebody's been buying up land  All around travis air force space when I first became aware of this story  There was some concern that this might be a nation state like china  surrounding  travis air force space  Uh with uh their own property so they could surveil it or whatever. Turns out no it wasn't china  Uh, in fact, it was a company  Called flannery associates  Spent 800 million dollars  To buy tens of thousands of acres  And who is flannery associates? It's mike moritz  Vc funder reid hoffman founder of linkedin mark andresen the guy who created netscape now  Of course has his own venture fund chris dixon  It's the uh, the collison  brothers who started stripe  They're they're buying up this  Deserted land, uh  To make a special city  They're gonna they their plan the investment is in theory to create  a uh a beautiful  Uh city in uh in the north bay area  Let me see if I can find the description here of of this city  Uh where people live beautifully thousands of residents  Tens of thousands of residents with clean energy public transportation  Dense urban life in the middle of bum  Nothing nowhere  Um, I guess you could build a highway to it from san francisco. I mean, there's certainly a housing crunch in san francisco  lorraine powell jobs steve jobs widow is also an investor nate friedman  daniel gross  Uh 800 million dollars some of this land at first they were buying it cheap  But then word got around with the farmers. Hey, somebody's buying up the land and they were spending as much as 10 to 20 times  the normal value  for this land  one problem  It's zoned for agricultural not residential  And uh, that could be a problem because it's not easy to change the zoning  So they're gonna have to they think their plan is to have a state initiative  You know, it's very easy in california to get something on the ballot  Just takes a few tens of thousands of signatures on the petition  So they want it solano county residents to say yes, we want to build the city of the future  Here in the solano county

I just want an island where we can do what we want  That's this that's this philosophy is we're technologists. We solve problems. We understand we're engineers  We don't let politics  mess with our heads  uh, just let us  Take over remember when covet hit apple and google said, oh yeah  We got this and they created the software  To notify you when you've been exposed and everybody with an android phone and an iphone had this  Supposedly had this software and if everybody used if everybody used it  Then you would always know if you were exposed. How did that work out?  That was silicon valley solution to the covet crisis  Yeah

Is there a loophole in the law what's going on?

Start time: 5281.72
End time: 5314.60
Speaker: Jason Koebler
Transcript:  So there's actually not a loophole in the law and after I published this everyone was like, okay  What's the angle here? What's the patch? Why why is apple doing this?  and  To know to know why apple's doing this you need to know a little bit about  Sort of the right to repair movement this all sort of stems out of a massachusetts law in 2012 for auto right to repair  um  That after that law happened the auto industry was basically like  We're just going to comply with the massachusetts law in the entire country. Yeah, that's why state laws can really make a difference

Transcript:  And so this uh this california law passed the california senate, I think 37 to zero  Uh, it was unanimous unanimously passed the senate  and apple has been taking these sort of incremental steps over the last few years to  provide repair parts and to essentially comply with most parts of the  California law and what I think is happening here is this is apple saying  Okay  This law feels inevitable  We already have to comply with the one in minnesota  Let's let's back this one in our home state  we're not going to be able to uh fight this legislation in all of the dozens of states that are pushing these  These laws through or at least advancing it kind of like uh that quarter game  At the arcade where all of the quarters are getting pushed toward the ledge  It's like we're about to see this thing where all the quarters fall off and you get 30 or 40 different laws in 30 or 40  Different states and that would be a nightmare not just for apple  But for all electronics manufacturers where they have to comply with different sets of laws in different states  And so what I think is happening here is this is apple saying this is the law  We're happy to come we're quote unquote happy to comply with it. We've been dragged kicking and screaming to this point  but  Maybe if we endorse this law the other states will  Say, okay, we'll try to pass the exact identical language in our state and  That's kind of where it will stop

Start time: 5443.72
End time: 5534.80
Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  That is my theory at least I I have a less cynical take on this  Which is if you look at since apple started to really get in the uh, the mess  For their right to repair, uh, like third power third party repair, uh infrastructure stuff  If you look generally speaking at the technology they've been putting into products like the iphone with you know touch id or  You know secure enclave and all of that  I think they could tell that this is where the industry was going and they started to kind of bake into their parts  Cyber security like I mean not 100 mitigation, but at least ways to make sure  You know, this is a valid part that you're putting in here  Can we really think through hardware wise what would look like if you put something in the middle to detect this signal  They they've kind of had enough time now to really think about their products and to kind of figure out how a third party repair person  Uh being in this  How to make everything still like more secure there, right? Because this is inevitable as you said  Also really important to remember they still control the uh, you know the parts the parts apply 100 top to bottom  No matter who repairs it, which is a huge operational control on this  So I I kind of like this is a pattern you see over and over with apple like they get a goal in mind  And they start like moving their product line towards it and then five years later  You're suddenly like rushing towards it. So that's kind of my read on it. There's also the eu

Start time: 5535.92
End time: 5606.19
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Uh, and and more and more apple is kind of being beat down by the eu. I think they've  Kind of acknowledged you're gonna have to put type c connectors in their iphones this year and  Uh, you know  I think at this point it's really encouraging that governments are actually having some influence  On these big tech companies and yeah, this is good for apple. It's good for consumers  The way apple does right to repair. It's ridiculous  You may remember micah sergeant ordering  the the special kit  That included thousands of dollars worth of equipment that comes in giant pelican cases  They sent the kit  But they didn't send the part he was gonna put the battery into his iphone. He waited he waited the the part  Came the day after we had to send the kit back or get charged 1500 bucks for the kit  So as the kit is being sent back  The fedex guy knocks on the door and says here's your battery, sir  It didn't work out that well and I really felt like at the time apple is this is very grudging compliance that apple's saying  All right, if you want to repair it  See what you're gonna need

Start time: 5607.32
End time: 5661.98
Speaker: Jason Koebler
Transcript:  but i'm glad brianna brianna brings up a really good point about parts pairing and about uh,  Sort of the cyber security aspect of this because that that is something that people have pointed out since this news has come out earlier  this week  um  There's still a lot of yeah parts pairing issues software issues like apple still has a huge amount of control over that and so  This is apple giving a concession, but they still have a huge level of control. And so maybe they eventually decided  You know, this is not  this is not going to impact us that much and then the other thing i'll mention is a lot of the  Repairs that are happening now like that sort of leading edge of repair is board level repair  Where you're you doing micro soldering like, you know, yeah, apple's not doing that. They're charging you 1500 bucks for your motherboard  Exactly. And so, um, this is not something that apple is going to be offering through this like they're not going to be offering

That's a  I just I feel cruises, uh cruises responses over a hundred people lose their lives every day on american roadways and  Countless are badly injured  We believe it's clear cruise positively impacts overall road safety  That's a crash here a crash there

Transcript:  I don't know. I feel like our like  You know one of the things I think that would really benefit, uh, the autonomous driving market would be regulatory clarity  I have a really good friend of mine that uh used to run venture capital firm for this here in massachusetts  And just went to china because he came to the conclusion if anyone is going to solve this  Uh, it's going to be the chinese because there is greater regulatory clarity  And you know what the roads look like and what the process is to be indemnified if there's a crash  You know what the expectations are and I think too often like even on this show sometimes when we talk about, you know regulation  It's always seen as a a bad thing  I think you can actually go the opposite way where if um, you know a tech company can really understand a path forward to  Develop a product where they're not going to be sued out of existence that can really be a positive, right?  So, um, I think tesla's trying to do something  Very very difficult. I think they're doing it with fundamentally flawed hardware  But I also think the the lack of clarity in what the path is to not get your pantsuit off  I think that's a really big hurdle

This guy's a freshman member of congress christo lucio from  pennsylvania's 17th district  Is is we often complain  And I know brianna you ran on the premise that our members of congress don't have a clue about technology  Uh, there there are a few ron wyden is one and uh,  I guess i guess christo lucio is he was the policy director at the university of pittsburgh's institute for cyber law policy and security  And while there, uh helped a local commission craft a report that  Led to according to eric a complete overhaul of voting machines  In and the area which is great. He also worked at the uh, nyu's brennan center for justice  Tell us about christo lucio. I want we should celebrate when we get some members of congress who know what they're talking about

Start time: 6094.60
End time: 6292.08
Speaker: Eric Geller
Transcript:  Well, you know when I when I cover cyber security and it's such a technical topic and it can be so dense and particularly covering  It with a focus on policy  You have to make it about the real world impact on regular people  You have to make it something that people can understand without a degree or a comp tia certification  And I I try to make it as much as possible about the people who are involved particularly  You know we hear about a lot about sort of washington as this monolith, you know, washington is messing this up or whatever  When it comes to tech and cyber  For the most part these folks really don't have personal experience with this stuff  They're doing what their staffers are telling them or perhaps they're doing what the lobbyists are telling them  So I try to highlight when folks actually come in with an understanding of this stuff or in the case of center-wide  You know, they develop an experience with it christo lucio is a really interesting person because he's a he's a freshman  So this is his first term in congress  But he has a lot of experience in a policy context thinking about why it matters that you know  There are only four or five companies that make the vast majority of american voting machines  And why there are no federal rules that require them to have any kind of security precautions on these voting machines  This is really all done at the state level and a state can choose  Not to require any of this stuff  And it basically comes down to who has the strongest requirements who has the weakest  Not necessarily the way that we would want to set up this system if we started from scratch  He has experience with this. He studied this he's looked at this  He's also worked on issues like disinformation and how we can try to get the companies to do things differently. We were talking about this earlier  And what he was saying is basically  You know  He worked with state and local election officials day in and day out as they tried to understand  How safe their voting machines were and what he saw and this should not surprise folks is  For the most part these people had no idea how to ask the right questions of these voting machine companies  Do you use two-factor authentication for the administrator portal to get into the unofficial election result database?  Where you post the results on election night?  It's not the official results  But if somebody can hack that they can cause a panic and potentially in this day and age that can lead to real world harm  As we've seen riots break out over misinformation on social media. So this is incredibly important  it's all done at the state and local level the federal government has basically abandoned any sort of  Responsibility to regulate this there are agencies that will give advice to the companies about what you should do  But they're not requiring it  They're pushing it to these local election clerks who don't know how to do this stuff  And he actually wrote a basically a how-to guide  What questions should you be asking when you're going out there to buy new voting machines? What should you be looking for?  And he was talking about how it's time for washington to step up. It's time for congress to pass  Legislation that sort of sets uniform standards so that you don't have to worry whether you live in massachusetts or california or idaho  You don't have to worry is your voting machine producing a paper record  So you actually have durable proof of how that vote was cast  You don't have to worry about all kinds of security issues right now  You have to kind of figure it out for yourself. Look up what kind of equipment you're using and what standards it's meeting  So I think he's an interesting example of somebody who has this prior experience and is coming into this place that is not known  For being up on the latest tech and cyber  Policy news and he's trying to change that along with you know a handful of other folks. So he's someone to watch

Transcript:  Yeah, he's very interesting because the administration the biden administration is really pushing for that law to be re-approved without major changes  And he comes in in this interview with me and basically says  i'm not quite convinced by the argument that the government is making which is basically the short version is  If we don't renew this law without changes, we're going to lose a really important source of information about cyber attacks in this country  We learn a lot about what the the other countries are doing to us in cyberspace by using this power to spy on them  And he basically said i'm not convinced that this is such a critical tool  So it's it's an interesting kind of tension between a new democratic member of congress and and the democratic president in his uh, in this piece

Transcript:  You say he says we were not thinking about privacy when 702 was created 15 years ago  Alongside security in the way that we do now  And I think it's appropriate to readdress it and say, you know, how can we make 702 better if you if we want to  Uh reaffirm it. How do we make it better? I think it's appropriate brian. I'm sure you have a lot to say about this

Transcript:  I was just gonna say I think it's it's really interesting in this country  Look, I think no one that looks at election security would would claim that we invest the kind of resources into this that we need  At the same time the fact that you know all 50 states and then even you know  Sub counties within those states all have their own election systems and processes  In in some ways, it's so distributed. It it does part of the strength faith  It does I mean and you can look at individual like circuit clerks offices, right?  And you'll go down there and you'll find like me windows me running and the infrastructure has not been updated in many years  That's something we should very clearly appropriate more federal dollars for  but I I think so I think there are ways to take the strength of  You know states running the elections in a way that makes sense to them to take that strength and also have some federal guidelines  um  For what kind of technology you can use I think if there's an argument against uh,  Public code auditing for for voting machines. I have never seen it. I think there's no excuse for this to be a black box  I I think like obviously  Cyber security people should be able to go look at that code and give you confidence in the results and you know  The the issues you're raising like two-factor authentication for  Administrator functions. I think that's something we need a mandate for so  um, I think there's a way to to keep the strengths here, but also  Have a little bit more federal oversight in it in a way that will give the public more confidence in the outcome

Transcript:  I mean, it's just such an interesting space because a lot of other aspects of technology, you know  pcs and and even cars now they've kind of the the companies have made peace with the idea that there are going to be people tinkering  And meddling and trying to find problems and especially the computer makers decades ago  We're very very against the idea of creating programs to let hackers look at the code  Look at the technology tell them if there's a problem and potentially get a reward for alerting them to a critical flaw  The voting industry is kind of the last bastion of resistance to this idea  And so it's very interesting to watch kind of the resistance from these companies and they've been opening up a little bit under sustained pressure  Including from the government but a lot of them still don't really feel comfortable  Letting these hackers these unvetted hackers come in and look at this equipment and for a long time what they have been able to  Successfully say is we're different. We are the architecture of democracy  You cannot let random people look at this code  Now the response of course from the security professionals is they're already doing that  You can buy voting machines on ebay and open them up and see what's in them  Yeah, they did at DEFCON last year with the voting machine village, you know, they did it they did it  I was just there a couple weeks ago watching some of the machines that they were pulling apart  I mean this stuff is happening already. Yeah

Speaker: Eric Geller
Transcript:  Absolutely. I mean first of all a lot of like state and local government agencies that do this work didn't know  There was any federal support available for them in 2016 and after  The after dhs the department of homeland security said we're going to call elections critical infrastructure  Which opens up a new role for us to help them  You started to see local clerks get to know for example the cyber security agency cisa  Which you just mentioned they started to form partnerships with fbi cyber experts  You also saw non-profit groups start to come in provide money provide expertise. We have absolutely progressed significantly  Since 2016. Um part of that of course was the tech companies for a while  Felt pressure to do more to fight misinformation and to root out hackers using the platform  So we'll see if that continues to degrade but absolutely in a lot of other areas  Sometimes it's just as simple as knowing who to call if you see something suspicious on your network  You would be stunned folks watching this show would probably be stunned how much that is the problem you get into a crisis  You've been hacked. You don't know who to call at the federal or state level to get help that has been  Dramatically reduced as a problem across the country that is much much less of a problem those relationships exist today  So we are definitely better off than we used to be

That's that's great. What's what's currently what's the status of that?

Transcript:  So it's it's just been introduced. Um, one of the things I think is interesting  It is a republican congresswoman who's pushing for for regulation of federal contractors, which is not something you see every day  But it goes back to this idea that the government relies on private companies for so much more than we used to we outsource  It we outsource human resources from federal agencies  To these private companies and folks who watch this show or listen to this show might know the name solar winds  This is a company that provided oh boy it software to federal agencies fortune 500 companies  They were hacked and that opened a door to their customers  So what this is trying to do it's not going to solve the problem in one fell swoop  But it is going to put more eyes on this code so that you don't have what are called supply chain attacks getting into the ultimate target  By getting into an intermediary target first if you can cut down the number of attacks  You can cut down the ability of hackers to jump from one victim to another  And what this is doing is saying federal contractors are obviously a huge target because if you can get into them  You can get into the federal government. So this is trying to deal with that

Transcript:  By the way, it is an interesting. Um split. I mean, it's not completely  Left or right a lot of the people fighting against the renewal of section 702 of the faixa act  are in republicans in fact like  um  uh  josh, uh, what's his name josh holly holly i try to i try to blank his name out constantly but but  There is a post opposition on both sides of the aisle on 702, which is great.

End time: 6855.90
Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  If you understand this stuff you understand that is difficult to balance platforms and free speech  It's not all or nothing. It is a gradient and you've got to approach this thing and cyber security is the exact same way  It's not  like  Just like a completely locked down system or complete free for all  Right, like there's give and take here like good policy is about understanding all these perspectives and coming to something that addresses  The best needs so I just I completely reject this framing that it's left versus right. Look at matt gates

Transcript:  I think you're exactly right matt gates voted to reauthorize 702 back in 2018  Uh this year he says you couldn't waterboard me into voting to reauthorize 702  These 702 authorities were abused against people in washington on january 6th  Oh, okay, and they were abused against people who were affiliated with the blm movement. Oh, okay  I'm equally aggrieved by both those things even jim jordan  Uh is questioning 702 so that's good. I think that's a good thing. Go ahead. I'm sorry to interrupt

Transcript:  I was just gonna say eric  I'm glad you're doing these articles because you mentioned ron wyden earlier and I think it is important that people in dc  Understand the issues that they're talking about and for so long it was like oh you want to talk about privacy?  Go talk to ron wyden and he continues to do really excellent work, but the fact there's a new crop of of  lawmakers who  understand this stuff and who are  Talking about it in an intelligent way is is really hardening to see because you do  So much of the last few years has just been screaming about facebook censorship or like  These sorts of things but without a lot of substance behind it. I mean the tiktok hearings were horrifying  in terms of the level of  understanding among the um, you know folks running them and so  I don't know  I'm just happy you're doing this this work because i'm i'm really glad to see that there are some  Some people who are taking it seriously and who are actually trying to understand the issues

Start time: 6942.58

Transcript:  And part of it is just communication, right? It's not the easiest subject to explain  I mean, that's why I like doing it is because  Finding new ways to make this relevant to regular people is interesting and it  Challenges me to explain it in a more interesting way  So for congress for members of congress to grab this and make this an issue that they care about  That that says a lot because it's not the sexiest issue  You're not talking about health care or even education or or even simple military issues where you can understand a tank rolling across the battlefield  This is just not as tactile  And so when people take this on I I think it's worth spotlighting that that we have folks who are trying to communicate about this  To their folks back in their district

Transcript:  I don't know if I agree with you on that just in the sense with my current job is working a lot with younger people  Um, or you know canvassing like we're directly working with some of the biggest uh, twitch streamers to basically get their audiences activated for this election  And I have to tell you when it comes to like social media policy  Or open expression policies  Um, you know or even cyber security they are  Exponentially more keyed in than I think the average voter my age would be so  Um, I do think there's a growing electorate that understands, uh, the technology is our it's our our open square, right?  Yeah, this is where we talk about things today

Speaker: Eric Geller
Transcript:  Absolutely, it definitely skews by age and I think what you're seeing now is  You have to you have to message to those young folks who are already kind of tech savvy and naturals at this  But if you want to get people to support you on, you know your stance on a cyber security issue  You frankly have to get them to understand it  In in you know people in their 50s people in their 60s people who have never used social media  That is still the most politically influential slice of the united states electorate and uh, it's changing  But for now you do still have to communicate to those folks and the one thing that does hit people no matter what their age  Is ransomware so you constantly see these these ransomware attacks on schools on hospitals  People can't get their elective surgeries done because the unit is shut down because their computers don't work, right?  I mean think about the not petcha malware attack  You know the the shipping around the world was paralyzed because the computers at these ports could not bring in cargo containers  Shipping was paralyzed for a significant amount of time for some of these big companies because of this cyber attack  Not because of a ground invasion or a nuclear strike but because of this thing in the computer  So we're starting to see this affect regular people more  But it's still pretty scattershot as far as you know, has your son's school been ransomware?  Right. Did your daughter have to have to have to cancel an elective surgery because of a cyber attack on a hospital that is still  Where it's hitting people the hardest?  We're not yet seeing that  It's widespread but it's not yet to the point where every single american is like well  This is this is in my top five issues and I don't know that it ever will be  But it's still a challenge to communicate about this to a lot of folks

It's more like a final fantasy active time battle system  Like everybody moves across the board at x number of spaces  The the real reason to play this is it is a very very deeply  Written game. That's truly one of the best fantasy stories i've ever like played through  Um, this is really rivaling dragon age as far as quality. So that's the reason people love it  Uh, it's been a long time since we had a really uh, good narrative game  Uh, especially with the uh, bio-ware layoffs that were announced this week  Uh, I think this is uh, the best we're gonna have for a while.

There's a really good argument that microsoft game pass has been very good for small-sized studios because it gives them a funding way to make a  You know 10 20 30 million dollar game in a way that couldn't have existed  Um, you know just a few years ago. So I do think it's good for smaller studios  Uh this particular model how long microsoft can keep it up. That's all another question then

Transcript:  They are not  Apparently making any money on xbox exactly  Exactly, but xbox game pass really is at least for people who want to try a lot of different games  um, the the best way to go because for a  Basically the cost of one triple a title a year  Or maybe two you get to play hundreds of games  And which is good for me because i'm not like paul therot where it's all it's calling duty or nothing  I do want to I you know, I play  You know, i've played balder's gate a little bit diablo 4 a little bit. I want to try them all out  And so game pass is a really good solution at least for those games. I'm looking forward to starfield which will be available  Uh day and day.

Yeah, he was morning bun  The supreme court in 2014  Ruled that phone searches your smartphone  require warrants  however  Subsequent court rulings have been unclear one way or another  There's a  a new  Ruling from the fifth circuit that scares me just a little bit the case  The case we talked we talked about it when it happened  immigration lawyer named Adam Malik crossed the border  from Mexico into Texas and  The Department of Homeland Security and the CBP the border patrol seized his phone  In response to mr. Malik's assertion of privilege, he's an attorney remember he said hey attorney client privilege  There's privileged communications on this device officer sullivan informed. Mr  Malik that the dhs was seizing the iphone and the digital contents would be searched  Officer sullivan did not disconnect the iphone from the internet or the communications network  He failed to take action would protect the iphone from accessing the internet or a communications network  He ordered mr. Malik to leave the deferred inspection area without the phone  While the phone was connected to the internet the reason that's important is because that's you could go through all the email  There's stuff the phone's connected to  And when it's unlocked you have access to it  Furthermore they kept the phone  For five months they sent it to a lab for forensic analysis bypassing the security features  extracting the phone's data  Sent the data to the dhs  They then used a filter team to screen out any privilege materials that took  uh conditional two months  Once the filter team had finished they provided the border officers in dallas with two thumb drives containing the data the filter team  Had determined was not privileged  Five months later. He gets his phone back. He sues  He says there was no warrant. There was no probable cause. I am in fact a member of global entry  He was  um  Fifth circuit said no  You're going across the border dude. You have no protection from the fourth amendment. No warrant is needed now  I have to point out there been  There's been case law on both sides of this. This is the most recent  Um, this is really bad news. We reported this story when it happened and it seemed to paw an appalling abuse of power  That because he was an immigration lawyer the dhs decided to effectively harass him

I think most people  Um understand the technology has unprecedented power in our lives and I think um, you know  even within the republican party nowadays, I think you you see a lot of uh,  You know suspicion over this kind of warrantless collection of information like this. So it seems to me that um,  This would be a very popular initiative to codify this in the law. It's it's truly baffling to me. We don't see more progress on this

I guess  The the the lesson from this is if you are crossing the border into the united states and I suppose it's true in other countries as well  Uh, you probably should carry  Uh, erase data disconnected from the internet  Um, maybe carry a dummy phone with you  He was not accused of any crime and in fact has not been charged with any crime

The government should not be able to sit down and and  Nobody should be able to tell me yeah your access to condoms or yas or plan b this stuff for crying out loud  So it's a freedom issue.
