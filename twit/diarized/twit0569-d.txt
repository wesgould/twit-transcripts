You don't have to go to, you don't have to stay in New Zealand.  You can live in New Zealand for a while and then go to Australia for a while.  And then you can go to wherever you move around.  I move around.  I was just, I lived for a month in Cuba.  I lived for a couple of months in Mexico.  But you're a writer.  So there's a difference because writing you can do anywhere.

I could do, I could record it and upload it.  It might take a day or two to upload, but I could do it anyway.  Believe me, I, uh, I'm thinking about it only because it just feels like we're  going to hell in a hand basket here.  I don't know why.  Is that me?  It's the election.  Apple's taking the headphone jack out of the iPhone.  That will not stand.  I mean, it just feels like it's all over.  It's all over.

End time: 629.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, that was our innovation is going to happen anyway.  Cause the Doppler, uh, here one, my God, that, that is that it's not finished yet,  but like the Doppler in like three or four years, this thing, this is the  thing that aims at you, right?  No, this is the thing you open up the app and you're like, I don't want to  hear the baby crying anymore.  And then silence the baby remotely.  You can like silence sirens.  You can turn up this, turn down that you can tailor exactly what you hear.  And the new one, you can, you know, stream your music and make phone calls and do  all the things you can do with a regular ear.  It's like fantasy.  It's 300 bucks, unfortunately.

Start time: 630.12

Start time: 633.72
End time: 666.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a replacement.  These kinds of this category of hearable.  They don't like that term, but I like it.  Hearable is there several multi-core processors in each earbud.  This is really sophisticated, uh, audio technology.  And I think it's all going in that direction.  It'll all get cheaper.  It'll get smaller.  The battery life is the new wearable.  Isn't it?  Yes.  And so it's like, this is what I want.  I want to never take them out.  I want to, I want to hear only what I want to hear kind of like, you know,  political opinions, whatever, whatever.

End time: 677.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But exactly.  But, but this ships by the end of the year and it's fantastic.  And then there are a few others.  There's a matter of, there's a lot of innovation.

Start time: 677.82
End time: 679.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have you used it?  No, no, I haven't.  So in principle, in principle, their previous product was impressive in multiple ways.  There are a few things about this product.  They're kind of parlor tricks.  You can have the Darth Vader voice and all kind of stuff, which is dumb.

Start time: 692.14
End time: 693.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 700.26
End time: 706.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, you know, the concept, you think so, Roberta dumb, would that be in gadget has spoken.  How about if, um, what do we do?

Start time: 706.62
End time: 708.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  Every voice.  Yeah.

Start time: 709.28
End time: 747.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everybody's like the enterprise, the pervy grandpa from the Simpsons.  Hello, my arms.  Everybody you saw like fries with that order.  Family guy, family guy.  So who's from?  Uh, yes.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Smart noise filters is really intriguing.  Um, yeah, problem, you know, it's easy for the Bose and other noise canceling  headphones to work with jet noise.  Cause it's a consistent sound at consistent frequencies.  They don't work well at all with voice or anything else.  So I'd be very curious how smart these smart noise filters are.  I guess an airplane engine is not so hard, but office chatter.  Can you really block that out?

Start time: 747.34
End time: 777.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can, because the way these things work, they work like noise cancellation,  where it is they essentially take in the noise and then they face it, oppose it.  And they do the same thing on the fly with specific frequencies.  So they don't have a generic, for example, the baby filters, the one everybody likes  is we've all been on those airplanes.  It doesn't generically filled out.  It listens for and identifies exactly what that specific baby is doing  and where it's doing it.  So the filtering in each earbud is different based on the location of  the baby and stuff like that.  It's pretty sophisticated.

Start time: 777.78
End time: 792.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I only reason I'm a little skeptical is because remember the Bragi Dash,  which was a Kickstarter for Bluetooth headphones.  Also $300.  Yeah. And they did a lot more, except that when you got them, they didn't do much.  Everybody I know who ordered them and the battery life on all these products is

Start time: 792.64
End time: 806.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  rubbish. Three, three hours, four hours max.  But, but I'm excited about the future of that.  I really think that having a lot of processing power in your ears and wearing  those things all the time is going to be pretty great in some unexpected ways.

Start time: 807.30
End time: 816.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is not, however, why Apple is removing the headphone jack.  No, it is not.  They want...  Will they do that, Roberto?  You work at it in gadget.  You know, you have to deal with this in some way.

Start time: 816.60
End time: 845.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, they might. Who knows?  It's Apple.  And the thing is that people keep bringing it up.  Well, you know, we have all these ports on our computers.  Well, the audio jack isn't essentially a computer port.  It's an audio jack.  It's a jack that's used by millions of products.  Everything, everything from sound boards to tape players to everything uses that audio  jack. And then to remove that, you're basically, you know, given a middle finger to an entire  industry that's been set up for I don't even know how long.  Are you familiar with Apple?

Start time: 846.28
End time: 848.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The middle finger to the entire industry is what they do.

Start time: 848.74
End time: 904.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you're also giving a middle finger to millions of users because, you know, if I get a  phone and I'm paying $20 a month, I can afford that.  You know, I'm not making a lot of money, but I want a smartphone.  Everyone has a smartphone is how you get your jobs.  However, one, you know, it's everyone's computer for the most part.  You know, these mobile phones and they say, OK, here's your computer that you can buy from us.  But all the things that you've been using since you were born to listen to music, you  can't use those anymore. Right.  We want you to use, you know, whatever insane beats headphones we have and then we'll give  it to like, you know, maybe some third parties will license it, you know, and gives them  control over who what will work and what will not work.  If they don't, if the next iPhone doesn't, if none of them have audio jacks, I'm not buying an  iPhone anymore. I think I do.  I use that's a real.  And I'm in a band.  I use that audio jack for a lot of stuff.  I use it to record.  You're a musician. There you go.  There you go. Yeah.  And yeah, it's ridiculous.  And if they're doing it, they've already done it.  You know, it's if they're not doing it, then yeah.

Start time: 905.12
End time: 917.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But watch, because I don't think it was a BuzzFeed or Businessweek.  It might even have been Businessweek.  This this the storyline that this is innovation.  That's what Apple's going to say.  We're innovating by taking out the iPhone jack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple is in a little tiff right now with Spotify.  I'm actually interested where you guys come down on this.  I think there's two reasonable points of view.  Spotify started the battle by complaining that Apple,  they sent a letter to Apple's legal counsel saying that Apple is rejecting  an update that Spotify has had waiting to be released in the iOS store,  causing quote, causing grave harm to users by doing so.  The letter says Apple and they released this publicly, of course,  Apple won't approve the new version because Spotify doesn't use the company's  billing method for in-app purchases and subscription services.  Apple did say that, well, Apple's response to this is,  well, we've always treated you this way.  This is nothing new.  We've always said that, in fact, Spotify charges three bucks or more a month  if you buy it through Apple, which is actually kind of maddening.  So in fact, Spotify will tell you, and this is one of the things Apple doesn't like,  will tell you, don't subscribe here.  Go subscribe.

Start time: 1108.98
End time: 1117.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apple's response, and I'm paraphrasing, I assure you,  is that we abuse everybody in exactly the same way.  So why are you complaining about it?

Start time: 1117.90
End time: 1119.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've always abused you this way.

Start time: 1119.30
End time: 1138.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In a nutshell, they charge a 30-something percent premium  for anybody who's selling stuff, but they don't charge themselves.  And if they did, it would be ridiculous, obviously.  So everybody has a disadvantage against Apple.  And they're right.  I think what Spotify is doing, they're trying to force the issue  into the public conversation because it really is unfair.

Start time: 1139.34
End time: 1159.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Especially for subscriptions.  In-app purchases, I'm like, OK, I can understand it.  But for a subscription, the in-app purchase, OK, it's being stored  on whatever random server Apple's using.  Google, who cares?  But for subscriptions, like an ongoing payment system,  it doesn't seem fair, but everyone bought into it.  And now they're like, well, you bought into it before.

Start time: 1161.68
End time: 1179.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they set the terms when there wasn't really an app store  or an ecosystem in place.  And so they could invent the rules that were the common methods  that everyone could follow on.  But now Spotify is saying, how much money will I pay over these  millions of users every month?  That's just not reasonable.  And I give them that Apple has more money.  I lend on Spotify, so I have a smaller business than bigger.

Start time: 1179.36
End time: 1191.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is the problem.  Spotify gets more than half of its customers through the app store,  which means both it costs them money and they can't say goodbye to Apple.  This is a big part of their business.  Well, that's why I charge 13.

Start time: 1193.00
End time: 1193.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they're still getting their $10.

Start time: 1195.04
End time: 1250.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is what cost it.  Spotify launched a promotion the second time they've done it that said,  if you're new, get three months of service for a buck,  but you can only get it if you sign up on the Web.  And Apple threatened to apparently threaten to pull the app  unless Spotify stopped pushing the deal for iPhone owners.  This is from Billy Steele's and Gadget article.  Spotify complied, but also nixed the iTunes billing option  in the iOS version that they this currently stalled.  They took it out.  And Apple says, well, you can't do that either.  So that's what Amazon did, though, for a long time.  And I think still does.  You can't buy a book in the Kindle app.  You have to go to the Kindle store on the Web.  Right. Right. Yeah.  Same thing with Amazon streaming.  You can't buy movies within it because they'd have to give it a 30 percent  big to the Apple folks.  Like I find a book in the Kindle app and I'm like, oh, is Apple going to ban  the Kindle app in the Amazon streaming?  I mean, that may be part of the reason you don't have Amazon streaming on Apple TV.

Start time: 1251.06
End time: 1258.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They just have you put it in like a like a wish list.  Yeah. Yeah.  And then later you go onto your Amazon account on any other device in the world  and you buy it.

Start time: 1259.22
End time: 1268.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The reason this is, you know, for the complaint now, of course,  is that Apple has a competing service.  So it's even more in Apple's interest to slow Spotify down a little bit.

Start time: 1268.94
End time: 1299.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And they haven't been super successful against Spotify.  Spotify, you know, is you know, Apple has dominated music since the early 2000s.  And they just don't like it. They don't like it, Leo.  They don't like another company sort of like doing a lot better on subscriptions  and paid subscriptions than they are able to do.  Of course, they could buy a certain music service to get to what is it?  Two million more users.  Tidal is apparently.

Start time: 1303.24
End time: 1322.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If they just wait, Spotify will go out of business in about five or ten years.  I think that's the truth.  If they just like, you know, let's just wait until they realize  they're never going to make any money.  And then that's what happens.  You know, Google, Apple and Amazon are going to be the only people  with these services because they can afford it because they don't have to make.  Yeah, it's secondary to, you know, the hardware or the other services that they're selling.

Start time: 1382.20

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But to Mike's point, Spotify has 30 million subscribers.  Apple Music has 15 million.  And so it's only a two-hundred differential.  But Apple's coming on strong.  That's what I'm saying.  Apple's doing a very good job to capitalize on their built-in install base on the iPhone  and using that to leverage quick growth in the market.

Start time: 1395.12
End time: 1430.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I would guess that behind the scenes, the other thing that's going on here is,  how do you quickly kill the other guys as you make the music industry squeeze them?  And Apple, really what Apple wants to do is use Jimmy Iovine, Dr. Dre,  their good connections with the music industry, Taylor Swift and others,  to get the music industry to squeeze these other guys, right?  And so behind the scenes, Bruce is also writing a note to Warner Records saying,  It would be very convenient for us.  No, they don't need to do that.  They just make nice to the music industry.  They become one of us.

Start time: 1431.42

Start time: 1441.88
End time: 1468.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's easy to make nice with the music industry when you're Apple  because you don't have to pay Apple a 30% premium.  You can charge less and still make it more profitable for the music industry.  They don't have to be operating on zero margins.  And is that fair?  I mean, it doesn't violate antitrust law to the best of my knowledge, but is that fair?  If Google tried it, it would be unfair because they don't make everything, which...

Start time: 1469.08
End time: 1480.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 1527.82
End time: 1568.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  iTunes sells it, but you can't stream it.  Prince, according to someone in the know, I don't know,  it would be a matter of whether the contract said that Prince's estate would have to approve any license assignment or not.  And I imagine it would because that's a standard clause.  So according to a music executive, Apple would probably have to negotiate a new deal with Prince's estate.  It doesn't... in other words, Prince would not go along.  In fact, what Steve Gordon... actually, he's an entertainment lawyer and the author of The Future of the Music Business is being quoted here in The Ringer.  They're not acquiring titles rights to play music.  They're acquiring titles subscriber list.  That's all.  And they're not... you know what?  What? They're really acquiring Jay-Z's Goodwill.

That's what Apple... if Apple's smart, that's... and I know they are doing this...  they're really carrying favor with the music industry.  And you're right.  They're just going to let Spotify wither on the vine.  And everybody else except Amazon and Google wither on the vine.

Transcript:  The only question is whether the music industry fears Apple.  And they should, right?  Because the real problem...  and in the past they have feared Apple because Apple...  the iTunes store is the number one music store by far.  You know, not just digital music, but in general.  I mean, Sam Goody's is not even like close.  So they...  I think if I were in the music industry, I'd worry because all Apple has to do is shut down all of these competitors and then say,  oh, and by the way, music industry, you're getting one tenth of 1% from now on.  What are they going to do?

When you need all that power for this Google spreadsheet.  It doesn't matter.  It's all the same.  By the way, I think Microsoft has found that out,  which is one of the reasons this is the last version of Windows ever.  In my opinion.  Now, you were an editor of Windows Magazine.  Yeah, I was.  Yes, I was the editor.  You've watched for years as Microsoft version after version.  Every four or five years, another version of Windows.  At the end of this month, actually August 2,  exactly one month from yesterday, they're  going to release the anniversary update to Windows 10.

And he had this vision for this networked computers,  with cloud computing, essentially.  And everybody's like, oh, that'll look.  People want to own their own giant PC, and they  want to upgrade it with two more megabytes of RAM.  And so there was this whole battle.

Transcript:  I'm curious what you think.  Our show today brought to you by Fresh Book.  We'll talk about that too.  Fresh Book's the super simple cloud accounting software  that's helping people who are freelancers work for  themselves, keep track of their invoices, their money,  save time billing, get paid faster.  Look, it is no fun.  Let's face it.  You don't get into business because you're so excited  about the day-to-day admin work.  You don't get into business because you like printing and  mailing invoices, because you like dunning slow-pay clients.  No.  But if you're in business, you need to do that so you'll get  paid.  Five million small business owners use Fresh Book, the  dead simple cloud accounting software, to transform how they  feel and handle their paperwork, how they feel about  it and how they handle it.  It starts with the invoicing.  And that's how I started using Fresh Book more than 10 years  ago.  You can create and send an invoice in about 30 seconds.  It's easy.  It handles all different currencies.  You can import time and hours from the Fresh Books app.  The app is great.  Of course, there's branding on your invoice.  You could set recurring invoices.  You could attach receipts.  You can even set up with your client that the invoice is  automatically sent and automatically paid.  Believe it or not, your clients hate paying bills as  much as you hate sending bills.  Nobody enjoys the paperwork.  Make it easy for them.  Your clients can even pay online, which means you get  paid a lot faster, on average about five days faster with  Fresh Books.  And if they don't pay auto payment reminders, make it  easy to keep on track.

Start time: 2288.42
End time: 2321.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, Leo, I use Fresh Books all the time.  No.  Yeah, I do.  I love it.  It's fantastic.  That's awesome.  It's great because you can pre-configure every one of the  fields.  I just select the publisher, and it knows everything else.  It knows how much I get paid for each comm and all that  kind of stuff.  And then here's the part that nobody ever talks about that  is one of the best things.  And it's a simple little thing.  But sometimes I worry whether they got my invoice.  They pay on monthly cycles.  So if I miss a cycle, it's another month.  So you can just go to the site and look.  And it says, yep, they opened it.  They saw it.

Start time: 2322.08
End time: 2419.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love that because sometimes clients, not your clients, but  some clients will say, oh, I didn't get the invoice.  You say, no, you did.  You see, you opened it on Friday.  I could see it right here.  You can also get deposits.  This is something new.  I don't know how exactly it works.  But you can invoice for a payment up front.  A lot of times, I was expensing stuff.  And it does make it very easy.  You take a picture of the receipt with your phone.  It automatically gets in the invoice.  But this will also let you request a deposit up front so  that you can not be spending your own money on the project.  And they'll do it out and everything.  It's really kind of neat.  When it comes time to pay the taxes,  the reports are fantastic.  You get so much from FreshBooks.  They even have an EMV chip card enabled card reader, which  means if you're doing work at people's houses or on their  premises, you can go there.  You can create an invoice.  You actually can create an estimate, create an invoice,  get paid right in one place, all in your FreshBooks app.  Right there, right then.  Getting started is easy.  And we've got a 30-day free trial at  freshbooks.com slash twit.  All we say, all we ask is mention this week in tech.  And the how did you hear about this section?  That way they'll know.  FreshBooks.com slash twit.  I have to log back into my computer.  I have to now time my ad so it's exactly the sleep time  on the computer.  So I'll log back in.  Let's see.

Transcript:  We don't know.  They might call it 610.  We don't know.  There is rumor afoot that Google will do its own new phone that  will be a, not a developer handset like the Nexus phones,  but actually a top-of-the-line flagship phone.

Transcript:  I have a conspiracy theory for you about why they might do  this.  Yeah, because why?  Because it doesn't make sense.  Ronam Audio did a good column about why it doesn't make sense.  They've got things going their way, pretty much.  They would be competing against direct competitors.  Initially, I thought, oh, I know what they're going to do.  They're going to build Project Tango in every single phone  and subsidize it and make it cheap and all that stuff.  That doesn't make sense.  I think this is what makes sense.  They're under fire around the world, especially in Europe,  but they're also talking about it in the US again  around antitrust and Android.  Because Google is paying some companies to add.  In other cases, they're not paying, but they're  trying to get all the Android handset makers to build in all  the Google stuff.  They really want that.  That's the whole point of Android.

Transcript:  You can download the open source AOSP version of Android,  but it has no Google services in it.  That's free.  Anybody can make a phone.  That's what Amazon does.  They modify it, and they make their fire tablets.  But most customers want Google services.  They want Google Play Store.  They want Google Maps.  And so as a result, Google says, OK, you could do that,  but here's the rules.  A, you've got to get our approval.  And B, you can't make a phone without it.  So that's the thing the EU doesn't like.  The EU says, no, that's monopolistic.  If you didn't say to Amazon, for instance,  OK, you can make a standard Android phone with Google  services, but that means you can't make a non-Google AOSP  phone, that's Google's rules.

Start time: 2910.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So here's the conspiracy.  So I think that one reason to come out with a phone  for themselves is they themselves can build everything  in, just like Apple does.  And so I think it's a kind of bludgeon  to get the OEMs to voluntarily put that stuff in.  Because, for example, let's say Europe said, OK, no.  There's no way you can coerce handset makers to build in any.  They can do whatever they want.  And Google, there's nothing you can do about it.  Well, there's no point for Google  to even have Android in that market.  So then Google can say, OK, well, we have a phone.  Then we're going to sell our phone in Europe only.  And so knowing that this exists, the OEMs will be like, OK,  we're going to play ball because we  don't want to have to compete with you directly,  where you're going to be selling the subsidized phone.

Apple is building a car, for crying out loud,  for one and only reason, so that they don't get locked out  of the cars, right?  All the cars.  Google came out with Android for one and only reason.  They didn't want to get locked out of the smartphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did software.  They did platform only because they felt that was the best way  to sell hardware.  And it's only recently.  Everything used to sell the iPhone.  But that choice was far in the past.  It's only recently they've started  to consider having a future beyond selling hardware.  And that's partly because their services, weirdly enough,  because they're crap, their services  are a big part of their profit center now.  So what percentage compared to the iPhone?  Well, iPhone is still killer.  But services, I can't remember what it was.  It was like a $6 billion business.  It was not an instant payment.

Start time: 3071.94

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And not just iCloud, obviously.  But then the iPhone is like $6 of that total?  Well, no.  Because everybody who buys an iPhone also  ends up getting coerced into buying more iCloud storage  for a buck or two bucks a month.  That's a nice annuity.  It'd work if you can get it.  So Apple is now maybe more of a platform company  than they used to be.  But they really were a hardware company.  True.

And that's why I don't buy this.  And the Motorola deal failed for a reason.  I mean, they would write off several billion dollars  at Goodwill for a reason.

Transcript:  That's a perfect analogy for what Google is doing, right?  Google makes the software.  And they've partnered up to now.  Even this was made by HTC, this first Android phone.  They partnered up to now with traditional OEMs,  not Ford and GM, but HTC, LG, and Samsung  to make their devices.  So the only reason this is a news story  is that Google might make their own devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Doesn't matter, because they're selling more Android.  Far more Android phones are sold worldwide.  But what's the advantage to them?  It's to have the apps.  That's the only reason.  Google services.  So they do the open source thing as a little  tip of the hat.  They know.

Start time: 3201.02
End time: 3210.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Apple's just sitting around going,  ha ha ha, I can pull this off.  But whenever these other companies go back into this market,  I expect losses and lower volumes than they anticipate.  And the service project will now finally work.  And I think that's the key to this,  is how much money does service take  for Microsoft to get right?  And if they keep doing this episodically as Google has,  how can they possibly build the momentum needed  to actually break into it?

I mean, when Apple was sitting pretty making Macintoshes  and iPods, and this was when in 2007,  the iPod was king, and people said  they're gonna do a phone, I said,  that's not a business you wanna be in.  That's a terrible business.  But they, because they were brilliant,  because they created a platform  that was significantly ahead of the pack.

Apple ultimately does all these different things  primarily for content consumption.  They see that as their business model.  I see that as their business model,  and I think they do too.  Since Steve Jobs came back and launched the iPod,  they learned, hey, this is what we do.  And so, that's why they can't, I said the same thing.  I'm like, this is nuts, they don't know anything  about the phone business.  Why are they doing this?  It's crazy.  It's not crazy.  They proved us wrong.  We were very, very wrong.  Because the phone is a major place  where billions of people will consume content  that they may or may not be paying for.  And so, Apple was facing a future  where they're just irrelevant  because people are getting their content  and other people are controlling it.

I mean, I agree with you, wearables as a category.  And smart glasses.  And worth investing in.  But I think that's what's really interesting,  is I am sure Apple in 2007 looked with great trepidation  at this big bet they were making on the iPhone.  I doubt very much Steve Jobs said,  you know, in 10 years, we are gonna be the largest company  in the world because we are gonna have hit  on the next big thing.

In fact, this is so funny because  I see more and more of these around  and I realize, when I see these, I go,  oh, you don't wanna lose your stuff either, do you?  I have one on my keys.  It's called the tracker  and it lets you track your belongings with Bluetooth.  So what happens is you get a tracker.  This is the tracker Bravo,  which is very slim and elegant.  Actually, my keys aren't here,  but I'll open this one up.  What color do you like?  You should have a different color  for every device.  Animals, you can put them on your cats  because they're so small and thin and light.  The tracker Bravo comes with a little,  one of those little quarter-sized batteries  that last all year.  When you get the tracker Bravo,  you pair it up to your phone.  There's just a little button on it.  You put the tracker app on your phone.  Now, here's what happens.  It's kind of a two-way separation alert.  So if your phone and your keys part company,  it will alert you.  If you leave your keys on the beach  and you walk away, your phone will go beep, beep, beep, beep.  Your keys are out of range.  If you leave your phone behind,  the tracker will go beep, beep, beep, beep.  And here's a cool thing.  You can push the button on the tracker  and it will set off an alert on your phone.  Even if your phone is silenced  and your phone will start ringing at you,  you can make it anything you want.  I have Black Sabbath Iron Man on my phone.  Good choice.  Do, do, do, do, do, do.

Now here's the other thing,  the only tracker does, and I love it,  they have the largest crowd GPS network in the world.  So you might say, well, Bluetooth,  that only is good for about a hundred feet, right?  Right.  But what if you get past that range,  let's say you leave your keys in the beach and you go home.  Now you know you've lost your keys,  but how does your tracker know?  Well, first of all, it knows the last time it saw them.  But then if anybody with a tracker walks by your keys,  the tracker on your keys talks to their smartphone app

They have water resistant cables  so you can put in your pet collar.  You can even add a laser engraved message  to your tracker Bravo.  So put your pet's serial number or name or whatever on it.  They just introduced the tracker Atlas.  This is also new.  It works with the Bravo or third party Bluetooth trackers  to pinpoint your item on a floor plan of your home.  So one of the problems, of course, you might say,  oh, I know my keys are home, but I don't know where.  Well, with the tracker Atlas, you know where.  Oh yeah, they're stuck in the cushion.

And I think this is something people overlook,  is that people don't just run ad blockers,  because they don't like ads.  They run ad blockers,  because there's security issues with ads.  Yep.  But now with Facebook ads.

Start time: 4245.72

Start time: 4253.06
End time: 4267.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All I have to say about this,  is this is part of a larger trend,  where the big companies like Google, Facebook, Apple,  et cetera, are in the business of building a better user.  So what they're trying to do over time,  is get you used to more and more cookie-tracking.  Does that sound creepy?

Start time: 4268.36
End time: 4272.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 4273.12
End time: 4285.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to build a better user.  So they're methodically going in this direction,  but mark my words, three years,  there's gonna be no opt-in,  they're just gonna do this whole thing all the way,  and nobody will care.  That's the real truth of it.

Start time: 4286.30
End time: 4325.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the real truth of it,  is that if they did this without making it opt-in,  nobody noticed either.  I guess, so there's a new page called My Activity.  It may or may not be turned on for you.  It's starting to be turned on today.  It's really interesting,  because 9toFindGoogle said,  hey, great news, Google's new ad technology is opt-in.  And then Wired said,  uh-oh, Google expands ad tracking.  So it really is a variation in how people view all of this.  My attitude is, we're gonna get ads.  Wouldn't you rather have ads  that are of more interest to you?

Start time: 4326.88
End time: 4338.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think we're a weird, we don't count.  Because I'm searching for so many weird things for work,  the ads that are pushed to me,  and then I use, I killed all the trackers,  all the cookies, and I'm like,  I mean, I have this on my...

Start time: 4338.26
End time: 4358.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's my position, the reason people don't like ad tracking  is not because it's effective,  but because the tools,  the recommendation tools are so crappy.  Thank you.  That they're creepy, they either recommend stuff  you just bought over and over again,  like I already got those Levi's,  I don't need to see them anymore.  But that's just poorly implemented recommendations.

Start time: 4358.82

Start time: 4393.92
End time: 4426.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But this is a huge problem.  This is the elephant in the living room  with all the data they harvest.  They keep harvesting all this data,  and where are the relevant ads?  We've been waiting year after year.  And they're terrible at it.  They're horrible at it, and that's one problem.  I think the bigger problem is just a cognitive bias  against a human being understanding  what actually happens with his so-called tracking.  There is no tracking.  There's no committee of conspiratorial people.  No, it's a machine.  Whoa, look, look.  Alex Wilhelm just did this.  He just bought something and some weed on whatever.  No, that's not happening.  That is not happening.  It's just, there's algorithms.

That's my concern.  It's the sort of like ads people.  What are you worried that's gonna happen, though?  Well, they can track where you go,  what you're doing, what you're buying,  and then that just builds a more robust system  to help them hack you.  Everything, every little bit of information  that you put out there is more information  that someone can use to hack you.  I noticed that you have a Chiquita Banana sticker

And that was a really huge pain.  Someone actually hacked into my voicemail  and changed my voicemail recording  so that I left the next web and joined in gadget.

But a Stephen Fry or somebody who's just a major celebrity,  you know who I'd be interested to talk to is Neil Gaiman  because he's well known among geeks,  he's a geek icon.  And ask them what do you do?  Because for sure there's some 18 year old geek  who's attacking you constantly, right?  And what does it cost you?  How much effort do you put into it?  What do you do?  Are there, I'm sure, in fact I know there are firms  that do this.  I've been told there are firms that do this.  I've been told that there are firms that you can hire  at great cost who will track the hacker down.  Who will actually, you know, a counter hacker  working on your behalf that will more effectively,  probably because they're willing to break the law,  more effectively track down the miscreant  and threaten to break their legs.  I think that you can pay for that.  I'm sure.

Transcript:  But then there's what Roberto brought up,  which is that everything's in the cloud now.  So a lot of the hacks we hear about,  we don't really see the consequences in a big way,  but you hear that some hospital system company  or insurance company or any, all the government agencies  have been hacked by the Chinese and Russians and so on.  But it's like if everything's in the cloud,  which brings us around to, I think is always  an interesting conversation, does Apple,  does Apple do what they say and is what they say they do  the right way to go?  Keep all the information on the phone  instead of sending it to the cloud.

Transcript:  That's the new question that we're all gonna be asking  after WWDC and the announcements about differential privacy  and on device.  Apple wants to use information about you,  but they think or assert that they can do it privately.  But that's marketing speak.  They will at some point, Apple always does do a white paper,  which might be more forthcoming.

Transcript:  True.  Also equally untrue.  Yeah.  Anyway, to a certain extent,  the worst case scenario for Apple, just to zip this up,  is the pandering to the public ignorance about stuff.  It's in my hands, therefore it's secure.  Well, no, unless I leave this in a taxi or whatever.

Start time: 4861.06
End time: 4891.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, well, I'll give you an example.  Apple has, everybody knows if they read between the lines  that Apple has the key to your iCloud storage.  And if asked by law enforcement, by dually,  dually ordained, I guess it's not ordained.  Ordained.  If law enforcement asks for that.  Law enforcement, if the right people ask,  they will give your iCloud contents to...  Here's another way to look at it.  But they act as if that's not the case.  Again, public perception.

Start time: 4891.38
End time: 4898.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, they've said it like they've been very public about it.  We've, I've been on calls with them, you've talked to them.  They say they will.  They said to me, they will give it over.  And they've always said...

Start time: 4898.78
End time: 4934.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the first time I heard them say that publicly  was in the San Bernardino case,  where they said, and it felt a little self-serving,  hey, had the FBI only asked us and not changed the password,  we would have just said,  back it up to the iCloud and we'll give it to you.  Well, that was also the FBI.  That was very self-serving.  Don't even talk about the FBI's technical abilities.  But I think the general populace,  doesn't know that when you back up your phone to iCloud,  you're giving the entire contents of the phone,  encrypted or not, to Apple,  which can then and will then give it to law enforcement,  if asked.  Well, then there's speculation that they're not going to.  Because after all, isn't that where Scarlett Johansson's  because they encrypt it,

Start time: 4935.22
End time: 4943.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  because they have the keys to that encryption in the iCloud.  But there's speculation that they're not going to have  the key anymore.  They're going to do the same thing on the phone.  They're going to swallow it.

Start time: 4943.52
End time: 4965.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Believe me, when they do that, they will announce that.  Oh yeah.  Because it's a huge publicity waiting for them.  And I thought they might announce something at WWDC.  And to me, the fact that they did not,  tells me that Apple's trying to have it both ways.  That they want...  Look, it's also bad PR with a lot of the American public  to say, oh, we're not going to help you  in your investigation against terrorism.

Start time: 4967.72
End time: 5013.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think Apple wants it both ways.  I think they want general consumers.  They're exactly as you said,  they're kind of obssessing it.  They want the perception to be that they're protecting you.  They also want it to be clear to law enforcement  and anybody paying attention that in fact,  if law enforcement needs it.  But, and you know what you may even say,  and I think a lot of the public says, no, no, that's fine.  If the FBI asks, you should stand and deliver.  But what people don't get is, well, if that's the case,  it also means that that is less secure for a bad guy.  That somebody, a misbehaving employee at Apple,  might have access to that and hackers might have access.  And in fact, that is what happened  with the naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence.  That was a phishing campaign.  But they got in through,  those were iCloud stored photos, right?  Yeah, because they phished them.  Well, we don't know exactly.

Start time: 5013.62
End time: 5018.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, they did, we found out.  It was they phished them.  Yeah, right.  It was just a simple phishing campaign.  It wasn't social engineering?

Start time: 5019.30
End time: 5026.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, phishing is social engineering.  But I mean, I thought some of it was calling Apple reps  and getting some information from them.  Maybe not.

Transcript:  Matt Honan's hack was phishing.  That was social engineering.  That was Apple, Amazon.  Right, they used social engineering with Apple

Start time: 5035.34
End time: 5054.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and Amazon to collate information.  It was super easy, because we had to do it for research.  But Apple changed it, and Amazon changed it, they say.  But that's my point, is that if Apple can see the data,  if Dropbox can see the data, it doesn't,  yes, they can say, well, we're only gonna hand it over  to law enforcement, but in fact, it makes it less secure.

Start time: 5054.38
End time: 5130.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, exactly.  And one of the things that helps you understand  Apple's decision-making process is they are very, very good  and almost unique in the industry.  And looking at the long game on every single aspect,  they look ahead in the future, and I guarantee you,  they have meetings and they say, okay,  there are gonna be large numbers of really,  really horrible hacks, lots and lots of data.  What are we gonna say?  Yeah, what will be the response?  Scenario one, we need to be ready for that.  And then here's another scenario.  There's gonna be horrible terrorist attacks  where catching the bad guy is gonna involve using a phone.  What are we gonna say?  So they have a story for both of those.  The story on the one hand is that they ask for it,  and it's illegal, and it's a warrant,  we give it to them, give it anything.  The other thing is, oh, we don't put things in the cloud,  cloud's dangerous, we keep everything on the phone secure,  all that, that's their story for that.  But they're looking and they know events will take place  that will put them in the spotlight at some point.  Meanwhile, what's the most secure device  that is generally available to consumers?  It's a Chromebook.  It's all cloud.  And that's super secure because Google is super secure.  And by the way, speaking of Google Plus'  fifth year anniversary, I'm glad Sundar Pichai  got hacked on Twitter and Quora,  because he's been using Twitter  instead of his own Google Plus,  and has Google Plus ever been hacked?  No.

So really, their account wasn't-  Never use third party hats.  Hats, never third party hats.  But somebody hacked a third party app  that had permission to post to their Twitter account  and then use that to post.

Start time: 5163.70

And so I was like,  I haven't used Foursquare since I was like 14.  I've had that happen too.  Yeah, and so I was very confused.  So I went through to my Twitter account  and tried to undo third party app access.  And over the years, it was like 150 things  that were allowed to post from my account.  I killed all of them, of course.  That's terrifying.

Start time: 5192.16
End time: 5200.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

All of Google's are.  However, it turns out, and by the way,  this post was complicated and somewhat above my pay grade.  But according to this post,  and I haven't seen anything to contradict it,  they figured out how using a flaw  kind of in the way Qualcomm enables a secure store  in the encryption.  And there is a way, not an easy way, but there is a way.  If you understand this chart, you too can crack.  Then you are Steve Gibson.  Then you can.  There's always a way.  There's always a way.

Transcript:  Let's take a break.  I want to talk about the new Facebook feed.  I might have buried the lead.  There's actually some very big stories  that we didn't talk about,  including, of course, the fifth anniversary of Google+.  Yeah, that's a huge story.  Cannot forget.  I cannot forget that.  I want to talk about that.  I'm talking, of course, about the Tesla fatality.  Yes.  And lots more.  And this little public service announcement.  Whatever you do, don't eat gas station nougat.  Our show today brought to you by Braintree.  Braintree is the solution for the mobile app developer  who wants to add payment to their apps.  I think if you're writing a mobile app  and you know you want to have customers use your app  to buy things, to pay for things,  there's a couple of ways to address this.  One would be to write a full-stack solution yourself.  I think if you're a developer, you know,  that's not the right way to do it.  Not only is it hard to do, it's hard to do right  unless you're really an expert.  And even then, it's a pain  because then somebody adds a new form of payment,  you got to go back in the code and write the whole thing.  So what you're probably going to want to do  is go out and look and see what other people use.  You might check, for instance,  well, you know, what's the best payment experience  out there?  Uber, right?  Sure. It's great.  You get out of the car, you're done.  So what does Uber use, you might ask?  Or what does Lyft use?  Maybe you use GitHub.  Of course you do.  What is GitHub?  These guys are smart.  What would they use?  What would Airbnb hotels tonight?  You know what?  The answer is the same in every case.  All of those services, Casper and Boxed  and everybody use Braintree.  You know, buyable pins on Pinterest.  This is amazing.  This is everywhere.  It's Braintree.  Braintree payments, because it's a full stack solution,  a few lines of code you can easily integrate.  They keep it up to date.  They're security experts.  You don't have to worry about fraud.  They've got full-time fraud protection built in.  Your customers like it because they've used it before.  They know it's safe.  And when there's a new form of payment, it's easy.  You flip a switch, you just click the box  in your control panel and you put the new app out  and boom, you're done.  Just update a few little things and you're done.  From Pounds to PayPal, from Bitcoin to credit cards,  Braintree does it all.  In iOS and Android and JavaScript,  that means you can use it on the web too.  .net, Node.js, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby.  It is the best.  I don't know if you're the decision maker in your team,  but please bring this to the one who does,  your program manager, your boss, whoever,  your product manager, braintreepayments.com slash twit.  And if they need a little more incentive, tell them,  oh, and by the way, your first $50,000 in payments  are fee free.  It's the best way.  That's why everybody uses it.  Braintreepayments.com slash twit to find out more.  It's such a sad story.  I don't want to make fun of the story in any way,  but I do think this is, as far as I know,  correct me if I'm wrong,  the first time an autonomous vehicle  has killed a passenger.  Was it an autonomous vehicle?

Start time: 5491.30
End time: 5499.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's semi-autonomous because it's autopilot.  So you're supposed to be,  the driver is supposed to be in charge of the vehicle  at all times, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

Transcript:  You're not supposed to be watching Harry Potter movies.  Tesla Model S, it was a very challenging situation,  whether you're a human or a machine.  Cruising down the highway, we know,  because he blew by a few other people who reported  he was going at least 85 miles an hour,  which is over the speed limit in that area.  Yeah.  A tractor trailer turned, made a left turn  across the freeway, and it was white.  And according to Tesla's records,  neither the driver nor the autopilot could see it.  The brake was not applied.  The car hit the tractor trailer at full speed.  And it was an unusual situation for an autopilot  because the tractor, as many trucks,  in fact, this is against the law in Europe.  I'm told they have to put baffles  at the bottom of the truck.  This truck was very high off the road.

Start time: 5549.70

Transcript:  That's why they do that.

Start time: 5550.79
End time: 5578.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  So yeah, that's why they do that so that you can see it.  So what it looked like perhaps to the autopilot is a sign  because they could see road  and then there's something blocking it.  That's pure speculation on my part.  But for whatever reason, maybe it was the light Tesla  and their blog post said that it was a white truck,  it was a bright sunny day.  Whatever reason the brake was never applied,  the car hit the truck and the passenger was immediately  killed.  Chilling effect on autonomous vehicles or?  No.

Start time: 5579.58
End time: 5604.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The opposite.  Business as usual, the opposite.  The opposite, here's why.  Look at all the information that Tesla has  about what happened.  Okay.  I know it's amazing.  They know everything.  As we know with software in general  and open source software in particular,  if you're constantly refining,  getting data in a good way, in a meaningful way,  and refining what you do,  this is how self-driving cars ultimately  will be essentially perfected.  This is something that we never have.

See, here, I'll tell you why it's germane  and why I don't want to impugn the driver.  Because the truth is, most people say,  I think autonomous vehicles are great for the other guys  because they're crap drivers.  I am an excellent driver.  I...  It's cognitive bias.  That guy was a crap driver.  Of course he died.  But I am an excellent driver.  So I am not going to trust an autonomous vehicle  because I'm a better driver than that.

You have to really mess it up to maybe spearfish it,  to use your earlier term.  Really hack at it to make it break.  But I mean, that's awesome.

Oh, you know, the bus scenario, the trolley scenario.  The bridge or whatever it is.  And how are you going to program that?  And oh, oh, oh, is...  Would anybody buy an autonomous vehicle  that would sacrifice their life  to save a busload of school children, et cetera, et cetera?

And then those people are just like,  well, now we're there, and we kinda have to stay here  because it is Facebook and everyone's here.  And every once in a while, Facebook will appease the users  and say, oh, you know what?  We're gonna make it so it's just you and your friends.  It's just your friends and family,  all that other stuff you're not gonna see.  Well, I mean, you are gonna see the ads that we're using.  Oh yeah, you'll always see those.  You're gonna see all those ads.  And of course, if those pages are,  if they wanna give us money to boost their posts,  you'll see those.  But really, it's just about, you know.

Transcript:  when you finally get it.  And the general public doesn't see social networking  and social media as a platform,  that they don't see themselves as content creators  or any of that stuff.  They just say, oh, well, that's where people are,  I find out about people.  And so, but here's the-  That's what everybody thinks Facebook is.  Here's the thing that bugs me about all this.  So essentially what happened was they made this big,  so I wrote a column about this,  it's like social media and social networking.  Social networking is kind of on the decline  and social media is on the rise  because it's easier to get more money out of social media.  It's easier to get more money when the New York Times  has fast mobile pages and all that kind of stuff.  And so they-  So Facebook, which was created as a social network,  Right.  Is now-  Said, wait a minute, we should really be a news source.  Exactly, exactly.  So what happened was, it became,  everybody started talking about Facebook  as a social media platform,  that they were paying publishers to do this,  paying publishers to do that,  favoring publishing, publishing, publishing,  and people were like, it was bad press, essentially.

Start time: 6761.94
End time: 6774.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and also it bit them in the butt  because then conservatives said, oh no, no, no.  That's right.  You're pulling down-  Exactly.  You're espousing your political beliefs  through manipulation of the news.  Exactly, but the real criticism-  I don't think they were doing it.

Start time: 6774.94
End time: 6810.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The real criticism was the lack of transparency.  And that is exactly what bugs me about this whole story.  So in the spirit of transparency,  they came out with a bunch of BS that means nothing.  They said, oh, we're really about this, that, and the other.  You don't know, for example, let me just-  So there's social media that's put on the network  by the social media.  New York Times puts an article there.  There's also, Uncle Fester can put  a New York Times article there.  Are they favoring that when it comes from Uncle Fester now?  We don't know.  There's no transparency.  I don't see any news articles anymore  in my Facebook feed.  They're all gone.  They change their algorithm every day.  Every minute.  Right.

Start time: 6811.40
End time: 6852.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this is what, I think Om made a very good point.  He says, Google interacts with users via search.  Those signals are strong.  They're good, they're powerful,  they're useful for the most part.  Facebook interacts with its users via its news feed.  He says that feed, it's a random collection of events,  information from acquaintances, news links, videos, photos,  all sorts of stuff, including advertising.  These create a large number of variables.  It makes it difficult for the company, Facebook,  to create a perfect personal experience  and still meet its corporate objectives.  Its artificial intelligence  is clearly not intelligent enough.  Right.  It's just too stupid.  Right.  It's too hard to do what it's doing.  Right.  So it's never gonna get better?

Start time: 6852.58
End time: 6872.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is always getting better for Facebook  because if you look at the numbers,  the amount of time that people spend on Facebook,  it always goes up.  And their light years have had everyone else  in terms of the amount of time.  And the only thing that even comes close is YouTube.  So it is working for them.  It's working for them.  This whole system is working for them.  Even changing it constantly works for them.

Start time: 6873.24
End time: 6886.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because they've already got all the people on there.  Change it, keep changing.  They're like, oh, we'll change it,  we'll make it a little different.  You're like, oh, now we'll have,  more people will go back to Facebook  who may have left Facebook,  but the reality is we're all opening.  They see the needle moving and they get in front of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not by their billions.  I mean, I think there will always be people,  the people do that all the time.  Some people even quit Facebook.  But in general, people go to Facebook  and it's pretty satisfying to see what's going on there  when they see what they see.

Start time: 6909.36
End time: 6943.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because Facebook knows how satisfying it is  based on how long you stay. Exactly.  And they're always gonna keep tweaking it.  And so they just keep tweaking it.  In fact, Ohm says at the end, he says,  in what might have been a rare bit  of unintentional corporate honesty,  Facebook's Mosseri wrote,  we view our work as only 1% finished.  So even though we're confusing users,  we don't seem to have a very good handle on this  in Ohm writes in deciding to prioritize  one kind of post over another for reasons  that seem to have little to do  with what individuals are asking for.  Facebook is once again confusing its users  and it doesn't matter.  Doesn't matter.

Start time: 6944.06
End time: 6961.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The 1% thing is not a new trope.  I mean, Google has said for years  there's about 1% done with search.  We're only starting on this path  towards search. Yeah, Google's still in beta.  Yeah, but I mean, it's obviously not.  And so I feel like it's a cheap way to say  we're still figuring things out when in reality  you do have a very large, I think more requirement  to your 1.65 billion monthly actives.

Start time: 6961.10
End time: 6977.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google's referring to the 1% of the information out there  that they haven't indexed.  They're referring to the 1% of your time  that they've got now and they want 100% of your time.  And it's great for them because it's ultimately  about ad dollars and every time they get  five more minutes of your time,  it's five less minutes that you're spending  on Google or somewhere else.

Transcript:  What's funny is I remember when they started  prioritizing news and they did their instant articles.  And I, you know, Jeff Jarvis said,  yeah, get in there, you know, it's a land grab.  Every news source in town should do it.  Look how great Vice and Buzzfeed have done based on this.  Buzzfeed, Jonah Peretti even said,  we don't have a website anymore.  We just make articles.  Of course, Buzzfeed doesn't make money on its articles.  They make money selling viral videos to companies, right?  That's kind of where their profit center is, I think.  It's not really-

Transcript:  What time is it?  It's so mean to the audio audience  because we're just sitting here giggling at bad dog photos.  It's time to do an ad.  I wanna thank Alex Wilhelm and Roberto Baldwin  and Mike Elgin.  You guys are great.  Always fun to have you here.  Our show today brought to you by Wealthfront.  Everybody knows they need to save.  I mean, you gotta save.  You gotta save for the future.  You gotta save for your rainy day.  You gotta save for your digital nomadic life.  Coming up, you gotta save for college.  But the problem is how?  Do you just put the money under your mattress?  You put it in a bank?  You might as well put it under a mattress.  You put it in a bank, you get nothing, nothing.  So everybody says, all right, well, I know how you do it.  You invest.  Yeah, but that's where you,  there's where your troubles begin.  Are you gonna go out, buy the library books,  read all about it, and learn how to invest,  but to buy out of there all the wisdom of the world?  And then you take your money  and you open an account at Schwab and you start investing.  And then about 10 years later, you go, oh, I forgot.  Wonder how those investments are doing.  And the shock sets in.  Okay, no, we're not gonna do that, right?  All right, you're gonna hire an investment advisor,  some smart cookie, got an office in the strip mall downtown.  And this guy, man, he knows what he's doing, right?  That's why he has an office in the strip mall downtown  because he is a genius at investing.  And this guy is gonna charge you one or two or 3%  of everything that he manages for you every single year,  which means this genius is getting you in a stock.  By the way, he might be getting a commission.  He's certainly getting a little transaction fee and 3%.  And if that stock doesn't do 3% better  than anything you pick, you just lost your money.  So there is a better way.  I'm telling you all the ways that people do it.  Don't do it that way, go to wealthfront.com.  Wealthfront.com is amazing.  It's a computer, computer software designed  by some of the best minds.  The guys who wrote those books you bought,  like this one, A Random Walk Down Wall Street,  own it, Burton Malkiel.  Charles D. Ellis's Winning the Losing Game, great books.  They take that knowledge,  they encapsulate it into the software.  And the nice thing about software,  software doesn't charge you.  Software is cheap, it doesn't work for one, two,  or 3% a year.  One quarter of 1% a year, one quarter of 1% a year.  You can start investing as little as $500,  but I'm gonna tell you something else.  I don't want you to invest.  I want you to go to wealthfront.com and read up.  You can take advantage of some free stuff.  For instance, you can go through the question process.  By the way, they've got a very simple process.  They've really got it down.  Not dozens of questions, some simple questions  to identify risk aversion and long-term goals.  And then they'll give you a free portfolio.  They'll say, okay, this is what we'd invest in.  Thank you, that's free, that's free.  They will even let you enter in all your existing accounts  and tell you what you're spending on fees,  how diversified it is.  So they'll give you some real information  of what you're doing, all that's for free.  Read up about it.  They just introduced, by the way,  their 529 college savings plans,  which is a really good way to save for college.  You can invest after-tax dollars, it's like a Roth IRA,  and save for a child or grandchild's  higher education expenses.  Wealthfront now has $3 billion in client assets.  It's growing really, really fast  because this is a better way.  I don't know if you saw the article in Wall Street Journal.  The storefront brokers, even the big brokerages  in Wall Street are terrified of Wealthfront  because you don't want it works.  And they have no way to fight it.  It's Wealthfront.  Find out more, Wealthfront.com slash twit.  What they're gonna do for you,  again, I don't want you to buy right away,  I want you to read up, but if you decide to invest,  you can start with as little as $500,  and your first $15,000 is free of charge for life.  Not one quarter of 1%, but free forever.  Now that's a great way to start that college savings plan,  you can start with that nest egg.  Or your retirement fund or your rainy day fund.

The pilot AI was running on a Raspberry Pi  and they've pitted it against a professional fighter pilot  with decades of experience,  a series of flight combat simulations.  The AI successfully evaded Geno  and shot him down every time.  Lee called it, Colonel Lee, I'm sorry,  called it the most aggressive, responsive, dynamic,  incredible AI I've seen to date.  SkyNet.

Transcript:  There are actually two levels to this story though  in terms of military technology.  On the one hand, they're out gunning a human,  but then the other thing is that they,  one of the problems with human pilots is  the planes are so fast, turn so sharp,  they need special suits so they don't pass out.  Machines, they don't have any of those problems.  You could invent a plane that just like does crazy turns  that would kill a human.

That's why I stopped playing Go.  And it's like, what's the point?  If the AI can determine and stop ISIS.  That's when it becomes.  Right.  When it can, okay, this is what they usually do.

But I got kind of sad because I'm like,  dang, I get paid to do that.  And then I realized all it could do was the stuff  that was actually the most boring part of my job,  which is grabbing certain numbers  and putting them into little boxes.  And so for me, just personally,  I'm like, hell yeah, I take the drudgery out of my life  and I can do more creative stuff on top.  Great.  If that's where we get the products too.  But for now, I'm just not concerned  because humans can't write.  So humans that can't write,  tell them computers how to write, don't really scare me.  Yep.

I'll do it for you, I miss it.  If I could get a robot to do it.  You don't get to do that anymore?  I do broader macro reports.

They've been discontinued.  Future carrier order fulfillment will not be guaranteed.

The statement about discontinuation of Blackberry 10  and AT&T and Verizon, that's incorrect.  Blackberry's device strategy is based  on a cross-platform model where we'll continue  to support a Blackberry 10 platform  while expanding our device offer  and include Android-based devices.  We are focused on software updates for Blackberry 10.
