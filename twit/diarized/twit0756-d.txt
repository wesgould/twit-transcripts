It also Punxsutawney Phil predicted a quick spring this year and the San Francisco 49ers trounced the Kansas City Chiefs 100 to nothing.  One of these things is not is not yet true.  Apple made a lot of money.  That's true.  In Q4 the color charts are up from Jason Snell's fabulous six colors.  He's become famous now for these charts.  I asked Jason how many hours does it take to make these?  He says it's all automatic.  61% revenue from phone wearables 11 services going up 14% Mac and iPad are kind of the laggards there.  But it was a record Apple quarter that that first quarter first fiscal quarter of the year, which is the fourth calendar quarter is the big selling.

End time: 344.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  More than anybody.  Are there that many people in the world?  It's an amazing number.  Yes there are obviously.  But there are only seven billion.  So one and a half billion is pretty good penetration.  Yeah the only number 80% are on iOS 13.

Start time: 346.57
End time: 346.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Start time: 347.31

Start time: 352.39
End time: 360.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry.  Total Facebook users too is I think like an interesting number because that's what upwards of two billion now or close to a billion like they announced we're we're reaching crazy points.

Start time: 361.00
End time: 380.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook also had great results and there it was the monthly active users was over two billion.  But even the daily active users was like a billion and a half.  It was I can't remember the numbers exactly.  Maybe you guys do.  But it was like wow.  Not Stephen King though.  He's he's he's he is a Facebook recuser.

Start time: 381.37
End time: 396.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hold on.  I got it right here.  Daily active users one point six six billion monthly active users two point five billion.  But then you know what Devender what I think you're thinking about is if you count across the entire family of apps.  Yes.  Where is that number.

Start time: 396.22
End time: 409.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's that's the one that was that eight nine billion once have Instagram and Facebook together two point eight nine billion.  That's that's almost half the world's.  I mean it is almost certainly everybody on the Internet.  Right. Yes.

Start time: 410.30
End time: 421.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We estimate about three billion on the Internet or like over over the age of 12 because I think Benedict Evans has a thing up about that today.  So if you count adults we're getting to half.

Start time: 422.31
End time: 433.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's insane.  It's just crazy that we're talking about billions when it comes to devices and users at this point from single companies not just like everybody on the Internet.  But one company has this huge slice of the pie.  It's insane.

Start time: 434.04
End time: 442.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is is big tech too big.  Certainly there that's the current you know thought among all the Democratic candidates anyway.  The vendor is big tech too big.

Start time: 443.65
End time: 479.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think so.  I think we've gotten way way too big.  And you know we've talked about this the last few times I've been on.  It does feel like the tech industry has come from the mentality of kind of being the outsiders.  You know the ones who have been fighting against the man and now they are the man and they are so big that you know countries don't know how to deal with them.  They're bigger.  You know Facebook is bigger than most countries and the power and influence these things wield.  There's nobody to keep them at check except for their CEOs who all seem to be either clueless or out of the loop or just have no clue how to handle this power.  Children. Yeah.  We need something.

Start time: 480.00
End time: 492.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're young people.  Yeah.  Yeah I don't know what the I mean if you if you stipulate as I think everybody does that big tech is maybe too big.  I don't know what you do about it.  I don't know if there's anything to do about it.

Start time: 493.14
End time: 520.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can I push back and say it depends on what you mean by too big.  Yeah.  You know what I mean because like I think I might have even said this on this show before.  Like you know the only previous to this like the only company that you could think of that's like OK my addressable market is every human being on the planet is maybe like Coca Cola.  But no one is like Coca Cola shouldn't sell.  That's a good every human being.  It just depends on what you do with what you have.

Start time: 520.80
End time: 527.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is kind of the point because Coca Cola doesn't have influence over how people think what they wear who they vote for.

Start time: 527.30
End time: 545.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have huge cultural influence is the thing like I've been to my family's from Guyana South America.  So I've been to remote villages in South America far from civilization.  And the one thing you can count on getting is a nice cold you know Coke.  But that's a good thing.  That's a good thing.  But what's wrong with that.

Start time: 546.22
End time: 565.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We look at the rising obesity levels across the world like all these come all these companies are kind of there is there is that but they can't leverage sugar water to do other things like you know destroy markets or you know mess with democracies things like that.  I think but nobody really and I apologize you're right we always talk about this so I'll stop.

Start time: 566.00
End time: 582.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But a final thought.  No let's keep talking about it please.  I think nobody really thought about what it would mean if a handful of companies dominated the discourse in society not just U.S. society but global society.

Start time: 582.14
End time: 607.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nobody really like at least in terms of the tech people there aren't as many people maybe even thinking like the way Steve Jobs used to like thinking in a broader mindset.  And about what their stuff means and what it means for the world.  And yeah I feel like the philosophy the striving a lot of tech these days is very much like let's get as many users as possible to hell with what it means for democracy or anybody for that matter.  Well and Apple's a good case in point.

Start time: 609.68
End time: 642.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You were a participant in the Six Colors annual report card Devendra along with others well known.  And one of the number one complaints people seem to have I don't remember what your thoughts were on this was that it was unseemly that Apple provided a essentially a campaign photo op for the president in Austin at the plant down there.  That was of all the things people were most unhappy about it was Apple's political behavior.

Start time: 642.60
End time: 653.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Almost definitely and Tim Cook was right there like within the first few months Trump was in office you know sitting at the table along with other you know major CEOs and just suffering through those meetings.  I would have said that's his job as a CEO.

Start time: 654.06
End time: 694.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's his job.  Regardless of who's president or what policies he enforces you know your job is as an as and this is the problem with tech being too big is that really it's a business and your job is to make more money.  And that's Tim Cook's doing his responsible being a responsible CEO which means that and I've said this before companies are a moral they don't have a sense of good or bad.  They're there to make money.  How important is Apple's massive flex plant in Austin where they're cranking out dozens if not hundreds of Mac pros Wesley.

Start time: 697.25
End time: 723.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not that big.  Also I mean it's big for I mean for a piece of real estate.  But if you look at like Tesla's factory or something like that it's nowhere compared into the net size which is it's also once again it's not factory.  Yeah it's it's it's it's it's been there for a while and it's it just blends into the landscape.  It's not anything very significant.

Start time: 724.02
End time: 736.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a factory in the same way a Play-Doh fun factory is a factory.  It's the same way that my son's Lego table is a factory.  It's it assembles products.  Yes exactly.

Start time: 736.08
End time: 778.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  From all around the world all over the world.  They don't actually make anything.  No raw material comes in and products come out.  And if I could talk about like what you're saying that is tech too big I think the issue is that the dependence on other companies that build upon these technologies that is where their power comes from.  No one's building their business on just selling coke.  But people are building an ad business a consultancy photo editing copywriting all of that based on Facebook.  Yeah it's enabling so much.  That's why so many more people are coming to depend on it.  But that's important right.

Start time: 778.24
End time: 787.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what a platform does.  That's what Windows did in the 90s right.  It provided a stable platform for people to create businesses on.  Sure I would say we have.

Start time: 787.20
End time: 811.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the thing is it's controlled by Facebook in terms like Windows if they say hey we do not allow third party applications you just don't upgrade right.  You don't choose to move on to the next thing.  You can in some ways you have the ability to opt into those rules.  But with Facebook if they change something everyone has to adopt that platform in that stance.  It's good to remind people that we have the Internet.

Start time: 813.00
End time: 866.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the platform.  This is the Wild West where we could create anything.  I am a bit sad seeing companies like Facebook and all like basically consolidate how communication happens how we think of the Internet and the possibilities of the Internet.  Like to me that's really disappointing and very sad.  So on a broader level what can we do.  We talk about this all the time.  Regulation would be nice.  People who actually understand the technology in government and in leadership who can actually keep these companies in check to like I'm sure you're going to be able to do that.  I'm sure you guys talked about that Clearview AI story.  But that that stuff is insane.  And the only reason Google and others haven't done yet is because even they thought to themselves this is crazy.  We can't do that.  We can't do this.  We can't go this far.  But that's also not preventing a small company backed by Peter Thiel to invest in facial recognition tech and go crazy with it because nothing is stopping them.

Start time: 866.20
End time: 895.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like it's almost the closing the barn door after the horse is gone.  That's it.  It's out there now.  There's nothing we can do about it.  Your face is everywhere and everybody's got it and law enforcement has it.  And I admire companies like Apple for at least trying to keep some lid on privacy.  Of course Apple one could say only does that because their I ads product failed and so they don't have any ad revenue so they can they can afford to say privacy is a good thing.

Start time: 896.82
End time: 929.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you see even that most recent acquisition they did?  But first of all, the most I'm trying to remember the name of it.  It's something that I X X nor dot AX.  Yeah.  So number one, the whole point is that they in theory you could do any sort of machine learning and stuff on the device.  So it doesn't have to go back to the cloud.  So that's great.  Isn't that great?  Yeah.  So privacy but then also they backed out of that that Pentagon thing that people had to back out of.  Yeah.

Start time: 930.02
End time: 957.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So X nor had a contract with the Pentagon to do face recognition for drones.  And this is the one Google was going to get involved in and Google's engineers petitioned them and they pulled out Apple not probably has nothing to do with politics.  It probably has more to do with appearance canceled that maven contract.  Once they bought X nor they said, yeah, we're not going to do it.

Start time: 958.16
End time: 978.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's an interesting thing that you were just talking about.  Like, well, this this independent company doing this facial recognition stuff like this is a rare case of like one of the big platforms buying technology that maybe could be used for nefarious things and being like, no, we only want to use this for stuff that maybe would be consumer friendly and user friendly and privacy friendly.  Yeah.

Start time: 980.50
End time: 996.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, X nor if I remember correctly also did the AI for wise and wise cameras.  Oh, that's right.  That's right.  So I'm guessing there's this possibility they just canceled all contracts across the board.  So everyone was available to work on their project.  Yeah.

Start time: 997.00
End time: 1022.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wise was left with their pants down because the face recognition on the wise cameras stopped working when X nor got purchased.  That's exactly right.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it looks good for Apple to say, well, we're not going to do the D.O.D. thing.  I think it's more complicated than that.  Remember, Jeff Bezos saying, look, it's patriotic companies in America have always done their best work for the defense of this country.  That's patriotic.  What's wrong with that?

Start time: 1023.40
End time: 1048.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think people confuse abiding by the law and helping the government with right and wrong.  You know, turning in Nazis and Nazi Germany was what the government wanted.  And it was what was a good citizen.  Yeah.  Yes.  And so you can't you can't like put what's good and bad with what's the law and what's not the law.  Those aren't the same thing.

Start time: 1049.56
End time: 1051.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you sound like a you sound like a hippie.

Start time: 1053.34
End time: 1068.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was going to say that, I mean, like there's a distinction between helping your country remain strong with its national defense.  And I get what you're saying in terms of like the division line between morally right and not.

Start time: 1069.50
End time: 1079.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Ford built tanks and airplanes for the American War effort in World War II.  Everybody did.  And maybe they made a little money on it, but at the same time, it's the right thing to do.

Start time: 1080.00
End time: 1117.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's patriotic.  And also firebombing Dresden.  You can make all sorts of arguments is morally reprehensible and a war crime and things like that.  But the point is, if if all of this technology stuff is to get an edge and I'm not making like from I also applaud Apple for not getting involved with this particular program.  But if all of these technologies now like AI are what keep you ahead in military stuff in defense, then at what point are you hobbling your own country?  If you if you don't participate, it's complicated, isn't it?

Start time: 1118.94
End time: 1170.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Speaking of complicated, Apple is going to come up against a problem in Russia soon in November.  The parliament, as we've talked about before, passed what Fast Company calls the law against Apple.  The law requires all smartphone devices in Russia to preload Russian apps extensively to support the Russian economy.  But I think it's also feared that those Russian apps might provide information to the government about its citizens.  Apple always prohibits this.  The law goes into effect in July.  And some say Fast Company says this is going to force Apple to decide, do we allow Russia to put spyware on our phones or do we pull out of the market?  What would you what would you do?  Would you do to Vindra?

Start time: 1172.90
End time: 1190.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it would be nice to see Apple kind of resist this somewhat.  But I mean, every every time company gets fine doing business in China.  And that also involves quite a few privacy related issues there, too, except they're not preloading things in China.  But it also seems like it's only a matter of time until that's something that's going to happen.

Start time: 1190.04
End time: 1223.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and Apple had to move the iCloud servers to China for Chinese customers, presumably to companies that the Chinese government could then get into the servers.  For sure.  It's it's really this is it's tough.  We are now in a much more global environment than ever before.  Markets are global.  And yet every country has its own laws.  Every state has its own laws.  Look at California with our new Privacy Act.  All of a sudden, companies have to kind of do something separate for California than they might do in the rest of the country.

Start time: 1224.38
End time: 1238.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. But for Apple, especially, this is so different from their whole philosophy of of we own the device.  Like, it's pure. We do software and hardware.  You know, even, you know, they still sell to China, but it's it's the same essential thing, though.

Start time: 1239.40
End time: 1241.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not a privacy thing. It's an aesthetic.

Start time: 1241.36
End time: 1270.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no. But what I'm saying is, is that right beyond the questions of kowtowing to various regimes requests and things like that, like I can see that it's also a little different because Apple would essentially have to give up what it has said, you know, its entire life.  You know, we make the product we deliver to you is exactly the way we want it to be as opposed to, well, in Russia, you're going to get some sort of chintzy mail or maps app or whatever, whatever.

Start time: 1270.04
End time: 1280.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. But didn't they remove the news app for the China market, too?  I mean, they have made concessions.  They took the Chinese flag governments.

Start time: 1280.20
End time: 1288.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They took the Taiwanese flag off the emojis in Hong Kong and China.  They yeah, they've done that kind of thing all along.  Right around that around the edges.

Start time: 1289.81
End time: 1306.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But again, what I'm saying is the edges.  Yeah, it like if it's a if it's a Russian photo app alongside photos, if it's a big deal.  Yeah. But no, but all down the line, if it's email, if it's the if it's the browser, I'm assuming is the prime thing that the government wants to load up there as well.

Start time: 1307.34
End time: 1311.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it'll be very interesting.  Come July.  I can't wait to see.

Start time: 1312.12
End time: 1326.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is one situation where it seems like the business value, if it's three billion dollars or something close to that, it's not that big to Apple, a company with such a huge war chest like they can they can take that hit and have the goodwill of being the company that said no to Vladimir Putin.

Start time: 1327.00
End time: 1349.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Basically, I think they would love that.  Except then China comes along.  And now you got a problem.  So as soon as you make a concession to Russia, the next you got to look at, you got to play the chess game a couple moves ahead.  Now China is going to come to you say, yeah, we'd like to do the same thing.  Now what do you do?  Because you can't leave China.

Transcript:  It used to be a problem in China.  I remember a few years ago, we'd go to the Apple store, get in line to buy an iPhone and there'd be a ton of people waiting in line who were planning this to were on a mission to buy phones to send to China.  And that's you know, that's how they got the supply chain going.  I know Apple didn't like that.  I don't know.  It's a very I'm just glad I'm not Tim Cook.  Although he's got the wallet to maybe make up for any emotional trauma.  They're there.  They had a record quarter.  They're doing quite well.  They did mention coronavirus.  They've closed stores in China.  They're worried that coronavirus could slow down production.  China, Divinder, you're probably an expert on this, given your job.  China shuts down anyway for the new year, right?  They've been shut down all week.  They decided to extend that shut down for the Lunar New Year a little longer because of coronavirus.  The markets open on Monday.  I don't know if factories are going to start reopening, but there is some concern that production might be slowed, that Apple might even have to move production out of China.  Yeah, I'm definitely not an expert on this.

And honestly, I'm just I'm a little worried too, because it seems like China is not equipped for this.  Most countries aren't equipped for a potential global pandemic.  So it's more than just Apple.

I just watched Contagion last night just to update myself on practices and the best practices in case of flu.  Stay away from Jude Law.  Apparently.  First of all, don't have drinks with Gwyneth Paltrow.  Yeah.  Not the greatest movie, but I know here's why I watched it.  I'm looking at iTunes.  This movie came out in 2011.

You know, I there was a guy at Cal who was an expert in sick joke cycles.  He was he was great.  Dundas, Alan J Dundas, something like that.  He was great because he said they're always tied to our psyches.  And we joke about the stuff that makes us most uncomfortable.  And he would tie the various dead baby jokes had to do with changes in abortion rights in America.  He would tie this in.  And I bet you Dundas has some thoughts about why all the zombie movies became bigger the last 20 years.  And I have to think it's related to our concerns about global pandemics and epidemics.  Like this is like our psyche processing.  You know, and boy, you watch Contagion.  It's a horror movie.

And according to the piece in 2003, when SARS took broke out, it took researchers about 20 months to get come up with a vaccine after the genome was sequenced.  By the time of the Zika virus in 2015, that was brought down to six months and they think they can do it in three months this time.  Nice.  Now, the question is, it comes back to this idea of like if you, you know, once it's out of out of the door, like even if you come up with a vaccine within three months, it'll be already all the way all the way around the world at that point.  So even even as three months too slow to actually stop it dead in its tracks.  Yeah.

Could we ever get a contagion that it's like all of a sudden people find out like a month or two months into it.  It's because we all have our phones and we're touching them 70 80 120 times a day.  And so then because we never back in 1918, we didn't have one thing that we all touched so many times.  And so that all of a sudden, the cure is, is we all have to stop using our smart.

Transcript:  That's Karsten Bondi, our producer, and he's apparently giving me the signal that it's time to mention our first sponsor of the show molecule.  I do have my molecule running and the molecule, the molecule will kill viruses.  It's actually better than a HEPA filter.  HEPA were invented during World War Two, widely used in hospitals, but they're filters.  They trap particles of a certain size.  But the truth is indoor air pollutants can be much, much smaller than those trapped by HEPA filters, including bacteria, mold, viruses, allergens, things that can make you sick, volatile organic compounds, formaldehyde from your carpet, paint from your walls.  Molecule traps it all using something called PICO, photo electrochemical oxidation.  And actually, I have to say we bought a molecule, I think it's now been a couple of years because Lisa would wake up every morning with a headache because when we moved to the country, there were a lot of pollens and allergens and she would just, we got the molecule.  It fixed it.  It fixed it.  Her headache was gone, which was amazing.  That's why we bought another one from Michael's room.  We have one in the studio now.  We love these things.  They not only get all the allergens, all the toxic chemicals, all the viruses and the bacteria, they destroy them.  That's what PICO does.  It actually oxidizes them.  There's a blue light that goes and it just destroys them.  It also has a filter so it gets everything.  It's been great for us and our family.  It's been verified by labs all over the country.  It is an amazing technology.  It'll help you sleep better.  It'll help you breathe better.  It'll help clean the air in your house.  And if you're in an office where you can't open the window, you absolutely need a molecule.  Indoor air can be up to five times worse than outdoor air, according to the EPA.  You've got to stop breathing that horrible air in your office and get a molecule.  They've got the molecule air.  That's the one we have here in the studio for large rooms.  There's now an air mini for smaller rooms.  Choose a molecule that fits your space the best.  You can also pair it to your phone and it'll automatically send you filters when you need new ones.  You don't have to think about it.  You can look on the phone and see the state of your molecule, but it'll also just order filters for you if you want.  You don't have to.  I just think the molecule is a great technology.  For 10% off your first molecule, look at that too.  It's beautiful cast aluminum.  There's the mini on the coffee table there.  For 10% off your first air purifier, molecule is spelled with a K, M-O-L-E-K-U-L-E dot com.  And use the offer code TWIT10 to get 10% off.  We love our molecules.  You will too. Molecule.  It's been tested at the University of Minnesota Particle Calibration Laboratory and other universities.  Molecule.com.  Offer code is TWIT10.  It's the only air purifier I use and recommend.  We love it.  Molecule.  Yeah, I didn't even think of that.  We are defended against the coronavirus.  So come on in, everybody.  Come on in.  Google shutting down its China offices too.  Let's see here.  The EU has patented, I'm sorry, passed the measure requiring a common charger standard.  I'm a little confused because I've read stories that said this is the death knell for the lightning port.  And I've read stories saying it doesn't have anything to do with the lightning port.  Brian, which is it?

Transcript:  I've read it several, several times.  It's the brick, the charging brick, right?  It's the brick.  Yeah.  But it doesn't talk about the port on the phone.  That's why I thought it did.  This is USB-C on one side and lightning on the other.  They could add another dongle, drop that into the box.

Start time: 2078.60

Start time: 2109.50
End time: 2148.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it doesn't corner the market in terms of innovation in terms of like their own power standards because they could say, yeah, we'll use Qi on all of our stuff, but it'll max out at five watts.  But you have to use the Apple branded one to use 35 watts or 45 watts or whatever the higher wattage because they want to make sure that your phone is safe.  So it could be encryption or authorization or handshake to make sure it's an authorized Apple charger.  So they can in terms of accessories, they still can lock it down even though it's a common standard.  So in terms of innovation, I think they're just fighting it.

Transcript:  I think until we have like true over the air wireless charging, wireless charging as it is now is just like it's a nice secondary thing.  It's a nice thing that your phone could do once in a while if you have a wireless charging stand or something by your desk.  But we like to use our phones while they're charging.  And you can't do that easily with wireless.  Wireless is slower.  It's more finicky.  You don't know if like I know a lot of people who have wireless charging stands by their nightstands and half the time they misjudge like where exactly they put their phone or it shifts overnight and it stops charging.  It's two different phones.

There's but it would be nice if we all could.  Can we all just agree?  On the other hand, you don't want governments to say, no, look, you can't use quick charge three.  You can't use Samsung's charge.  You have to use this technology.  You don't want a government to tell tech companies, no, no, we're going to do this standard.  That seems like a recipe for disaster.

It would be nice to have people in government and leadership who understand the stuff enough not to just be like, oh, yeah, we just need a very dumb way to achieve universal charging standards.  We could do this in a smarter way that actually could make Apple want to use USBC in their phones.

What else?  Gone from my mind.  We did Apple.  We did Amazon.  Facebook had a good quarter.  We mentioned there.  Oh, I know.  So this last week was the 10th anniversary of the iPad.  I thought the iPad was a pretty good thing.  I like my iPad.  Apparently, I'm a loser.  Everybody agrees.  The iPad.  Ben Thompson, the headline on Strategory, the tragic iPad.  John Gruber.  It's a disappointment.  Even in this thing, Devinder, that you and everybody else got to do,  but I wasn't invited to, that Jason Snell does the Apple report card.  What he gave in the iPad, the D plus or something.  I thought the iPad was pretty good.  What's wrong with the iPad?  What did you give it?  What did you give it, Devinder?  I forget.

Start time: 2525.10
End time: 2576.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't remember?  In the report card.  But it does seem like we should at least give the iPad credit for being the tablet that survived.  It was the thing that inspired everybody to make tablets.  And now there are certainly very few Android tablets I think are worth buying.  Microsoft took the strategy of trying to turn Windows into a tablet thing.  So convertible PCs technically are tablet-like,  but I still don't like the way Windows handles tablet stuff.  So the iPad is the only successful tablet.  And that makes a lot of sense.  It's been doing good business for them.  I think where Apple falters is in terms of supporting multitasking.  They were slow to that.  They were slow to turning the iPad into a usable computing platform.  But as a tablet, I think they deserve credit for at least being successful and trying to push things forward.

Everybody should have one.  That was the first iPad I bought myself too.  And I bought it specifically so my parents can FaceTime my baby daughter.  And it's been perfect for that.

They seem to agree that that's very poorly implemented.  I think everybody on MacBreak Weekly said, yeah, they should just dump the multitasking  because it doesn't work very well.  And they blame this not on Steve Jobs, whose original conception they think was right on,  I would agree, but on subsequent software developers over the years.  I think we can blame...  Sorry.  Who's the scapegoat everybody at Apple blames for everything wrong with Apple?  He was fired. I can't remember his name.  Oh, we got rid of him.  Johnny Ive?  No. Maybe we could blame Johnny now.

And I think about this a lot.  There's certain people out there who maybe we can blame Steve Jobs because he made the  trucks versus cars thing.  So there's a certain segment of people that believed that tablets would replace the computer.  And so the fact that 10 years...  That's what this is about, right?  Is that there are certain people that are disappointed that you still need something  with a keyboard and a mouse.  And so if it's just that it's not doing everything yet, that doesn't mean that it's a failure  as a product, right?

Transcript:  It's all Scott's fault.  iPad Pro, though, great hardware.  We've loved the hardware.  It's been well reviewed since they launched that thing.  And certainly in the most recent years, it's beautiful.  But the software has always been slow to catch up to that hardware.  So Apple, they've been lagging on macOS software and iOS, too.  They have a lot of software innovation they really need to focus on.  But the iPad as a computer replacement, I think a lot of people I talk to, even tech journalists,  some people use that for all they do, you know, for image editing, for reporting.  I personally couldn't live that way.  But it certainly it would be great for like a weekend when I need to go and just write a long thing and not have to worry too much about like heavy.

Transcript:  That's kind of my point is that it's all these people that are like, well, I'll never need a computer again.  I'll have this tablet and I can.  And so it's just the disappointment of those people that imagine that that's what they were going to have by now.  And what if the answer is, is that again, you have a car for something, you have a truck for something, you got a semi for something like so.  All right. A tablet is great for like you were saying, I did FaceTiming with the grandparents this afternoon.  Like, so so what that the tablet didn't kill the laptop?  Like, who cares? Yeah. Yeah.

Transcript:  I think the problem is that it's all all of this stuff.  So expensive. If like all of us, somebody's buying you this stuff, you can have an iPhone and Apple, MacBook, a Windows machine, an iPad.  And then it kind of all is a continuum of stuff.  And you use the right thing for the right time.  But if you had to only choose one, probably wouldn't be the iPad.  Right. And that normal people choose one.  They're so expensive.

Transcript:  The from my friends, the I don't use a Mac, but the value prop that they have seen the most out of iOS 13 is Sidecar.  And so it's it's they've given up on using the iPad for everything.  But as a companion to their laptop, it is that feature makes it far more usable for them.  And so if Apple was choosing not to focus at being standalone, but actually part of a workflow where it's easy to work with it, their applications or other hardware, I think that is the true nature and the true purpose of iPad where it could really shine.

Transcript:  Let me take a break.  I want to pick this conversation up because I've been working on a theory and you can help me develop this about where computing is going, going forward.  And the iPad works into this.  But but but we need to take a break because the Super Bowl is going to start any minute now.  And I want to get out of here in five minutes.  Our show today brought. No, I know we have another hour.  Our show today brought to you by Captera.  If you're in business, you need software, right?  But so much business software is can I be blunt crap?  Mostly because you're using old stuff.  That's why so many people are still running Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 95, Internet Explorer 8, because they have an old program that the boss's nephew Joey wrote when he was in school.  Now he's moved to Borneo and he's not updating it.  But that's the only thing.  Captera is a directory of all the best enterprise software, the big categories like CRM, the little stuff to like, you know, individual line of business software like yoga studio management.  You can.  There are 700 categories, thousands of programs in here.  No longer.  It doesn't make sense to Google it.  Doesn't make sense to ask people.  Just go to captera.com slash twit.  You could find the right software.  It's really easy to say here, you know, here's the category.  Here's what I'm looking for.  They then have customized filters that are applied to that specific program.  You know how many seats if it's on the Web or if it's on premises, if it's, you know, just if it's a yoga studio with a lot of people.  If it's a yoga studio, whether you can make appointments, you know, all the stuff that you need, you click those boxes and you narrow it down.  You can do a side by side comparison just like the magazine.  See all the features together.  And then the best part about captera kicks in because captera has more than a million real world reviews from real users.  So you can before you decide to buy, you can see what people are actually using the software say about it.  This is this is amazing.  I think one of the reasons there are so many reviews is because captera is free.  It's there's no charge ever for this.  It is a free directory.  And I think people feel like, well, I want to pay it forward.  I mean, this is great.  So you do and you're more than welcome.  Leave a review.  It really helps make captera the leading free online resource for software solutions.  Captera believes every business can thrive with the right software.  You deserve it.  There's lots of other information there.  Helpful articles, guidebooks, step by step ebooks.  It's all free.  Captera, C-A-P-T-E-R-R-A dot com slash twit.  It helped us find a perfect sales system.  Captera is the solution.  Captera dot com slash twit.  Find the tools to make an informed software decision for your business.  It's free.  Did I say it's free?  It's free.

Please let me do a Linux show.  So I think these are going to be great.  Nice short bits that help you with little tips and tricks.  Watch it.  Twit dot TV slash H.O.I.  So here's my theory.  This has to do a little bit with the iPad.  It's clear that what's happening with computing is it's going from a big powerful computer in the middle.  In the earliest days, it was a mainframe with dumb terminals at the end.  But then it's slowly spreading out to the edge.  Then you had a desktop PC.  Now that's the big dumb computer in the middle.  And it's moving out to the edge again with your phone, with IOT devices.  Computing power has chips, memory.  Software has gotten so cheap that you can put a computer in your light bulb now.  And so this is what Sacha Nadella is calling computing at the edge.  And it strikes me that that's what we're seeing.  The reason the iPad is maybe a little frustrating for some people is it's more of an edge device than a central device.  But it's not quite as edge device as the iPhone.  It's kind of stuck in the middle.  Does that make sense, Devendra?  Yeah.

Start time: 3190.91
End time: 3247.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's kind of a transitionary device.  And I can understand that frustration.  Yeah.  Like I said, I've talked to a lot of people who use their primary computing device.  I could never do that.  And if I tried to do that, I feel like I would be very frustrated because the CMS we use at Engadger is nearly 20 years old at this point.  Like using stuff like that, like ugly old Web Tech.  See, you're stuck with that old stuff.  Yeah.  Like I was just talking about.  Yeah.  But we need, I think we still need people doing productivity work.  Still need like traditional computers.  There's nothing wrong, I think, with a traditional computer.  And you look at laptops over the past couple of years, over the last year, honestly, like laptops look incredible now.  They're so sleek.  They can do a lot more.  Sure, you're still using a keyboard and mouse and dealing with older interfaces.  But I think what you can actually do with those machines is a lot more than you could in the past.  And yeah, that means the iPad being more of a consumption device, maybe not as much of a creativity device.  I think that's still useful.  But Microsoft, like their dual screen stuff, I'm really intrigued by that.  Oh, yeah.

And of course, Sachin Adela talks about it because they eventually their business model is Azure, the centralized data and services that they want to offer.  And that's why they don't care so much about Windows anymore.  Sure.

Transcript:  I mean, game consoles are computing now if you're if you're playing games in your living room.  But now you can also stream your game and what you're playing and broadcast from that to to Mixer or Twitch or something.  So what you could do with your computer is a lot different now.  You could you could do competing related stuff pretty much anywhere all across your home.  And I don't know, like to me, I would love to see a dual screen device like I've tested out a couple of those laptops with two separate screens like the Asus Zimbabwe Pro Duo.  And that thing works really well.  Like it's a big 12 inch screen right below the main screen.  And there's a lot you can do with that.  They just showed off a new one, the ZenBook Duo.  I think it's CES.  That one's like three pounds, a lot sleeker.  That sort of stuff, I think, will really extend the functionality of what you can expect from a PC to like things are transforming all around us.

Start time: 3313.08
End time: 3345.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do see, though, a lot of I mean, I'm more interested in the Duo with two screens and a hinge.  And maybe the ZenBook Duo, which is kind of an interesting idea.  Then I am in a bendy screen and Samsung, of course, with the fold and we've seen other companies CES.  We saw a number of folding screens.  And of course, in nine days, Samsung is reportedly going to announce a competitor to the Nokia folding phone, a flip phone with a bendy screen.  I thought it was. Have you tried the new Nokia?

Start time: 3346.12
End time: 3386.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't tried the Nokia, but I've definitely seen enough of the bendy screen phones, especially like the Galaxy Fold.  I am. I wrote a thing about this, I think, last year after the Microsoft stuff debuted.  Like I I think that split screen design is going to be a lot more functional and a lot more sturdy and useful for actual daily use than a folding screen.  I feel like we'll get there eventually.  But folding screens today are so precarious.  It is insane what these companies are expecting these phones to do.  And they're all going to have bumps, wrinkles, creases, and they're going to break.  They're going to break.  It's insane.  I don't think we should be going down that road right now.  Did you guys, Leo or whoever, when you were at CES, did you see the Huawei ones?

Transcript:  Like, yeah, they're beautiful.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I know given the environment I was in, you better not buy it because, you know, it's Chinese spyware.  Yeah.  But by the way, that was like, oh, my God, this is really sexy.  I think they got it done right.  Yeah.  That's the trifle.  It's a trifold.

Start time: 3406.04
End time: 3452.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the problems with the fold is it folds up into a phone you don't want.  It's too small.  It's dopey.  And then it unfolds.  And then the creases are a problem.  I'm interested in the Duo because the idea of a Duo is...  So the Duo is Android and the Neo is Windows, right?  Am I getting those two right?  I believe so.  Or vice versa.  One of them.  Anyway, the idea is that you might have to have a phone that's a little bit smaller.  So the idea is that you might have controls on one side and something else on the other.  Do people work that way?  Is that sensible?  I think it is.  Because the idea of the fold is it's just a bigger screen.  It's just a bigger screen.  It's like, oh, now it's an iPad.  But Microsoft's saying, well, you divide your functionality up among two screens.

Start time: 3452.00
End time: 3491.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The way a lot of us work in Windows and on PCs is like you may have apps side by side  or at least apps like maybe part of one window over here that you can keep an eye on the  live stream or something while you work on your email over there.  And that sort of functionality we have never really had in a mobile device.  So that's what I'm really interested in is seeing like how what we can do with that sort of  functionality or have one app take up both screens but have like your email folders and  categories on one side and all your messages on the other.  It opens up the way we work, I think, in really new ways.  So I'm excited.  I'm not sure if they're going to pull this off.  And I've learned not to get too excited about some Microsoft hardware.  So we'll see.  Or even 100 percent Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know that the idea is it's it's like a pocket square when it's folded up.  It's smaller than a phone.  It opens up into a phone size, not a big screen.  It opens up to a phone size.  You like this idea?

Start time: 3569.14
End time: 3583.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no, actually, I know we're jumping around here, but I thought that this is too tall.  So one of the things that I like about the concept and we've jumped from laptops to smartphones.  So forgive me.  The thing that I like about that.

Start time: 3583.12
End time: 3595.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, this is all of a piece because this is all about computing on the edge.  This is all about smaller, different computing devices that might in the long run replace regular computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So one of the things that I like about the concept of foldables on phones is that the real estate in my pocket can be reduced.  Right.  So my ideal phone would be a phone that could get back to you know, there is a foldable razor coming out, but get back to the you fold it up and it's smaller size like the old razors used to be.  You unfold it and you can have a phablet.  I would love a phablet.  It's just that I don't want to have to carry around a phablet.  So like that's the sweet spot that I'm hoping at.  I don't know that I'm sold on foldables for phones, but if someone could give me a phablet when I want it and a smaller phone in my pocket, that's what I want.

Start time: 3640.86
End time: 3669.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the leaked Twitter video.  Is this shaky the way it's supposed to be?  It's very shaky.  So you see that the phone itself is a tiny little phone.  There's only a little screen that's kind of notification screen.  Then it opens up.  You know, notice how he opened it with his fingers all over it.  That just seems to me that we're going to have a big problem about two months with these phones just breaking.  I don't know if I trust these flexible screens very much.

Start time: 3669.32
End time: 3718.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think what's happening, by the way, is that you look at a folding phone is like, oh, man, that's so cool.  That's the future.  That's the future I want.  I want to see the screen that can do this.  This is what I've seen in sci fi.  I think realistically, in terms of what we can build now, these dual separate screen, you know, idea just makes a lot more sense.  And we don't talk about hinges as much, you know, because it's not as sexy as a folding screen.  But laptop companies, Microsoft, Lenovo, a lot of folks have been building these convertible laptops over the past decade, basically, and really perfecting their hinge tech.  And I think that is really reliable.  It's really sturdy and it can take a lot more abuse than a folding screen can.  So that's that's my big thing for these dual screen devices like the duo and the neo.  Just a really intriguing from that respect.  Expensive, right?

Start time: 3719.00
End time: 3737.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, we don't know anything yet.  The Razer is fifteen hundred bucks.  Yeah.  And it even said in the apparently I didn't see it because I didn't buy it.  But it says in the in the instructions, it's to be expected that you'll have some bumps and ripples on the screen.  It's like, I don't want that.

Start time: 3737.20
End time: 3740.99

Start time: 3742.24
End time: 3809.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if they could perfect the folding screen, I guess I would be OK with it.  So that's so that's one approach, which is to make it a smaller phone that turns into a normal size phone.  There's Jeffrey Fowler from the Washington Post talking about it or what?  And Samsung's doing both.  So Samsung is going to have a small phone that unfolds apparently the Z Flip and they're going to have a Galaxy Fold style eight inch screen that unfolds.  Which would you prefer or would you want both?  I think this is all about I think this is why to me the edge is interesting.  It's choice.  And the problem is if you can only choose one, that makes it hard because one doesn't do everything.  But if you could afford to have so like a lot of computing is going to be going through my Amazon Echo or my Google Home Max or maybe my folding phone or maybe my folding tablet or maybe my laptop.  The computing is going to be environmental ambient and it's going to be whatever device is appropriate.

Start time: 3809.62
End time: 3853.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leo, just just for again, coming back to smartphones like you said choice like we've only had one choice for 10 years now, which is a slab of glass out of 2001, a space Odyssey.  Right. So I don't care.  Like what if you know, again, cars and trucks and things like you have a choice like I would love 10 years from now for there to be three to five different form factors for devices.  And and it's not even for use cases.  It's also for like personal preference and taste and things like that.  Like that's more interesting to me than everybody has a thing that looks exactly the same.  So even though I get pushback on this, like no one's buying those foldable phones or whatever.  I'm like, but I like the fact that people are trying to find something else.

Transcript:  Just like 3D and TV.  I think people aren't ready for it.  It's going to be imperfect.  And I think it's going to cast a stain on the whole foldables for years to come.  Right.  Because some people got sick from 3D.  It's the same thing with these foldables.  Someone says, oh, I bought one of those cost me more money than any other phone.  And then it broke after eight months because the screen had a crease in it.

Start time: 3899.48
End time: 3917.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and the TV thing is interesting because they just died.  The 3D trend died because the TV makers had like the 4K and HDR ended up being the better upsell to people  rather than wear these ugly glasses and maybe you'll get 3D that looks as good as the theater.  It never did.  And that was the big problem.

So that'll sell this year.  They're not selling the drop down one.  That's just like a prototype right now.  It's so expensive.  But I think a lot of companies have been pursuing foldable, rollable tech and displays.

He's Superman.  He's Superman.  And also Witcher is a popular series and like it is that that's a deeper discussion, I'd say.  But I don't think Apple, a billion dollars, first of all, weird to say, is not that much money compared to what Netflix spends, what Disney spends on Disney Plus.  Yeah.

Game of Thrones did that.  Watchmen, I think, did that to a degree, although not everybody did that.  Watchmen is a perfect show.  Boy, I liked Watchmen.

Transcript:  Mighty proud of it.  You and me both, buddy.  Our show today brought to you by Wasabi.  I was just talking to Chris Marquardt, our photo guy, about his backup strategy.  He surprised me.  He uses Wasabi as his cloud storage.  You might be surprised by the people who use Wasabi.  Wasabi is hot cloud storage.  Maybe you've not heard of the name, but you might want to think about Wasabi for yourself  because it is faster, better, less expensive, more reliable than the big guys.  It blows away Google and Microsoft.  Wasabi, I'll give you an example.  Wasabi uses the Amazon S3 API, but never charges for API requests.  They don't even charge for egress.  Wasabi, because they came up with a revolutionary process that lays data on disks sequentially,  as opposed to in blocks, is 80% cheaper than S3 and six times faster.  And man, talk about security.  There's my buddy David Friend.  Hey David.  We love David Friend.  He created Wasabi with his partner, Jeff Flowers.  You get 11 nines of durability.  11 nines.  I would willing to bet that it's more secure than your on-premises storage.  If you're, like many of us, looking at cloud for your business, you've got to look at Wasabi.  You can make some storage immutable.  That means it cannot be changed by ransomware.  That's huge these days.  Data center redundancy means your data is always safe.  They even do active integrity checking on every single file to make sure you lose not  one bit.  That's how you get 11 nines of durability.  HIPAA compliant, FINRA compliant, CJIS compliant.  Talk about savings.  Just take a look.  Go to wasabi.com.  W-A-S-A-B-I dot com.  I think if you're presenting to the boss a cloud storage strategy, I know you're going  to do Azure and you're going to do Google Cloud and you're going to do AWS, but I really  think you ought to look at Wasabi.  Add a fourth name to that.  Wasabi.  In fact, if you want to try it for yourself, we've got an unlimited month.  Just bang on it.  Upload everything.  Click the free trial link at wasabi.com.  Use the offer code TWIT for a month's unlimited use so you can really see for yourself.  I'm telling you, it is the best.  Join the movement.  Migrate your data to the cloud, but do it with confidence with Wasabi.  Go to wasabi.com.  Make sure you use the offer code TWIT.  Everybody needs storage.  Everybody needs Wasabi.  Wasabi.com.  Offer code TWIT.  Thank you, Wasabi, for supporting the show.  Good old Agit Pai.  Good old Agit Pai.  He's been busy.  FCC's been busy.  We admitted one year after Motherboard and the New York Times revealed that certain carriers,  certain mobile phone companies were selling your data to people like bounty hunters.  One year, the FCC finally says, oh, you know what?  They're selling your data.  Agit Pai says, we've concluded.  I've got to read you the quote because it's hysterical.  We concluded that one or more carriers, one or more, we can't say how many, broke the  law selling location data.  He wrote a letter to Frank Pallone, who's a member of the House.  I wish to inform you, says Agit Pai.  The FCC's Enforcement Bureau has completed its extensive investigation and has concluded  that one or more wireless carriers apparently violated federal law.  Apparently.  We'll see.  We'll see.  In the coming days, Pai writes, I intend to circulate to my fellow commissioners for their  consideration one or more notices of apparent liability for forfeiture in connection with  the apparent violations.  That's three appearance in one letter.  That's good.  As Vice Motherboard, which discovered this a year ago, points out, Pai's been foot dragging  and stonewalling through much of the last year.  Other commissioners like Democrat Jessica Rosen-Warsaw, who is often in opposition to  the Republican Chairman, Agit Pai, said that for more than a year, the FCC was silent.  This is an FCC commissioner speaking.  After news reports alerted us that for just a few hundred dollars, shady middlemen could  sell your location within a few hundred meters based on your wireless phone data.  It's chilling to consider what the black market could do with this data.  It puts the safety and privacy of every American with a wireless phone at risk.  Commissioner Jeffrey Starks wrote an editorial for the New York Times criticizing lack of  follow through.  I'm glad he wrote, we may finally act on these egregious allegations.  My question is, what took so long?  And of course, this doesn't say they're going to enforce it.  It just says we're looking into it.  And it doesn't say what the fines will be.  We're looking into it.  It's apparently.  Yeah, finally act in quotes.  Quote.  And you know what will happen?  They'll do a slap on the wrist.  And these companies, which make tons of money on this stuff, will pay a small pittance for  the right to keep on doing it effectively or to have done it for the past year.  Anyway, I guess we should mention they're going to do something about it, maybe.  Apparently, maybe.  Apparently, I'm really even if they're fine.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  You, Wesley.  And then and then we'll give it.

Transcript:  In terms of telecoms and fines, there might be a fine, but there's very little enforcement  to make sure those fines are paid.  So even if they were told, hey, you need to pay X amount of dollars, they could say, sure.  And then never pay the fine and never get enforced that they're not getting paid.

Transcript:  I think, yeah, the FCC has historically never been one to press these companies too hard.  And I don't think Adjapai is also the guy to do it.  Like, I'm really interested to see, like, which consulting firm or lobby group he joins.  Well, it's a revolving door.  He was a Verizon.  He was a Verizon lobbyist, right?

Start time: 4814.14
End time: 4846.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's always been a revolving door for this job.  It's too bad.  Into and out of private, the private sector.  Facebook this week put out a, as Gizmodo called it, confusing off Facebook activity privacy  tool.  They also says it doesn't do poop.  Doesn't clear, it's nothing.  Have any of you played with the activity tool?  I mean, the one thing it does do, I am not a Facebook user, so I can't look at it.  But apparently.

Start time: 4847.04
End time: 4886.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I did.  Sorry, I did too, because I kind of had to walk it back.  The day it came out, I talked about, I used it.  I talked about it.  I was like, oh, wow, this is actually, this is refreshing.  I can see all these things and I can case by case say, not you, not you, not you.  And I was like, wow, all right, this is actually, it's late because remember, this was supposed  to happen a long time ago.  But it was, of all the things where it's like, well, we're giving you granular control over  how your data.  Wow, that's very intuitive.  And then I learned subsequently that it's basically bupkis.  I think it doesn't do anything.

Start time: 4887.90

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 4893.38
End time: 4913.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but the point is, is that all it does is sever the connection so that the third  parties have the data on you.  Facebook has the data on you.  And when you say, I don't want you to share this anymore, it just severs the connection.  But it's not deleting.  On either side.  Yeah, right.  But everybody still has the data.  So then it's.

Start time: 4913.94
End time: 4933.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does it stop it from doing it going forward or will as inevitably happens?  You know, with Twitter, Facebook and these others, I would typically every year or so  go, oh, yeah, I should probably delete my application connections and all that.  Go through them, Google.  Is it like that?  That then you'll start making more of them?

Start time: 4934.34
End time: 4976.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We'll see that actually I haven't followed up on that, so I don't know.  But the point being that in theory, the way that I remember using it is that so then if  I go back to another website and make the connection again, yeah, that is right.  So it maybe puts the onus on me to always go in.  So then if you think about it that way, it's useless because then it's requiring me to  go in. Now, they're going to sell it as well.  We're giving you this control.  But my control is that every time I have to think about, OK, it's another it's the first  of the month. I got to go into my Facebook and see if I can sever.  And by the way, all I'm doing is severing for a certain amount of time, but it's not

Start time: 4976.86
End time: 5027.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  deleting it.  So Shannon Wooden, who's writing it, gives Motto and says it doesn't do poop, writes  Zuck's use of the phrase is control your off Facebook activity and clear this information  from your cat is misleading.  You're not really controlling or clearing much of anything.  You're just telling Facebook to put the data it has on you in two separate buckets that  are otherwise mixed together.  So you're clearing the connection Facebook made between its data and the data it gets  from third parties.  But the data so face.  So the data is still stored at Facebook.  They didn't delete anything.  I don't even know if this is compliant with GDPR or the New California Privacy Act, because  in both cases, you're supposed to be able to find out what data a company keeps on you  and you're supposed to be able to delete it.  Have them delete it. Right.

Start time: 5027.58
End time: 5060.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's what I'm going to say is that, again, I walked it back, but I was very impressed  with the transparency now.  And I'm going to also walk back the fact that you had to go through this layer and this  layer and this layer of settings and settings to find it.  However, once I got there, I was like, wow, this was really easy to figure out this site  that I remember visiting once six months ago.  There's the amount of connections they have on me.  And I was like, all right, stop.  So it's not useless.  If you're willing to be very vigilant, I guess.  Yeah.

Start time: 5062.92
End time: 5073.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I this is why I'm not on Facebook.  I don't feel like Facebook is completely transparent about what they're up to, what they're  doing and what they're giving you.  Anybody disagree?

Start time: 5101.32
End time: 5107.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 5107.98
End time: 5109.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 5109.98

Start time: 5114.98
End time: 5152.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's nobody holding them accountable.  But I feel like Facebook tends to throw breadcrumbs at things like this and they hope it's  enough to satisfy us.  And to me, it's like didn't they also announce that this summer there was going to be their  governing board or the...  Facebook oversight board.  The oversight.  Yeah, they're going to start hearing cases about content issues.  And we don't know what that means because they're entirely in charge of it.  And yeah, it's one of those things where it sounds like Facebook is trying to do the  right thing, but they don't they don't ever want to let anyone else kind of come in to  really check out what's going on.  We need some independent oversight at some point.

Start time: 5153.22
End time: 5188.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Facebook's independent content oversight board, according to CNBC, leaves the company  firmly in control.  Yeah.  So the board will have the ability to review content moderation cases as long as they don't  involve content posted on Facebook's marketplace, fundraisers, Facebook dating, WhatsApp,  Messenger, Instagram Direct or Oculus services.  And Facebook said the board's decisions will not set precedent.

Start time: 5189.88
End time: 5194.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So maybe Facebook can pick the judges and maybe...  Well, wait a minute.

Start time: 5194.66
End time: 5239.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they picked the first round and then those judges picked the rest.  I don't even know who's on the board at this point.  I don't know if they've picked them yet.  They're going to do it for six years.  It will review the annual reports prepared by the trust to determine the operational and  procedural effectiveness of the board.  Of course, after six years, they could say, it didn't work.  I bet they will.  Facebook will implement board decisions to allow or remove the content properly brought  to it for review within seven days of the release of the board's decision on how to  action the content.  You know what?  This is, to me, a way to pass the buck.  Yeah.  So we don't have to decide.  And obviously, this board won't have the bandwidth to deal with all of the myriad  content problems on Facebook.  I mean...

Start time: 5239.46
End time: 5257.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's also...  You set up this regime in place to say that you have a regime in place.  But then, number one, it's probably set up to not be functional for things that  actually matter.  And then number two, if some outlier happens, you can always say that it's not...  Well, this isn't a part of the regime, right?

Start time: 5257.80
End time: 5265.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Facebook decides which cases the oversight board will use.  Exactly.  So they could just say, well, we're not...  This one's not for you.  Well, right.

Start time: 5265.82
End time: 5297.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're saying like, this is not a judiciable or whatever.  Right.  I don't know.  You know, like, this is not...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It reminds me of when I was in middle school and we had a Star Trek RPG on Prodigy.  And we came up...  You were scrolling down and I'm looking at the bylaws.  And like, we wrote that sort of thing up where it's like, well, you can't do this  against someone else on your ship and you can't...  And like, that's literally what they're doing.  It's just pretend RPGs or like bylaws.

Start time: 5298.54
End time: 5316.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're not even doing that, I wish.  What they're doing is they're making a body and saying, you will make the decisions,  but you won't have to spell out what the laws are.  It's like saying, we want you to be ethical, but not define what ethics is.  Because some person...  It's kind of like creating a Supreme Court.  It's like philosophy.

Start time: 5317.06
End time: 5321.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then instead of letting the court decide what cases to take, you tell them what cases to take.

Start time: 5322.98
End time: 5350.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And also, like the trolley car problem.  If you could choose to hit the people or hit the one, whoever, and either choice is  actually an ethical choice.  But if you don't define what your ethics are, you can't predict how things will be treated  on the case going forward.  Just flip the coin.  Them treating it from a case by case basis means that they never have to write down,  they never have to define what is truly right and what is truly wrong, what is ethical,  what is not ethical.

Avast, which for years people preferred as an antivirus because they didn't have to pay  any money.  Turns out they were doing more than paying money.  Avast bought a company, a marketing company that they sent a jump shot.  They sent all the information that they collected and they collected a lot from people using  Avast to jump shot, which then sold it to marketers, brands and so forth.  So much heat now that Avast is actually shutting down jump shot.

We dot com a Facebook alternative that says no ads, no spyware, no BS.  If anybody ever heard of this, because the reason I ask is.  Well, if they don't have ads or spyware and it's free, who's paying for this?  Shouldn't this always be the question when you see something that's free?  Uh, well, OK.  So you're the product.  Yeah.  Why?  Why?  How can they give this away and not have any ads?  Free forever, it says.  Free forever.  No ads, no spyware.  Free forever.  Is this just some billionaire that's given it away?

I haven't heard anything about this company, but it is this to me seems like  if you're going to do a social network like this, right, like maybe you'd expect  people to pay something a little like the way WhatsApp had like a nominal fee.  99 cents a year.

Look, I mean, number one, um, it's like the whole Google thing.  Like, well, what if you just did a, uh, a search engine that only had two ads  or something like that?  Like in theory, you could always do a social network that didn't sell your data  or whatever and just ran banner ads or whatever, you could probably still make  a billion dollars a year if you could get traction.

Start time: 5669.78
End time: 5744.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, but that's the, this is, we could do an hour on this, like, cause there's  been a lot of smart pieces about this recently about even, you know, we've  said for years that Google is the greatest advertising engine ever created  because they're at the point of intention.  If you search for a hotel in Marietta, Georgia, it's likely that you're going  to, um, want to go to Marietta, Georgia in the near future.  And so like, but at the same time, like there's been all these studies that say  that, like, you know, eBay and even all of the, in fact, like the last decade of  unicorns and stuff like that, they throw these, they throw their money at these  targeted ads, targeted.  And, and, and the idea is, is, well, wouldn't those have been searches anyway?  Wouldn't those have been like, so that if, if it's almost like the banner ad,  which used to be like this shotgun approach, like, or, or even there's that  famous quote, like, I don't know.  Um, uh, I spend all this money on advertising and half of it is wasted.  I just don't know what ha what half.  Um, a lot of people are now thinking that maybe 30% is wasted.  We just don't know what 30%.  So like, that's the, that's it.  That's the progress we've made.

Transcript:  I worry because ad tech kind of ruins the internet.  And I, I, I worry that if advertisers are demanding this, I worry it's  going to ruin podcasting them.  It's the next frontier in podcasting is figuring out how to track our audience.  And, uh, already I mentioned this before, but already Spotify has announced,  yeah, we're going to have, we're going to, we're going to, we're going to have  all sorts of metrics about our, uh, our listeners.  So come, come buy ads on the Spotify podcasts.

Start time: 5775.94

Transcript:  There is there, there is the ability to put like, um, what's the term I  can't think of right now, right.  Right.  Exactly.  Um, um, again, I can't remember the term, but, um, however, in theory, like  that's still, there's several degrees removed as opposed to Spotify where  Spotify, like when I look on my stats at Spotify, not only can I see the age,  the demo, everything I can see the top five artists of the people that  listen to my podcast.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  So that's a completely different thing than say overcast or even, um, Apple  podcasts or Google podcasts or anything.  It's like, like where it's just basically an RSS feed.  And unless I put a pixel thing on there, like all I know is this episode got  downloaded and maybe from this IP address so that you can figure out it's in this  geographic region and that sort of thing.

I think Starlink is the greatest thing ever because we were talking about computing  at the edge.  What do you need if you're going to compute the edge?  You need internet everywhere.

He's talking about, uh, what Starlink is going to do.  Imagine adding internet access to the rest of the other half of the world.  Only half the world has internet now.  Imagine putting those other 3 billion people online and what the effect of that will be.  Um, that's what to me is fascinating.  And we're going to start seeing Starlink this year.  We're going to start and it will get better every year as he launches more and more and  more up to 12,000 lower.  More space junk.  More space junk.  So who wants to argue against?

So a lot of the initial, uh, customers for Starlink are probably going to be for  financial trades, uh, to major, uh, financial hubs, uh, which means that it's  going to be super expensive for the very, very sensitive applications.  That being said, that means it's going to be high end initially.  Um, and that's fun.  He's got to make that money back.

And, um, what is it going to be like for the us government to be able to tap into  some of the most important, richest transactions, communications, uh, around  the world, uh, with a subpoena.  Um, so as more people and more high value targets move onto this platform, um, it,  it's going to be really curious as to how many people will trust it, uh, knowing  that the us government can just tap into it.  Um, I don't know if he can find a way of incorporating it into a place where he  doesn't have to, um, have to, to submit to these types of, uh, law authorities,  whether it's Russia, whether it's China, whether it's the us government to try to  move away for that kind of oversight.  Um, I don't know.  No one's really talking about this generally speaking, uh, as an American,  I guess we are not, but other countries, when you're talking about a global  internet access, that might be a concern that, um, that might come up.

And like, you know, so, uh, the, the thing that made me want to say that is that you  were like, well, uh, Elon Musk hasn't, hasn't done anything controversial lately.

I think, uh, let's take a break and we'll get some final thoughts and stories in here.  But first a word from a zip recruiter.  Zip recruiter is the way to hire.  And I could tell you from our own experience, it's a amazing, uh, of  course, a great place to go if you're looking for a job, but if you're hiring  zip recruiter makes it so much faster, so much easier, so much more effective.  You probably saw the ads with a cafe alturas, uh, which is a coffee shop.  Uh, their COO Dylan Miscavitz was looking for director of coffee, having a hard time  finding qualified applicants switched to zip recruiter.  And that's when the, and we've used this too.  And it really, it really helps.  They will, besides the fact that zip recruiter puts your posting on more  than a hundred other job boards, it takes all the incoming, uh, applications, puts  them in the zip recruiter interface, formatting the resume so they're easy to read.  They have screening questions so you can eliminate people that aren't right for you.  It makes it very, very simple.  They don't jam your inbox, all of the benefits of zip recruiter.  But one thing they do that's really cool is zip recruiters.  Technology will look at your posting and find people who have the right  experience and then tell them about you.  They promote your posting.  They'll invite them to apply for your job.  And that's what Dylan discovered.  He, he had qualified candidates apply within hours in just a few days.  He found his director of coffee.  We had the same experience literally within a few hours, qualified  candidates started rolling in.  It's a great feeling, especially because it, you know, if you're the person  who does hiring at your company, it's so hard, a small company like ours,  somebody leaves, we've got two weeks notice, we've got to fill that job.  We're going to be slammed.  It's going to be hard.  And the fact that we can get great applicants and we get them fast makes  such a difference for us.  Four out of five employers who post on zip recruiter, get a quality  candidate within the first day.  That is a technology that really works.  I, you got to try zip recruiter.  It's effective no matter what size business you could try it for free at  ziprecruiter.com.  It's a special address.  It lets them know you're, you heard it here.  ziprecruiter.com slash twit Z I P zip recruiter R E C R U I T E R zip  recruiter.com slash twit T W I T.  It's the smartest way to hire.  We've used it.  We use it now for every opening and it makes such a big difference.  Highly recommended.  ziprecruiter.com slash twit.  Thank you.  Zip recruiter for doing such a great job for us.  Caltech.  Big payday for Caltech.  If the decision's upheld, I imagine Apple and Broadcom will appeal.  Apple is ordered to pay $837.8 million to Caltech.  Broadcom $270 million, more than $1.1 billion for patent infringement.  Caltech filed suit in federal court in 2016 saying that those Broadcom chips  and Apple phones infringed the wifi chips infringed on Caltech's patents.  The jury said, you're right.  It's the sixth largest patent related verdict ever.  Of course, Apple and Broadcom will appeal and a lot of times on appeal, these  numbers gets shrunk, but still a big victory for Caltech.

Transcript:  Do you know during the podcast lawsuit where I forget the name of the company  was saying that all podcasts infringe on our patents.  And one of the discussions was, do we challenge the patent or do we not?  In this specific, the Apple challenged the patents, Apple and Broadcom.  And most of them were rejected except for four.  They chose to go ahead and investigate and they found in favor of the plaintiff, not  to defend it, which means that Apple actually lost four of those challenges.  And just to those patents were upheld.  And so this makes their case even weaker.  So they probably are going to lose even if they appeal because the  patents have been seen as valid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can, if you have a patent dispute.  And this was the conversation with the podcast patent.  You can go back to the U S patent and trademark office and do something called  an interpartis appeal where you say, Hey, can you look at these patents and see if  they're legit? It short circuits the process of the patent and trademark  office looks at you.  And by the way, you have for documents saying, look, here's prior art, blah,  blah, blah. And if they agree with you, it short circuits the whole thing.  You don't have to go to court.  But as you point out, Wesley, there's a huge risk.  In fact, our attorneys suggested we not do this because if the USPTO agrees with  the patent, then when they go to a jury, they say, look, even they appealed in the  patent trademark office, even said this is a good patent.  And apparently that was important in this trial to Adam Carolla's credit.  I want to give him eternal thanks.  He raised money, he had a crowdfunded it and did in fact fight against the patent  troll and the electronic frontier foundation did the went to the USPTO for  an apartment. They decided to do it even though our attorney said, oh, don't do  that. And they won.  And that short circuited it.  So thank you, EFF and Adam Carolla, because that patent lawsuit could have killed  podcasting, could have been a bad, bad thing.  Instead, it went away.  Speaking of going away.  Sonos and Gadget, great piece from you, Devendra.  Every smart device you love will die.  Starting with Sonos.  A little dramatic.  It's an important point, though.  Yeah. Make the point.  Tell us why you say this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's something, you know, last week we heard about Sonos' plan to retire some  of their 10 year old products.  And so like the first Play 5, some of the first bridges, I believe that they released.  And basically they said that they were going to end support.  And also, if you were using those devices and had modern Sonos hardware, none of your  hardware would be updated because it's all kind of a dated network and they're all mesh  connected. So you couldn't have like old stuff and new stuff running together.  I think it just made it clear that this wondrous bounty of connected gadgets we're living  in, this is the cost, is that they will they will die and much faster than similar  gadgets of the past.  Right. Like I know people running speakers, high-fi speakers that are decades old.  Like speakers from the 70s.  They can still run today because they're all running over a nice standard wired connection.  And that's been consistent for the last several decades.  And we just don't have that anymore.  And smart devices, because they're basically tiny computers, they won't be able to run  newer software and newer updates.  They'll just have to be, you know, retired eventually.  Your only choice as a consumer is to upgrade.  And I think for Sonos in particular, that was a bad it was a big hit to Sonos fans  because you could easily spend thousands of dollars equipping your house with smart  Sonos speakers. And now it looks like the company just is going to be killing support  and also giving you a really bad way to upgrade.  They have this thing called the cycle mode that will fundamentally kill an old device  completely irrevocably like you can't even restore it.  And they'll give you 30 percent off new hardware and you'll do this all again in 10 years  maybe. And it's just kind of a to me it's kind of a mess.  And it just shows like this stuff won't last forever.  Smart devices may make our lives easier but they will die like far sooner than older  gadgets of the past.

Like we can't stop this.  But I think like a lot of people complaining like the upper over this for Sonos to be like,  OK, we're going to figure out some way to make your older devices and the new stuff  work eventually.  We don't know how.  Yeah.

But yeah, I think when you're thinking about this stuff, certainly you want to have an  Another way to use your devices if the app dies, if the company goes bankrupt.  The problem with the Sonos stuff is that a lot of the early hardware didn't even have  three and a half millimeter jacks.  I know the play five did.  But when they kill the play one and the play three, those don't have other jacks.  You can't do anything with them if you can't use the Sonos app anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

But you can decouple the smarts like you were saying, Leo, like have the receiver be the  thing that you upgrade every couple of years with new standards and new tech.  Have the speakers be these devices on the ends that you can just plug anything.  And by the way, you'll get there.

Because people in the highly regulated industry like insurance or government work, there's  a whole certifications you needed need and mainframes are still one of the only that  consolidate all of those certifications for transactions and able to manage all of that  in terms of redundancy and uptime.  They're expensive, but you can literally shoot it with a shotgun and it still runs.  And so, yeah, they still make servers.  They still make server arrays.  Just most of the high end stuff.
