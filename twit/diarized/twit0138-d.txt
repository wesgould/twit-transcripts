I'm Leo Laporte, about to leave for Australia.  You don't mind if we make this a short show, do you?  No, it won't be too short. You know me, I can't stop talking.  We've got a great panel.  Steve Gilmore is here, the head of the news gang and the gang and gesture labs and just a great guy to know and have around.  Hey, Steve, this time on Skype.  Hey, I'm in living color now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. And streaming Ustream?  Not right now.  Because we had a little problem there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's tempting.  You know what we're doing is we're ordering a T1, which will be here April 14th.  And then I will stream via a separate channel from the internet channel we use for Skype.  I'm actually have three channels. I have a cable modem, a DSL modem, and a T1.  And we'll just figure out which is best for which.  But that will solve that problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I'm missing your video thing.  I have to sort of imagine what you look like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You kind of got hooked on that.  You've been watching that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, totally.  Are you demented?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course.  Also here, I'm really pleased to have him back.  Mark Fraunfelder, who is one of the founders of Boing Boing.  Hey, Mark.  Hey, how you doing, Leo?  Thanks for having me.  Always good to have you, Mark.  And you're busy with Maker Faire, too, coming up soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it'll be first weekend in May.  So lots of exciting stuff happening there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Forgive me for not knowing.  You work for Make Magazine?  You do stuff for them?  Me? Yeah, I'm the editor in chief.  Oh, excuse me.  Pardon me.  I didn't know that.  I'm an idiot.  I love Make Magazine.  When did you become the editor in chief of Make Magazine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  From the very, very first issue.  How could I not know this?  Well, my name is very small on the masthead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't toot your horn enough, Mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, your partner in crime is the kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Phil gets all the attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, sure.  Which is great.  Phil is amazing and fantastic.  So you do the work.  I love having him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's like the Mick Jagger of Maker.  Exactly, yeah.  I sent a note off to Tim O'Reilly that when the first issue of Make came out,  I just fell in love with it.  And I said, this should be a TV show.  Please, if you want.  And I guess you've been talking about making a TV show for...  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, we are doing a TV show on public television  with the Minnesota public TV folks up there.  And hopefully it will launch this year.  And it's going to be a lot of fun.  And Phil will, of course, be on it.  And it'll be the magazine brought to TV.  Lots of how-to projects and profiles of really cool makers and stuff like that.  So it's all moving forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good.  Because it just seemed like a natural to me.  It's such a visual magazine anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So what's the Maker Faire?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is that all about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's in San Mateo, California.  And it's kind of like a giant science fair.  It's like a family fun event.  Last year we had 40,000 people.  This year we think about 50,000 people will come.  And there are robots.  We have all sorts of electronic projects.  We have a trampoline where you jump on it.  And every time you jump on the trampoline, this giant fire machine shoots a huge ball of flame into the air.  Oh, geez.  A huge electric, a life-size robotic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It sounds like you have Mark Pauline working for you there.  Is that the Survival Research Labs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  They came last year actually.  And we expect them to come this year again too.  And they bring all sorts of crazy fire belching robots that destroy each other and stuff.  We call them Four Fingers Pauline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  That's nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  He lost his thumb in a rocket fuel accident.  Yeah, he lost his thumb.  So he had his big toe amputated.  And that is his thumb now.  So when you shake his hand, you're actually shaking his thumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He lives just down the road.  He lives in Petaluma now.  That's right.  He moved his whole lab over there and everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You should check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been invited.  His wife's a good friend.  She worked at Tech TV with us.  So.  Amy?  Amy's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  I worked with her at Wired too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  So small world.  Well, we'll look forward to the Maker Faire is May 3rd and 4th at the San Mateo Expo Center.  And I have tickets, but I'm going to be doing the radio show.  Maybe I'll send my kids down to set off belching balls of flame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That would be cool.  And you can visit it at MakerFaire.com.  And it's FAIRE, which is kind of a play on Renaissance fare.  And also FAIRE spelled that way means make in French.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I missed that.  That was too deep for me.  I completely missed that.  Wow.  All right.  I've got four tickets sitting in front of me.  Molly Wood is scheduled to join us in just a little bit.  We started a little early so I could get out of here.  I'm going to Australia tonight.  I'm looking forward to this.  This is going to be a lot of fun.  It's a Michael Oland who does the Adobe Photoshop Lightroom Adventure book.  Well, it's now books because it's an O'Reilly book.  The next one's coming out and he's going to take a bunch of photographers and me.  I'm not in that category, but I'll take pictures and we'll send back blog posts and so forth.  I don't think we'll have Twitter in the next couple of weeks because I will be in Australia.  Some of our shows will actually be on hiatus for the couple of weeks.  I'm calling it Spring Break minus the nudity and heavy drinking.  Well, maybe not actually.  Who knows?  Mikkel's a party guy.  But I'm glad we could get together.  Dvorak may also join us a little later on.  As I said, we're starting a little bit early.  I asked the guys what we should talk about first and Heathrow seems to be a good topic.  What is going on there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they introduced this new baggage handling system, I guess.  And there are now an estimated 15 to 20,000 stranded bags there that people can't get.  They have no access to them.  Planes are taking off without the luggage being loaded on there.  Is it like a conveyor belt to a big room and they're just sitting in that room?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why can't they get them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have no idea.  It's just one of those logistical nightmares.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember when they opened the Denver airport, they had problems like that.  But they didn't fly.  They waited until they fixed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they're just taking off.  What's happening also is the hotels around Heathrow are filling up really quickly.  The hotels have started gouging the poor hapless stranded passengers.  They're charging like 250 pounds a night for a room that typically costs 100,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, British Airways only gives you 100 pounds.  So you're kind of out of luck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's crazy.  Why are they not flying in this situation?  Why can't they do what they do when they lose bags in the first place, which is just to deliver them later?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good question.  They'll eventually find their way, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think part of it is they're canceling flights.  They've canceled 37 flights today.  The total number of cancellations, 245 flights.  But you're right. Why can't they just go without their bags?  I don't know.  Maybe there's other problems as well at this new terminal.  Heathrow has always been a nightmare anyway.  I hate Heathrow.  Yeah, with the fines.  Just appalling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There might be a room with people filling up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They said today that 400 employees came in on their day off to sort through 15,000 stranded bags sitting inside the new terminal just to figure out who they belong to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Cory, my co-editor at Boing Boing, said that if you can afford it, you should always fly business class at Heathrow because the check-in terminals are on the opposite side of the building and they have special guards.  If you take Virgin Air business class, they actually will take the limousine right out onto the tarmac and they have their special guards there and just get right on the plane.  Completely avoid the riff-raff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let them search for their bags.  We've got a car.  James.  I think that's definitely the way to go.  But who can afford it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm interested that Cory can.  Yeah, well, I think that when he does his speaking gigs, he just puts that into the rider.  Yeah.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  April Fool's is a Tuesday.  That's when I arrive in Tasmania.  I thought I'd make my website upside down for April Fool's Day since I'm down under.  The first April Fool's joke, though, has already hit the airwaves.  Was anybody fooled when Kevin Rose announced that Revision 3 had been sold to Fox News on Dignation?  You shouldn't do April Fool's jokes, though, before April 1st.  That's cheating to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  The rules are that you have to do it between midnight and midnight.  Otherwise, it's just a dirty trick.  It's not a prank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's some sort of prank that was set up for Jonathan Schwartz that he talks about on his blog.  He's the president or the CEO of Sun Microsystems.  And if you go to his blog, you'll see that he's anticipating something happening tomorrow with some incriminating video that was shot of him.  And he knows it's out there.  Yeah. Evidently, he wasn't pleased.  But he's trying to figure out how to not fire the guy who did it, who was his CFO or something.  Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Good.  I can't tell which part of this is the joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's exciting. I love this.  The folks at Make must go crazy with April Fool's. And Boing Boing, too. You guys, you're all jokesters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, we actually, I don't think we've pulled any pranks on Boing Boing on April Fool's  just because I think people would be expecting it. We just couldn't get anything past them.  Phil usually comes up with something pretty good on the Make blog that just teeters on the edge of credibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Last year, I said that Twit had been sold to G4, which was somewhat credible to Comcast.  And maybe too credible because a lot of people believed it.  I had actually, you know, I had things like, Dvorak does this, too.  He always does his April Fool's comment. He'll always have a press release by Slurpa Sloof, which is April Fool's backwards, right?  And that's a giveaway, right? And so I said, you know, spokesman Slurpa Sloof said whatever.  Then I had a picture of G4 and Twit shaking hands and all this. And people bought it.  I had to actually put a little thing, a bug on the thing saying, no, this is a joke. I'm not selling out to G4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's amazing. You would think that, you know, on April Fool's, people would have their antennas fully extended.  Right. But this kind of stuff and not believe anything sneaks up on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How about you, Steve? You do anything special for April Fool's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I try not to read anything. Just keep it, you know, away from my eyes so that I don't get pissed off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is not a joke, although I imagine the newspapers wish it was. Did you read the long piece by Eric Alterman?  I thought a very good piece in The New Yorker on the death of the American newspaper.  It's coming faster than anybody imagined, I think because of the cost of ink and print and because of the success of blogs and other news sources online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Also the success of things like your show. I mean, this is a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We don't do, you know, the thing is we don't do news. We don't create, we don't do any research or any reporting or any enterprise stuff.  We just we need primary sources. Yeah, I don't actually do any work.  We're just, you know, BSing on something we read.  But isn't that what a lot of blogs are doing? So who's going to be the primary source anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're right. That is a problem. You know, Boing Boing really depends on primary sources.  And I've always thought that there's kind of a virtuous circle between bloggers and newspapers because they help each other advance stories all the time.  I'll go ahead. I'm sorry. No, you go ahead.  Well, I was just going to say, I think did that Altman's article mention Craigslist as a cause of the death of newspapers?  That's what's really killing it, isn't it? Yeah. Classified ads. I mean, that's where they make all their money, right? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's so... Somebody made a point a couple of months ago about that argument,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  which is that if the mainstream media had just dedicated a small unit to go out and build a website and do what Craigslist did and just confront them head on, that they would have kept it in house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's what's going on in general, which is that these old business models die hard. They don't get it that they're threatened.  They don't act promptly. The record industry didn't, you know, and as a result, they shouldn't. They don't need to get beat, but they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But, you know, we have the advantage of having watched the record business go completely suicidal.  And the movie business is doing a semi bad job of it as opposed to an incredibly bad job.  And maybe the publishing business will finally come into alignment with these guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know who's really scared is radio. Radio is convinced that it's dead.  And of course, this week, the Department of Justice said yes to the XM serious merger.  Still one more shoe to drop. The FCC has to say yes to, although it seems likely with the DOJ getting out of the way that this will happen.  And that just that in addition to Internet radio just terrifies the terrestrial radio. People aren't listening anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Interesting. Do you have your radio show on a satellite?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's it's syndicated. It's on XM, but it's also on terrestrial radio.  But interestingly, and nobody stopped me yet, I also put out a podcast commercial free podcast of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you get people like live. I listen to it on the podcast because, you know, it's convenient.  Everything. Yeah. Yeah. So do you have more listeners on the satellite?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Well, I don't have ratings for terrestrial versus satellite, so I don't know who listens more there.  But certainly more people listen live than listen on the podcast podcast about 50,000 people,  which is one tenth to one twentieth the total number. So it's that's the thing.  I don't know if radio is really in trouble. I spoke to a radio convention a couple of weeks ago and I said, I don't think you're in trouble in some ways.  What you're doing fits in very well with the Internet. It's interactive talk radio, especially as it's about community.  It's about interaction. You can use the Internet. This is that same thing you're talking about, Steve.  If if you would just pay attention, it's an opportunity, not a challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. I mean, the public radio for all of their I mean, they have such an embedded, you know, Luddite view of the universe that they are the arbiters of what is tasteful and et cetera.  But even they have come sort of screaming to the party with podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's very interesting. Let me add Molly Wood because she's now online.  It's very interesting because when I first at the first podcast expo, I talked to the NPR guys and they were very the only thing they were doing is little chunks of the podcast.  They were doing his little chunks. They were. Hey, Molly Wood, how are you?  Good. How are you? It's great to have you. We're already halfway. Not halfway, but we've already begun.  Let me say that's all right. We started early because I know you have to leave early.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then here I am. You know, you're like, that's OK. You're on time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Steve Gilmore is here and also Mark Fraunfelder.  And we've been talking about I don't know if you read this. It is online, which is kind of nice.  That's smart. The New Yorker is putting stuff online now.  And Eric Alterman's excellent piece on the death and life of the American newspaper out of print is online as well as in the New Yorker.  We've been talking about the future of newspaper.  One of the things Alterman says or points out is according to Nielsen, the Huffington Post is more popular than all but eight newspaper sites.  So I think blogs are really becoming even though they aren't exactly news gathering.  Or is Huffington more of a news gathering site than a blog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It seems like it's more, you know, opinions on it. It happens. They have to find that news somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about Politico? That's been getting a lot of I didn't I wasn't aware of them until I saw them all over the TV.  They sponsored one of the one of the debates even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Politico is an interesting data point here because they were the first to really identify in a very powerful article the fact that Hillary has virtually no chance of winning.  And that became the news. Right.  And that was then taken by the cable networks in particular and pitched as a tipping point in the actual campaign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And interestingly enough, Eric's brother, John Alterman, who writes for Newsweek, who took this campaign up and really took the banner up and said, Hillary can't win.  And now it's the story.  But so there's a case where Politico is actually is doing the research. They're doing the enterprise reporting.  There I mean, in this case, they're doing math.  It's not like they had to make any phone calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But nevertheless, but they it was a heavily researched article because they they went and did exactly what their competitors in the so-called mainstream media were doing.  Right. And and they got the benefit of that.  They're also getting paid to do it, which is not the case with many bloggers paid by what do you mean paid because they have advertising?  I assume so that Politico seems to be a business model site.  It's not just a labor of love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Anyway, I was saying when Molly joined us, I was saying that NPR when I first talked to them were very leery about putting full length programming like fresh air in this American life.  Well, this American life is not NPR, but like fresh air on and they were what they were afraid of is their local stations, which depend on subscription revenue,  would lose that revenue that they would revolt because why should you pay, you know, KQED here in San Francisco, 100 bucks a year if you can just download the podcast for the show as a podcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's the same issue that the television networks have with their local affiliates.  Why would the you know, the affiliates are kind of caught in the crossfire of putting network television online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So maybe Steve, it's not so much that these people aren't aware of the threats that the new media pose, but their hands are tied.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's this, you know, crossing the chasm innovators dilemma problem.  I mean, it's a real one and it's very hard to, you know, it's Microsoft cannot easily move to a, you know, on demand office model without cannibalizing 40% of their revenue.  So it's the same thing in each of these media industries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. The innovators dilemma. That's what they call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's there are several business books and I think they all say the same thing with different titles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Another big story. Go ahead. Go ahead, Molly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, if you're going to move, I was going to say, have I come in just past the declaration that newspapers are indeed dead?  Or are we trying to save them in today's show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they're dead. I have to say when I look at my Kindle and I can get all that content, I mean, that I well, wait a minute, let me put it this way.  I think print newspapers are dead. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the, you know, the New York Times, what the Times is doing with Saul Hansel is the editor of the bit section in the New York Times.  They're now breaking stories before it gets into the major into the print book. Isn't that interesting?  Yeah. So I think that what we're seeing is, as you say, the Kindle and the iPhone are becoming significant delivery mechanisms for newspapers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's only going to get worse. You're going to get better and better portable devices that are easier and easier to read.  And why should you spend money on newsprinting? I remember when Arthur Oaks Salzberger, I think it was Salzberger said a year ago,  Ten years, we won't be printing a paper version of the Times. And I remember even Dvorak saying, oh, he's crazy.  In fact, I wish Dvorak were here because he has very strong opinion. He believes the print versions will last. I just I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think they'll last actually. Really? You like that? I think I personally still get two papers.  Yeah. And no people who think I'm very quaint for doing so.  But I come from a family that is, you know, that if the paper's not there in the morning, they go out and get it no matter how early.  And it's sort of and because that's there are two generations still living in my family who cannot start their day without the daily paper.  And in fact, to kind of read it on and off all day long. And I think that there are still a lot of people like that out there.  So maybe it's maybe that death is coming. But I think it's a little further out than we think it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, are you that way? Do you have to read the paper paper?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, it's funny because I pay to get the paper paper, but I don't read it every day. But I certainly I prefer it.  I prefer that scannability like that. To me, the the scannability of the newspaper is what will save it over the electronic version.  I can't stand looking at the paper one story at a time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I was just going to I was going to use the T word to point out that and the T word stands for Twitter that with Twitter,  I'm getting most of my news through links on Twitter, which are basically going into the item level.  You know, RSS feeds, whatever it is that is carrying the specific information.  So as as that happens, the viability of of an aggregated print source or even an online website is really going to be under attack for the next few years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's an interesting model. So you you you look at Twitter, you use it like an RSS feed then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's become the signaler of news. It's the first place the news shows up.  It shows up here much before, you know, the cable networks get things.  Isn't that interesting?  When there's a mainstream source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it a mainstream source for anyone or is it sort of a very an even more kind of carefully spliced agenda setting?  Because you're getting that news then not I assume from the Twitter dot com homepage, but from the people that you follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. So there are micro communities that are forming and it's a very elitist model at the moment.  But the mechanics of it are can go vertical at any moment.  And in fact, that's already starting to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that is one of the things that's unusual about Twitter is you build your your followers or you build a list of people you follow.  So you control totally. I mean, if you want people chattering about LL cats all day, you could have that.  Or if you want somebody doing substantive news, you could follow those people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it becomes like a bunch of ships passing in the night.  You don't know what's going on in those communities and they don't know what's going on in yours.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does that seem like an efficient model?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know. I know. I can't stand that the way you described it.  I mean, I guess I never would have thought that the newspaper version, you know, the Wall Street Journal or New York Times elitist agenda setting would actually seem like a broader model.  Well, you're describing what sounds kind of what do you need?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you need for this to work? You need like self selecting news is the death of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's the problem, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because you only would you don't have to follow somebody who says something you don't like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But, you know, I know that we're you know, it's it's scary.  But, you know, I think you need to get into the idea if it's self selecting.  And if those micro communities have power, then the business models will follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I believe that I'm not saying I'm not talking about business.  I guess I'm not.  This is the this is the difficulty we often get into.  There's the business conversation, which is, you know, our newspapers out of business.  But there's then, though, I think there's a larger social issue of is this a good thing?  I mean, and that comes down to things like, well, where do where do we get our primary news from if there are if there's nobody paying for reporters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's my point.  My point is, is that the issue is about funding.  Right.  Journalists. Ultimately.  Yeah, you're right.  And if you have a micro community which has a very high yield and, you know, CPM, essentially, that'll fund journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But how? What? I mean, am I going to pay somebody fund the reporters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All it seems to do to fund to me is the linking.  Yeah. And then not.  And then when you back it out, pretty soon you've got no one funding the content and the content creation.  So you're all linking to the same story, but the story itself may be utter crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I would suggest that the New York Times has been founded and funded as an international.  I mean, I think probably 60 percent of the cost of the New York Times is in carrying the overseas international bureaus.  I mean, that's not that's an elitist organization.  And it's worked pretty well.  Well, they fund it by make turning it into a national newspaper and moving toward an online model that supports a broader audience around the things that people in this country are interested in the horse race of the campaign, et cetera, et cetera.  And they're using that to fund the serious journalism that goes on in the margins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, draw a picture for me 10 years out of what newsgathering is going to look like, where it's going to be printed, how we're going to talk about how we're going to consume it.  Where are we going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, let's have Molly since she's the one who's scared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's the one who wants her newsprint, who wants ink stained fingers.  Well, Mark, Mark publishes a magazine.  You're making a print magazine.  I mean, you have those same issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you know, it's interesting make the print magazine does well.  It's grown really fast.  We have a paid circulation of about 100,000.  And I think the nature of the magazine, the how to projects and the size, it's like the old popular science magazines is a little bit larger than a digest size magazine makes it kind of handy to carry around.  When you're working on a project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think that people read, make actually make these things?  Isn't it kind of more aspirational?  I mean, that's how I read it.  That would be cool.  I would like someday I'll make that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do think that the majority of people don't make it.  Don't make the projects and they just read it and they kind of are living through the the people are actually making it.  But, you know, I get lots of email from people who make the stuff.  And so there are there are quite a few people out there making they want paper.  Yeah.  And I think just for this kind of a magazine, paper is so great to flip through and look at.  There's something, you know, when you get online on a computer, you just have this urge to click and not read.  You know, I have that same thing myself.  If I'm reading an article from the New York Times online, I'm constantly like wiggling my mouse cursor around and double clicking and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a syndrome. I was just reading about that.  The hyperactive mouse syndrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I've got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it related to the leg thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. Yeah. It's like what is that they call that jumpy leg?  Restless leg syndrome.  Restless leg. I have restless mouse syndrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  John Stewart called it the Jimmy Legs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it sounds like both you and Molly believe that print is here to stay.  I guess it is, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it certainly has survived many predictions of its death, right?  Maybe it's generational.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My kids maybe don't need paper.  Maybe they don't have restless mouse syndrome or maybe they do and they don't care.  Maybe they have short attention spans and they just click, click, click, click, click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I think it sort of kills me.  But I think the future of kind of this self-selecting feed is probably going to come to pass.  I mean, I think it's going to take my argument for paper is that it will take a lot longer than we think probably to finally go ahead and kill it off.  Just nostalgia and the generational gap alone.  I think we'll keep it alive longer than we think it's going to.  But the reason I think it worries me is just the narrowing of the news.  I mean, didn't that journalism study also find that people are in fact, you know, despite this kind of concept of the long tail, where all the information is available to anyone who wants to consume it, that people are reading about the same eight subjects and that their consumption of information is narrowing.  And I think part of that is because as we self-select our feeds, we create, you know, the echo chamber effect just increases exponentially.  And pretty soon you feel like you can only talk about what everyone else on Twitter is talking about and you never actually get exposed to anything else.  And the long tail concept actually is kind of flipped on its head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It becomes almost the opposite of the potential of the long tail.  We just all have our own little fat tails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And it's like this weird, it's just a peer pressure loop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. No, I think it's somewhat true.  What's happening?  I don't follow people who would, you know, say things that are offensive to me, even if it's politically offensive or, you know, I guess I don't follow people I don't agree with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Whereas I get the Wall Street Journal, even though I disagree with it, its opinion pages almost completely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I skip the opinion pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But then the fact that I get that paper sometimes leads me to read the opinion pages and then yell back at them.  But I think that's really valuable.  I think it's a valuable exercise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think you just sort of go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I was just going to say it really is great having that dead tree version on your table and the serendipity value of coming across certain articles is fantastic.  And it's a lot harder to do that with an online version, you know, or through RSS or Twitter or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I think we're all basically saying what is going to happen, which is print is going to survive.  It's going to be the loss leader for the brand, and it's going to be subsidized by these micro communities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me read you what Eric Alterman said in The New Yorker, because I think we're coming to the exact same conclusion he came to.  He says, So we're about to enter a fractured chaotic world of news characterized by superior community conversation, but a decidedly diminished level of first rate journalism.  The transformation of newspapers from enterprises devoted to objective reporting to a cluster of communities, each engaged in its own kind of news and each with its own set of truths upon which to base debate and discussion will mean the loss of a single national narrative and accrete upon set of facts by which to conduct our politics.  That's an interesting point we hadn't mentioned. News will become increasingly red or blue.  He also says there'll be serious losses. You'll lose those serendipitous encounters that you were talking about.  And he brings up one point that I hadn't really thought about, but I think is very interesting.  He says, What becomes of those people at home or abroad who depend upon journalism to keep them safe from oppression or injustice?  And there is a very important role to journalism in that regard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a very interesting point. Well, because what becomes of journalism and the there's this idea of sort of a journalistic imperative, which is to uncover and expose.  And if that imperative becomes changes and evolves into, you know, who can get the gossip out first, who can get the gossip out first and who can further the analysis, who can kind of, you know, advance the conversation or start the conversation, who can be first post.  Right. First post. It is that first post mentality. Yes.  Then we do lose that, you know, and not all of that is good. I mean, I went to journalism school and my senior kind of thesis class was it became very clear that post Watergate, every, you know, graduating journalism students desire was to bring down a president.  Right. And that's not a good instinct all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They all got jobs, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's nevertheless, it's a pretty important instinct. It has been an important instinct in bringing, you know, light and information to the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Be interesting. It's clearly we're in a change, you know, phase change right now. It's very interesting to see what's going to happen. I think it's kind of unpredictable.  I want to pause this discussion, a great discussion about the future of journalism to talk about our sponsor briefly.  Then we'll get back to it. Audible.com slash twit. You know about Audible. They're the greatest place to get your audio books, all kinds of titles, 45,000 strong.  Now there's, we've got a new URL I want to try out on you. There are two offers. Somebody sent me an email and said, you know, you're offering the free book and that's good, but you can also, there's a different offer that you might want to offer your, that Audible offers you might want to offer your listeners.  And so I asked Audible and they said, sure. So here's your, here's your two different deals. You can go to audible.com slash twit. Sign up today. If you're a new user, you'll get a credit for a free book.  And I'll tell you what a book I can recommend in just a second. But there is another way to do it. If you want at least three audio books with a 50% discount, and you'd have to figure out whether this is a better deal or not, depending on what books you want, go to audible.com slash twit 749.  That's because you get half off your membership in Audible is $7.49 a month for the first three months and includes a book credit a month. That might be a better deal. Actually, give it a try. Audible. This is just a different way to go audible.com slash twit 749.  Join Audible for three months at just $7.49 and you get a book credit a month. That's 50% off. I think that's a pretty good deal. Now let me talk about a book you might want to read.  Given our discussion on the future of media, this is a fantastic lecture series that I listened to.  The Library of Congress series on the digital future.  It's a collection of lectures, eight lectures hosted at the Library of Congress from some of the most interesting people, I think, in the business. Let me tell you who you're going to hear from. This was recorded about three years ago, but it is not out of date.  David Weinberger, who was one of the guys who wrote the Klu Klutreng Manifesto. He was an Internet advisor to Howard Dean.  Brewster Kale, who founded the Internet Archive and is actually archiving the Internet.  Larry Lessig is on this, talking about copyright and copyleft.  This is a fantastic series. Eight lectures by some of the best minds. I really enjoy these. 12 hours. It's not a book. It's a lecture series. That's one of the things I want to let you know about Audible.  This is not just books. They have radio shows, lecture series, the presidential debates. They have lots of different material.  But all for listening. Plays on your iPod, your iPhone, hundreds of different devices. Audible.com. There are two different ways to do this.

We do thank them so much for their support. Audible.com slash twit. Audible.com slash twit seven forty nine. You take a pick, whichever you prefer.  And we thank Audible.com. So now Steve Gilmore, because we were having trouble with his Skype connection is because he has a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to AT&T tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We put him on the phone. Your final thoughts, Steve?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm trying to push back a little bit on what Molly said. What she's describing when she talks about reading the journal, which I do every day, as well as the New York Times, and most of it online these days, is that that's a fairly elitist sort of newspaper or journalistic focus point of view.  And it is a large audience and it will continue regardless of what these new medias are. So I really don't think that the death of investigative journalism is going to come...is going to proceed quite as quickly as might be suggested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and also, I mean, sometimes unconventional citizen journalism is better. Look at the Tibetan monk's story. I think a lot of times there are, you know, as more and more people are empowered to cover these stories, not with journalistic training admittedly, but with the tools to gather the news, we in some ways do have better primary sources.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I do think that, you know, take the other side for a second. The ability to fund a series...I mean, for example, there's been this issue in the blogosphere recently, Dave Weiner and others trying to get the newspapers and the people who are allowed on these conference calls with the candidates to be able to publish those MP3s that are resulting.  And it hasn't been easy. I think that we're getting there finally. But, you know, there's a question of access and the major companies are, because of their clout, are provided access that some of these citizen journalists just can't get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tell people what Dave's been trying to do, because that's an interesting story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, basically there are these conference calls that the candidates, the campaigns put on every day where, you know, Wolfson from the Clinton campaign or I forget who it is from the Obama campaign and somebody from the McCain campaign will basically do a roundtable with specific chosen journalists.  And these are recorded, of course, by the journalists so that they can file their stories without having to remember it all or take, you know, elaborate notes.  So the recordings exist and Dave has been trying to get people at the Times and also at McClatchy, I believe, and others to, you know, provide those in a form where they can be distributed on the Twitter network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And because Dave is such a diplomatic, easygoing fella, he's having great success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, I know that there's a touch of humor in that, but he is actually having some great success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I'm glad he's, what he really is, is the burr in the saddle. And I'm really glad that he's doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's really interesting because I think in that argument about, I know I'm just belaboring this conversation, but it's so interesting in that whole fight between kind of, you know, what is a traditional journalist and what is a blogger and what's the difference and why is there a difference?  A lot of journalism does come down to access, just fundamentally having the name recognition, like you said, Steve, to get the access.  And so it's not that, you know, journalism training makes you sort of somehow more skilled at getting access, although that is part of it.  It's just that you work for someplace that gets you in the door.  So there are sort of two possible scenarios for the future where everyone's a journalist and anyone can kind of have this access to the news.  And I guess one is that anyone would be granted that access, that we do have to have these mechanisms for universal access to anyone who comes calling.  Or, you know, the kind of, there's the doomsday scenario wherein Mark Cuban leads the way and you start blogging all journalists or all bloggers.  And you say like, okay, I don't know who to give access to, so it's no one.  And then, you know, we have the death of investigative journalists because no one can investigate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The problem is that the nuclear winter scenario isn't going to happen because these bloggers are just too damn noisy.  Yeah, like Dave Weiner.  Exactly. And the other side of it is that I really strongly believe that this is going to be a hybrid because I've always viewed the, you know, I started writing for Byte magazine about 25 years ago, God help me.  And I've written for a lot of the mainstream tech publications for a long time.  And I've also been blogging for the last five years and doing podcasts, et cetera. So I know both sides of this.  And to me, the blogosphere is like Broadville. It's something where things bubble up, people gain reputations.  It's how the comedy clubs were in the late 80s. And now all those people are running television.  This is an inexorable move toward so-called professionalism. It comes with the territory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting. You're saying it's almost, it's the farm team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely. It's the Kansas City A's for the New York Yankees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder though, is it the farm team or is it the next Yankees?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the question that Arrington has been asking in recent weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is a great conversation.  And we have another podcast to call This Week in Media, which also covers these subjects.  And I think, well, I like to talk about this more and we will.  And maybe we'll do it on This Week in Media as well.  But, you know, what's exciting about our time is that we are seeing so much change.  This digital revolution is changing so much in our lives. So many business models are crumbling.  Let me ask you this on a broader scope. Is it in general a positive move? Is it a lot of negative to it? Is it neutral?  Mark, do you feel like, are you an optimist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I am. I get, you know, it's just increased my sources of information.  And I do think that there will always be an opportunity for good journalists to get paid somehow.  There will probably be some rough periods.  But, you know, with a combination of my using Google search, search words with RSS and RSSing a lot of different blogs and then reading print paper,  people have a tremendous amount of variety and control over the news that they get.  And I think there's, you know, there's always going to be a way to make money from that.  And therefore there will always be a way for good journalists to get paid.  So in the long run, I am not worried at all. In the short term, I think it will be weird for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's going to be weird. I know Corey says that too. He says, he quotes Theodore Sturgeon and said, 90% of everything is crap.  But that means 10% of everything is great.  And if you have more everything, then you're going to have more great stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure. And honestly, people like some of that crap, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, what my crap might be your foie gras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you know, even though I don't want to admit it, I actually do like some of the gossip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I read Valleywag every day.  Well, I wouldn't go that far.  I was, I was at a, I was at a very high level meeting with some very high level CEOs.  And I was looking over the shoulder of one of them and he was reading Valleywag.  Not only was he reading it, but he was clicking the links to find out who is this person that Jimmy Wales has been seeing.  I mean, if you look over people's shoulders, you can see that people are reading this stuff.  They may not admit to it. It's a dirty little secret. It's like page six.  You know, you got to read that stuff.  Guilty pleasure.  Guilty pleasure. How about you, Molly? Optimistic, pessimistic?  And I don't just mean journalism in general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's almost, yeah, it's interesting.  It's almost sort of not worth it to ask, I guess, if it's a good thing or a bad thing because it's so inevitable.  It's not like we're ever going to sort of shove this back into the box.  And so we just sort of go on and see what comes of it.  But we might be able to influence it, don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or is it not, is it not possible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think we can influence it to a certain extent.  Overall, I'm optimistic.  I mean, as much as I, you know, kind of make him play, I may, I personally might be a little bit of a journalism elitist.  And I wish that, you know, standards at some publications that I work near and or with were as high as they had been or or what have you.  I think that the Internet and the World Wide Web are the greatest thing that humanity has ever accomplished.  I mean, you know, not to like wax a little melodramatic, but it's phenomenal the amount of information that we can access and that people, people can access, really disenfranchised people can access.  So, you know, when it comes right down to it, the quality will sort itself out.  The fact that that information is there at all is kind of a modern miracle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is when I wish we could have we were trying to get Scott and Rosenberg right before the show, the founder of Salon.  Here's a guy was a print reporter founded Salon, which is a in my opinion, a journalistic landmark, a huge success.  We love Salon.  Fantastic publication, which is, I guess, solvent, although maybe not very solvent, but at least seems to be going on and is now writing about the blogosphere.  I think he would have a lot to say about this.  How about you, Steve?  You two share, you know, that heritage.  Are you optimistic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wouldn't say.  I mean, I know that's your question, so you don't have to answer my question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Answer any question you like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, well, I'll make a political question and then I'll answer it, which is I don't think that it's, you know, seriously, I don't think that it's about optimism.  I think what Molly says is exactly right, which is it's going to happen.  Right. The question is, what's going to happen and how do we improve things?  Because there will be a loss in terms of what I would call discoverability, you know, the serendipity that Mark was talking about before.  And, you know, that is something that needs to be engendered in these new editorial models.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to say I'm very optimistic because of things like Twitter.  There is serendipity.  It is now more about people and more about direct connections to personality.  So instead of reading a newspaper, I read a person.  And I think ultimately that's valuable.  I think if you have if you're a curious mind, if you have interest in current events or what's going on, the fact that you can disintermediate these people, deal directly with them, follow them directly, build your own newspaper, I think is better.  I don't think it's going to become an echo chamber.  I don't think it's going to be a come.  I think that's exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, look at what you're doing here.  You are essentially building a new broadcast network model.  And I mean, I'm sure it's built around people I'm interested in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if you're interested in my kind of ethos, you might follow it.  But I guarantee you there are people who listen to this show who well, look, when Dave was on it, who hated.  I mean, Dave got a lot of hate mail, but I bet you he provoked some people to into thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the things that he discussed and that we all discussed will resonate to those people long after they get over whatever they felt was disagreeable about Dave's tone of voice or whatever it was that they were concerned about.  But the thing that I think we have to remember is that the Twitter universe is really, really time grabbing and crunching.  It's very difficult to be able to get a good, strong signal to noise without sitting in front of the computer all day.  And there's a friend of yours in mind, Dave Schlesinger, who is an early stage podcaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And who has turned into a very cranky man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, he's worse than Dvorak.  So on and so forth.  But well, worse than Dvorak.  Come on.  But the thing is, is that he's been wrestling in recent days with, you know, resigning from Twitter, keeping it to 15 minutes a day.  And, you know, I just try and keep them on as long as possible so that he gets crankier.  But the bottom line is that he's really he's underlining what the issue is, which is how do you find an efficient way of getting to those, you know, bubbles and nuggets of information?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I found the way.  I think that he yeah, I think that what's happening here at some point, there's going to flip for you.  There is an old way of thinking that you have to somehow keep up.  That is really what's getting in your way.  You can't give up, release, let go.  However, if you bathe in this stream of information, you get plenty.  And so email is a good example for me for a long time.  I think a lot of people still have this crazy notion.  You've got to answer your email and you've got to read it all.  You can't.  You can't give it up.  Do the best you can.  Read what you want.  Take what you want.  What, you know, wade through this stream without holding on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And, you know, this is a credible argument because you are as many of our you're a canary in the mineshaft of this.  It works for me.  Well, I mean, but you're exposed to a tremendous amount of volume of all this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so what happened to me is I got burned out.  It was it was too much.  I was I was at Dave Slusher's point where I was like, I quit.  I did quit Twitter.  It was too much.  It was it was a problem.  And now I'm just kind of relaxed into it.  And I just love it.  I just I I don't feel like the key is not worrying about missing something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Leo, that is such great advice.  You know, I with Make magazine, I had a similar thing where I was freaking out because I would get all these story submissions and come across ideas that were like fantastic projects for the magazine.  And it was like this fire hose of stuff.  And I was like flipped out about trying to get everything in there.  And then I just realized, you know, as long as everything in the magazine is good and I don't put anything bad in there, I just have to realize that a lot of good ones are going to get away.  Right. But the magazine is going to be filled with good stuff.  And that's really best you can do.  And I don't feel like that's giving up.  No, it's not.  It's not really giving up.  It's it's it's kind of letting go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is letting go.  And it's celebrating.  There's great stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me ask Mark a question.  What's your lead time on the magazine?  It's a quarterly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we have a really long lead time.  And the articles, you know, since they're do it yourself, they're they're pretty evergreen.  So that helps to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, my one enduring concern, if I have an area of pessimism in this whole conversation, it's it is speed.  And it may sound sort of old fashioned, but I think that speed is the death of investigation and in some cases, the death of sort of accuracy.  And as we push for kind of faster and faster and faster information, there's just it is not possible.  This is not a this is not a knock on bloggers.  It is simply not possible to be both accurate and researched and also fast.  No, but I can't just be on to certain point.  Again, I think it's pretty fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think these are birthing pain, something you know very well.  I think these are how old your baby now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He just turned one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's kicking the walls I hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, he he doesn't want to go to sleep today.  Oh, little guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's adorable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, nothing like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But but I think these are birthing pains.  I think I think we're still using old mindsets to try to absorb this information and try to make sense of it.  And I think what happens is, yeah, there's a lot of quick judgment and stuff.  What you have to do as a consumer is kind of know that and just kind of sit there.  So when I see Kevin Rose say Fox bought us instead of Twittering it like Robert Scovel might do, I pause for a moment.  That's interesting.  Let me wait and see what else is said in the blogosphere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's great for you.  But people will do that.  The fact is, 20,000 people are following Robert Scovel.  And so if he does it, he'll learn.  And they're a bunch of credible ninis.  I mean, just you don't know.  Well, there could be a tidal wave, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think that what will happen is that it's what I'm saying is that's because we haven't learned it yet, but we will learn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that Robert is laying the groundwork for people understanding the difference between a showman, which is what Robert is,  and a credible source, which Robert is occasionally, and which there are some stars in that area.  I mean, when Mike Harrington, who sort of straddles the border of these two issues, when he says something,  it's usually well thought out, deeply researched, and about at least 80% accurate,  I challenge you to any mainstream news organization to do better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're more of a fan of Mike on that regard than I am.  But nevertheless, I think you're right.  I think you have to consider the source.  So believe me, Scovel is a great source.  I don't throw Scovel out.  I just know how to treat his, I understand his content.  And this comes down to, instead of, you know, when you read the New York Times, you understand the New York Times.  When you read the New Republic, you understand it.  Well, now you have to understand the players.  So it comes down to that same kind of getting who Scovel is in this game, who Mike is in this game,  who Steve Gilmore is, and then judging what you hear from them accordingly,  and then putting together a picture on your own.  I think people can do that.  I give people credit for being able to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that means that people will have to work a lot harder than they had to in the past.  They don't have to think.  Because, like you said, it is the, well, they will have to think,  and I think that history has shown us in abundance that they don't like to.  Well, yeah, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I write those people off.  If somebody's not thinking, they're going to get the wrong answer no matter what they read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there will be a middle layer of what we call editors that will come in, you know, middle persons that will come in  and provide that kind of aggregate good read.  That's what Mark's doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I used to think that, and I'm actually kind of against that now.  I think that I want the disintermediation.  Let yourself be the editor.  But you can have both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you can.  You don't have to go to CNET or Boing Boing or...  An editor is just another source, I guess.  Well, again, I think it comes down to the personality as you get to know the people.  I mean, I used to, a dear friend of my mother was the film critic for the New York Post,  Archer Winston.  And Archer's reviews were, you know, if you're an idiot, you're going to love this movie.  And basically, you know, I often read opinion and news sources not because I think they're right,  but because I think they're wrong.  It's like Dvorak, when he says it's time to sell, I buy.  Right.  But you know how to interpret it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's using your noggin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not just that.  It's that, you know, you get instincts about the people that you pay attention to,  and it's a complex decision that you add that all up.  It's not something that's going to yield to some sort of algorithm.  No.  It's the brain that's very intelligent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's something we're good at because what it really is doing is bringing it back down to the way it was,  where you lived in a village, you had 150 people, you knew who to listen to, who not to listen to,  who was silly, and you could put together a picture of the world from those voices.  And it just brings us right back to that.  I think it's something we're actually better at than consuming mass media.  I don't think mass media served us very well.  I relish the collapse of mass media.  On that note, how about that?  Let's move on.  Macbook owned, or should I say pwned?  I love this story.  Cansec West, a security conference in Vancouver, has a very fun game.  They call Pwn to Own, in which they take three computers,  Vista, Mac, Ubuntu, unmodified stock computers,  and give hackers a chance to own them.  Now, here's the deal.  On the first day, they have to own it just using the operating system,  exploits built into the operating system.  On the second day, they're allowed to use applications that come with the computer,  but it'd have to be made by Microsoft, Apple, or Ubuntu.  And on the third day, they get to use third-party apps.  So day one, none of them are hacked.  Nobody can figure out how to hack any of them.  Day two, a hacker strolls in.  His name is Charlie Miller.  Walks up to the Macbook Air, surfs to a website that he created,  uses Safari to do this, website that he created.  Two minutes later, it's pwned.  He takes home $10,000 in a Macbook Air.  Pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which presumably he'll run Firefox on.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what is it that he's actually hacking?  He gets like, rude access?  Yeah, he gets rude. He pwns it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nothing on the Vista machine until day three,  when you're allowed to use third-party apps,  and then another hacker uses Flash to own Vista,  the Ubuntu machine stands alone, unhacked.  Yeah.  Isn't that a great contest?  What it's done is it's sent a chill,  and I know this because I did the radio show today.  It sent a chill among Mac owners who were saying,  Wait a minute.  You mean I could get hacked?  Part of the deal on this is they don't get the $10,000  unless they sign an NDA saying,  we won't tell anybody how we did this  until Apple gets a chance to fix it.  So we don't know exactly what happened.  It seems to be a fairly well-known bug in WebKit  that Safari is based on.  But it's a little scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So CUNY has already identified, I think,  two critical flaws in Safari for Windows,  which it sounds like they may be similar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got a third flaw.  Did you see this?  The Windows EULA for Safari.  Apple put in the EULA,  it must not be run on any computer that's not made by Apple.  They changed their mind on that shortly after that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean after they forced you to download it.  Forced you to download it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they forced you to download it  with its massive security flaws.  Thanks so much, Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They pushed it on everybody.  They didn't force you to download it,  but they sure bugged you until you did.  They didn't force you, but they tricked you.  I think they tricked a lot of people.  How did they trick you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it was preselected as part of your Apple updater.  Yeah, so if you installed iTunes and QuickTime,  which many Windows users have because they have iPods,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  then the updater, which you also install,  last week said, oh, Safari 3.1 is out.  And by the way, there's some ad copy.  It's a better browser.  It's faster.  It says, would you like it?  You could say no.  I said no twice.  Finally, I agreed.  Because it will not go away.  It doesn't go away.  Yeah.  And it comes up, it'll say, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it comes up as like there's an update for what I had  was an updated version of iTunes was available.  So then when I click, you know, it says,  would you like to upgrade?  And then it, or it pops up the whole,  it's the Apple updater software itself.  So it pops up.  So there are check boxes.  And this is why I had everybody up in arms.  The check box for iTunes QuickTime was selected  and the check box for Safari was selected  as though it were an update to a quick time.  So it's like, oh, it's a quick time.  Safari was selected as though it were an update  to existing software.  In fact, it was a whole new installation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're in an unusual situation though,  because that iTunes update came out a few weeks before then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think people say that the updater popped up  for them like that with only Safari in it.  Yes, because I had updated iTunes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  when it, when that update was first pushed.  That was pre-Safari.  So I got the updater that just said Safari.  But I didn't have, what's interesting,  I didn't have Safari on Windows.  I don't use Safari on Windows.  Exactly.  And it kept bugging me.  All right, fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Fine.  That was really nice of you.  I took a different approach.  I wasn't that happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wasn't that happy.  In any event, I did read the EULA  and it said you may not, you may not install this on Windows.  So it's interesting.  There's a good article in Ars Technica  by David Chartier, who is a Twitter fella,  on EULAs and companies not reading their own darn EULAs.  Adobe Photoshop Express had a little EULA problem  earlier this week.  Adobe, you know, this, by the way, have you used Express yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I haven't used it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Photoshop.com slash Express.  It's Adobe.  It's kind of, the idea is it's Flickr,  but it's got built in, it's, it must be an Air.  It's beautiful.  It's got built in photo manipulation stuff,  but it's also gallery.  Very slick.  It will import your photos from  Photo Bucket Facebook, not Flickr,  Photo Bucket Facebook and Zoomer.  I can't remember another site.  Just gorgeous.  But in the EULA it says,  the content that you add to it,  you grant Adobe a worldwide royalty-free,  non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable,  and fully sub-licensable license to use,  distribute, derive revenue or other remuneration from,  reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate,  publicly perform, and publicly display such content,  and to incorporate such content into other materials or works  in any form or medium now known or later developed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow. So they're saying they own your pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We pwned you, baby.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's interesting because they don't say they own them.  They don't say they own them.  It makes it, right, it makes it explicit that you still own them,  but that they can use it however they want.  So in the future, add.  It's a non-exclusive license.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you say they're indemnifying,  but others say, well, they could also take my picture of a 10-year-old  and put it on the box of Adobe Photoshop,  and they wouldn't have to ask me.  Right.  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which, interestingly, this is very,  I mean, I was kind of surprised that this turned into such a big deal  because this is very standard Yula language for media uploading.  Yeah, Facebook has similar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Flickr has similar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Did they change it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They did. They backed down.  The blogosphere wins again.  So what did they change it to?  Adobe says, we heard your concerns about the terms of service.  We reviewed the terms in context of your comments.  We agree.  It implies things we would never do.  So they're making.  I don't think they haven't changed it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, they're going to revise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The legal team is hard at work.  Like our secretary of the treasury,  they're probably working over the weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I kid you not.  Okay, we're in trouble now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not on the weekend.  They're working on the weekend.  Anyway, I think we should make a hall of fame for bizarre Yulas.  Anyway, thank you, David, for that good article.  It's again, pointing that out.  I'll tell you.  That's funny.  I got an email from John C. Dvorak saying,  I can't be on the show, but you could send me a check.  So I'm going to send John money for not being on the show.  If anybody would like money for not being on the show,  email me and I'll be glad to ignore that email later in the day.  Fellas, and gals, anything else you'd like to talk about?  Al Jaffe of the Mad Magazine profile in New York Times.  Did you see that?  The guy who does the fold-ins?  Now there's a media that may never die.  I haven't seen Mad Magazine in years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's so great.  I mean, is Spy Burst Spies still going on?  Yeah, it's still there, yeah.  But that's a different artist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The cool thing about Al Jaffe is that he's been,  he has done over 400 of these fold-ins.  He's 87 years old.  And the article had some cool information.  He does the entire thing on hardboard so that he himself doesn't really,  he's not able to experiment with the fold-in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't understand how he does it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He said he could, well, he probably uses trace,  you know, using tracing paper and things like that to check it out.  But he said he knows it would be much easier to do on the computer.  But age 87, you know, cut him a little slack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who cares? I love him. He's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's fantastic. The article was just great.  They said he was such a gentleman,  and he was going through a cancer scare during the whole thing.  And a friend emailed that to me.  Yeah, and so it's just a good example of the many sources where I get my news.  There's email and RSS, and it just all comes together to be this great self-made newspaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I got it from Boing Boing, so there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Great.  I will say also, I have never read Politico,  and then since Steve was talking about it,  I've been kind of possibly perusing in the background here, and it's pretty great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a good site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It looks like they have paid journalists on staff, too.  I was looking at the About Us link, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they run it like a business.  What a concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Amazing. Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These kids today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll tell you.  No, we do a, I do another podcast on this network with Dick DiBartolo,  who is another one of the usual gang of idiots from Mad Magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, that's cool.  Yeah.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and I tell you, I took a tour of Mad and saw some of the original Al Jaffe stuff,  and Dick loves Al.  Al really is courtly.  He's really a neat guy.  Mad Magazine is an example of old media I never want to go away.  And by the way, they put it out on DVD.  Every copy of Mad, it's not the same.  It isn't the same.  Not the same.  You want it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Especially that early stuff that Will Elder and Harvey Kurtzman did,  where the minutiae and the tiny little details.  Those little marginalia, yeah.  Chicken fat, as Elder calls it.  You can't, the PDFs aren't, the scans aren't good enough to check that stuff out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you'd get carpal tunnel syndrome trying to zoom in on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although they'd have an automatic fold-in capability, so it does save you the time of doing the fold-ins.  Anyway, hey, it's really been great talking to you all.  What a pleasure and fascinating conversation.  Mark Fraunfelder is, I have now learned editor-in-chief of Make Magazine.  I'm such an idiot.  And of course, one of the founders of Boing Boing, a directory of wonderful things at boingboing.net.  The Maker Faire coming up May 3rd and 4th at San Mateo.  Are you going to have, is Dignation going to be there again this year?  Oh, I'm sure they will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've been there every year so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Revision 3 covers it.  And I just asked before the show of Mark if I could do my radio show the next year.  So maybe we'll do it that way.  Let's do it.  So does that mean Fox News is going to be there?  Yeah, Fox News will be covering Maker Faire with Dignation.  Awesome.  Great story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm twittering that right now, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Heard on the street.  Maker Faire, if they want to get tickets, go to makerfaire.com.  And that's F-A-I-R-E dot, makerfaire.com.  And that's going to be a lot of fun May 3rd and 4th in San Mateo.  Thank you for being here, Mark.  Really appreciate it.  Oh, thank you.  Molly Wood is of course on CNET's Buzz Out Loud B-O-L dot CNET dot com and CNET TV dot com  where she is reinventing the media despite her J-School background.  Doing a great job, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm nothing if not a mercenary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We forgive you the degree.  It's okay.  Speaking as a college dropout, you know, it's okay.  You don't have to drop out, Molly.  She's proving it.  And of course the great Steve Gilmore.  Great to have you on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I really appreciate you being so kind to have me back.  Oh, please give me a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Newsgang dot net.  Is that the best place to send people?  Absolutely.  And Dave Slusher is the Evil Genius.  And he's showing up on the Newsgang these days, too, which is very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Evil Genius Chronicles is his Google address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, his cranky Google address.  He's a proto-podcaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, he's, it just doesn't get any more serious than him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Defy the zeitgeist.  I'm Leo Laporte.  We thank you for joining us.  Once again, a reminder, I will not be here next week or the week after.  I think there will be no tweet, although there have been moves afoot to do tweet without me, so it's possible there'll be shows.  Just keep your feed open.  I don't know why anybody would close their feed, but keep your feed open.  There will be other shows on the network, including Steve Gibson's doing security now every Thursday.  He's not going to miss a beat.  We've got Daily Gizwiz's every day.  We're going to have, I believe, Mac Break Weekly's as well.  And follow my Australian Adventures online at leoville.com.  I'll be putting up pictures, video, and blogging as well.  Thank you, everybody.  Another tweet is in the can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good example of, you know, a friend emailed that to me, that article.  Something that I wouldn't find on my own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Steve, are you through now?  Are you calling for a pizza?  What's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, my teenager is about to be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh oh, he's mad.  Oh no!  Dad, get off the phone.  I'm trying to get a pizza here.  So here's the deal.  I'm just trying to get the thing off, but I have a hell of a time.  What blue screen is like?  Forget it.  I'm killing you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Doing the twit.  Doing the twit.  Doing the twit, baby.
