Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We hope to see you back very soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Slash Dell.  We are convened, this is Twits at Sea, we're convened on a boat somewhere in the middle  of the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean, thanks to our host.  Thank you very much, you did that.  Either you had the burrito at the...  The boat is the Viendam and we are in the Caribbean or the Gulf, I don't know, let me  ask the captain, Captain Neil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know this is the Caribbean now but I think...  But the Gulf of Mexico, we're doing both things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Neil Bauman is the founder and creator and the host of Geek Cruises now, Insight Cruises,  right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is correct, Leo, we're in the process of adding that name and slowly changing to  that name over a period of time so we'll continue to use Geek Cruises but Insight Cruises will  be a better representation of the broad range of cruises we are offering going forward.  This is number 35?  This is number 35, that is correct.  Actually this is sailing number 35, we've done over 40, I think it's 43 different topics  on these 35 sailings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, this was a Mac Mania and a Photoshop cruise, yeah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually no, we had a good track of Photoshop and photo editing and Aperture and some other  applications that Ben Long and Derek Storey were running but this was just a plain old  Mac Mania.  Wow, that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One more, we'll give you a plug and then I'll introduce the Twit panel because I do want  to give you a chance to promote your upcoming cruises.  What's ahead?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thanks, Leo, I appreciate the question.  Well we do have actually a Mac Mania to Alaska in May and that will have two separate tracks,  two separate events, one is called Apertureura and this is Apple's new photo editing and  photo collection.  A lot of interest in that.  For the professional, absolutely, I mean it's a high end package and Apple is putting a  lot of time and energy into it and we're going to have an Aperture class running constantly  and then a couple of Mac classes running.  Now and then I'm doing a Photoshop, strictly Photoshop and PC cruise and actually we'll  be mostly focusing on Vista, the new operating system from Windows.  I'm on that one, that's February when?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is February 3 through 10 and you are on that one.  I can't wait for that one, that's going to be a lot of fun.  So if you're into Vista or Photoshop that will be a good one and then the Mac Mania  6 is in the fall for the Panama Canal.  That's correct.  My mom's on that one, not me but my mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's insisting.  Have you ever been to the Panama Canal?  It is unbelievable.  It is an engineering marvel built in the 1915 era or so and still is working perfectly today  and it's going to be an incredible experience for anyone who hasn't seen it or done it.  We'll have in addition to a Mac event on that and Woz has said he's going to be on that  one as well.  We're also running a Shakespeare event.  That's really cool.  Shakespeare at Sea with the Oregon Shakespeare Festival so I'm really looking forward to  that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That will be so much fun.  Well thank you for allowing us to do the first Twits at Sea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Indeed, that's right.  Thank you very much for doing it here at Sea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The first ocean going at Twit.  Let me introduce the Twits around the panel.  Starting with to my right it's Randall Schwartz who is the Pearl Maven, did the Programming  Pearl and Learning Pearl and is here.  You're teaching what on board?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did a course called Unix for Mac Geeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my god.  Randall's also a security expert and so we're glad to have you on the show today.  Thanks for being here.  You've never done a Twit before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've had you on Flaws.  Yeah this is my first time actually sitting here for a Twit.  It's been very fun.  Thank you for inviting me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the whole panel is new here because we couldn't get Dvorak or Patrick or anybody  on the boat.  Steve Steklo is also here.  He is a Senior Features Writer for Wall Street Journal.  Senior Special Writer I'm sorry is what you're technically called.  And I'm glad you're here.  You're here actually covering the story for the journal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well I also among other things write an occasional column about the internet called Virtual Reality  for the Saturday Wall Street Journal for the section called Pursuits and that's what brings  me on the cruise today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good great.  Well we have actually some really good questions for Steve on the stock options issues that  are going on right now.  We have here Annie Inako who is one of my favorite Mac guys.  You write for the Sun Times.  The Great Metropolitan newspaper.  You sound like Superman.  I'm going to move your mic a little closer to your mouth.  But just move it closer to your mouth.  I know you didn't brush your teeth this morning but the mic doesn't care.  I trust you've all pureled your hands though.  A very important sanitation on the cruise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  However as you can smell from your speakers my mouth is minty fresh because I've just  eaten four Altoids.  My sinuses are also very clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Radio doesn't care.  Naomi Pierce is also here of Pierce Communications and a long time cruiser.  I've met you many times on shipboard before.  But also a long time member of the internet community going back to the early days of  the well.  Late 80s.  Feeling old.  Glad to have you all here.  Let's start off by talking a little bit about the options scandal.  The Journal broke that story along with Newsweek.  There's some question about who got there first but I'm going to give the Journal credit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not on the stock options.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got that one to yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well pretty much.  I mean basically what happened was there was some academics who had done some research  into the granting of stock options at a lot of different companies and they had studied.  They had discovered that there seemed to be a lot of options that had been granted at  very opportune times where the stock had been at the lowest point.  Extremely low for you know the month or the year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just before we go too much further.  What is the scandal?  What is it that the companies have been doing and what's wrong with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Basically stock options have been around for a long time and they're supposed to provide  an incentive to employees and the way they're supposed to work is you are granted the right  to buy stock at some future date at a set price.  The way it's supposed to work is the date that the board of directors approves the option  grant is when they set what's known as the strike price.  That should be the value of the stock that day.  That day.  But what had been going on was a lot of companies appear to have been sort of cheating by backdating  the grant date to an earlier date when the price was much lower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if I say to you Steve welcome to TWIT incorporated we're going to give you a million shares of  TWIT at a price of a dollar.  Not the stock price today which is five dollars but the stock price of six months ago which  is a dollar.  In effect I've given you four dollars a share right out of the box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That would be okay if it was properly accounted for and properly disclosed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Company has a pool of stock that could be at the one dollar price that they could then  award.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well again if you account for it properly then it's okay but if you claim it was awarded  it's what's known as fair market value.  In other words you know you're pricing it what the price is today and then maybe it'll  go up or maybe it'll go down.  That's how it's normally done.  A lot of companies will award options at the same date every year so you can't sort of  mess around with the dates.  But what a lot of companies are now under investigation for is for approving the stock  option on a particular date but then somehow picking it like cherry picking a great day.  It's almost like betting on a horse race after the race is run.  There are now over 120 companies including some big names.  It seemed to be endemic to Silicon Valley.  It's largely Silicon Valley because stock options became such a big part of compensation  for employees particularly during the internet boom.  Home Depot is one of the companies that's been caught up in this.  United Health has been caught up in this.  Of course the Apple computer has been caught up in this.  As I said there's more than 120 companies and scores of them are also under investigation  not just by the SEC the Securities and Exchange Commission but also by the U.S. Justice Department.  We've already seen more than 40 executives who've lost their jobs over this including  the number of CEOs.  Like for example United Health just this morning I saw that there was another company Apollo  Group which is an educational company out of Phoenix.  They just lost a couple of employees.  But isn't it just an accounting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How illegal is it?  It's not just an...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well a number of... there have been several criminal cases already.  There have been two cases one involving a Silicon Valley company called Brocade Communications  another a New York company called Converse where there have been indictments and criminal  charges and there have already been some guilty pleas.  What's the crime?  In those particular cases the executives were charged with fraud for essentially lying about  the way the options had been recorded.  So for example in Converse among other things they discovered a secret slush fund which  no one knew about which had a bunch of options in there and the board apparently was not  told about it and it was to be given out when necessary.  In the case of... and there have been two guilty pleas the CEO of Converse has fled  to Namibia.  Converse Sneakers?  No, Converse with an M.  Oh, Converse, okay.  Right, which is a...  That's a fling a little bit.  That's a fling a lot.  Right.  It is a tech company.  A pretty big one actually.  There are extradition... the US government is trying to get them back and there are extradition  proceedings now.  In the case of Brocade they indicted the former CEO, Greg Reyes, and the former Vice President  of Human Resources.  They've entered pleas of not guilty but again it's a fraud case where...  Who's the victim though?  Well, the victim to some extent is the shareholders who aren't told exactly what the value of  the options were and the tax implications.  There was a study done just last week...  Now a lot of these companies have been forced to restate their earnings.  Apple, for example, is in the process of doing that.  There was a study done last week that already to date the restatements... and again many  companies haven't fully restated yet but those that have it's already surpassed five billion  dollars.  And there's another company which hasn't even restated yet.  They've already said it's going to be about one and a half billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is the money though that goes to whoever got this post-dated option, is it really coming  out of the pocket of the shareholders or not really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it dilutes the value, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, it dilutes the value.  It dilutes it.  Right.  But on the other hand, when these things come out and when companies suddenly disclose they've  got this problem, often the stock price goes down.  So the people are... the shareholders are hurt that way as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although sometimes the cure is worse than the disease.  When you're talking about taking Steve Jobs out...  I mean, it's already... the former CFO Fred Anderson resigned over the stock option scandal  and a lot of people are calling for Steve Jobs' head.  Wouldn't that hurt the shareholders a lot more if Jobs is forced out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely, I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, if I'm a shareholder, I want Jobs to stay in his job.  I don't want him to be punished for posting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We don't really know much... the situation with Steve Jobs is kind of interesting because  Apple has not really fully disclosed what he knew.  I mean, what they've said is that there was a grant he received that was backdated, but  then they said that that grant was later cancelled and that he didn't benefit from it.  Then they subsequently said that there were 15 different dates between 1997 and I think  January 2002 where options awarded by Apple were backdated.  And they further said that Steve Jobs knew of a few of them, but they didn't say which  ones.  We don't know which were the 15.  They said that in the few that he knew about, he did not receive or benefit from them.  But, you know, so we don't really know which ones did he know about.  They said he wasn't aware of the accounting implications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'd be curious who exactly is calling for his head though, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is sort of like the heat that Reagan faced during Iran-Contra where they want accountability.  What did you know and when did you know it?  Exactly.  And also the knowledge that, look, we know we want to get some sort of accountability,  but we don't think we want to push hard enough to remove this person from what he's doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The CEOs who have been hounded out, did what they do, was that somehow worse than what  Jobs did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, again, we don't really know what Jobs did.  I mean, all we know is that, you know, he knew about some of them and that he was unaware  of the accounting implications.  I'm not sure what that means that you're unaware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I'm not going to be sidle up to you and say, Steve, we could do something, but  it'll be illegal.  But what we could do is we could give some post-dated shares to people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think those CEOs who've lost their jobs over this largely were found to have not properly  disclosed to their own board.  Once they found out.  Once they found out.  And what's happened is...  Apple's been very proactive, haven't they?  Well, they, you know, stepped forward and voluntarily decided, like many other companies,  decided on their own to do an in-house investigation.  And, you know, the US government really doesn't have the manpower to investigate, you know,  120 different companies.  So they've largely relied on teams of lawyers hired by the companies themselves to do in-house  internal investigations.  Now, usually these are outside lawyers.  And, you know, some of these investigations have been, you know, pretty extensive.  And, you know, usually the findings are turned over to the Securities and Exchange Commission,  sometimes the Justice Department.  We know in the case of Apple that that's already happened.  So yeah, I mean, Apple has been proactive in terms of, you know, ordering up its own  investigation and conducting one.  But again, for example, with Apple, you know, they've said they're going to have to restate  their earnings over this, but they haven't done it yet.  So we don't really know the full extent of the problem at Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But, you know, taking Apple as a what-if, you know, as an example, if Steve knew about  100% of his options were backdated, that's sort of one thing.  If Steve knew about 15 out of, you know, how many hundreds, that's a completely different

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just think that sometimes this maybe it does go back to Ron Contra and the people  who are saying, well, so what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wasn't that right about when the Macintosh was first introduced?  84, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, the company has said that they found no misconduct by any member of Apple's current  management team.  But then they further said...  But Fred Anderson wasn't current.  And he...  Well, we don't...  I'll talk about Fred in a second.  But what they, you know, they also said that there were two officers in which, well, what  they specifically said was that the investigation, the internal investigation by Apple said  it raised serious concerns regarding the actions of two former officers in connection with  the accounting, recording, and reporting of stock option grants, and that they were going  to provide all details regarding their actions to the SEC.  Now, they haven't named who these two former officers were.  Now, simultaneous with this announcement, they said that Fred Anderson, who was a member  CFO, chief financial officer of Apple, had stepped down.  He resigned from the board.  He resigned.  And, but we don't...  To be honest, we don't know, was he one of the two former officers they're talking about?  I mean, Apple hasn't said who they are.  So a lot of this is going to be left to the SEC and possibly the Justice Department to  determine, you know, whether there was any, say, criminal wrongdoing or how serious it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  was.  But again, I have to say, if I'm an Apple shareholder, even if it goes all the way up  to Steve Jobs' office, it seems to me that it's not in my interest that he be...  I mean, I guess if he's arrested, he's arrested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's not in any shareholder's interest for, you know, a major top executive to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, which is worse, post-stating options are getting loose in Steve Jobs, it sounds

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  like.  If a president's dumb enough to flee the country to a place that actually has extradition...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe he doesn't deserve...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One might make a dummy argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, this is obviously a continuing story and I know, Steve, you're continuing  to write about it in the journals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I suspect there are many much more egregious cases than 15...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't strike me as Enron level malfeasance, or is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I don't think so.  I think in terms of the number of companies that are under investigation, we haven't seen  this in terms of just the, you know, the scope of it since something like at least 30 years.  So, and again, I started off before, the role of the Wall Street Journal was there had been  academic studies that had shown a pattern of very opportune stock option grants where  the price was very low.  But the academics who did the study, who turned this over to the SEC, which did launch kind  of a small investigation of it, somewhat limited, just a few companies, they never named any  companies.  And then in March of this year, some of my colleagues at the journal did a story in which  we named six companies that had highly suspicious grants and we actually calculated what the  odds were that these dates would have been picked where the price happened to be the  lowest point of the year.  And in one case, it was something like one in 300 billion were the odds.  And those companies included, by the way, United Health and Converse, which, you know,  both of them have lost their CEOs and we've done many, many follow-up stories naming other  companies and then, you know, once those stories broke, then a number of, then the SEC really  ramped up its investigation into this.  And as I say, we've seen indictments, they've said there's going to be more.  It really, I agree, it's not necessarily Enron, but it is, you know, it's huge in scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it related also to the overcompensation of executives?  I mean, is it kind of just another way companies are kind of overpaying executives?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I don't know if it's overpaying, but certainly that's been, one of my colleagues  who's been working on this has written a lot about executive pay and that whole issue.  And that's kind of what interested him in this in the first place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just a way of sneakily giving more money to executives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, exactly.  I mean, millions of dollars.  I mean, in the case of the Converse people, I mean, I think they netted an extra $6 million.  That's according to the federal indictment in that case.  But yeah, I mean, if you give a CEO a million shares and you backdate it so that it's worth,  it was at a price $10 lower, that's $10 million like extra.  Now again, you have to remember a lot of these options have to vest.  I mean, they can't immediately exercise them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that would be a tax issue for the employee who receives that if he's invested immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's a tax issue for the companies as well because up until the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002,  a company didn't have to expense options that were granted at what's known as fair market value.  In other words, that day that you approve it, that's the date of the grant.  But if you backdate it so that it actually has a value, you were supposed to expense that.  And that's why many companies are now having to restate their earnings.  And it's a real mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, so that's the gap that we're arguing about.  It's not that the board didn't approve the slush fund of whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's different cases again.  But I mean, just another example for the effect on shareholders.  I forget the name of the company, but there was one company that's already spent $70 million  on its investigation and restatement of its earnings because you have to bring in teams of lawyers  along with the accountants.  And that itself is very expensive.  And you wouldn't have had to do that if it was done properly in the first place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Another story Randall brought to us from actually this is via the IP mailing list.  The interesting people mailing list, Dave Farber sent this out.  Kind of a great story, I think.  Good news for the good guys.  Yeah, it's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've been following this story for a while.  Apparently Logan Airport has a four-pay Wi-Fi service where you have to pay some amount,  maybe arrange for T-Mobile or somebody.  But Continental Airlines was offering a free Wi-Fi service in their lounge for their customers.  And Logan came along and said, you can't set this equipment up because it interferes with our equipment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It interferes with our right to make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right. That was really the bottom line.  But they were claiming that because they were the property holder that they had the ability to control  the wireless, the unlicensed band, well licensed in a broadway band of what Wi-Fi is,  they had the claim that they had the right to control that.  And it was clearly seen as just a money grab.  But the larger, more important issue is what really are the rights someone has to broadcast  and receive in these so-called unlicensed bands?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what did the FCC rule?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  From the recent posting, apparently the FCC did in fact side with Continental.  They said that Continental had the right to set up their own wireless as long as they were complying with the FCC's rules.  In other words, the FCC claimed jurisdiction over the Wi-Fi signals in that building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are actually very few rules over this 2.4 GHz band.  That's an unregulated band. That's why Wi-Fi is on that band in the first place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a really important ruling, I think, because it reestablishes the FCC's role in a positive way to say,  look, we set the rules here and everybody has to play by our rules, whether you like them or not.  And you don't get to make up private rules for your building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This would also have implications.  That's important building. So if you're a renter and you rented in an apartment complex  and the landlord said, no, no, we've got our own Wi-Fi, which you have to buy, you set up your own, they can't stop you.  Exactly. This is an important precedent for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because what this means then is that I could, as a person that wants to help out the fellow renters in my corner of the building,  I could set up a Wi-Fi port within the realm of course of my agreement with the, who provides my data service.  I could share stuff from my corner of the building and the landlord can't say anything about that.  Even if it interferes with their stuff, as long as I'm complying with the FCC's rules about it, the landlord can't say anything.  That's what this case says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know how much like this is phone. If you've been following this Spanish company FON,  the whole idea is they are offering like $3, $5, something like that, access points.  But only if you agree to make it an open access point so that other people can then use it.  And they want to build basically a network, worldwide network of free open access via these phone access points.  I presume they make some money on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I say good luck if they're going to be doing that in the US.  I think most of the carriers in the US have basically said no.  It's in their terms of service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. We also have a company like that called Linksys that ships all of their routers that has open networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody said Linksys is the number one ISP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. I mean, the moment I check into a hotel, the first thing I do is say, okay, Linksys, Linksys.  Which one of these three am I going to use instead of paying $20 a night?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, now there was a case in Washington state where that was shown to be a potential damaging thing.  Now, this was an extreme case, but there was a prosecution.  Is Linksys liable?  Not Linksys, but there apparently were some laws about data theft or whatever that were being applied in Washington state,  probably similar to the laws that convicted me in Oregon.  But this guy got on, was sitting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't say that anymore because you're going to get expunged and now you'll...  Yeah.  And they'll be on record here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll erase your tapes. This will all be edited out. Right.  Tapes. That's so anachronistic too. Tapes.  I believe there's no tapes.  No, no. You feel old.  Bits.  But apparently this guy in Washington state was sitting in his car in the parking lot of something like a Starbucks.  It was a coffee shop.  Coffee shop, yeah. And so he's sitting in the parking lot. And apparently after doing this for many days, I forget the exact number.  They asked him to move.  Right. And so he's sitting on the parking lot. So to me it seems like a simple trespass issue that they could simply ask him to leave for trespassing.  But instead they invoked a computer crime law to get him prosecuted on the basis that he was also stealing the Wi-Fi service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And that's ridiculous. I mean, I have to side with them from the point of view that if that parking space is being taken up by someone who's just buying them coffee at McDonald's,  you know, that's bad for their business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what they said. They said if he had just bought a coffee, we wouldn't mind, but he would just sit out there.  Just buy coffee. That's all we ask. A cup a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. It's something people have to be aware of, these big umbrellas of Wi-Fi that, you know, you cannot really, you don't have a reasonable expectation that people are not going to find it and not going to be able to use it.  As a matter of fact, I met one of my new neighbors because I had a brand new access point in that was set up by the cable company.  It was open for one day because I was out of town at the time. And then so basically as soon as I came in, I put in passwords, put in everything.  So I got a knock on the door the next day. I said, hi. The neighborhood internet access is down. Do you know what that is?  My name is neighborhood internet access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But again, because we have these mixed rules about it though, it's very interesting to really say with some authority because of differing case law, whether it is really.  I mean, I can tell you what I think is expected based on, you know, my idea, which is it, you know, if it's not, if it's not passed, it's not privacy protected.  You know, you haven't taken the action to actually lock it up.  But, you know, whatever analogy we come up with, it's going to be not directly applicable.  But the problem is we've got case law that's going both directions on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But isn't part of the problem generational in nature? Almost everybody is this. Well, we're all in our early 20s.  Right. Absolutely. Yes.  20 hex or base.  We're like in our 30s and 40s. But we're in our like we're in our teens and 20s and technological years.  Which means that we essentially grew up understanding that well, look, these services are open.  These services are meant to be shared unless there is security on it.  That means that the implication is that, yes, you can go to this website and download this picture or download this content.  If there were password protected, the owner would want it protected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Except if you tell that to somebody who's used to be, you know, walking up to a closed door rather than a locked door and still not going through.  But then the analogy breaks down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Well, I'm saying when you confront people who are from an earlier generation who believe that while it's cable TV that you plug into and you have to subscribe to doors,  and again, you need a passkey to get into. If I if I set the space station, of course, I'm not going to expect people to use it because they were going to they have to come in and pay for it.  Yeah. This so many so many things in this world are generational problems like that where it's so difficult to explain to kids that, look, if you don't pay for the CD, yes, it doesn't hurt.  You know, it doesn't hurt Dweezil's app that you didn't buy it. This this one copy.  But again, millions of people, that's a big problem.  But again, you were raised with the concept of well, it's on the Internet. It's possible to simply download it.  And you lose that sort of connection between monetization and content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And there's so many people who don't understand that there are layers of security to provide to their Wi-Fi device.  They plug their Wi-Fi device into their cable thing.  And that's great because they can carry their laptop around at home, but they don't realize that anybody driving by parking on the street also has access to the very same Internet connection.  And some people may not care.  And other people may think that there's you know, that this doesn't implicate them anything.  But I tell you, man, the first day somebody sends spam using their Wi-Fi, they're going to get they're going to accuse them.  It's their problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's even worse than that when people are downloading music through an open point, when people are doing extremely more offensive and more illegal things by an open point.  Yes.  That the first time you get a knock on your door saying, hi, your your Internet access point was used to transmit this thrust in your face.  Boy, does reality hit you like a ton of bricks at that point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I also really wouldn't mind sharing my Internet connection with people around me when I'm not at home, which is frequent enough because I want all these cruises and stuff.  But when when I am at home, I kind of want it to be mine.  So, you know, there's there's that kind of adjustment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you think phone is hopeless.  This whole business plan is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it might work for what for where they're installing it, where they don't have a broader infrastructure, where that might be the only way that people can come home.  It's a utopian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, a lot of people have proposed we'll just keep these open access points.  Let's make a giant mesh network across the entire country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As a table full of people who have spent eight dollars per minute on Internet access for the past week on board ship.  Yes, I'm all for a big mesh.  Can it reach out to the Caribbean?  Especially now that we all have VPN technology and we can essentially make it.  We can protect ourselves within that.  Exactly. If we are if we care to be secure, we can simply drop our own bubble of our own tunnel of secure connection to wherever we want.  Of course, then we need more people to die and we replace by more tech savvy people to understand that those things are both are both are easy to use and necessary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the problem is that when there's free Internet service provided, we have a problem of a chain of accountability.  Exactly.  Because if we have people that can just sign up for free and don't have to have an agreement of some kind with the extra to sign an AOP of some kind, then we have the problem with spam and child pornography and file sharing that comes through these ports.  The same reason I argued and sort of against all my friends, I say city will see Metro provided Wi-Fi is the bad deal.  It's definitely going to be a bad deal all the way around.  And because if if if Metro provided free Wi-Fi allows me as just an average citizen to walk up and start sending spam and start downloading child pornography or file sharing, there's no accountability.  The city will actually become liable for some of those things.  And once the city becomes liable for some of those things, soccer moms are going to come in and say, my kid was downloading pornography out there in the parking lot.  We've got to have somebody shut this down, which means filters will go in, which means there won't be any any actually unfiltered service, which means all we'll have is a city subsidized service.  And there won't be an opportunity to compete with a professional service or a paid for service because once you take away the bottom tier of customers, there's not enough income at the next tier up to provide for an Internet service.  So you lose competition. You have a problem with accountability and soccer moms are going to be controlling it.  There's going to be lawsuits forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you have censorship versus accountability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. It's just a huge issue. I don't think Metro Wi-Fi is a bad deal. I don't know why people are so promoted for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Those are all good points. I'm not sure if it's an either or proposition.  I think that one of the best ways to jumpstart development in a lot of communities is simply say, well, look, what if we were to say that everybody will get not really good broadband, not really good Wi-Fi access, but simply a reduced one that's good enough for Google's doing in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's three hundred kilobit access is kind of not to just, you know, you still would want to get a commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That sounds to me like a great setup for a two tiered toll road, non net neutral.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. But again, I've got five different ways of accessing the Internet.  Like I'm not a board of ship. I mean, it's like, well, no, no, no, I'm not a huge one.  I'm a citizen of the United States of America. You know, if I whenever, whenever, whenever.  Okay, I won't deny that. But the thing is, every time I've had a Internet access method that fell short in some way, shape or form, be it speed, be it reliability, I've either gotten to find a different service, be it DSL, be it whatever else.  I've either kept the old version or simply cancel the contract. I think what we want to defend against is the idea that there is one way to get on the Internet and that way sucks.  I would agree with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Again, but you're much more savvy about this than most people are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But again, not everybody has choices. I mean, that's where you run into troubles.  Somebody has one or maybe two choices and both of them are gated communities where...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the problem that they're trying to address really though is the idea of informational haves and informational have nots. And that there is some nobility there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you're not a have not if you have a 300 kilobit access. It may not be as fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly. But if you have no access, you're a have not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's exactly right. And that's where municipalities might have certainly an interest in stepping in at least providing minimal access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I also think some of these municipalities intend to charge. I mean, they're going to act as a provider. I think Philadelphia, for example, it's not free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, interesting. And that's, of course, Philadelphia was the one that got everybody upset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I think my understanding is they want a lower cost to Internet access than...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Toronto is doing the same thing. Toronto Hydro is currently free, but it plans to charge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They may exempt certain people below a certain income level or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think free makes sense in the sense that it's community development. If you want to bring business to a community, I mean, it's good for the community if you do it in a tier.  I mean, look, Google has the capability to do this both technically and to monetize it because they certainly have ways to make money on free Internet.  Providing advertising holes. Exactly. And I'll be very interested to see how it goes in San Francisco where their pilot project is.  That's a model that could go worldwide and work. But will it go over in Poughkeepsie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then the problem again still, though, is even with Google set up, there's still accountability.  If anybody can walk up with a laptop, then how do we lock that one out? I mean, you can change the MAC address by typing a command.  I think Google can solve that one. Yeah, that sounds like a detail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think the goal for everybody to go for is diversity of species. I mean, again, I want really...  In everything, that's the goal.  I'm offended by the idea of a highly regulated and censored net, but if somebody wants to buy a net access where a central computer will look at every single address and make sure nothing naughty, nothing illegal,  nothing but pure as the driven snow and bowing to the kowtow of the right political party. Of the moment.  Exactly. If they want to buy that service, I think it's a great idea that they can get that sort of thing.  Again, it's not good for them and they're broadening their knowledge base.  But if everybody can get the exact sort of Internet service that they want, that's exactly in the best interest of humanity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not against mini Wi-Fi. Yeah, I'm not against mini Wi-Fi as long as it doesn't upset the free market enough that there can't be alternatives.  And as long as there aren't enough dollars wasted on setting up a system that eventually gets shut down because of First Amendment problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. In my community, I had to give a very long... I had to restrain myself because I realized they were not talking to people who are used to talking the emotion of geeks.  Because the cable company, they wanted to give them exclusive delivery of broadband Internet access. I said, bad, bad, bad idea.  Because think about all the auditors you've had and think of running a business that now cannot get processes, invoices or do...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exclusive like there's no DSL could be used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They thought that it wasn't because they were stupid, it's because they were simply ignorant about what that implied.  Basically, they were going to add another couple of pages to the contract they had with nameless evil rat cable system.  And so they said, well, we already have an exclusive on cable content. What if we simply...  Data as well.  We'll wire up your entire community for this. And we're like, you know, we got to make sure that if some guy wants to come in with optical, he can do that.  We want to make sure that it won't be illegal for me to put in a mini dish and get satellite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's very tempting for municipalities because the cable companies come in.  I've been on the tech committee from a small town. They come in and offer them the sun and the moon.  They never deliver. But once they get that contract, it's awfully hard for 10 years. They're an incumbent.  And it's very hard to dislodge them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And to be fair, when you're trying to figure out how to hire two more teachers that you desperately need, if someone wants to give you $800,000 for the free infrastructure, you have to have a good reason to say no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, there's an interesting and I'm not online, so I'm not going to be able to quote this exactly, but have any of you gone into an airplane or many other places and looked at access points and found free public Wi-Fi, free public hotspot?  I've seen that.  Yeah.  You'll see it on planes even. And of course, there's no Internet access on it. And somebody called my radio show and asked me about it.  And I said, boy, I don't know, but I sure wouldn't get on anything that said free public Wi-Fi and didn't have anything else at the other end.  I mean, there's all sorts of... it turns out it's a flaw in Windows.  What a surprise.  Oh, shocker that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Vista takes care of all this, right? This won't happen in Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Vista will never happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Vista will never happen?  Apparently, if you select... it's essentially kind of a virally spread.  Windows infrastructure, not infrastructure, ad hoc Wi-Fi networking will remember the last ad hoc point you were on and somehow creates this ad hoc point.  So somebody somewhere got on something called free public Wi-Fi and it's now propagating.  And you'll see it on planes. You'll start the flight. There'll be one. You get off the flight. There's 10. And then it spreads from there.  So just watch. You'll see a lot of these free public Wi-Fi and there's nothing on the other end because it's an ad hoc network.  Is it dangerous?  It's not dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it is if they've got viruses of some kind that could infect your machine.  Well, that's sort of a given, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not dangerous to you because you're using a Mac.  There's a way to tell if this machine has viruses of spyware. Look for an Apple Labuindos logo on the front of the machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A couple of Apple stories in the news. First of all, the new shuffle finally ships. Shuffle ships.  We've been waiting for the shuffle. That's the little one that's just basically the size of the clip that you got with the old iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So how long before the Bikini? Is that coming out next?  I think that is. When I saw it, I thought this is a Saturday Night Live skit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  It's a small kit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a little late, but it's out.  And I think the way they're positioning it, it's not your first iPod. It might not even be your second iPod.  It's your third or fourth iPod, right? It's the extra iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because really, why do you want to carry that big four-ounce iPod into the bathroom with you?  That's right.  Just click one clipped onto the flush hand or the hopper and you're good to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you seen them? Has anybody played with them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I played with one in a very brief at the intro. It is exactly what Apple does best.  Just give you something that you put in your hand and it feels right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple is very good at creating, and I'm a little propagandized now,  because Ben Long, who's on the ship, gave me these old BBC documentaries talking about Edward Bernays  and the creation of public relations.  And what Edward Bernays, who was the nephew of Sigmund Freud, figured out at the turn of the century was,  at that time, all advertising was based on value.  Here's what it's going to do for you. Here's how it's going to help you.  And Edward Bernays said, wait a minute, that's the wrong way.  You've got to speak to people's deep-rooted, subconscious feelings of need.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You sell the need. And so that's what Apple is so good at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't need another iPod, but you look at that, you hold it and you go, I want that.  There's two things that go into marketing. You're either creating demand or filling demand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we have a situation on the boat where the Purell, a Go-Go, every room you go into, they've got Purell.  That's filling a need. Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because otherwise we'll all get sick and die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they're pushing the Purell, baby, let me tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have never been anywhere where I've been so sterile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have absorbed more alcohol in my bloodstream through my hands than I have through one year of through my mouth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't you think, I mean, this is not a medical podcast, but just briefly, and we'll get back to your point,  but don't you think that by doing that we're creating a super breed of bacteria that's Purell resistant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a shipboard breed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe that's our job here on Earth. Maybe God put us here because he needs better bacteria.  No, it's plastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They'll be replacing Norwalk with Norrond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And plastic is a wonderful culture medium for bacteria.  Indeed it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I mean, it is really amazing.  They sell you a fabulous manicure when you get on the ship and then they completely ruin it by giving you Purell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And would that be need-based or would that be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's create the need to get the manicure and it's fill the need to do the Purell.  But Apple's very good at creating a need and looking at a situation where improvement...  A need?  And I'm using the little finger quotes.  Do you need another iPod?  Well, do you need a pet rock?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Another way of looking at it is that they don't market to existing markets.  They basically say, well, look, how do people want to use this now?  The fact that there are now a million different ways to slip an iPod onto your shoulder, into your hat, into whatever,  means that, well, how about one that has an integrated clip that you can essentially put it on whatever piece of clothing you're wearing.  It's great for writers, right?  Exactly. I mean, you see, my God, that's such a natural and good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think there's a certain fetish quality in Apple products as well.  Maybe we're just the... I mean, everybody in this room, these Mac Mania crew...  Look, these guys spent thousands of dollars to sit here and talk about Macintoshes.  And that wasn't a need, but...  That's not the best test group.  But don't you think Apple creates these fetish objects that you don't need?  I look at the MacBook Pro, the one that just came out.  I don't need another laptop, but I want one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Replace the word need with the word demand.  Create a demand.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Create an imaginary need.  Create an emotional need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But isn't that in some way part of the feature set of any piece of technology in any product?  I've been...  Oh, it is, but Apple's particularly good at it.  I'm saying, to get off Apple for just a second, just so we're not talking about one company,  Nikon let me a D80 for the past couple weeks.  I'm reviewing it.  Of course, I made sure I had it for the crews.  And part of it is, yes, it has great features.  Yes, it takes great pictures, but it feels exactly right in my hand.  It has the exact right heft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look, don't you need this?  Don't you want this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is there demand for that?  I mean, that's what capitalism is about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think there has to be demand, and that's the point.  Is there a demand for it or is that...?  This is an HD solid-state camcorder.  This is your gadget for the week, then?  Well, actually, I've been playing with this for a while.  No, it gets in half an hour on a 2GIG SD card.  Watch, I'm going to create a need right here.  Creating demand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Create a need to get another one because this is going to my pocket.  If I lick this, not having brushed my teeth, you're not going to want it back, are you?  Do not lick the camera.  Well, but again, it does come down to a perceived need because, believe it or not,  I still do not own a camcorder that you can plug in via Firewire because I hate camcorders.  I hate having one. I hate having to shoot video with one.  And so whenever I will take one for a month and review them,  I'll talk to people who use them every day to make sure that my knowledge is up to date.  But as wonderful as this is, and this is a really cool, compelling object that I'm holding...  I should say it's the Sanyo Exact HD 1A. It's a solid-state camcorder.  It basically looks like a... not the Phasers from the first series of Star Trek,  but from the second would-be series, when it was more of a peacekeeping Phaser than anything else.  Phaser sent to NAP.  I think marketing is more like hypnotism than mind control  because you can't hypnotize people into doing something they wouldn't do ordinarily.  So you can't market me to buy something that I don't think is worth anything to begin with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's an example. This. Bottled water.  This is a created need. You can go to the tap and get free water.  But here's what happened. Marketers noticed all of a sudden a lot of people going around with these sport bottles,  and they said, hmm, there's a market here. Why don't we just...  Portability.  Portability. Why don't we just sell this water this way?  Now, what's the markup on this water?  More than gasoline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the same price as the stupid sodas. I mean, they're selling them roughly the same price.  Is that a real need or is that a created need?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is a real need because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, why?  Remember what water tastes like in a public school? Do you know what the state of the pipe is?  I live in the Pacific Northwest. My water in the Pacific Northwest is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's your water for the Pacific Northwest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just open your mouth in three seconds. It's been raining so hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. The rain just comes right down. It's like natural all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really think it's not so much marketing. Again, not only that, but people are more aware that they need to hydrate.  The reason why they're feeling so terrible at the end of two days is because they've drunk maybe two cups of non-caffeinated whatever it is.  I like the fact that, again, if I want to hydrate, every store will give me a bottle of water with no caffeine, no chemicals, no calories, nothing but hydration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And no corn syrup. I mean, it's really for people who are moving away from sodas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There are many documented cases of bottled water that's bottled with municipal tap water or, in some cases, worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which shows you how good the tap water is supposed to be if they meet requirements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But if bottled water doesn't even match municipal standards for water quality, why are you paying for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's the question for the consumer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, because there isn't a stream anywhere near Copley Square in Boston.  It's a trust issue.  Oh, rather, there's the public garden. We've got the swan boats in there and ducks are doing things there that I don't approve of.  This water comes from Whistler. This is trustworthy water.  I don't want to brag or anything, but I've got a dollar on me right now. I'm going to make another dollar really, really quickly in my job.  So I can spend a dollar to get 20 ounces of water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute, it's bingo time. Let's listen in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And a very fair good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is your captain speaking with a voice from the bridge.  A voice from the bridge.  Give voice to the whole technological information. Whatever you choose to do, make it a great afternoon and evening on the V-Damp and I'll see you around the ship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you won't.  Has anybody ever seen this guy?  Yes.  Not around the ship?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not around the ship, but he's on the closed circuit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, that's a tactical error. The least thing you want to do, given that we're at sea, he's trapped on board with 1,500 people who want to hurt him really badly.  I'll see you.  I would have a Max Hedrum sort of thing in my place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's almost as good as saying I carry 20 grand on me at all times.  Can we talk about that? Wozniak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to have to email that boy.  Steve Wozniak, who was going to be on this cruise, I think, but his book came out a little bit late, and so he's on a book tour still.  And part of the talk of the cruise is Wozniak's appearance on Colbert and the vote on whether it was abysmal, horrible, or just plain embarrassing.  But the other thing he did is he gave an interview. You heard this, Naomi.  What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He basically told everybody he likes cash, and he carries 20K on him at all times.  I'm guessing that's not going to happen for long.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That seems like a dumb thing to admit.  That's right. That's just crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a pretty large audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So on Colbert, he says, I carry a credit card-sized knife that I can cut my stake with.  Well, he's got a lot of dismal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, bigger than that, his standard business card is a sharp piece of square metal that is apparently sharp enough to cut a stake with.  Wow. He likes to demonstrate this for stewardesses.  And that's not a liability issue, huh?  Exactly.  Here, have my card, slice.  My theory is that after your net worth exceeds $300 billion, let's say $400 billion, they give you a special social security number that's like the black American Express card.  When you pay for the black card, they give him whatever he wants, do whatever he wants.  Black card, anything you want.  So when the FBI runs a background check, when he gets pulled over for whatever, they say, oh, you've got the double Y in front of the, okay, that means you're so rich, you can buy our way out of anything.  So go on your way.  Thank you very much.  Sorry to have troubled you, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't O.J. have one of those?  Who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  O.J.  Oh, but I, you know, he's got to be one of the sweetest guys that's ever been on these pieces.  Absolutely.  And he's got every gizmo.  He's like a child.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think really that's the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think the big problem with the Colbert appearance was just that the cardinal rule of appearing on that kind of a comedy show is let the host be funny.  And he was trying to tell stories and just expecting Colbert to be very patient and simply sit and enjoy the stories.  Colbert's not a straight man.  Exactly.  And so he's done that long enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're aware, though, that Waz has posted that whole video on his own website.  He feels pretty good about it.  Must.  Yeah.  I saw it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't think.  I think he knows Waz and watches that.  That's Waz.  That's how he is.  So I think that that among his circle of family and friends is just like, well, Waz was Waz.  Somebody who doesn't know Waz might look at it and say, well, ow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but there's so many executives in this industry, too, which that would be true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Something about coupons.  Would you rather have the so-called crazy, like, rich businessman who, like, cuts his cuts his stake on a flight with a business card or the crazy CEO who spends $4.8 million on a birthday party for his dog, stealing money from the company?  That's a good point.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nobody ever backdated any options to Steve Waz.  I can tell you that right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He would have shared them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he would have given them away.  So Apple shared a document that might wish at this point it didn't share.  This was downloaded and according to the unofficial Apple web blog, TUAW.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Support your local union.  Support the TUAW today.  I like the TUAW.  Look for the union blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They released, Apple released for download in its developer section, iPod's Notes feature guide in which I'm quoting, it says, all other notes feature capabilities described in this document are supported for iPod models with display screens beginning with the touchscreen models.  Whoops.  The what?  The touchscreen models.  Now this just came out on October 20th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is a small piece of text inside another document or is this about?  It's a small piece of text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a kind of highlighted note as you can see right here.  Right.  And it sounds to me like absolute confirmation, inadvertent, that Apple has a touchscreen model coming out.  Or is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or was planning to at that time.  Well October 20th this came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's pretty recent.  Yeah, that's tipping the hand again.  Sounds to me like that's an admission.  Is there any way you could say it was else?  You think it's just a mistake or documentation?  Somebody told me it was a typo.  They meant, I don't know what they meant, touch screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What word is like touch that's only a typo away?  Tough screen.  Tough screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well sometimes you have a think-o in which you type the word you did not intend to type even though it's a perfectly good word and Microsoft Word doesn't tell you hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't you think somebody vets this though and a few people looked at this?  It sounds to me more like it was a document that wasn't intended to be released until a few weeks hence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or maybe Macworld.  I mean isn't that.  We don't know when.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some have said that December.  That the touch screen will come out.  That doesn't make any sense to me.  For only one reason, to preempt the Zune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Zune is probably going to preempt itself.  I mean Microsoft has invented the self-preempting gadget.  I really don't see them doing a touch screen, introducing such a major new iPod without enough time to sell a buttload of them in time for Christmas.  They are overdue for a release though.  That's very true.  I would have been, I was a little surprised we didn't see anything that big in October.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Could it have been technical issues or production issues kept them from releasing in October but they are trying to get it out as quickly as they can?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are so many different reasons why.  Every time I talk to somebody post this incident and ask how come this didn't ship in time.  It ranges from we thought, there was a feature that we thought was integral but suddenly we decided we needed to get rid of it and so we had to hold it back for a couple of months.  This is somebody inside, Apple said this?  There are people who sometimes talk to me when they are not supposed to be talking to me.  There are situations.  We are in international waters, it's okay to say this stuff.  No it's not.  And it's not that this has absolutely nothing to do with any topic we are currently talking about.  We are talking about products dating back, in some cases dating back from eight or nine years ago.  Before 97 maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are a lot of things that could stop.  And it's clear for instance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And some of them are so stupid that when people are expecting this special inside dope, well of course as we know the new iTunes store in Polynesia hasn't opened yet, there is a special international.  No it's because they wanted their goal was to have X 100,000 units ready to ship.  They had less than that and so they didn't want to blow the biggest blast of PR they are going to get.  So they decided let's do it in January when we are already going to get more PR from whatever keynote appearance that Steve Jobs is going to be doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It could be projections about how big the need slash demand would be for the holidays.  Are we agreed though that there will be a touch screen iPod?  We are not.  Why not?  Well I mean until Steve or whoever actually gets up on the stage and with his mouth expresses to the world that something is real it's just not real.  It's just not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But he did that with ITV already.  But he did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that was very cleverly done to preempt other people's announcements and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it also sort of changes the dialogue about.  And it didn't cannibalize any existing Apple product, more to the point.  But even better than that it sort of makes the upcoming iPod debates interesting because when the movie store and the TV store came out, the video store came out,  you were thinking okay well obviously now this implies there is going to be a big screen iPod.  Now there is well wait a minute maybe there is not going to be one because now they are preparing another device that is more appropriate for watching big screen video.  So maybe they are going to simply say no the iTunes is still, the standard screen iPod is we want the same size,  we want that big mechanical looking scroll wheel so that you don't get fingerprints on the display.  We are just going to have this ITV device that is the intended best.  I don't like the idea of a touch screen to be honest with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like the idea however of rumor killing disinformation leakages in three words or less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I hope there is an attachment that lets out Purell whenever he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The new Purell iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Zune is a sharing device, the iPod is also a sharing device, they are just sharing things that maybe you don't want to share.  Like Carpenter's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Zune squirts the content, the iPod squirts Purell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is two different things that could happen.  One, I mean I have definitely known of products whose announcements have been shredded 10 minutes before the keynote for whatever reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are things that I can't talk about for all the different reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could but it would be wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly, but you are just shocked.  I understand how stupid I am about how it goes into marketing where I realize wait a minute but it is so real and it is so good.  We decided that and like wow.  For every three things I think I understand about Apple and other companies, I know there are always a hundred other things that I can only guess at.  There is no room for arrogance, there is no reason to believe a rumor just by the even when a good news site.  There are three Apple employees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are three Apple employees aboard this ship and I think it was you Naomi who pointed out that they could appear on the show but it would be their last day at Apple.  All Apple employees are allowed to speak on their last day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I mean speaking of which, the other potential outcome for this is we have precedent of products being killed for rumors.  Not that I would promote this as a candidate for such but we lost that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now wait a minute, you don't go all the way down the line of the product cycle and then kill it because somebody leaked it.  It has been done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It has happened.  It has happened.  Really?  Yes.  Can you give us an example?  There was a firewire thing at one point, do you remember that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is a lot of money to throw away just because a rumor leaked out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A firewire interference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is one of the eight firewire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How could you like go right in your mind?  Yeah, I got to point out you are wearing a headset mic and whispering it is in fact not going to do any good at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have those really petite little Madonna mics that Madonna puts on when she dances and you don't want to pay attention to how old she has gotten.  Hey, she looks pretty good for my age.  Anyone looks good bolted to a crystal cross, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is not This Week in Madonna, much as that could be the next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But in all seriousness, I think there has been precedence of both things being cancelled for that, we think for that reason.  I will accept that.  And just because.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It just shows Apple's absolute commitment to secrecy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it is their right.  As a company, it is absolutely their right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whether it is intelligent is another matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just getting back to the baseline response though, we all know quote unquote that there is a touchscreen iPod out because we have all seen patent filings have been posted everywhere.  A new one came out last week.  Exactly.  And we all know that there is an iPhone coming out because we have all heard the stories about how Steve is not even being terribly caged with his friends about it.  But even so, and we also had reports from it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It ain't real until the skinny guy in his blue jeans sings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know better than to know that it is a fact until I am actually holding one in my hand.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can see it on store Apple com.  You can't see it on store Apple com.  It is not real yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The problem that I have with rumor sites is when people start treating this news.  This is no rumor.  This is no rumor.  No, no, no.  This is a document that Apple.  That is no rumor.  But you opened the can, didn't you?  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just want to quickly defend the so-called rumor sites because a lot of them are doing really good journalism.  There are a lot of sites that they will not simply say, hey, this dude sent us an email with a picture of what is totally an iPod PDA.  And it's also a video.  And it wouldn't be.  They couldn't fake a video, could they?  Yes.  Yes.  Some design student who wanted to show how good he could design stuff could have faked that thing.  Whereas there are others who say, well, look, we got this information from this source and we've heard from this source six times and six times he's given us reliable information.  Who's the best?  I really like Apple Insider.  I, again, know nothing.  The previous statement is still true that don't believe in to actually see it.  But if I thought that something was not possible or the Apple would never get into this business, if I see it on Apple Insider, I at least have to start calling people and say, OK, what is there something that I don't know?  Is there something I really thought about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, it seems like that does damage to the stock price to you, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, hell, everything does damage.  I wish I were an Apple stockholder right now.  I know.  I think that nothing's going to hurt that stock price for some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but you see, it used to be worse back when the Wild Wild West days before Apple really clamped down on rumors and made it the third rail of Apple employee manual.  It's not anymore?  Oh, no.  I think it still is.  It is.  No, right.  But you think before that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Back when Mac week was Mac leak.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would get routinely things in my inbox where someone would someone would tell me about this new print this new print architecture or this new printer, this new piece of hardware that was coming out.  It's really, really good.  But it would be like from this doctor cyber dude lead to that, you know, whatever dot com like this basic 40 year old person trying to make you think he's a 16 year old person email address.  And you say, oh, yeah, it's good.  But the room the rumor is that because I saw it, it didn't really work.  And we don't really know how we can put it in the network.  And I'm like, OK, chances are I think at least two out of five.  This is an Apple product manager and this is a competing product.  He wants to make sure that buzz starts getting negative.  So he can say he can basically go back to a meeting later on say, well, you know, already the buzz is bad.  Why don't you give us the budget and the manpower and the resources to make this work?  God, they clamped down on that.  That is not like the dangers, though, is when it leaps into mainstream media, when it gets quoted in mainstream media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The good news is the same mainstream.  Mainstream mainstream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I get you with that.  You told us this is the guy from the Wall Street Journal.  You told us you get mainstream for all of our publications and stuff.  Damn.  Google just bought JotSpot, which is a joke.  I think this is Joe Krause, the guy who did Excite, went off, sold Excite, founded JotSpot, which is a Wiki, actually pretty good Wiki server company.  Two thousand customers, they say, paid between five and two hundred dollars a month for Wikis.  Another acquisition for Google, their first Wiki, I think.  It's a service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think so, but it also had like a spreadsheet component, which is similar to their Sheets.Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They do. They have one of the nice things about JotSpot is they have they look like ActiveX controls.  I don't know how they really implement them, but they're embedded little controls for a variety of different commonly done things, including spreadsheets and churning.  And that would be a good acquisition for Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It might be good to really expand because they took rightly over what, a few months ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so they've got spreadsheet, they've got rightly, they've got calendar, they've got email, they've got Wiki.  What more does Google need?  The love of a good woman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's you.  Thank God. Thank God this is a mainstream media. I would so kick your ass right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody said a browser. They don't really need a browser, do they?  They've got Firefox. They don't need a browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One thing that Google needs they don't have yet is they don't have the APIs that Yahoo has for doing remote access.  Like Yahoo provides JSON callbacks so you can actually do everything client side where Google doesn't have anything like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the Google API is not as rich as the Yahoo API?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yahoo API is actually much better for small sites to use directly.  That's interesting.  So eventually I think Google will catch up when they figure out what they're doing wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the kind of thing that, I mean, well, Google knows what value there is in that when you look at Google Maps and all the map mashups.  Clearly a good API is a great way to outvalue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also the Yahoo API, at least for like the maps, I know a friend of mine that's doing real estate with it and apparently the Yahoo API is more open for commercial reuse than Google's API for that kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if I'm Yahoo, I'm looking at what Google's doing.  I'm thinking how do I get a jump on them? Well, that's one of the ways to do it.  You have a more liberal license.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure some of this is catch up because, you know, Yahoo's playing the number two role here.  But Yahoo has actually also gone ahead and opened up a bunch of JavaScript client side stuff that is really, really nice.  So they're providing essentially tools that rival prototype JS and JS and a few of the other things are being used for Ruby on Rails.  They're using the same sort of things, but they're got a much larger user community and Yahoo is using it inside as well.  So you don't have to use PHP to interface.  Not to use PHP.  So they have all this stuff that downloads creates JavaScript.  It's all compressed JavaScript.  So it downloads nicely.  It's under a BSD style license, so very easy to reuse for commercial applications.  They are releasing a couple of new packages a month.  They are very active in their own mailing lists, their public mailing lists.  So they're really trying to become sort of the big open source supporter of really good cross platform tool kits to be used in things that they're building their front page with or Yahoo mail with and things like that.  And Google is nowhere near that.  The Google client side stuff is some really weird thing that you start out writing code in Java and it compiles to Java.  Now a little disclaimer here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've done some consulting work for Yahoo on this.  So I am a little bit.  I've seen both sides though.  Google's also released.  We haven't seen it yet because we've been shipboard and it's costing us, as you said, $8 a minute to download anything.  But they have a new Gmail mobile client, a Java client for phones.  Gmail dot com slash app will run on any phone that supports the mobile Java implementation.  And I talked to Emma MacArthur, who's a big Gmail fan, and she says she loves it.  It's really working great.  I think that's a nice feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But does it still have, does it still use the old style phone interface for software where it will automatically attach numbers next to different menu options?  Because that's my big.  That's nice though, isn't it?  No, it's terrible.  You don't like that?  Well, because a Windows smartphone, which is my favorite mobile operating system, it uses the key in the browser app.  It uses the keypad for scrolling.  So every time I'm just going to naturally hit the nine button to scroll down and out.  You said thank you for deleting all your email.  Thank you.  Right.  It's actually sort of reduced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good question.  I do not know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't.  I was kind of upset when Bloglines updated their mobile mobile side and Bloglines mobile is it transforms any phone you start accessing.  It does such a wonderful job of taking a complicated browser based interface and totally redoing it for mobile.  It's just wonderful.  But now they added, they basically did a deal with Squeezer so that if you follow a link from one of your RSS items, it's not the whole article.  It just gives you a link to something.  It will instead of taking you to the real web page, now it will take you to, it will go through Squeezer to turn it into a more mobile appropriate looking page, which is kind of a nice thing.  But again, Squeezer also uses numeric menus at the very end.  So now I can't, I have to down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's just looking at this and again, I can't because I haven't installed it.  It looks like it's very clean.  They've got a menu option, so I think you probably will be able to scroll until you hit that menu option and then you'll have to.  Possibly then you will, numbers will be activated.  Photos are instantly resized to fit the screen size of your mobile device.  In some ways, Amber thought this it's a Blackberry killer.  It turns any phone with the sports J2ME into a pretty good email device.  Non Verizon phone.  Yeah, as long as you're not using Verizon, you're OK.  Verizon doesn't support.  Yes, they do on the razor, don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Verizon. Well, Verizon uses Brew.  And so you can't do any of the J2ME stuff.  It's all locked down.  Only Verizon apps can go on Verizon phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why I will never buy a Verizon phone.  Matter of fact, they've stopped.  They've been smart enough to stop sending me phones to write about because you keep saying that.  Although after the second or third, I simply had to say, well, look, this is a nice phone.  But if you want to send it to me, realize that the first three paragraphs are going to be Motorola.  The Motorola feature set for this phone is wonderful, but it's too bad that Verizon has turned off being able to email photos, turned off this feature, that every feature that competes with the pace.  They turn off Bluetooth.  Exactly.  That's rendering it.  Ringtones.  This rendering into a useless, you know, it's like being back in 1988.  You know, you may as well have a brick phone for all the features that you get for free with the thing.  It's a useless service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google's started to share revenue on its Google video started with the Mentos guys.  They do it did a new Mentos fountain video.  I guess the story was they made something like 30 grand off of Rever with the video on Rever.  Rever, of course, shares its revenue.  And Google clearly seeing this is a this is a gap in Google videos now said we're going to invite.  Now, it's not clear whether anybody can do this or you have to somehow get it make a deal with Google to share video.  But 50 percent of ad revenue, it says, will go to videographers.  Only girl 15 is moving there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Every time I see something like that, I always have to realize how little I know about real legal aspects and how often I wind up having to call people to ask because this makes me wonder what the legal aspects are going to be.  What are you giving up?  Now, well, not only what you're giving up, but now that we have content that's monetized and content that's not monetized, does that give if I have content that's being either pirated or maybe being exorbitant, does that give me a bigger club with which to hit this other person?  Say, well, look, it's no longer I know.  I know. I know. I know we're both make in the old in the old mechanism.  We're both making no money off of this video.  We posted off onto onto Google video.  If my video is now generating revenue, can I say, hey, look, you're dying me revenue.  Now I can actually get an attorney who's willing to take on my case.  Sounds right. You know, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Google hasn't indicated whether this will extend to YouTube, which, of course, they bought just a few weeks ago, but I presume it would.  Right now it can't because they haven't finished the deal.  Is it 50 percent net or gross?  Boy, you sound like you're talking 50 percent of ad revenue.  But the problem with Google is they've never revealed what their actual ad revenue is.  You just kind of assume if you use Google AdSense that you're getting your fair share, but you don't really know how much they're making.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We need independent audits.  No way.  Sounds expensive.  Seventy million dollars later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If these video services were any good at auditing, the only videos on there would be more like Cat with a Sombrero chasing a bug videos.  The reason for going to Google video and going to YouTube would not exist because you no longer get TV shows.  You can no longer get music videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, in fact, MySpace has announced now that they're going to use this fingerprinting technology for the sound, for the audio on MySpace.  This has been a big problem, of course, on YouTube and other.  In fact, this was part of the YouTube deal was there'd be some sort of fingerprinting so that copyrights holders could find their stuff on YouTube and ask that it be pulled down.  MySpace, which of course is owned by News Corp, a Murdoch's company, is going to use audio fingerprinting technology to block users from uploading copyrighted music to MySpace.  So this, I think you're going to see this every, this is going to be universal.  And you're right.  All you're going to see is cat videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, especially I'm always disappointed when I see where companies priorities are.  MySpace, my God, it's such a terrible, terrible way to have a presence on the net.  Okay, your default fonts are terrible.  The default layouts are terrible.  I told my 14 year old daughter is of course big into MySpace as all her friends are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I said, honey, don't you understand this is so web 1.0.  This is the worst user interface.  She said, what's wrong with user interface?  You click here.  I said, no, but you don't understand it's ugly.  No, I see it works just fine.  But you don't understand there's all these ads.  What are you talking about?  It's their culture.  Well, but they don't know any better.  Well, they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They used to know better.  They used to be using block software that actually has here eight really nice and professional  design templates.  We're also not going to make it easier for to have whatever crappy garage band you stumbled  onto an hour ago, Blair through my speakers at three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know 14 year old cares.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But this is another marketing principle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The old guy, their flare trousers and their Bebop music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He will care about templates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's a stalwart.  Very good.  It's another marketing principle that the enemy of the exceptional or the enemy of the  very good is the good enough.  I mean, the mediocre.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, and it's right.  And it's worked.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just ask Bill on the top page.  My website is a slogan by I think Voltaire saying the better is always the enemy of good.  But I wish that my space were even good.  It's just there.  It's just there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And speaking of Bill, Windows amazingly, Microsoft has capitulated on the license agreement  to Windows Vista.  The license initially said you could only transfer it once to another device.  They've now removed according to this is from ours.  Technica.  They've removed the language relating to device transfers.  And it now says, quote, you may install one copy of the software on the license device.  You may use the software on up to two processors on that device at one time.  What if you have a quad?  What if you have a quad?  I don't know what you do.  You have to buy another license of Windows for the other two processors.  The other two just crash.  You may use software on two processors at one time except as provided in the storage  and network use ultimate edition sections below.  You may not use written by Brian Michael Bench.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The ultimate Windows Vista ultimate may not use the software on any other device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Windows is three years old and is a half mutant.  Vista pen ultimate was just before that.  Hello to the listeners who are getting these references, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to thank you guys for being here.  I want to thank our audience, too, for joining us on Shipboard.  You could have been playing snowball jackpot bingo, but no, you came here to tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We could be off hacking voting machines this week for that.  Yeah, do you want to mention that briefly?  Yeah, it is kind of an interesting week in that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're coming up on a big election in just a couple of days.  We're going to get off the boat and have to vote.  A lot of counties and states and municipalities are still using these D-BOLD  and other electronic voting machines that are very suspect.  There was a story in Texas about a voting machine that if you happen to vote the Democratic slate,  you had to vote the perfect Democratic slate, would change it to the Republican slate.  Coincidence?  Yeah, I think not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You pass out in Florida, you pass out the Foley firmware update.  I think so, yeah.  There's a really dry academic but exceptional video on this whole issue showing just  showing you precisely how easy it is to hack one of these things over at, I think it's,  it policy dot Princeton dot edu slash voting.  And it's painful to watch.  I mean, it's got no production value at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We did it on the screensavers three or four years ago.  We had the guys come on and show us how easy it was to hack.  And it hasn't, as far as I can tell, been fixed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, and the professors did this.  It wasn't the kids doing it.  But it's a pretty interesting issue, and I don't really know how we're going to solve it.  But the...  Well, everybody agrees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everybody I know agrees.  The only solution is some sort of paper receipt.  It's got to print out something.  But I don't even trust the paper receipts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At least you can do a recount of some kind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's going to be something that counts the paper receipts,  but it's going to come from the same company.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, really the only solution is going to be requirement,  we will not validate these machines unless the operating system,  unless the operating system, all the software is open source,  unless everybody just posts it on the web.  There's a system that works for encryption,  because you would think that making the encryption public would make it weaker,  but no, actually every time you have an encryption system that gets broken...  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Except remember the Dennis Ritchie GCC hack, though.  They hacked the compiler.  They hacked the compiler so that it would recognize when it was being compiled for itself,  when it was running...  So the code looked ostensibly completely clean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to also examine the compiler code to make sure it's clean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It would recognize itself and insert a hack that when it was compiling login.c,  it would put a backdoor into login.c so anybody could log in using a known password.  Did he do that as a demonstration, or did Dennis just want to be able to get in?  No, he did as a demonstration. He didn't matter.  But yeah, he did as a demonstration that just having the source code is not enough,  because if you control the compiler chain, you still got your way in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what does EFF say about this?  I don't know. It's costing me eight bucks a minute just to sit here.  For more information, go to EFF.org.  You know, they're probably fighting some good fighter or another,  and could use a donation or two from citizens that care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there's a good website, and I can't remember it, on electronic voting that's very good.  It includes links to that demo that you talked about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And nobody at this table is worried about kids hacking these systems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I mean kids. It's Republicans. I mean, what did I just say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just worried about general denial of service,  because if you can get a good virus into this little smart card thing,  and get it inserted in the system, then you could cause chaos.  This country would be in an uproar if an election result was to come in.  We already have chaos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not that paper ballots are any better, let's face it.  I'd much rather do paper ballots than...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would too, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not that it's a better technology, it's just a more mature technology.  If it reassures you in the least, I've heard that 7,000 lawyers on Tuesday will be dispatched to watch our elections.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's as if, you know, I'm just waiting for Iran to send independent observers to watch our elections.  Who is? Venezuela is sending people to our elections.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Most of our vacations are better than a Broadway show.  7,000 lawyers are going to be watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How many? For 300 million people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  The eponymous Andy Anotko.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  First generation iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Ultimate iPod Book.  I'll plug his column.  It is device independent. It's a great column. Andy is one of the funniest guys I know.  I actually read that column.  I do too.  It's my parents' too.  No, Andy is one of the great Mac writers and it's always a pleasure to see him, his hat and his sideburns coming up that gangplank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm also glad to set my hat in place. I guess he's one third of the experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
