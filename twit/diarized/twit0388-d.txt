Transcript:  Well, lots of meetings. So one of  my interesting themes of CES is  the increasing mediarization of  consumer electronics.  Oh, God. I think CES now is

Start time: 186.80

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 188.61
End time: 208.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And lots and lots of media  companies trying to get in on  this sort of latest technology.  So I think lots of late nights,  lots of meetings.  Is this on behalf of Channel  Flip?  Yeah.  Okay, good.  Yeah. So all sorts of interesting  Google meetings and things going  on.  Cool.  And this is my first time in the  Twitter studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He's on a schedule.  Yeah.  So before we talk about some of  the things you guys saw,  I suppose we should talk about  all the cool gadgets you saw.  What do you think of this CBS  CNET thing?  Oh.  I think...  So I want to emphasize that we  are not beholden to anybody.  And so what we say about this  trade show will not be in any  way influenced.  CNET, which has a long and  somewhat glorious tradition of  tech news coverage, gives the  best of CES awards each year.  They've done so for some time  since Tech TV stopped doing it,  I think.

Start time: 266.17
End time: 267.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think G4 took over and then...

Start time: 267.60
End time: 337.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And then, well, Tech TV slash  G4, yeah.  They nominated the Dish DVR  Hopper as a finalist in their  best of CES awards.  Hopper is a very cool product.  It lets you record multiple  channels, I think all the major  networks at the same time.  Prime time.  And then, skip the commercials,  which has brought them under the  scrutiny and eventually lawsuits  from most of the major networks,  including CNET's parent company,  CBS.  CBS apparently objected to CNET  putting the Hopper on their best  of awards because of the lawsuit  and the Hopper was disqualified  shortly before the winners were  announced.  CNET attached a disclaimer to its  list of award finalists.  Good for CNET for saying it.  Because they could have just  gone zzz.  Instead, they said the Dish  Hopper with Sling was removed  from consideration due to active  litigation involving our parent  company, CBS Corp.  And this is the sad thing.  We will no longer be reviewing  products manufactured by  companies with which we are in  litigation with respect to such  product.  Oh, it's horrible.

Transcript:  This is the nightmare or one of  the nightmare scenarios for  journalists, right?  I mean, to have the advertising  arm reach in, have the legal arm  reach in and tell you what you  can and cannot cover, or even  worse, tell you what you can or  cannot award.  I mean, I have friends in the  industry who were bemoaning this  the minute they heard it.  They said the only reasonable  thing to do is for the CNET  editors to quit.  I don't think they can do that.  I mean...  Well, they could do that.  They're not going to do it  because they have to feed their  kids.  Exactly.  But I mean, that's the kind of  angst that this has drawn out.  I've had friends who say, I will  not have anyone tell me what  score I'm going to give a  product.  I will not have anyone tell me  which one I'm going to  recommend.  This is even worse.  This is a company who is not  even ashamed to say, yeah, we  are not going to cover you if  you sue us or if we're involved  in a litigation with you.  If we're suing you.  Right.

Start time: 390.18
End time: 415.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's just...  But I think it's going to become  an increasing problem because  one of the trends that we're  seeing over the last few years...  The mediation.  Right.  The mediation of technology.  The fact that big technology  companies are getting into  media, big media companies  getting into technology, and  all of those facts are in many  ways so common that they're  always going to start to throw  up editorial issues.  I mean, you see any of the big  newspaper companies that are  always suing each other and it  just becomes a nightmare for the  journalists.  I think...

Transcript:  You're owned by Discovery now.  Yes.  This could happen to you.  Potentially, yeah.

Start time: 420.14
End time: 479.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean, right now, at least  Tekzilla's content does not  dovetail or any of Discovery's  current offerings.  But I think it's misleading to  assume that this is somehow new.  I think this has been the case  for decades on.  Never happened to us at Tech TV.  Well, we had a very strong  editorial kind of firewall that  was...  For that reason.  For that reason.  And I think at some point when  news became more of a product  than actual information, when  CNN came online and, hey, look,  we now have a product we can  sell, suddenly became an asset  and any time you involve large  amounts of money, people start  you know...  Yeah, it starts...  You always get a slippery  slope.  You start somewhere, well, maybe  we won't cover it.  We'll just kind of ignore it.  And suddenly it starts rolling  into censorship, into selective  bias.  I mean, that's the whole concept  behind gatekeeping, right?  You let people know what's  important based on your...  What you consider to be good or  not.

Start time: 480.84
End time: 485.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think it hurts us as tech  journalists, though, doesn't it?  Because now the perception is,  oh, you know...

Start time: 486.41
End time: 494.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I also wonder if it really  hurts CES as sort of an entity  because...  You know who it hurts is CBS.  Well, because CNET...  This used to be the Tiffany

Start time: 494.84
End time: 497.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Network.  Now they clearly have no  dedication to journalism at all.

Start time: 497.82
End time: 506.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because CNET is like the  official press partner of CES.  Goodbye.  I would hope CES would pull the  plug on this.  Yeah, because if you've got the  press partner censoring what  they're going to cover...

Start time: 506.82
End time: 518.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  First thing I do is I go to the  Consumer Electronics Association  that organizes CES and say,  under no circumstances can these  awards be handled by a corrupt  organization like CNET ever  again.

Start time: 519.16
End time: 526.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Or just a company with a vest  and interest...  A conflict of interest, yeah.  A conflict of interest because  you will run into that issue  time and again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, somebody asked me, I  gave a keynote on Monday at the  podcast awards, New Media Expo.  Somebody asked me, would you...  Should I syndicate my content?  Should I partner up with big  media?  And I said, under no  circumstances.  And this was before this came  out.  But I said even then, every time  we've talked about doing this  with other big media entities,  there's been an impedance  mismatch.  And when it comes down to the  final deal, it always doesn't  fit.  And I always pull back because  I don't want to be put in a  situation like that.

Start time: 552.98
End time: 574.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You know, what strikes me is  that I come from sort of the  home podcaster background.  I don't have training in  journalism.  And so I always look to the big  organizations to sort of take  my lead from.  This is how I should be acting.  Yeah, that's not true anymore.  Exactly.  If I'm a home podcaster, I can  say, well, if CNET's going to do  this, why can't I just shill for  a company that's going to hand  me a bucket full of money?  Right.

End time: 595.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If I ever did that, it would  have to be so much money that  we would have to be what they  call F.U. money.  I'd have to be able to walk away  and say, I don't care if I have  any credibility, but the minute  you do that, your credibility,  your integrity are gone and it's  almost impossible to recover.  And I just feel really sorry for

Transcript:  the guys at CNET who are not the  senior editors or not the super  editors.  They're stuck.  You're in a rock and a hard  place.  I mean, you either stop earning  a paycheck or you just don't

Start time: 622.58
End time: 630.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  you?  And you know, it's such a  competitive market that they can  easily say, well, we can replace  you.  We'll find that 20-something that  is here to sell out.

Start time: 630.74
End time: 667.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And the thing is, this has been  going on kind of bit by bit with  TechCrunch investing in companies  that it covers.  This has been happening more and  more.  And the attitude has always been  disclosed and it's okay.  And this is what the end result  is.  And I've been warning against  this.  People say, no, no.  As long as we disclose it,  everybody knows who's in whose  pocket.  It's okay.  No, it's not.  Because what happens is things  like this where you actually get  legitimate contenders for a  prize removed for consideration  because the parent corporation  says you better not.  I mean, like, card journalism  used to be life with that for  decades.  Right.  We don't want to get that.  You've got to watch out about  that.

Start time: 668.50

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right?  I mean, it's, I mean, you know,  hey, let's talk about our new  car.  We're going to fly out to an  island in the middle of the VGN  and you get to drive a really  super, super amazing sports car.  We'll put you up.  We'll feed you food.  You know, we'll fly you both  ways.  Four-star accommodation.  Just say something nice.  And then you get like a bunch of  fluff, you know, generally five  to six pages long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, I saw a great article  on Gizmodo this week which was  one of the writers who said, you  know, we all know that PR is  basically just a shill to try  and get, you know, give you free  stuff to get something out of  your pocket.  He said, I got so fed up with  this while I was at CES this  week.  I was so tired and so achy and  so ill, I just tweeted, I will  write anything about anybody's  product if someone will give me  a back rub.  A back rub.  You're cheap.  And so the guy tweeted it and  within five minutes he got a  headphone company that sent a  masseuse to where he was on the  show floor, gave him a back  rub and he said, here is, and  I'm writing about these,  whatever it was, headphones.  They sound really good, really  interesting.  And they're very relaxing.  And they're very relaxing.  He said, this is super, super  amazing.  And he said, I'm going to write  a book about this.  And he said, it's very relaxing.  He said, this is CES distilled to  its purest form.  And I thought, yeah, that's about  as soft as a glove.

Start time: 730.28
End time: 752.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And, you know, I'll be honest,  there's some companies that  don't get it.  I mean, you know, I'm not going  to name any particular names,  but we did a review for a  product on Teczilla and the CEO  kept calling me back, asking me  to review it again.  It's like, well, no, I mean,  there was nothing wrong with the  initial review.  We have reviewed it.  It's like, you know, you want me  to review it because, you know,  so it becomes more favorable and  it's just like, no, that's not  the idea behind it.  That does happen from time to  time.

Start time: 753.12
End time: 767.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We've always gotten that in tech  TV.  We got it.  And you just ignore it.  And most companies are savvy  enough to know you get a bad  review, you get a bad review,  you move on.  Some companies get punitive about  it.  Life goes on, right?  I don't know.  Well, that is a great idea.  I already have three offers for

Start time: 768.28
End time: 770.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  a back rub.  Keep tweeting.  You haven't even asked me yet.

Start time: 771.24
End time: 772.98
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.  Anyway, I thought we should

Start time: 773.12
End time: 774.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  bring that up up front.  We will talk about CES.

Start time: 775.38
End time: 820.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I also, I don't know, this  is such a sad story.  I mean, I'm not going to be  honest with you.  I'm not going to be honest with  you.  But it's a huge story.  I hate to dwell on it, but we're  going to talk about Aaron  Schwartz because a huge story.  And if we don't talk about it,  you know, it's the kind of thing  that mainstream media is not  going to be able to understand  or make any sense of it.  But we can and we should talk  about it.  We will.  His death and his, what his  legacy was and what he meant to  the world of technology in just  a little bit.  You know, somebody in the chat  room said, hey, how is it  different from taking ad money?  We do, we take ad money.  We're very clear when it's an  ad, right?  So I would love not to take ad  money, but I don't know of any  other way to fund the business.  And we certainly don't change  our editorial coverage of  advertisers because of that.

Start time: 821.23
End time: 861.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think we could go even  further.  I mean, just from my experience  with Twitter, whenever I get a  new ad read, one of the things  that's always told to me is...  You don't have to do it.  A, I don't have to do it.  That was the very first thing  that you told me.  If you're not comfortable doing  an ad, you don't have to do it.  The second thing is I was told  we don't disparage the  competitors.  My job is not to go in there and  say, oh, I love this company.  In the ad, you mean?  Right, and I hate that company.  We don't do that.  I think that's what makes it  different.  There are rules for saying this  is an ad, this is who supports  us, and if you like us, please  support them.  This with CBS was just completely  different.  This is we want to punish this  company because we're at odds  with them legally.  Right.  We don't like what they do, so

Start time: 861.84
End time: 877.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  we're going to punish them.  Anyway, I'm going to do an ad  anyway.  So there.  Because if I don't...  Great segue.  I don't know how we keep the  lights on.  Our power bill is like $4,000 a  month.  Wow.  So I'm going to...  Looking at this, that doesn't

Start time: 894.76
End time: 903.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  turn off the lights.  So that was a revelation right  there.  That was good.  Our show today brought to you  by the great folks at stamps.com.  This is a postage pro tip.  I love the word pro tip.  Chad, you were, I think, the  first person ever who gave me a  pro tip.  I was playing Skyrim.  You said pro tip.  Do you want a pro tip, Leo?  Yeah, here's a pro tip.  I like that phrase pro tip.  It's like this is stuff pros  know.  And the pros know if you're  doing mailing, you don't go to  the post office to buy stamps.  I guess that should be fairly  obvious.  You're waiting.  It's a waste of time.  You're waiting in line, parking  and all that stuff when there's  a better way.  Now, maybe the pros think the  right way to do it is a postage  meter, but that's not the  modern way to do it.  You do not need a postage  meter.  It's so funny because I see  people waiting in line at the  post office.  They're waiting with their  postage meters to get them  recharged.  You don't need that.  You don't need special ink.  You've got a computer, right?  You've got a printer, right?  That's all you need.  Oh, and stamps.com lets you buy  and print U.S. postage from your  computer, your printer.  You don't need anything else.  No special ink, no postage  meter.  You can print right on the  envelope, which means you can  put your company logo, the  postage.  In fact, stamps.com will pull  the address and the information  from your address book, from  QuickBooks if you're on eBay or  Amazon, Etsy, PayPal.  You know, if you sell stuff  online, it'll put it right from  the website.  So you're not typing in  addresses.  You're just printing right on  the envelope or printing right  on the sticker for the package.  It will automatically send out  emails with tracking numbers for  priority mail and express mail  automatically.  It's just the fastest, easiest  way to turn yourself into a  professional shipper.  So if you do a lot of mailing,  you really want to use stamps.com.  You also get discounts you can't  get at the post office, up to 21  percent on Express Mail.  It gives you mail up to 15 percent  on priority mail.  It gives you international mail,  too.  Fills out the forms for you.  Certified mail fills out the  forms for you.  There really is no easier way, no  more accurate way to mail.  And when you get that scale, now  you always have exactly the  right postage.  You just plop the letter or  package on the scale, boom, it  prints out the right postage.  Now, here's the scale.  Here's the deal.  If you go to stamps.com, look at  this special offer, $80 value.

Transcript:  Hey, before we get back to CES,  I think we should mention Aaron  Schwartz.  What an interesting fella.  Teen prodigy.  If you read Cory Doctorow on  Boing Boing had a very touching  heartfelt eulogy for Aaron.  Larry Lessig, who knew Aaron,  had a very touching eulogy.  Everybody seemed to know this  kid, starting around the age of  14 when he started showing up at  computer conferences and trade  shows.  He was right about that age when  he helped write the  specification for RSS, which we  use every day.  That's how we do podcasts.  He wrote some of the early code  for Reddit and sold the code to  Reddit.  And he's sometimes called a  founder.  I don't think that's quite  accurate, but he certainly wrote  much of the code that Reddit's  running.  And he became a political  activist in a very interesting  way.  Larry Lessig wrote, he was  brilliant and funny, a kid  genius, a soul, a conscience, the  source of a question I've asked  myself a million times.  What would Aaron think?  This is Larry Lessig, the Harvard  constitutional law professor.  Unfortunately, Aaron committed  suicide, killed himself.  He killed himself on Friday at  the age of 26.  And Larry Lessig and many others  including the family blame the  U.S. government.  Larry says that person has gone  today driven to the edge by what  a decent society would only call  bullying.  I get wrong, but I also get  proportionality.  And if you don't get both, you  don't deserve to have the power  of the United States government  behind you.  Here's what happened.  Aaron believed, like all hackers,  that information wants to be free.  There's a video of Aaron  speaking.  He started freeing information  early on.  It's interesting.  He liberated the U.S. legal code.  So there's a system called PASER  that gives you, in the United  States, gives us access to case  law, paid access to case law.  Now, case law is public domain.  Case law is what all the court  have ruled about stuff.  It's what you would use if you  were defending yourself, what the  precedents, what the legal  precedents are.  You know, every lawyer has a law  library, but then they also go  online to PASER.  And for a fee, they download  these judgments.  But those judgments belong to all  of us.  They're public domain.  They're the U.S. courts.  So activists built something  called RECAP and encouraged its  users to take their case law  downloads after they did it and  post them on RECAP, perfectly  legal, because it's our stuff.  And RECAP was free and open.  And anybody can use it.  Well, Aaron took some of the  money he made from the sale of  Reddit and bought 20% of the  PASER content and posted it on  RECAP.  That's a guy who believes  information should be free.  He got in trouble with the feds.  The FBI investigated him.  Corey Doctorow says it looked  like he'd be on the pointy end  of some bad legal stuff, but he  escaped it all in a merged  triumphant, because, in fact, he  didn't break any laws.  There wasn't a thing to do.  But he did raise the price of  the higher of the United States  federal law enforcement.  He annoyed a lot of people  doing that.  He annoyed people.  He founded a group called demand  progress, which was one of the  real effective groups of fighting  SOPA and PIPA last year.  So he might have, I don't know,  he did something that was a  little reckless, let's say.  There is another database kind  of like the PASER database.  It's called JSTOR.  It's an academic journal  database, and it charges money  for access to academic journals.  Now, these aren't quite exactly  in the public domain.  Some of these studies were paid  for by federal funds.  Some of the studies are academic  and paid for by universities.  But it's often been a bone of  contention that this stuff, for  society's sake, should be widely  available.  The scientific journals, anybody  should be able to access them,  shouldn't have to pay for it.  He was associated with Harvard.  Harvard had an account with JSTOR.  He used his legitimate account,  but he did something JSTOR says  you can't do, which is download  in bulk.  He, in fact, took a laptop, snuck  it into MIT, put it in the  closet in MIT, and had it in the  closet, and connected it, and  downloaded the entire database.  Want to think, 20%?  Is it that little?  I thought it was more.  Anyway, gigabytes.

End time: 1446.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a lot.  I don't know how much.  Yes, he took a lot.  JSTOR, when they caught him,  actually, he turned himself in.  JSTOR and MIT decided to  prosecute.  The Feds, of course, said, yeah,  we finally got this kid.  Eventually, JSTOR backed down.  In fact, an interesting thing,  JSTOR just a few weeks ago  decided to make all of that  information public anyway.  MIT, according to Lessig, was a  little less, a little more  equivocal in its backing down,  giving the prosecutors, the  federal prosecutors, sufficient  reason to continue forward.  Aaron was facing 50 years in  jail, a $4 million fine.  The trial was to come in April.  Now...  Totally disproportionate.  Totally disproportionate.  They were treating him like a  terrorist.  They were trying to make an  example out of him.  They implied that he was stealing  this data to sell it, which he  wasn't.  He wanted to make it publicly  available.  However, he did break laws.  Although...  Just not really 50 years worth of

Start time: 1446.34

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now, Corey writes, Aaron was a  person who had problems with  depression for many years.  He'd written about the subject  publicly, talked about it with  his friends.  And, of course, there are many  things that might cause a person  to want to take his own life.  But his friends, his family, and  Larry Lessig do think that the  unreasonable disproportionate  reaction of the federal  government had something to do  with it.  The thought of being in prison  for 50 years might have had  something to do with it.  So our deepest condolences to  all who knew Aaron.  To all who knew Aaron Swartz.  To his family, to his partner.  It is just a horrible tragedy.  I don't think that it's really  appropriate to say it's all the  Fed's fault, but it's certainly  appropriate to shine a light on  their inappropriate prosecution.  And I just think it's a great  loss for all of us.  It's very sad.  I think one of the things we can

Start time: 1503.14
End time: 1542.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  take away, and there are an  interesting couple of things  that are happening.  So academics are starting to  post PDFs of their own  material and open sourcing it  and put it on Twitter so it's  sort of like a tribute to make  some information free.  But I think one of the other  things that we can really take  away from this is, and kind of  a serious and slightly grim  note, is that mental health and  depression is something that  affects a lot of people.  It affects a lot of people in  the geek and nerd community.  Many of us kind of laugh it off  as being a little bit antisocial  because I'm a bit of a geek.  But I think we all have a little  bit of responsibility just to  try and look after the people  that are near us and try and  say, try and get people to get  help if they need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now Larry points out that Aaron  had many friends in San Francisco  and he was beloved by many.  He was not somebody who was cut  off from society.  So I don't want to even speculate  on what happened.  The expert witness who was going  to testify on his behalf, Alex  Stamos, who is a computer  security and forensic expert,  called the case vindictive.  He said that Aaron did not hack  the JSTOR website.  He just wrote for any reasonable  definition of hack.  He wrote a handful of basic  Python scripts that discovered  the URLs of articles and used  curl to request them.  He did not use parameter tampering.  He did not break a captcha.  He did not do anything sneaky.  He did not cover his tracks or  hide his activity.  The government provided no  evidence that these downloads  caused a negative effect on  either JSTOR or MIT.  It's very sad.

Transcript:  Beyond the tragedy of losing  someone who was so intelligent,  who was a visionary, who was  actually fighting for the free  information rights of anyone  who has ever used an electronic  resource, I think there is  another story here which is how  desperate the DOJ and the federal  government is to have some sort  of strong case that establishes  their version of copyright and  property laws in the digital  domain.  We saw it with the defeat of  SOPA and PIPA.  We saw it with the bungled  prosecution of Kim.com and Mega  Upload, and we see it here.  And they are so desperate for a  win that I think that's where  that bully attitude comes into.  We want to make an example out  of you.  There is also a fear of  technology that drives a little

Transcript:  We've only got to look at the  composition of the congressional  science committee which is full  of people who don't believe in  science.  They don't like science.  That's evil.  So I think again, it's one of  those things where I feel like  changes in some of these cases is  generational, that you get a new  generation of lawmakers or a new  generation of people in power,  in government, in society, and  attitudes change along with that  but there's always the guys that  want to go down kicking and  screaming on the way out.  This is just horrible.

Transcript:  It is horrible.  So Brewster Kale of Archive.org,  Carl Malamud who is the  transparent government activist  and others have created an  electronic Aaron Schwartz  collection on Archive.org.  The web team of the Internet  Archive writes Brewster have been  archiving all the Aaron SW sites  they're finding.  Aaron has quite a few.  And if you have some digital  archives, email, photos, code,  the Aaron Schwartz collection is  right now going up on  Archive.org slash details slash  Aaron SW.  I think this is a wonderful idea  to save all this stuff.  And interesting things happening  on Twitter.  Have you seen the PDF protest?  An anonymous has gotten behind  this which is kind of interesting.  If you search for, what is it,  PDF, PDF, PDF, PDF, PDF,  PDF, PDF, PDF, PDF, PDF,  PDF, PDF, PDF, PDF, PDF,  PDF, PDF, PDF, PDF, PDF.  I can't remember if it's protest.  Academics are posting links to  PDFs, I'm sorry, PDF tribute is  the hashtag.  Look at PDF tribute.  The first post is from anonymous,  please share academics posting  their papers online and tribute  to Aaron Schwartz using the  hashtag PDF tribute.  So they're uploading in some  cases illegally because they  don't own the rights to it.  Academic articles that should be  part of the commons because this  is something we all need to know  and then they're posting it on  Twitter.  Freeing the information.  Freeing the information.  I think that's a really wonderful  tribute to him too.  Good going and if you're a  researcher or a scientist and you  want to do this in honor of Aaron  please do.  I've never met him, I don't know  him.  I know many people who did know  him including Corey and Larry  and Dave Weiner, many people, Doc  Searls.  Doc has a picture of him at 14  with Dave Weiner in the background  writing RSS spec.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know what's interesting is he  could have just taken what he knew  and his talent and he could have  just amassed himself a personal  fortune.  He could have cashed out.  He could have totally went like  the route that we see today where  people become superstars and they  can trade on their money and  their name for all sorts of  favors and he didn't.  He actually became very proactive  in making sure that he held on to  his beliefs despite all the stuff  that happened to him.  I think what's so amazing is that  what's kind of sad besides the  suicide is that he is a rather  rare individual in that respect.  It would be one thing to say if  there were literally thousands of  Aaron's swatches around but  they're not.

Start time: 1861.97
End time: 1945.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Here's a picture that Doc posted  from an O'Reilly conference in  2002 when Aaron was 15.  That's Dave Weiner in the  background.  It was the same year Doc says I  booked him for a panel at Comdex  in Las Vegas.  His mom dropped him off.  His computer was an old Mac laptop  with a broken screen that was so  dim I couldn't read it but he  could and he rationalized it as a  security precaution.  This was a very smart, very  precautious kid and we're very  sorry to have lost him.  So I just wanted to, I thought it  was really important that we talk  about this.  You can read a lot more if you  just search for Aaron Swartz,  S-W-A-R-T-Z on the internet.  There's just a ton of stuff out  there.  It's a sad story.  We had reported on the JSTOR story  several times and talked about it  but just for it to end this way.  Two years to the day by the way  of his arrest.  So imagine after two years, he was  facing not 50, 30 years in  prison.  That's not a lot better.  When you're 26, 30 years in  prison he would be my age when he  got out.  That's like the worst thing that  could happen to a 26 year old.  Being Leo's age.  Oh my God, I'm practically dead.  Let's talk about CES.  It seems so trivial, doesn't it?  Speaking of practically dead.

The press is lazy, not us, but  this was your assignment.  I said you're going to the very  first CES event, CES Unveiled,  which apparently had a dearth of  products.  It did have Gallagher though.

I was too.  And I ran into Leo over at the  food court and I said this to  Leo.  I went to the LG, the Panasonic  and the Sharp, oh no, the  Toshiba keynotes.  And one thing that I noticed  about all of them is like  literally half their news  presentations were dedicated to  new appliances.  Refrigerators.  Refrigerators.  Microwaves.  Washing machines.  And I went to the food court  and I said, well, I'm going to  go to the food court and I  went to the food court and I  went to the food court and I  went to the food court and I  was like, oh my God, you're  going to be on TV and you're  going to be in a TV show,  and they're going to be on  TV and they're going to be on  TV.  Refrigerators.  Refrigerators.  Microwaves.  Washing machines.  New convection, microwave,  combination ovens.  And they were all touting some  sort of interactive cross  platform with Bluetooth or RFID  and your phone.  It's like you come up to your  washing machine, pass your  phone over by the detector and  it will tell you how to wash  your clothes.  Why don't you set the dials  like you normally do and press  start?  They're literally finding  excuses for the new  technology.  They're finding excuses to  literally drop all this R&D and  all this stuff that they've  developed that they can't really  move anymore because everyone's  bought the HDTVs.  Everyone has a title.  Everyone has a phone.  And they're trying to drum up  excitement to get kind of  consumers buying it.  And people are saying, well,  look, I'm tapped out.  I really don't need it.  And there's really nothing that  special about it.  I mean, 4K TVs look awesome.  They're great.  Not enough content.  I know there are movies coming  out.  There are movies that were shot  in 4K that you can go to and  there are movies that were shot  in 4K that you can put on it.  But are you going to really spend  $12,000 to upgrade from your  HDTV right now when the amount  of content that is in that?  But that's not the point.

The point about CES is that it's  the stuff that you're going to  see mainstream in 12, 18, 24  months.  You can't say that there's no  content now.  So it's not kind of useful.

I think one of the trends that  comes out of CES this year is  that increasingly the big  companies that have got really  big stuff.  They do their own thing.  They're doing their own thing.  But if you look at, you know,  big picture thing about what's  happened in the last year,  you've got, you know, SpaceX  blasting off into space.  You've got Tesla delivering the  first all-electric sedan.  You've got all, you know,  incredible amount of innovation.  Oh, yeah, there's lots of  interesting stuff.  If you're going to see CES,  mostly what you're seeing is  amazing televisions, some nice  tablets, some nice laptops, and  some fridges with everything.

So I spend a lot of time in the  Venetian, a lot of time in the  south hall where I get to see  technologies that are in their  rawest form, like, you know,  flexible displays and curved  displays and haptic feedback  that could be used for something  later on.

And as you say, Microsoft, Apple,  Samsung all announced their big  products at their own events, not  at CES.  But you can't see the TV's this  year's and maybe next year's TV  unless you go to CES.  And I have to say, 4K Ultra HD  looks great.  It looks awesome.  Even better, Ultra HD OLED.  Yeah, that's Sony OLED.  Looks freaking amazing.  I can't wait to see that.  So I have to say, I do believe  there is some stuff there that's  innovative and interesting.  And the price came down.

For instance, maybe you want to  trade an iPad 3 for an iPad 4.  You want to get a new phone.  Maybe you've got an iPhone 5.  I'd like to get a Galaxy Note.  You can get cash for your old  gadgets.  I know a lot of us just throw  these gadgets in a drawer.  Wait a minute.  Now, here's my iPhone 5.  It's in flawless condition.  And it's $430, Gazelle.  Now, this is a beauty thing.  This is a hard offer from Gazelle.  As long as it matches the  condition that I specified.  I have 30 days to cash in on it.  So, I can wait.  In fact, it's a good idea to go  to gazelle.com right now.  Get quotes for your stuff.  And maybe you're waiting for the  next thing to come out.  You can get that quote and that  quote is good.  30 days.  Free shipping on anything worth  more than a buck.  And then fast payment.  They'll send you a check.  You get a PayPal credit.  Or I like this, the Amazon gift  card, which gives you 5% more  when you take that, the Amazon.  If you buy a new iPhone, you  can buy a lot of stuff on Amazon.  You might as well do that.  They are data experts who also  wipe the data so you don't have  to worry about that.  iPads, iPhones, Android phones,  even BlackBerrys.  You know, this is an exercise in  futility, but I'm just wondering  if I can get anything for that  AT&T BlackBerry curve I have.  You want to take a guess how  much that curve is worth?  Five bucks?  Ten bucks?  Ten bucks.  Let's see.  It's in flawless shape because I  never used it.  It's free of water damage.  Let's just see.  Hey, that's not bad.  I'll take $66.  Are you kidding me?  I'll take $66.  So you throw it in a box.  They pay the postage.  In fact, what happens is you get  all this stuff together and then  you say, okay, go.  And they'll mail you the box and  the mailing label and everything  so you don't have to pay  shipping.  iPods, MacBooks, even Mac Minis,  Mac Pros, and iMacs.  I actually now have my new iMac.  Maybe I should send them the old  iMac.  Gazelle.com.  They have sent out to date more  than $50 million to over 300,000  customers.  That is a great deal.  Find out what your iPhone or  other device is worth.  Get some cash to buy the next  one or just to pay rent.  Gazelle.com.

But what's so great about it, if  you actually haven't seen these  things, they're super tiny.  They're beautiful.  They're about...  Oh, wait.  Yeah, you have one on screen.  They are powered by AMD chips  with embedded GPUs on the core.  Yeah, I priced one out just to

Start time: 3760.16
End time: 3784.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, that's the big question,  Mark, because AMD has  traditionally trailed Intel when  it's come to out and out  performance.  But one of the things that XI3  was doubting was because, you  know, it's literally GPU on die  and the rest, the power usage is  so low.  He was...  On one of the lower usage models  of their entry-level unit was  about, I think, 13...  No, 14 watts and then 18 at max.

Transcript:  So, I mean, the exciting thing  is that whatever this Steam box  ends up being, Valve is trying  to develop, you know, basically  you know, Steam has become sort  of ubiquitous PC development  platform, trying to put that on  a little box underneath your TV  in the same way that an Xbox or  a PlayStation might live.

Start time: 3812.02
End time: 3832.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I've been very excited about  this for a couple of years.  I've been playing with this  Steam...  What do they call it?  Big Picture.  It looks great.  It's an easy to use, you know,  big TV interface.  But what you'd get is PC games  and in theory for roughly the  price of a PS3 or an Xbox 360,  you'd get PC gaming via Steam  on your big screen TV.  And what they're saying is that

Start time: 3833.06
End time: 3844.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the Valve software for the new  whatever it is they develop will  actually come on a box that's  powerful enough to power multiple  screens so you can have  multiple-player gaming on multiple  screens off a single unit.

Start time: 3854.59
End time: 3872.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But really, I don't know how  much that is going to be a  driver.  Just the idea that I get a three  or four hundred dollar box, put  it in my living room, HDMI it  into my big screen TV, comes with  a controller, sit back and play  the best quality games because  frankly console gaming is a  little bit stuck in the doldrums  because it's been so long since  the last update.  And I think that's a good

Start time: 3872.90
End time: 3893.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  thing.  I think what's so great about it  is now you actually do have a  very compelling home theater PC  device, something that isn't  ungainly or awkward to plug.  These are beautiful.  They're really small and they're  very innocuous.  I mean you could literally stay...  Even if you say you lived in a  smallish apartment, you could put  one near your HDTV and you could  run all your media through it.  They've got a VESA mounting

Start time: 3894.88

Transcript:  So having said that I thought it  was a really exciting idea, I'm  actually... I think it's  interesting and I think it's  innovative.  I think it's completely useless.  What? Why?  Which is that I just don't see...  If the last decade of home  theater PC building as tall as  anything is that nobody really  cares about building home theater  PCs.  Yeah, you're right.  They like Xboxes, they like PS3.  Look at the Windows Media Center.  Windows Media Center that's been  killed off in Windows 8.  Died.  The Windows home theater PC  server thing that sat in server  media over the house.

I've already bought a lot of  games via it.  I mean I love Steam and I think  it's a big... I don't know how  many members of Steam has but  that's a big player in the big  PC market.  Bringing it to the home theater  might be a different...

I mean Nvidia, if you went to  the Nvidia press conference they  unveiled Project Shield which  was a space... basically an  Android handheld gaming device  powered by the new Tegra 4 chip.  Right.  Now yeah, ho hum, Android gaming  neither here nor there.  But what was interesting is that  they showed off a functionality  that allowed you to stream from  your gaming PC to your PC  through the device to your TV  using the controller, Steam big  picture.  So any game that would run off  your gaming PC whether it  requires the GP or whatever could  be streamed like OnLive does or  did.  Right.

Start time: 4015.60
End time: 4058.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think that was actually the  big story in gaming and it was  really centered around the  Nvidia booth and the Nvidia  grid.  It's a concept that we've been  using in enterprise for a while.  The idea of massively  distributed power.  You could have these huge racks  of servers.  In their case they're using the  GPUs to do a lot of calculations  incredibly quickly.  And rather than having games for  this platform and games for that  platform you have the game which  can then be run to basically any  device you have which I think it  kind of takes away the importance  from really powerful miniature  computers when I can now have a  tablet or a desktop or a laptop  or a Chromebook all have the same  gaming experience because all the  hard processing is being done  upstream somewhere.

Transcript:  But that's what I think you're  talking about.  Being able to do that within your  own network.  So you've got the grid for when  you have access to the Internet.  But if you're only within your  house you can use the exact same  technology, the exact same  licensing to run a really high  performance game off your PC but  on your television.

Transcript:  I don't know that people, I mean  again I'm coming back one of my  other themes of CES is like the  increasing DPCification of PCs  and IT and technology right.  We've seen last quarter I think  there was an NPD thing came out  last week which is the first  holiday quarter that PC cells  have declined.  And we're seeing people buying  tablets.  I think you've got to blame  Windows 8 for that.  People buying tablets, people  buying iPods, people buying  stuff to do their computing on  that are not PCs.  And the idea of streaming  something from a PC to another  device implies that you're going  to have the PC in the first  place.  And I think looking out 18, 24,  36, 48 months we're just going  to see PC cells continue to  nosedive in favor of tablets.

Start time: 4128.40
End time: 4162.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean if you think about the  beginning of that was essentially  when people started picking up  laptops over desktop PCs because  it's a turnkey solution.  Your display is connected.  You don't need to plug anything  in.  It's convenience over power.  Exactly.  And you know it's I think it's  like home networking.  A lot of devices have become  DPCified if that's a correct  term and becoming more  appliances.  So why couldn't you have what  used to take up a huge server  case and just put it into a  giant box that you stick in the  corner, plug in one cord for  power and you know wirelessly  connect and have it do the same  thing.

Transcript:  The thing that I think really  kind of struck online was just  they couldn't carry any kind of  first tier games.  They carried games that were out  six months after they've been  released on everything else so  why would you?  I could rent a game for Xbox or  PS3 or Wii or Wii U off Gamefly  get in the mail, finish it up in  a month and then send it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There were also issues of the  economy of the server side  because you have to build up  enough server capacity to handle  a huge crowd and they said they  never had more than 1500 people  using it.  What killed them was scale.

Start time: 4228.03
End time: 4249.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They couldn't scale.  Because they had to build out  their own infrastructure but  here's the difference.  Here's the difference between  when online started and right  now and that is I can actually  buy computing power from a colo  somewhere.  I don't have to build anything.  Well for me.  Exactly.  EC2.  I can do it on demand.  I can say well I'm going to have  from this much to this much  needed at any time of the day  and you're only going to charge  me for it.

Transcript:  Amazon's elastic computing and  then of course Microsoft's  and Rackspace and others are  doing this too.  It really does change the  equation.  It's computing power on demand.  I don't know why online didn't  use that.  Because the latency.  It was too far away.

Start time: 4261.62
End time: 4270.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because Amazon's software stack  is going to be configured to  delivering web services not  gaming and the whole latency  equation is completely out of  line.  You need to optimize for

Transcript:  Java thing.  First a word from our friends at  Citrix who actually this does  run on Java.  I should point out but it does  it in a very safe and sane way  because you're not getting the  you're getting it from Go to  Meeting.  The folks at Citrix really know  what they do.  One of the reasons they use Java  is because it means they can  work on anything.  Actually you know maybe it does  it because now it works on the  iPhone and the iPad which don't  support Java.  It works on Android devices.  Go to Meeting allows you to hold  meetings pretty much anywhere.  Nowadays that kind of  convenience and flexibility is  not going to be a problem.  The  The promise of the digital  generation was all about being  able to leave work early, being  able to work from anywhere,  seeing clients and colleagues in  full high definition crystal  clear video.  It is amazing.  That's the HD faces.  You can be more productive.  You can work smarter.  You'll spend less time at the  office.  When you're traveling you know  you whip out your iPhone, your  iPad.  You can even present from an  iPad now which is great.  It will use the kids and you  can see them wherever you are  whenever you need to.  Go to Meeting free for 30 days.  I think it uses Java.  Maybe I misspoke.  Go to Meeting.com.  I think it does.

But that's fine because you're  using an app that you've  downloaded and you're going to  run it and it's Java.  What the problem is and what  the Department of Homeland  Security is warning people  about is Java in your browser.  Apparently another zero day  exploit in Java 7, the latest  version of Java, that means  that a hacker can take over your  system.

Transcript:  Are you sure DHS isn't just  worried about the vast amount  of man hours being wasted in  Minecraft?  It could be.

Start time: 4436.60
End time: 4510.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It could be.  They say this is great.  They say not to uninstall it but  merely to go into your browser  and we've been, Steve Gibbons  has been saying this on security  now for ages and disable browser  Java.  Now the good news if you're  using Chrome or Safari at least  and I don't know how Firefox  and IE do it, it will say before  it runs Java it will say hey,  this site wants to run Java on  your machine.  Is that okay?  And you have to say allow  explicitly.  Of course a lot of people  probably just go yeah, yeah,  whatever.  Sure, go ahead.  But there's a weakness in Java  7 that could allow the  installation of arbitrary  software on a machine.  The DHS says there's attacks  happening right now in the wild  and they're advising you to  disable it.  You have to disable Java in your  browser.  It's kind of complicated to do  in Google Chrome but the good  news is in Chrome it warns you  anyway.  So I guess the advice to our  viewers who are smart and  sophisticated is when you get  warned that Java is about to run  you might want to think about  what, from whom and why.  And if you're playing Minecraft  that's okay.  If you're doing GoToMeeting  that's okay but you might not  want to do it on hacker.com.  And...

So the idea is you've got a 30  pin cable, you've got micro USB  and you've got mini USB all on  this single cable, which is kind  of cool.  But the problem is, and Apple  really kind of screwed everybody  on this, lightning, and  lightning is proprietary,  expensive because it has a  protection chip built into it.  And so far they've kind of shown  some reluctance to license it.  There was a Kickstarter project  of a all-in-one battery that had  a lightning on it, or didn't  have it, but they wanted it to.

See, one of the things a lot of  people have said, they pooh-pooh  the idea of 4K because they  say, oh no, you need a giant  screen to see the difference or  you need to sit very close.  And I disagree.  I think surprisingly, and you  only know when you see it, 4K  even on a small screen actually  is noticeably different.  I'm not sure why.  It's not like your eyes are  screwed.

And it was too real.  Wow.  It was really incredibly real.  I didn't see that.  And that's part of the Ultra HD  spec is both 4 and 8K.  So I also asked people about  whether we're going to get  content in 4K.  And a lot of people I was  surprised said, yeah, no, don't  worry about it.  There will be.  And Netflix did a 4K streaming  demo that they did I think was  Sharp or LG.  No, really.  Wow.  I don't know who has that  bandwidth yet.

Right.  But it's also about allowing  people to connect with people in  a really sort of emphatic way.  So if I was holding an event, for  example, that I really wanted my  friends to definitely know they  were invited to, I could pay  seven bucks and have it pinned  to the top of their wall so that  when they next log into Facebook,  they could say, hey, Will's got  this event and he really, really,  really wants you to come to it.

Transcript:  our friends at Carbonite.com  online.  Backup done.  Mac or PC, if you need to get it  back, you need to get Carbonite.  Carbonite backup solves the big  problem of backing up.  First of all, it's got to be  automatic.  If you have to remember it, you  aren't going to do it.  You can have every USB key in the  world and you're still not going  to remember to do it.  It also has to be continuous so  that if you make a change to a  document, it immediately gets  backed up.  If it only backs up once a week,  what happens on day six and your  hard drive crashes, you've lost  six days' worth of work.  So automatic, continuous.  Now, I would submit it's great  to have backups to USB keys if  you can find what you're looking  for or an external hard drive.  But you also should have off-site  backup because if the worst  happens, a fire or an earthquake,  somebody steals all your stuff,  you've got to be able to get it  back and get it back.  And only off-site is going to  solve that.  You can encrypt it on the way.  Of course, it's automatically  encrypted with SSL, but you can  even encrypt it privately if you  want.  Trust no one encryption.  Only you have the key.  And by the way, one of the things  I really like, you can see your  data any time.  Just log onto your Carbonite  account on any computer, even if  you've never used it before, or  they have the iPad and smartphone  apps.  It's $59 a year per computer,  less than five bucks a month.  That's real peace of mind.  Go to carbonite.com.  Use our offer code TWIT.  You'll get two bonus months, 14  months at the price of $12 when  you decide to buy.  Carbonite.com.  Use TWIT as the offer code.  You don't need a credit card,  just the offer code TWIT.  We're big fans of Carbonite.  Highly recommended.  Highly recommended.  All right, last chance.  Anything else from CES that you  just have to, you think has just  got to mention?

I'm very tempted to do an  experiment.  Last night the NBC nightly news  covered this Java flaw.  And they, without permission, I'm  not complaining, used a clip of  me explaining it.  They just pulled it from our  channel.  They said, you know, nationally  syndicated tech journalist Leo  Laporte explained to his  listeners how to disable Java  and they show a little clip of  me.  But what if I play that clip on  the show with the surrounding  NBC content on this show?  Will they pull?  Take down notice.  I will.

But there's another thing I  really liked about it.  Television coverage of technology  has really improved  significantly.

I didn't mention actually the  story that worries me the most.  And I almost am tempted not to  mention this.  I'm nervous to mention this.  There is a patent troll out  there.  At least I think they're...  I don't know.  Maybe they're not a patent  troll who claims that they have  patented podcasting.  They apparently...  I remember this.  They sued Apple a little while  ago.  It's called Personal Audio LL  C. And they claim they invented  podcasting in 1996.  They have a patent which was  granted to them last year.  And a system for disseminating  media content representing  episodes in serialized sequence.  They sued and beat Apple.  Got a judgment of $8 million.  They've entered licensing  agreements now with Sirius,  Arcos, Koby, RIM, Samsung,  Amazon, and Motorola.  They're now suing two of the  biggest podcasters.  Adam Carolla and How Stuff  Works.  Now, we asked for a comment from  either of them.  And both of them probably at the  advice of their lawyers said we  aren't going to talk about this.  We're not going to say a word.  And I'm a little nervous about  that.  I would like to say...  Because I know we'll get a  lawsuit next, right?  Or channel flip.  Somebody will be offered.  Somebody.  And what I would like to see the  Internet, the podcast community  do is band together and loudly  fight this.  So it does make me a little bit  nervous.  They sue in East Texas because  that supposedly is a place that's  quite favorable to these patent  lawsuits.  Personal audio says they invented  this stuff back in 1996 or 95.  All I can say is it makes, as  somebody who does create content  for the Internet, this would be a  devastating blow if we had to  license it.  It would be a devastating blow if  we had to license this stuff.  If we got sued by these guys.  I don't know if we could even  afford to defend ourselves.  And we certainly couldn't pay the  kind of money that Apple ended up  paying.  It would put us out of business.  And it could put, frankly,  podcasting out of business.  So I just wanted to raise your  awareness about this.  Certainly I think what would  happen if we did get sued is we'd  come to our audience and ask for  your help.  We've asked...  I would love to help Adam and how  things work.  But I think they both decided  that it would be best to stay  quiet.  And I hope not settle, but  perhaps even settle.

And by the way, we talked about  Aaron Swartz who helped write the  code for Reddit.  Sometimes is I think incorrectly  credited as being a Reddit  co-founder.  Reddit founder Alex Ohanian joins  us Wednesday on triangulation.  I'll certainly we'll talk about  Aaron because I'm sure he'll have  much to say.  That'll be Wednesday at 10 p.m.  Eastern time on Twitter.  Thanks for joining us.  We'll see you next week.  Another twit is in the can.
