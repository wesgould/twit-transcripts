Transcript:  Well speaking of price we know a  little bit about how much Google  has made on Android and other  things from the Oracle Google  lawsuit. Google's not happy  about this. It's among other  things disclosed this is the  lawsuit over Java. Google paid  Apple a billion dollars in 2014  in one year to keep Google as the  default search provider for iOS.  Not much to Apple but still a  billion dollars is a billion  dollars. Yeah but I mean good

Start time: 349.40
End time: 362.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  deal for Google as well because  they're going to make more than  that out of it. I've got to say  Apple when it comes to doing  their contract negotiations must  be a bit sort of yeah OK another  billion here but a billion there  sooner or later it adds up to  real money. I wonder if Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  search on that they're they're  going to be confused and just  switch the default to Google  anyways so they may as well just  say OK fine a billion that's not  that much. You're going to make  10 billion on this over the  course of a year. It'll be  interesting though because  Google's business is I think  already has or will soon shift to  be more mobile than more than  not mobile. Right. And at that  point Apple might be able to  charge a lot more because they'll  realize how crucial that is to  Google's overall business. I'm

Start time: 412.54
End time: 433.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  looking at an article from 2014  about talking about iOS 8 and OS  10. Of course this is you know  two years ago must Apple will let  you ditch Google search for  Duck Duck Go.

Transcript:  we learned that in the life in  the lifetime of Android Google  has generated thirty one billion  dollars in revenue. So Android  has been a profitable enterprise  twenty two billion of that  profit. Not sure what the other  nine billion went to but maybe I  think it's a good thing. Yeah.  So if you're writing and  supporting Android where did  the money come from. Well it  says it makes money for Google  in two ways advertisements on  Android phones and then of  course the Google Play Store

Start time: 495.02
End time: 508.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the revenue so it's not an  insignificant amount. No I mean  good Microsoft makes a  significant amount of money out  of Android as well because it's  managed to grab gather enough of  a patent pile that it can  actually sort of say you know  big thick pile of patents here  if it went to court that could  be very expensive so when he

Start time: 509.94
End time: 523.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  rumor was for a while and I don't  think anybody knows the exact  amount although maybe they've  been revealed as this has in  court documents but the last I  heard was five bucks per Android  handset which that would add up  they're making a lot more on  Android than they're making on  Windows Phone. They're making a  lot more than phone  manufacturers are making out of

Start time: 524.04
End time: 529.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Android as well. It's but yeah  Windows Phone it's sweet but  you know. Lest you believe that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a twenty two billion dollar  profit mean is meaningful nine  to five Mac immediately jumped  into the fray. Benjamin Mayo  writing well Apple made more  from an iPhone in a single  quarter than Google's made in  all of Android history that

Start time: 544.10
End time: 559.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  headline that's so stupid. Yeah  because because this is talking  about device hardware and yeah  it's completely different. You  have to add in how much Samsung  how much every phone maker you  know makes up selling Android  phones if you really want to  compare it apples to apples. Oh  that's terrible. It was

Start time: 561.05
End time: 564.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  inevitable though wasn't it. We  knew that will happen would  happen at some point. Yeah but I

Start time: 566.19
End time: 569.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  think that comparison is so  silly. Oh this is one of the

Start time: 569.14
End time: 576.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  side effects one of the negative  side effects of these lawsuits  that fly around Silicon Valley  is what gets revealed in  discovery. Why are you saying

Start time: 578.33
End time: 583.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  it's a side effect. And why is  it bad. Well I think you know I  think about the Apple Samsung

Start time: 584.16
End time: 596.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  lawsuit. Apple sued Samsung and  yet so much was revealed about  Apple's process. That I think  Apple might have come to regret  that lawsuit even though they  got some huge amount of money in  the settlement. I'm not so sure

Start time: 597.99
End time: 646.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  there was that much revealed and  even if it did nobody can  replicate what they do as a  collective right. I think there  is a lot which is made out of  the whole oh you know Apple  details are out secrets are out  it still is Apple doing what  Apple does and yeah doing what  Google does and this is just you  know part of the process that  the cost of doing business I  like that all these lawsuits are  happening because it keeps  reporters busy and you know they  got something interesting to  report on. Yeah and as  otherwise they will write those  clickbait articles like you know  one quarter revenue versus all  of Android. So there you go I  think it just is better if you  have details. Well I completely  agree but you know maybe and

Start time: 647.97
End time: 666.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  maybe this is from the outside  maybe a misunderstanding but one  feels like there's almost a  Apple has some sort of visceral  aversion to anybody knowing  anything about what goes on  inside one infinite loop and it's  just like they were oh my god  they found out that we have a  design team oh my god. That's

Start time: 666.44
End time: 670.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  not just Apple though that's the  case at I mean I don't cover

Start time: 670.44
End time: 701.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apple as closely as I cover  Google and Facebook but they are  equally as controlling a  public sector. I mean I think  they're equally as controlling about  what kinds of information there  they do more outreach because they  want you know positive stories and they  want stories to be told about what  they're doing and they want their  innovation to be praised but they  if there's some I mean they're still  very controlling and very protective  of the kind of information that gets out  and the best stuff is always from  leaks or you know from lawsuits like

Start time: 701.54
End time: 706.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this. Who is the most open Silicon  Valley company? You.  You guys find easiest to cover?

Start time: 707.68
End time: 730.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The smallest ones because they're  desperate to be covered so they'll share stuff  like the more the bigger you are the  more at stake there is and the less  benefit you have from talking to a  reporter and having some executive say  something stupid or that's taken out of context  like or something that could  end up helping one of your competitors  they the bigger and more powerful  you are the less you know motivation  you have to be transparent.

Start time: 731.64
End time: 747.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah I think that's very true I mean we  have a lot of people they their entire  pre-hours strategy for the last ten years  has been don't tell anyone anything unless  that we know that they're a friend of ours  a lot of other companies have hooked up onto that  as well so yeah you're right smaller the  company the more open they are about talking about

Start time: 753.80
End time: 773.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to be gained by talking to the press period.  Then you've got to ask yourself what  is your job because there are  4.2 PR people for every  country. Well that's why they don't say that.  But I mean I can understand  there's the crafting the message side of it  but you know informing  the press to inform the populace would  strike me as kind of the PR.

Start time: 773.84
End time: 779.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why should the populace know anything at all?  The populace should get  everything it needs from advertising.

Start time: 780.14
End time: 785.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah because you know when somebody actually has  to pay money to try and convince you to buy a product  that means it must be really worth buying.

Start time: 786.59
End time: 864.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  May I actually make one  point here as somebody  who's no longer part of the business  I will say that  the way tech  media has become today  you step away and you realize  that actually you don't need it very much.  I think the noise  which passes  as news is becoming so  high that it is actually  pretty strange that  we actually focus  on anything meaningful anymore.  I think that is the bigger challenge.  I think most of the media people  the PR people have done a great job  of focusing  attention away from real news to noise  and I think  people are writing about  internet.org  as if it's the second coming of Jesus  and what essentially it is  is like  a ploy to kind of  have  insidious control over  what seems to be the internet  for the rest of the planet and  most of the press is not covering  that angle they are covering  what is the easier PR accessible angle  on that story  and I think that's what I mean is that  all of it is just noise now.  I think very few people are actually  digging into deeper stories  anymore.

Start time: 870.97
End time: 877.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think I may be the only person  who keeps talking about this.  You know whistling in the wind.  No, in fact

Start time: 878.75
End time: 906.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am going to play the opposite  just because I want to hear  because I understand  what you're saying internet.org which is  Facebook's initiative to bring  internet access to developing  nations where they don't presumably  I would assume where they don't have any internet  access at all but it's very  it's a weird kind of it's not really internet access  it's access to Facebook  but not just Facebook it's also  Wikipedia  it's additional stuff

Start time: 908.42
End time: 911.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Facebook approved stuff.  But Wikipedia is

Start time: 912.34
End time: 916.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's not just like certain parts of Wikipedia  that Facebook likes it's the whole Wikipedia right?

Start time: 917.13
End time: 955.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No Google, no Twitter  you know things which  which fit into the  it's like their idea of what  is the internet and  my issue with this whole  you know thing is  is that okay if you want to  do you know connect people  and give them access to Facebook  approved access  don't call it internet.org  call it Facebook.org  this is you know it's disingenuous  to call it internet.org  because Facebook is not internet  and to call it  internet.org is actually  you know the first sin  of the whole thing.

Start time: 956.62
End time: 962.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Didn't they change the name of it though?  No they haven't.  They changed it to Free Basics?

Start time: 962.56
End time: 1075.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Free Basics but it's internet.org  Free Basics it's like  okay no just change  the name of the organization  completely and I think we have to  look at this from a very  from a cultural standpoint right?  Look at in the pre industrial  early industrialization  when industrial revolution happened  the East India  Company was  the spearhead of the British Empire in a way  that they controlled  the two most important  commodities you needed  like for  economic growth one was labor  and the other was actual  commodities. In the post  internet age attention  and connectivity  are the two limiting  factors to economic growth so  by controlling those  points what you're looking at  is Facebook is trying to control  what will happen in the future.  I think people look at it and just say  no this is  just the internet but  if Facebook a logarithm can decide  who wins the elections let's say  in Egypt or in India or wherever  that is not a good situation to have  they never address those  issues directly they don't  address the insidious  nature of internet.org  and its impact on local  governments and local population  so I understand  that they are trying to do good by  giving access to people but  I don't think it's as simple  as that this is all about  about advertising making  money and decisions which will be made  based on how Facebook makes  more money in the future. Right now  you can say whatever you want  but  I draw the parallel between  what was the  East India Company and I think Facebook is trying  to do somewhat the same thing  in my opinion.

Start time: 1076.94
End time: 1139.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You raise a good point you have standing to raise this  you're Indian you know India far better  than I do but  isn't it  the choice between this and nothing  at all and I look at some  the free basics platform does  allow people  to supply and become part of it  and I look at now admittedly these are provided  by Facebook that says stories  by a women's health support network  that sees 71% of its traffic  from free basics they're providing  women's health information  baby centers reach  3.4 million people with information for  pregnancy and parenting through free basics alone  these are people who wouldn't  get this information  otherwise  I agree with you I understand the issue of  we don't want one incumbent to control  elections and so forth but they have  I don't have a problem with  being a for profit  you can't say well you shouldn't be  you've got to have this has to be a non-profit  no NGO is standing stepping up  and doing this Facebook is stepping up  and doing it isn't it better to have this than nothing

Start time: 1139.22
End time: 1157.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  at all well they are  here is the thing is you look at most of these countries  they have a very competitive  telecom environment not only that  they actually do have  internet available  to a lot of people much more  at prices which are much lower than what we  pay for in the US so these people

Start time: 1157.42

Start time: 1159.36
End time: 1229.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  people have access to  these technologies so by saying  that Facebook is subsidizing  access to these things doesn't  mean that they are doing the  right thing if they want to subsidize  access to Facebook  just Facebook or  Facebook approved sites they should  do that but that doesn't mean  they should call it internet.org that  doesn't mean they should be using  that as a single play  to access all the information  I think by becoming gatekeepers  of information  there is a much deeper problem they can  cause in the long term  I mean I am absolutely  sure that  you know  this is where the problem is going to happen  in the future and like  we don't know what people are doing  on these things and like who's accessing  all these services  I actually  I would challenge Facebook  to actually how about just  getting one  if you want to do  good for the planet how about  having one clean  source of water  for like every 10,000 people

Start time: 1229.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is he has created an LLC which he has said  will make charitable contributions  but he hasn't actually said that it will  make charitable contributions and Bill Gates  raised exactly this point when  the whole internet thing from Facebook  was announced he said look  if you got a choice between having internet access  and having clean drinking water or the  power to run the device which one are you going to pick?  I'll choose clean water of course

Transcript:  that I thought was really interesting  in Jessie Hempel at Wired  wrote a big feature on this  topic last week  and the one thing that the challenge that she said  that they are having aside from especially in  India like a lot of the push back that they are having  from local people who are saying we don't want your version of  the internet is that in a lot of  remote places people just don't  see the point of wifi they already  have phones they have their data plans  and they don't understand  why they would need to sign up for Facebook's  wifi and so the challenge is actually  adoption so  while we're all freaking out about this now and saying  oh Facebook is  horrible for trying to control the internet  in the end maybe it won't  be a problem because people won't use it.

Transcript:  In India  it's very  controversial I understand and  in fact  the Indian telecom regulatory  authority pulled the plug on  internet.org  while it debates whether  telecom operators should be allowed to offer  different services with variable pricing or whether  net neutrality should be enforced.  Mark Zuckerberg's response  was to write a piece for the Times of India  by billboards, newspaper ads,  television campaign  to promote free basics  couldn't you say that well this is just  anti-competitive malarkey from the  Indian regulatory body  if they want to do something  why don't they step up and do something different?

Transcript:  malarkey. I think what  the point here is that if they want more  people to connect to  Facebook that's fine  they want to subsidize it  that's fine I can't argue against that  look at T-Mobile  is banning access  to YouTube I mean that's  no different than what Facebook wants  to do. I'm perfectly fine with that  they want to pick telcos  to subsidize access  to Facebook  on people's phones  that's an application  whose usage is subsidized by Facebook  great but don't dress it  up as the internet don't dress it up as  you're doing great for  the planet you're doing this for  making more money I'm fine with that  there is nothing wrong with  this being a for-profit venture

Transcript:  call a spade a spade actually I'm  quoting from an article in the register  by a professor  Mark Graham at the Oxford University  internet institute he likens  Facebook's giveaway to Nestle's  free baby formula giveaway in the  70's yeah that's kind

Start time: 1493.76
End time: 1503.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 1503.46
End time: 1525.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  be a bad analogy though because it's one of those  things where you could say Nestle could say  no look we just want to make sure babies are  properly proper nutrition we're giving  a free formula  to people who are very poor  who maybe wouldn't otherwise have  access to this and  what they don't mention of course is it's not a good  alternative to breastfeeding it's not  it's a it's hooks them on

Start time: 1525.54
End time: 1570.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  this product yeah also they would give  away just enough baby food to  first one's free baby to basically  ensure that the mothers stop nursing they lost their milk  and then they had to go to Nestle and then  the prices got jacked up and that's why so many people died  in this case it's not  a life or death situation not quite that bad  no but I can see why  from an internet rights perspective  it gets people really riled up because you are  basically subscribing to the gatekeeper  model the walled garden and whatever Facebook  likes goes on there whatever  they don't like doesn't so it's  I find  it very worrying and I do find it really  annoying that they dress above sort of philanthropic  activity as opposed to  yeah we just really want to wide know wide know  our footprint in what's  going to be a very key market mark zuckerberg  I'm curious though because mark zuckerberg

Transcript:  what you guys think well it's one of the  reasons I'm raising this also because  says we don't cover it enough so I  want to cover it and give you all  a chance to speak out about  it mark zuckerberg writing in the times of india  says what reason is there for  denying people free access to vital  services for communication education  health care employment  farming and women's rights  I think that's a legitimate question  and I want to hear what you guys how you guys answer that  but I think you've done so  and I and you know I mean  it's I think there  is a kind of anti corporate point of view  in some parts of the world  less so in the US but in other parts of the world

Start time: 1640.20
End time: 1673.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  it's not anti corporate point of view  I think what it is is  not you know they're not  he's not being straight  when he talks about this  if he wants clean  like people should have more communication  yes then they should use everything  from whatsapp to kick to  wechat whatever is out there  not just facebook approved  messaging service not facebook approved  if he wants  to subsidize people's internet access  then they should have access to  all the internet not just  facebook approved internet

Transcript:  that's not the end of the world no it's not the end of the world  all I'm saying is if you want to be strictly  fair about it facebook could pay their taxes  in these countries and other countries  and actually give the government the revenue to run  are they not paying taxes in  well facebook's pretty bad i mean google  has just reached a deal this week with  the uk tax authorities whereby they're  paying 130 million dollars  pounds in tax it's not very much  effective tax rate of 2.5%  facebook I think it was facebook last year  in the uk paid 4,000  pounds in corporation  tax because they'd shifted through  things through to other subsidiaries  so I'd take these kind of campaigns  a lot more seriously if the companies  involved actually paid their taxes to let  government do it in an equal handed way  as opposed to just following their personal  corporate agendas

Transcript:  navigating the transition  from what is now  navigating the transition from what it was  to what it wants to be  more effectively than most people  you know is it perfect? probably not  I think if you really  had to decide today  what are the papers you will pay for  right  the Wall Street Journal and New York Times  will be the two names  which will be on pretty much  everyone's short list  like I pay for 5 publications  right now  I pay for the Times print  because I get digital free with it  I pay for the Wall Street Journal  because I get digital free with it  I pay for the Economist  because I get digital free for it  and I pay for the New Yorker  because I actually love the New Yorker  and the 5th publication  is Fast Company  because again I love the publication  so this is like  we have a choice to make  the more  if there was no print publication today  of the Times I would still  pay for the digital version  I think they  have a brand and the quality  and you know  and the strength to withstand  the shift you know  you could never make me pay for USA Today  or Washington Post  not the Washington Post  that's interesting  or not even the SF Chronicle  or anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  so I think  we kind of  underestimate the challenge of going from the past  into the future  but they have made much better efforts  than most people  Washington Post essentially had to  go out of business  in one sense of a word  and then find  a benefactor like Jeff Bezos  and then  start a climb back into relevance  I think that is  I would you know I'm not  I hate on the Times a lot  but I also have a lot of respect for  the kind of journalism they do  and the kind of efforts  they're making to transition out of  the print only world  I think the challenge for them is  how do they deal with the pension plans they have  and all the plants they own  and all the nonsense which  the legacy nonsense they have in the business  I think a million subscriptions  I think other publications can say  they have a million subscribers

Transcript:  and Amazon is looking  I mean Amazon sorry  Bezos is not Amazon it's his own personal investment  but he's looking very hard  at beating the New York Times  where he's Amazon's giving  Prime members  quite a deal on the Washington Post  but I still don't think it's come close to a million  subscribers I don't know  I'll have to check the numbers

Start time: 2742.14

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  so having been in the business  for a long time I would say  you look at what BuzzFeed is doing  BuzzFeed is building the traffic  and then backing into the good journalism  right whereas  the New York Times has the brand  and they are  basically using that brand  and they continue to do  what is good journalism  I think that is the key thing  it's like most of the publishers do not  understand that you know  click baiting things can only be  great for a little while  in the end you're in the business of serving  your readers and you do that  by bringing great journalism  that's exactly what  Washington Post is doing  that is exactly what New York Times is doing  that's exactly what  BuzzFeed is doing

Start time: 2844.48

Transcript:  I think most of the time  people  wait there is a reason why  the publication  the New Republic isn't really getting any readers  it's like they don't have  anything relevant to say to people  who want to read that stuff  the world is different  information on the internet now  I think  Chris was making a great effort  to give some  life to this  patient which has been in coma  forever they have not made money  in close to 20 years  like Maudie Perez  said that  he's never made money  when he owned it he never made  profit on that business  any business which is not making profit  not really being read  why do they exist  I think this is a huge challenge  I think  my argument  on this is actually  I wrote a post called the journalistic  orthodoxy which is  on my blog  I'll plug there

Transcript:  I don't really get the argument  that just because  journalism has to make a profit in order to be worthwhile to do  I mean look at the guardian in the UK  that's been run under a trust it doesn't make a lot of money  it loses a fair amount sometimes  it produces some of the best journalism you'll see

Transcript:  I know Jeff thinks he's going to make money  great picture though of Jeff  flying  his reporter Jason  Rezaian who was of course  held hostage  held in jail I don't know depends on how you  define hostage by Iran in July 2014  and was finally released after  some serious negotiations  Bezos flew his private jet  to Iran to pick him up  I think that's classy  I think that's cool that shows a commitment  he could have sent a drone  to pick him up but no he can't himself

Start time: 3129.77
End time: 3148.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

End time: 3162.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we have systems now thanks to the internet  we have things like Patreon  we have systems for that kind of backing  I think the problem is that  while we all make a big noise about how much we want  journalism nobody is willing to foot the bill  including individuals

Start time: 3163.16
End time: 3194.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah unfortunately people have got far too used  to getting their news for free  and not realising that it does cost money  you can run an advertising  funded internet publication  perfectly profitably  the problem comes when you've got  a whole host of media out there  who don't make a profit  who pays the bills for that  and I think there are  a fair number of examples  where people have taken over  they run these companies as like their private fiefdoms  and they expect their personal opinions pushed  and that's ultimately very bad for journalism

Transcript:  by the way Elm I'm enjoying this  journalistic orthodoxy  but I think what's happened is  there was this period and you talk about this  where it looked like the promise  of the internet would replace  could replace  voices like the new republic  it seems  that that promise  we are disappointed  that the internet has not lived up to its promise  would you not agree Elm?

Transcript:  I think there is a lot of great stuff  you can read on a daily basis  I think just because  I think the time for the new republic  has come and gone  I think it's just moving on  I think there is new public  why are we judging  Buzzfeed  just because it doesn't fit  our idea of what a publication should be  we start judging them  I think there is  people who are actually reading it  there has to be a reason why they read it  and so by dismissing Buzzfeed  we are dismissing the actual people  who want that kind of content

End time: 3310.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that's what people say every time  there is a new publication  I think  the people inside Buzzfeed like to make the comparison  to CNN  and all the ridiculous antics that they  threw out there when they first launched  and everyone is like oh cable news this is awful  oh my god

Transcript:  I think, Leo, if you really think about it  what people at BuzzFeed are doing  is essentially  those headlines  are a way to attract attention  in an environment where  attention is so fractionalized  and we are so  addicted to the dopamine hits  that there is no other way  to attract people  so those headlines are essentially  advertising for what is essentially  often a very good  story, that is the way of the world right now  we cannot call it click bait  I think it is just  attention grabbing  in the 21st century  I think attention grabbing in  the 20th century was  the New York Post or the London Sun  and the headlines they came up with  so I just feel  that we kind of tend to be  very quickly judgmental  about the new media  formats which come out  that's not really true, the media  formats get popular because  they reflect how the world  around them  likes to consume information  blogs became popular  not because blogs were  amazing, they were  but it was easier to consume  information faster  because we had broadband  and I think  you've seen that progress  we are at a point where  Buzzfeed is the normal  if they don't do it they will actually  lose the battle in my opinion

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  no and we should definitely debate it  and talk about the challenges  and what we're giving up when we  agree to do Facebook instant articles  or Google amp  but ultimately I  I think that's the point that most media companies  are going to join it  and agree to it  and get sucked into it  and deal with the consequences later  and then probably in 10 years from now  try to extract themselves  from it  similar to the way  I'm thinking about like  the beginning of the internet  like Time Inc the company that I work for  we had content  AOL had people but no content  and we'll control it all  and then time spent years  trying to extract itself out  and build its own website after that  and that feels like this all over again

Start time: 4794.86
End time: 4810.84

Transcript:  yeah I think that's a very accurate  summation of the situation that we're in at the moment  I mean Facebook has its own  news service  the only news service that they floated at the end of last year as well  I think you're right  it's increasingly people are trying to command the portals now  and I don't think it's good for journalism

Transcript:  well I have to first  disclose that I'm an investor in a company  which provides  similar technology to  companies who want to speed up  their experience  and so  if people want to use Google or Facebook  that's up to them  but there are real world solutions  the company is called twin prime  and I believe  the problem with  the actual  content delivery on the mobile  is a very real problem  and it's not just about ad blocking  I think ad blocking was  actually consumers saying that we will not  be  abused by the publications  and ad networks more than anything else

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  right but if you really  think about  whether it is the Facebook instant articles  or Google AMA  and  some of the technology  we at twin prime have  is that people want  faster access to information on the mobile  the kind of latency they  expect on desktop they want on  mobile as well and the mobile  sites are not  really built like that  there is just too much  clutter too much javascript too much  nonsense

Transcript:  but even the networks themselves  are not very great right like I think there is  there is just one aspect  is the  the actual  websites but then when the app economy  the performance suffers because the networks  are not as  optimal so I think all  this is pointing  to a direction where we need  better ways of offering  you know  access to information and I think  technology companies  are out there I wish  the media companies would take a step back  and say can we do this independently  can we use vendors  who are actually trying to  to make these technologies and not get  sucked into  facebook and google's  silos that's a question  media companies need to ask and I  think that's where it all boils down  to us like how much are they willing to  to you know try  independent things or how much they want to just  get sucked into  those two worlds and just kind of say  well you know they are going to pay for  pay for everything and we are just going to go  for it I think Dave Weiner is writing  some of the best stuff around  this issue right now in my opinion  you should  and everybody should read his blog

Transcript:  to watch  the IAB  the industry group  that  not regulates but tries to basically  unify internet ads and make them all the same  and make them easier to buy  they're sort of like the voice of digital advertising  they're having a real existential crisis  over the adblocker thing  they had a conference last fall  and they invited some people  that are kind of running small websites  and making their livelihood off of these websites  and that have been seriously affected  by adblockers  and they had them testify  as to how much it's hurt their business  and how can we help them  and how can we save them from adblocking  it was just really ironic  because we're sitting here  and it's like you guys are the problem  you created a crappy product that people hate  so much that they're willing to download  a specific tool to avoid it  these are internet users who are pretty lazy  and don't like to pay for things  I feel like they have so much soul searching to do  when it comes to making ads less awful  I have to be honest also

Start time: 5348.84
End time: 5358.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  even before I started using an adblocker  I didn't see those ads  I almost tuned them out intentionally  so I wonder how effective they are  it's a matter of speed

Start time: 5369.00
End time: 5392.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you forget also with a lot of the main adblocker products  adverts do still get through  companies can pay the adblocking company  to allow their adverts  but adblock you're right  that's exactly right  adblock plus  that's their business model  if you have what they call  approved advertising which isn't too intrusive  you can pay them some money and they'll let that through  and I think that's rather disingenuous

Start time: 5392.94

Start time: 5394.98
End time: 5471.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had the guys from adblock plus on  we did an interview with them  we talked a lot about the approved ads program  and I think they defended it  I think they defended it fairly well  saying look we have guidelines  you have to follow the guidelines  you can just give us money  you have to have ads that don't jump out at you  they don't have javascript  there's some reasonable guidelines  I do think it's appropriate to say  black and white no ads versus ads  isn't really enough  it's reasonable to say  there are ads  I go to daring fireball John Gruber's site  he's one of those small bloggers who is probably hurt  he's got one ad on a page  it's a text ad  it's harmless  and I think  there is a reasonable  middle ground where you say  maybe we can allow decent  small unobtrusive ads through  and still support those sites  I pay for google contributor  and one of the nice things about that  by the way that's bigger and bigger all the time  more and more sites I see the contributor blocks on  you can pay up to 10 bucks a month  and then sites that are somehow  opt into this  you won't see more ads on them  no google ads anyway on it  and I have to disable my ad block  and then they split all that revenue

Start time: 5473.24
End time: 5476.41

Start time: 5477.30
End time: 5515.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  well some of that revenue  enough to make it interesting  a lot of sites use it  you know one company that is not  freaking out over ad blocking  ad blocking is our favorite company  buzzfeed because all of their  ads are native  they look just like the content that you're  consuming everywhere  they're kind of genius in this way  they can have a cooking show  and then just have a product placement or an ad  in it at the beginning of their video or at the end  and they don't have to deal with  facebook they don't have to deal with google  they don't have to deal with any ad network whatsoever  they're kind of in control of their own  destiny there which I think is kind of smart

Start time: 5515.95
End time: 5522.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but that's the negative  again another negative side effect is  native content where it's a content  posing, ads posing as content

Start time: 5523.56
End time: 5530.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  yeah that's on debate but they at least  kind of own their  situation and they don't have to worry about people  blocking their ads because it's delicious

Start time: 5531.52
End time: 5549.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so I've turned off my ad blocker  and what I did with contributor is I said  show a kitty cat wherever there would be an ad  so here on recode  and at first you might think recode really  likes cats but in fact that would be  I'm not mad but google contributor  because I pay them some money is going to give  some money to recode and put a kitty cat

Transcript:  on the page  yeah I mean there are plugins I think there used to be a plugin for mozilla  which would every time  there's a british tabloid called the daily mail  every time you clicked on a daily mail link  it would direct you through to a picture of a kitten  because that was much better for your brain than actually  reading a daily mail article

Start time: 5566.75

Start time: 5571.74
End time: 5579.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know that's more maybe they're making more than  they would be from that I don't know but I mean  those ads the cost on these is very low now  because nobody looks at them they don't click on them

Start time: 5579.64
End time: 5595.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it's not a good business anyway so that's kind of what  the ad industry really has to deal with  is like well why are we defending this  business that's declining  in the amount of revenue it brings in  and doesn't work it never worked  and people hate it  it's kind of hard to defend so yeah

Transcript:  part of the story  with so many startups and twitter  especially is that only the founders  the founders feel such deep  affinity for this thing they started  it's their baby and only they can really  save it but  when there's multiple founders  I think it's really hard to give it to one  and push the other out  I see that rivalry  continuing if ev williams eventually  gets kicked off the board

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  not saying it has a big success  rate everyone points to steve jobs  he's the exception  but it is just a really common thing  it's hard for  this happened at reddit  last year too the founder came back  to try to save it  after leaving too early  I just think it's a really  strong draw  if a founder leaves the company and they see something  going wrong it's really hard for them to not want to step in  and fix it  and that's what would happen with dorsey obviously  but ev williams is still there too  I just don't see the two of them  I don't see him exiting gracefully  it does feel like the two of them

Start time: 6246.06
End time: 6309.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  what had happened prior to that  what he's trying to do is  actually  from what I've heard is that  the company needs to move  faster and there is a certain  sense of lethargy  in the operation right now  and he needs to overcome that  again I'm not in the business anymore  so I may not be as up  as erin and everybody else  in the industry is  but that said I do feel that  they need to take a step back  in order to make  progress and I think that's  what they're trying to do is this is  this is a company which has too many  people like you know at one point  I saw they had like 3000 plus  people which is just like wait  compare that to facebook and you  start to realize there is a challenge  with this company and  so you know it will be interesting  to see what comes up next  I'm actually  I'll still sit on the sidelines  and let Jack make  a few moves before I  have an opinion

Transcript:  well this is the problem  I mean twitter is very  it is  influential within the group  of people that use it simply because they got on there first  and they tend to be people that the tech  industry has awareness to  but it is such a basic set of functions  and they don't seem to be able to change it that much  that I do wonder how long  we have talked about making 10,000 character

Transcript:  I think that speaks to what Om was saying  there is a lot of legacy thinking there  people think that twitter in its  form today is sacred and that they  couldn't change it because users would revolt  but that is actually how facebook got to  a billion users is by creating new  looking at behavior  creating new products that kind of  feed into that and then people freak out  people freaked out when they introduced  newsfeed which was  which is now basically the core

Transcript:  yeah but people boycotted it  there were like pages  get rid of newsfeed we hate this it is invasive  and now it is obviously  the best part or at least the most  familiar part of  facebook and so I think  Ian you were kind of hinting at this earlier  but the way for them to succeed now  especially with the founder back in the driver's seat  is to piss off some people  introduce some things that  users will initially hate  but eventually adapt to and really

Transcript:  love yeah I couldn't agree more  I think get in there make some noise and make some  changes I mean 140 character limit  it was a great  cute sort of way  of getting things underground but as soon as you went on twitter  you saw it wasn't working because I don't know about you  but when I went on it was just like  oh 140 characters everyone would be  composing elegant little hikers  to go out there and no  look at this it's really funny and then  I think and that's what 90% of tweet posts are  you know there's no style there's no  innovation there so getting rid of the 140  character limit I say go for it

End time: 6741.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah it could do  as long as they actually limit it down  the big advantage I see  in twitter is that it's a pure data feed  we're getting to situations  now where you can get a tweet  when the  Virginia earthquake I think in 2011  people were getting tweets in New  York that an earthquake was occurring  actually before the earthquake  hit you a couple of seconds before  because the data was traveling wow  wow that was cool  that's what makes  twitter really special to my mind  that kind of pure data flow  and  just 140  characters it's neither  one thing or the other really

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think you look at  I wrote two blog posts  one which  when twitter went public  I wrote this blog post about  to live and die  in public that's twitter  and it was a little pun intended  in a sense this is a company which  went public this is a company  which lives in public  I don't think any other  corporation has the kind  of rigorous scrutiny  they have at a product level  and so it is very hard to make  some changes there and then  another post I wrote recently which was  about some little changes  they can make and the idea I was proposing  was you know take away the idea  that a link should not count  240 characters  a photo attachment or a  dozen photo attachments should not  count as  attachment to  you know in a  sense that should not be  towards 140 characters  make the 140 characters  mean a lot more that  is a good starting point the fact  that you know we all  are talking about radical changes  I think just making small  changes is  will get this company set on the  right path I think there is  like people just are looking  for a lot of  motion and confusing that  for action and that's not really  how you actually try to come back from  you know the dire situation  twitter is in

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  they need to make the product so much more  simpler and attractive  so that new users can come  to it and use it and  stick to it people are curious about  twitter they just don't want to  spend time on it because they don't  know how to deal with it and I think  they need to figure out how  they keep the newcomers  on the site and on the service  that is the thing they need to solve  you know I think maybe 10,000 characters  solves that problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and they have so much data  on what people are  reading tweeting sharing  whatever they can actually be  the newspaper of the planet  and that is  a great place for non  power users to start with  secondly I think if you really look  at this company  you know it just  the innovation in twitter  comes from its users  like the tweets from idea  didn't come from within twitter  it came from folks like  mark and rison you know the idea  of you know quoting a tweet  or doing snapshots  of like two or three paragraphs  you know that's coming  from people hashtag came  from Christmasina
