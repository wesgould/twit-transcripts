Transcript:  Um, actually, let's talk a little bit about TikTok today. I performed this morning  an act of rebellion. I downloaded and installed TikTok on my iPhone because who knows how much  longer I'll be able to do it. It's very confusing. I don't know what's going on.  TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company, Bite Dance, Cepheus, the committee, uh,  or foreign investment in the United States apparently, uh, is investigating. I think they  actually issued a ruling, uh, saying that, uh, like Huawei, TikTok was a threat to the United States.  One of the ways TikTok became really big is by acquiring a couple of years ago musically,  which is really kind of, I think from what I see on TikTok, kind of the backbone of what TikTok is  these days, which is, uh, lip syncing or acting or dancing to an original track. Um, it's, it's  very entertaining. It's a, it's probably the most engaging social network out there, but apparently  it's a threat to our way of life. On Friday, the president on Air Force One, uh, said that he was  about to ban it as soon as yesterday from the United States. I'm not sure under what law,  Cepheus could do it, I think, but I don't know if the president can by executive order, ban an  application. Uh, then, uh, for the last week, Microsoft's been negotiating to buy the  American rights to TikTok to kind of create a TikTok America that would be separate from the  Chinese bite dance TikTok. But then the president says, I'm going to ban it, but I don't want anybody  to buy it. So Microsoft said, ah, Microsoft threw their hands up and said, figure it out. And, uh,  they didn't end the conversation with bite dance. Apparently they were fairly close, but, uh, they're  not forwarding it until they find out what happens. I'm going to make a prediction. Nothing is going  to happen except now more people are going to download and use TikTok. Brianna, is TikTok a

Start time: 480.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  threat to national security? It's not a unique threat to national security. We need to have a  conversation about the kinds of information social media apps are able to download from our phones.  We all remember the scandals of Facebook on Android, downloading your entire phone list and  getting everyone you've ever called. We need to have a conversation about that, but there's,  there's really no evidence that what TikTok is pulling is any greater than what, uh, you know,  Facebook, Instagram, these other social media sites are pulling so far. So we need a wider  discussion about that. I also just want to say, uh, I wish I could tell you this was just Trump  and the Republicans that would make me very happy. My heart broke today to see Chuck Schumer, uh,  on the Sunday morning shows advocating the same thing with TikTok. So, you know, it's, it is,  we need to have a conversation about national security and the amount of information we're  giving up, but it's, I think racist to just focus on TikTok. Sinophobia or xenophobia. Paris, you

End time: 606.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did recently read down the day when this whole shuffle happened. I wanted to make sure that I had  it. I'm sure as a common response, I agree with everything that Briana just said in the sense that,  I don't know, I've been particularly disturbed by the reactions to TikTok's data collection,  both from the left and right and just experts in the tech field generally over the past couple  of months because it is definitely coming from a place of xenophobia. I mean, we have so many  different American made apps that do many of the same things. I mean, one thing that I've seen noted  quite often is, Oh, TikTok has the ability to see what you've, you know, copied in your clipboard.  And my guests, so do most of the apps you have on your phone. Um, this is a problem. It's not a

Start time: 606.42
End time: 664.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  TikTok specific problem. This came up because of iOS 14, which is in public beta now. So people  are suddenly using it and dozens of applications. I think it must be a library that they all  subscribe to. In fact, somebody, a couple of weeks ago, somebody told me that it was a Google  ad library. I use a, but a clearly non-invasive program from panic software, uh, called code  editor, which lets me log into my, uh, uh, server, uh, with SSH and, uh, and edit files and things  like that. And it was, I got the same thing that you get on iOS 14. Oh, code editors looking at  your clipboard every time I typed a character. Now I don't think code, I don't think panic software  famous for an FTP program and an SSH program is spying on me. Obviously they're not. Um,  they're using the same code library. So it's a, it's a, it's a bug. That's what LinkedIn,

Start time: 665.06
End time: 689.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Microsoft's LinkedIn said as well. So I think it's also just one of those things where if  you're building an app, especially in the time, I don't know, there was a time when apps and stuff  were being built where there wasn't this conversation about security and privacy. Why would  app designers not take the position of, yeah, let's get all the things. Maybe we'll need that

Start time: 689.52
End time: 704.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  information. Quite credibly. Well, we're just looking to see if you put a URL on your clipboard  so we can paste it in. Right. That seems credible. I don't know if you need to do it every single time  I type a character that seems like more than a bug. I can tell you firsthand from developing an

Start time: 704.54
End time: 751.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  iOS, it's often easiest just to get it, submit it to the app store to take a bunch of permissions.  And, um, it's just, it's like you're trying to debug it and get the app store to accept it. It's  just quirky. I cannot tell you how many times I and other app developers have just, it's a very,  very quirky system. So I think this is just in beta. I also think it's really important to point  out as far as the impetus for this. I personally do not think it's a coincidence that TikTok was  widely credited for disrupting Trump's Tulsa rally a couple of weeks ago. And, you know, Sarah Cooper  is so famous for making fun. She's amazing. And those videos are brutal to Trump. And I don't

Start time: 752.18
End time: 790.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  think that's a coincidence. She does Trump lip sync. And I was talking to a friend who said,  you know, I see Trump on TV. I can't understand what he's saying. But then I watched Sarah Cooper  and that makes sense. Because Sarah adds expressions and gestures and all kinds of  make sense all of a sudden. So I don't think the president should be so quick to not like Sarah  Cooper. She's adding context. I do think that might have something to do with it. Certainly in  his mind, because we know the, you know, I don't know what he's going to do to K-pop stans because  they were the other group that apparently figured out that you could register for tickets.

Start time: 790.38
End time: 799.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody on Trump's team has got to be wise enough to know you can't take on the K-pop  stans. But if you went against the K-pop stans, the United States would crumble.

Start time: 800.06
End time: 890.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, that would be it would be over. Right. You just can't win against the K-pop stans.  So they were both advocating people sign up for the Tulsa rally and not show. And honestly,  the fault lies with Brad Parscale, Trump's former campaign manager, and his campaign team for  believing all those registrations and building a giant outdoor stage and a giant parking lot  so that the millions of people who are going to be coming because they all registered would have  somewhere to be. And then I loved, well, I shouldn't say that that sounds partisan. It was  interesting to see the one person with the baby stroller in that giant area and the rest of the  arena half full or a third full. So I could see why he might be a little angry about that.  Is there though, Matt, and I'm not putting you in the position of speaking for the government. I  want to say that. In fact, we should have said that up front. Thank you. Matt does not speak  for the USDS or the federal government. But you also though, having worked at Geekle Google,  you understand how, you know, a little bit of how this stuff works. There's not any proof that  Huawei, for instance, has ever done anything particularly evil. They've done some commercial  espionage, apparently, but nothing particularly evil. But there's the potential if they run the  entire 5G network that at some point they could inject malicious software into the network or  shut it down. What could TikTok do? It's the forbidden app. It's like Waffy Bird. And if

Start time: 898.50
End time: 913.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you think about it, if you don't have it on your phone, it could disappear at any time. No,  I think it's less about that. Although you do see companies like Amazon saying,  hey, on your work phone or work device, please don't install this. Well, Amazon did it and then

Start time: 913.80
End time: 928.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  undid it. Yeah, because they realized, oh, we do a lot of business with these guys. Let's not piss  them off. But Wells Fargo did that. I think the Department of Defense. I don't know about USDS,  but it's reasonable. If you've got a company phone, you probably shouldn't have Facebook

Start time: 928.26
End time: 968.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  or Instagram on it either. Right. Yeah. I keep my Twitter and all that stuff very far away from my  work phone. It's my personal account. But I can understand why people want to have just a sense  of, okay, let's be careful. Let's see what's going on. And then just making sure that you can depend  on the tools all the way down. Reflections on trust in trust. You can put things into a compiler,  which then you can remove it from the source code. And turns out that thing can stay in the  compiler for years and years and years. So you don't want to be load bearing on any particular  technology that you can't quite vouch for, is my guess, is what people are thinking.

Start time: 968.62
End time: 974.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Brianna, what would be the legal, how could a president ban an app in the United States?

Start time: 975.28
End time: 1010.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was thinking about this. And one thing the United States government is very effective at is  we went after ISIS in ISIL in a very effective way and said, you know, this IP address to a  recruitment site, you can't access it. So my guess would be the executive order would basically  go after the ISPs and say, you can't go to this particular ISP. But think about that. I know  VPN products have sponsored your show. They've sponsored mine. And do you know how few seconds  would take the average teenager to get a VPN account to just keep their tick tock going?

Start time: 1011.00
End time: 1028.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will say yesterday I downloaded the tick tock app. The first video that came up because I had  to create an account because I forgot my previous password was a if tick tock gets banned, here's  how to get around it. You don't even need a VPN. You can go into the settings of your phone,  change your country of origin to Canada, and then you're great.

Start time: 1029.28
End time: 1112.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. I mean, it's not enforceable, basically. So I mean, one thing like Leo, I think,  Matt and I would probably agree that we do need to I don't know if it's more oversight from the  point of sale, like on the App Store or Google Play. I don't know if it's kind of an external  code audit policy for these kinds of apps when they're owned by other countries. I think we agree  we need more oversight and we need to make sure all of these are not stealing data from people.  And just to give people a very brief history lesson, you know, Edward Snowden had some very  serious allegations about our own spying agencies using Facebook to gather intelligence on people  all around the world. There's evidence for that. There's no hard evidence at this point that tick  tock is doing any of this. So if we're serious about doing this, the answer isn't to further  balkanize the United States from the rest of the world. The answer is to form more coalitions with  other countries. Say, look, if you're going to operate here, and, you know, if you're going to  have the software operating in our country, here are the rules you have to follow. You can't just  arbitrarily download people's phone books, there's going to be, you know, civil fines. That's clearly  the way to go. It's got to be bigger than just tick tock. I'm just looking at tick tock on my

Start time: 1112.50
End time: 1157.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  iPhone. It has access to my photos because I gave it access to my photos so I could put a profile  picture on there. It gives me notifications. I could turn that off. That's a push though. That's  not a poll. Background app refresh means it can run in the background and cellular data. It doesn't  ask for location data. It doesn't ask for, I mean, Facebook asks for 10 times more. That's why I don't  have it on my phone. You know, I mean, the worst thing tick tock does is waste millions of hours  of productivity. And maybe that's a reason to ban. I don't know. But I just I don't understand  how it could be used. If it's not getting location permissions, how could it be used maliciously?

Start time: 1158.50
End time: 1181.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it is getting location positions. I know that  I've no anecdotally at least from a couple of friends whenever they let's say go to Connecticut  to visit family or something, they will suddenly get Connecticut themed tick tock content or  something similar. But I mean, that could just be from IP address. You can get that from the IP

Start time: 1181.44
End time: 1206.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  address. So I guess they could get a geolocation through IP address without asking app without  telling Apple that they're doing that. That would make sense. Okay, so they're getting that. But  every app can do that. Yeah, every app can and probably I hate to say it probably does do that.  Your phone is a spy device. It's like the it's like, it's the best possible. It's got a camera.

Transcript:  Tick tock is at great pains really they're trying to appease the US government. They've  announced they're going to hire 10,000 Americans. That always seems to be good for relationships  with the White House. They have done something that nobody else will do. They say, we want to  reveal our algorithm because there's been some criticism of tick tock's algorithm that perhaps  it downgrades people because the algorithm is key to tick tock. The whole key by the way,  key to Facebook and YouTube too. The whole key is you get a million people to submit videos  and then algorithmically based on how many people are looking at how much engagement you  bring up the best videos. It's a brilliant concept. You know, you don't you don't

Start time: 1270.70
End time: 1293.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's unique and very different from other social media apps in that it's not specifically  follower based like the content you're going to be getting in your feed. When you open tick tock,  even with no app, you're going to be getting content produced from hundreds of other people  that are both tick tock stars verified as well as you know, like no name people I think you  might be interested in. You don't have to follow certain accounts in order to get content tick tock

Start time: 1293.92
End time: 1331.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  works really well. You could make the algorithm you can make the argument that YouTube's algorithm  encourages terrorism. I don't think that's a problem on tick tock. And you can argue that  maybe Facebook's algorithm starts feeding you all sorts of weird political stuff. But you I don't  I mean, I don't think you can argue that with tick tock. And they're going to they say they want to  reveal how their algorithm works. In fact, their chief executive Kevin Mayer said, and we call on  Facebook and Google, Amazon and Apple to do the same. Is that from your time in Google,

Start time: 1331.26
End time: 1376.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that's kind of the secret sauce. Yes, the algorithms are the secret sauce. But I can believe  that tick tock's algorithms you could you know, you could probably do a pretty good approximation  and like 1000 lines of code, you know, you're looking for engagement, you're looking for growth,  you're looking at the first derivative, like it's, it's going to be pretty simple, you might tweak  based on whether somebody's verified or how many followers they have. But, you know, the once you  have enough critical mass, once you get the network effect, then the content is flowing in on its own  and the algorithm itself, for tick tock, at least doesn't need to be, you know, that complex,  whereas the algorithms that run searching the entire web, you know, or the sorts of things that  Apple might use, or Amazon might use for distribution, those sorts, you know, that is a lot more complex,

Start time: 1376.78
End time: 1392.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  probably, and more proprietary, more, you know, you're right. I mean, I think anybody, if you  think about it, could figure out how to, how to surface the best videos and tick tock, you're  getting all these signals, people are giving them to you. Do you think Twitter is just killing

It's just, it's so obvious he's been coached.  Andy's trying to run out the clock because there's that long pause. But I have to say, look, I  realize that the temptation is to be cynical and snarky about this and don't get me wrong. There  was plenty of grandstanding in this hearing. I was just horrified how many people, uh, you know,  elected officials got up there and did their own grandstanding with a monologue about something  unrelated to the issue at hand. But at its core, I was very impressed and happy with the amount  of work in antitrust that the committee had done and the document research in the amount of discovery  that they put in front of the American people. I thought they did an excellent job. A lot. And

And I feel  like there may be a little bit more in touch, maybe not a lot, but a little bit more in touch,  uh, with what's going on. Let's take a little break. By the way, these are your hat choices,  Paris, if you don't mind. Uh, Mr. Bezos, I believe you're on mute.  Wow. I missed that one. That's good. And a nuance, a nuance destruction machine.

I'm so glad.  Dark. Dark. I'm glad I'm not seeing you again. Not. I mean, I know you would be around,  but we wouldn't get you on our airs. Brianna Wu. I knew we would never get rid of you. So that's  good. We count on you and, uh, and Matt cuts, of course, it's always a pleasure. US digital service.  He is the administrator of show today brought to you by Monday.com. We found a new way of organizing  our show prep, uh, our ideas. It's hard when, when, when team members are working from home,  you can't have the standups. You can't have the meetings. You can't just lean over a partition  say, what are you working on? You need a centralized place that you can let your team plan and track  and manage and get things done and know where everybody is. And this is Monday.com.  And it doesn't matter whether you work with a team of five people or 5,000 people,  it really is the best way to keep people connected and on track. It's a project management  platform that is designed to make effective teamwork possible no matter where the team is.  And even after COVID, we're going to go back to work and teams will still be distributed  all over the world. That's just the way works going to be from now on, but you can at least  keep their work in one place, bring them together. You have a single page of truth.  You can plan, track and manage your business. One easy to use platform. Now,  I know the first reaction I always have is, but I, I already have a platform. I don't want to give  it up. Monday.com works with all the platforms you already work with. It integrates all of your  existing tools. So we use Google sheets. We use Slack. We use zoom. It works with email. It works  with your calendar. It can all integrate in. In fact, it automatically does that. So now,  instead of having 50 different places to look to see how you're doing, you've got one great  dashboard and you can set it up however you like a Gantt chart, a timeline. We like Kanban boards.  You could do tables like spreadsheets. Monday.com has almost any possible way of looking at your  data. In fact, one of the great things is once the data is in there, you can look at it in a  variety of ways, whatever way makes sense for the information you're trying to understand.  It really helps with coordination across teams and departments. You can easily track and manage  work so that you always know, always know who's doing what, when. That's really important. In fact,  honestly, even when we get back to work, the thing I'm going to love about Monday.com is  no more meetings, no more check-in meetings. You don't have to anymore. What are you working on?  Where does it stand? When's it going to be done? All of that's right there in front of you,  always up to date in real time. That's done also with no code automations. You don't have to write  the code, but you can easily put that workflow on autopilot. Alerts, project flows, all work  automatically. Your productivity goes up, your efficiency goes up, transparency improves. That's  important with collaboration. If you're a company and you ought to be that makes data-driven  decisions, Monday.com is for you. You can track progress, timelines, budgets. You'll be making  your key decisions based on real-time data, constantly up to date. No more guessing.  This is an amazing way, whether you're organizing podcasts like we do, or organizing a giant  business or a production workflow or a project, a coding project you're working on. It's perfect.  Eddie did a great job. That's another thing I love. I've been using Monday.com for a couple of years,  but when you sign up for Monday.com, you can get an onboarding specialist to work with you. Eddie  sat down and he's a wizard with his stuff. He said, oh, here's another thing you could do. It's  awesome. 100,000 teams are already getting things done with Monday.com.

Transcript:  we didn't do that. What's happening here? No, they, they, it really seemed to be them repeatedly.  This was the pattern. The government will be talking about some emails. They'd have them  dead to rights on some anti-competitive behavior, something that was just completely  indefensible. And they'd be like, Oh gosh, I just don't know anything about that. I guess,  I think what we were trying to say is we're trying to empower users and they just kept trying to  flip it around. Like the other part of it that was so stunning is all four of them really kept  talking about their companies. Like they're these nimble, humble upstarts that just may have made a  few mistakes. It's like, y'all, y'all just beat the, like the market repeatedly because you're  all effectively monopolies or duopolies. Like, you know, you're not this nimble like garage run  company anymore. You are real entities. And I just, I, I, I really thought Congress did a pretty good

Start time: 2408.16
End time: 2423.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  job. All the grandstanding, you know, put aside. And it's, it's the staff as much as anything else.  I mean, they clearly did a lot of document. Did they, do they, are they able to use the  power of discovery? Can they subpoena documents? Is that because they got a lot of internal emails.

Start time: 2423.36
End time: 2433.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they released a lot of documents at the beginning of the hearings that they could discuss  a lot of emails and other things that were, I don't know, totally new. For instance, emails

Start time: 2434.82
End time: 2472.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that said from face that internal Facebook emails that said, Oh, we're really worried about  Instagram. It's a real threat right before they bought it. Confirming what everyone knows,  which is that they bought it as a defensive action. Jamie Raskin got Bezos to admit Amazon  is priced below market. I mean, I always assumed that Amazon probably figured we'll make it up in  the, the, the transactions it'll go through us as a result. Same thing with the fire tablets.  But I guess it's the problem is from an antitrust point of view, how do you compete with something

Start time: 2473.10
End time: 2483.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's priced below the cost to make it? They also proved in the hearing that Amazon actually  ranks its products up in Alexa above other products are offered. Again, something everybody

Start time: 2485.66
End time: 2515.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  has used it new, but it's good to get confirmation. It wasn't just your instinct. Right. They accused  they accused Amazon. Actually, this was the pop socket guy. And they brought this up who accused  Amazon of making duplicate products to his until he ponied up $2 million in ad buys. And then  mysteriously, the Amazon version of the pop sockets disappeared. Jeff Bezos said, well,  I don't know anything about that. If we did, that was wrong.

Transcript:  I will say one thing that I found astounding, very interesting about this hearing is that it  showed strangely that Mark Zuckerberg has been through a lot of these. He understood how to play  it. He understood how to phrase his answers and respond in situations where he wasn't quite sure  versus say Bezos, who has never been in this position before floundered a lot.

Start time: 2542.74
End time: 2665.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I also, you know, maybe this is just me, but I'm looking at the kind of message that's  sent by the way these by the backdrops these executives had the way they were shot. Bezos,  for instance, and rape my Skype room picked this up on Twitter. He said, get a ring light, Jeff,  you've got them on sale right now at amazon.com. Jeff was it and I think this was quite intentional.  He was so poorly lit that he kind of blended into the background. And I think the intent was  really to make him almost disappear. You know, he's managed to avoid these testimony up to now.  It just kind of the, you know, and that's in a way that's in a nutshell, Jeff Bezos, his way of  handling all this is he doesn't give interviews. He doesn't testify. He's just sits in the back,  but he's definitely the puppet master. There's no question about that. He's pulling the strings.  There will be so the upshot of this, this is a big showpiece. And yeah, members of Congress  used it to grandstand. But there was a point. And the point is there will be a report from the sub  committee, a final report, which will probably not come out before the election. Six hearings,  385 hours of calls and meetings, and most importantly, 1.3 million documents from these  companies. Lots of lots of legwork done before this testimony. And I think the point of this  report is, well, here's what we think should happen. Things like I don't know what's on the  table, maybe that Facebook should be required to divest Instagram and WhatsApp that I'm almost  certain will be one of the things they'll talk about. They did talk to Sundar Pichai, CEO of  Alphabet and by extension, Google over a Google email saying some websites were getting too much  traffic. Did you get that email, Matt? I don't recall getting that email.

Start time: 2667.06
End time: 2721.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's interesting because like, I was there when the search team was like eight people around a  ping pong table. And I always saw people acting with a lot of integrity and trying to make sure  that the results were fair. They were nonpartisan. If somebody typed in X, they get information or an  answer about X. But I haven't seen that email. I'm wondering whether it's also the case that if like  eight out of the top 10 results are one site, then somebody could send an email that's like, oh,  this site is dominating the search results in a way that's unfair. And then the shorthand might be  this site is getting too much traffic. But I've personally seen where investigators can ask  questions about things that to a search engineer, you're like, oh, these results are interesting.  And then they're like, are they interesting because you are squashing a competitor? And they're like,  no, they're interesting because it's actually got more French results than we would have expected  given that there aren't that many French queries, you know, that sort of thing. That's what makes

Start time: 2721.54
End time: 2795.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  this so difficult. Just the phrase getting too much traffic doesn't, it's not a smoking gun.  Now the imputation is it's this site was getting more traffic than our own sites.  But it could absolutely just be a failure of, oh, the algorithms putting this result up more than  it ought to. Pichai's response was, Congressman, just like other businesses, we try to understand  trends from data, which we can see, and we can use it to improve our products for users. That was,  by the way, the drum beat from all of them, but especially for Senator Pichai, as we want to  improve our products for users. I have to say at the beginning, when all four gave their statements,  I want to stand up and wave the flag. I want to say, yeah, God bless them. This is the engine  of the American economy. This is what's moving us forward. This is where innovation is happening,  that these companies are doing their best to make the best possible product.  As Tim Cook said, I guess it's true, we aren't dominant in any field that we participate in.  We are not even close to dominant. We just try to make the best products for users. And I think,  to some degree, to take the opposite side from you, Granna, that's what these companies do.  I don't think they should be punished for doing it well.

Start time: 2797.02
End time: 2834.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I would actually agree. I thought, Tim Cook, I think if you wanted to rank who got master  blasted in this hearing, I think Amazon would be number one, Facebook would be number two. I  thought Google and Apple got off relatively unscathed. Yeah, they hardly talked to Tim,  actually. Yeah, I listened to most of the hearing while I was working. And the biggest moment with  Tim Cook was him being asked about cancel culture for some asinine reason. So I found Apple's  answers generally compelling on this, as well as Google. So I think I agree with you, Leo.

Transcript:  There'd be a risk for Congress to be too aggressive in this, because especially now,  during COVID, we are really reliant on technology companies. Is it the case, do you think,  may I ask Paris this, is it the case that these companies are so big that we don't see  the innovative ferment we used to see? I heard one of my colleagues say in the early days,  we had, there'd be hundreds of different products from hundreds of different companies.  There was nobody one huge dominant player, we had so much to cover. Now it's really we cover  Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple, you know. Do you feel like that's true, Paris? Is that fair?

Start time: 2878.22
End time: 2944.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I feel like from a coverage perspective, yes, just because it is. There's so many, they're  so large. Each of them are a world in and of themselves, essentially. And there is a lot to  cover within each company, much less all combined. I mean, do I think that translates directly to  whether or not these companies are monopolies? It's not my position to say, but I think it's  interesting and perhaps not the right framework to apply here when you're thinking about a coverage  perspective. I think that a coverage perspective is always going to be focused on  the biggest players in the room, because there just isn't enough energy out there,  much less funding and media or even just from users to have your eyes on everything. But I  think that also when you have companies that do get so large and do affect so many people,  that that warrants criticism and warrants a careful eye.

Transcript:  That's exactly what David Cicciolini, who's the chair, said. He said,  because these companies are so central in our modern life, this was in his opening,  their business practices and decisions have an outsized effect on our economy and democracy.  Any single action by any one of these companies can affect hundreds of millions of us in profound  and lasting ways. Absolutely. Nobody denies that. That's why we cover them. We cover them because  they change our lives. That's not inherently bad. What do you think, Matt? You have the best  perspective on Google having worked there. I would agree with you. Everybody I ever met from Google  had, just like Tim Cook, had the interest in making the best product they could.

Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's true. I also think way back, the first FTC investigation, like 2011 or whatever,  the thing that Google would say is, we understand that with size comes scrutiny.  I think given the size of all these companies, it is perfectly appropriate to scrutinize them.  At the same time, it was interesting to see how, if you think about an earlier Zuckerberg hearing,  the questions were not on point, as seen by Paris's hat, for example. The questions,  you could tell a bunch of research happened. For me, one of the most interesting things is,  how do you get... The idea of lawmakers passing laws to regulate technology when they might not  perfectly understand some of the issues involved is a little bit scary. There are some interesting  areas. There's this thing called Tech Congress, for example. They've got fellowship applications  opening for the next three weeks. They bring in technologists, computer scientists, engineers,  and they sit in the offices of important members of Congress to help make sure that people  understand technology and you can ask the right questions or you can get to the issues that matter.  I think getting more technologists talking to DC and vice versa is probably good for both worlds.

Transcript:  Cicilline was a bulldog. He bared down on this Google issue. This is the one I really want to  ask you about, Matt. The claim is that Google favorites its own content over other sites' content.  Cicilline put it in, I think, a very nasty way. He said, why does Google steal content from  honest businesses? He was pointing at Yelp, which may be not the most honest business I've ever heard

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  let's face it, a lot of this scrutiny comes from Google competitors who are unhappy with Google's  success and whether in the EU or here, and Yelp's a good example, go, hey guys, you really ought to  look into this. This is something terrible. But Google, but it is the case that when you do a  Google search, and Pachai said this is particularly in commerce when you're looking to buy a product,  that Google's going to surface shopping information. There's a lot of knowledge cards now.  Used to be Google search results were just search results. Now there's the knowledge card and  there's a lot more stuff. And a lot of it does have YouTube videos, Google shopping.  Google's excuse is we're trying to give people the information they're looking for. We're trying to

Start time: 3149.14
End time: 3178.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  answer their question. Right, Matt? Yeah, that's absolutely right. And I think the people in the  search team still believe that. They've internalized that. And I also think there's  tension, which is well deserved because as Google moves up the value chain of delivering better and  better answers, there are some sites from my old world with SEO hat on where people would feel like  you're taking a snippet from my site. And that's the thing that people really want to know. Like,

Start time: 3178.64

Transcript:  That's a legit complaint. It's a legit complaint and it's a valid concern on both sides. Like,  well, okay, if you really, all you needed to know was how high Tom Cruise was, then maybe they're  not going to stay on your site. You mean how high or how tall? How tall, sorry. He can be as high as  he wants. He doesn't need to be tall. But then the flip side is, the other day I was invoking my  Google device and I was like, you know, tell me how to spell loquacious. And it just spells it  right out. It doesn't point me to another website. So that's what you want as the user. That's what

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you want. Yeah. So I do have to say, as someone that watched most of this hearing, we're not just  talking about things that show up in Google site results. Like some of the most explosive moments  we're talking about for Google's own lyrics that show up on Android. And they had one particular  company that put that out there. They actually put fake records in their lyrics and you know,  Google was caught red. Yeah, exactly. Google was caught using that. So this isn't.

Start time: 3248.98
End time: 3268.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, but Google, okay, so this is more complicated because Google said, well, we  didn't scrape it from Rap Genius. We hired a company that scraped it from Rap Genius.  Yeah.  So it's not our fault. It's that company's fault. And I think,  at least in Google's defense, they stopped doing that, but they did get caught red handed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure. Sure. I'm just saying, I think it's a wider pattern of behavior that I think could be  construed as anti-competitive. And in my opinion, if you're using a third party person and they're  doing something that blatant, I do think it, I think your company should face sanctions in that

Transcript:  Another thing that came up at the hearing, which is based on an article written by a couple of my  colleagues, the information is kind of the accusations that Google has used its Android  platform and the amount of information it can kind of collect on how users using Android use apps  in order to do research for its own applications. I think the situation that they,  my colleagues discussed in their article was in preparation for launching Google's own possible  TikTok competitor, they pulled data from Android about how people use TikTok and Android devices,  which seems kind of like a conflict of interest there.

Transcript:  yeah, but Amazon's accused of using retail data to figure out what products it should make.  But I think every business in the world would do that, does that, right? We're trying to figure,  I guess Amazon has a unique access to data that it wouldn't normally have. Is that why it's wrong?

Start time: 3363.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, part of the issue is that if you listen to the complaints of  small like first party sellers or third party sellers on Amazon, they say, oh,  I have been making this unicorn themed hairbrush for 10 years, everybody loves my unicorn hairbrush,  it's been doing so well. Then all of a sudden I see Amazon brand unicorn hairbrush appears,  top of the search results is the Amazon choice and nobody buys my unicorn hairbrush anymore.  That's a good complaint.  And in situations like that, it seems, I don't know, to be a fairly concerning practice of true.

Transcript:  This is the same problem I have with Google owning YouTube and Amazon selling stuff,  is it mixes the two things together. If Google were just a search engine, it wouldn't be so  much of a problem except that it controls one of the number one deliver of video content.  So that kind of muddles the matter. Amazon, if it's going to do what it's due, shouldn't also  be in the business of making these products because they have an unusual amount of information.  I mean, face it, I bought this hygiene hand on Kickstarter, which shows that I'm an idiot  because I paid too much for it.

Transcript:  I get your point. I really do.  It's complicated.  It is complicated. And in this particular case, my husband does patent law and I would,  so you were coming to me with this particular business plan. I would say,  what you have in front of you is not novel in a way that it can be patented according to our laws.  And you should understand that this is a business threat. That's reasonable. I do think that's a  slightly different situation than someone, than a company abusing their data to undercut competitors  and threaten other companies, which is what came out in this hearing. So I think I really  agree with you, Matt. The way forward is these are big companies. They deserve scrutiny.  And I think you can never say often enough, you know who wasn't at this hearing today?  It's Microsoft. We brought that case against them in the nineties and they have been a pretty  ethical company, generally speaking, in the two decades since. Three decades now, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that regard. What I've heard from my friends that work at Microsoft over and over and over again is  that that fundamentally changed the culture. Interesting. And that there was more of an  anything goes approach before then. And then they finally had a conversation where it had to go  through legal. They had to have discussions of those going to open them up to liability. So  my opinion is this is all checks and balances, right? If the, not talking about Trump,  but a generic president were to do something that was over the line, Congress checks them,  that doesn't necessarily mean the presidency itself is corrupt. It's just a system meant to  check each other. I think until we see stronger antitrust actions against tech companies, I think  they're going to feel free to just keep pushing the line harder and harder. So I strongly support

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  this line of investigation. Chicholini ended the hearing saying, this hearing has made one fact  clear to me. These companies as they exist today have monopoly power. Remember this is the antitrust  committee. That's their bailiwick. Some need to be broken up, all broken up. I'm not sure which of  the four need to be broken up, but anyway, some need to be broken up. All need to be properly  regulated and held accountable. We need to ensure the antitrust laws first written more than a  century ago, work in the digital age. So what is the remedy for, let's pick one thing. What would  you do about Facebook? Would you make them divest Instagram? Is that the remedy there? That's the

Start time: 3729.78
End time: 3745.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  easiest one, I guess. I think so. I'd love to know what other people think, but that seems like a  slam dunk to me. At the very least, I think we need huge civil fines when Google gets caught  manipulating advertisers to put people out of business. They make so much money. We've seen that in the EU.

Start time: 3760.06
End time: 3852.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  hearings? I don't know. I mean, I think about this often is that there are no good solutions in this  case. I mean, even if you're looking at the history of antitrust law, I'm trying to forget whether it  was standard oil or sugar or something else like that. But when companies had been ordered to be  broken up before, oftentimes the thing that ends up happening is, oh, yes, you have the seven parts  of this company, but the same people sit on the boards of all of those companies and have meetings  at the same day at different times where they all move from one room to another.  It seems like, oh, break them up is an easy and sound biteable answer. But in actuality,  there's going to be a lot more steps. And be it fine, then the question is, what sort of fine  would actually work on this, breaking it up? How do you ensure that that actually does what you meant  it to do and that the companies operate entirely separately? It's going to be complicated and  convoluted process no matter how it is done. And I think that that's one aspect of this that people  are not focusing on enough and not enough kind of academic or just expert thought is being given to  it generally. Because this is, I feel like the part we have been on currently of, oh, should these  companies broken up? That is not like 10% of the overall problem. And the what do we do next part

Start time: 3852.38
End time: 3926.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  is going to be the 90% of the iceberg. One of the, for instance, one of the things that came out of  the hearing, the subcommittee had internal emails from Amazon. Now we all knew that this happened,  but they have the smoking gun. Remember diapers.com. What was that one started by the founder of Jet?  I think it was. I think so. Yeah. Amazon wanted to force the company to basically  go out of the market and sell to Amazon. One email said these guys are our number. This is a quote.  These guys are our number one short term competitor. We need to match pricing on these guys. No matter  what the cost. Amazon said it was willing to lose in these emails was willing to lose $200 million  to get diapers.com by selling products at a loss, put them out of business. This is exactly what  Amazon did. The reason jet.com was founded is because this guy was angry that this happened.  And he said, I'm going to beat Amazon at its own game. Didn't happen. It sounds like they've got  the smoking gun over this. So what, Matt, what do you do? What does Congress do? Define them?

Start time: 3927.72

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, you know, there's a, there, yeah. And how much can you unscramble the egg when you're like,  okay, how long has Instagram been purchased or double click and purchased by Google or something  like that? Like it's really tricky because on one hand, you know, the tension for me is if you don't  like Facebook, you can stop using Facebook. You can stop buying Apple products. There are other  search engines you can go to besides Google and you can buy things at places other than Amazon.  So there are some, some ways that the market can self correct, you know, and the latest social  network is Tik TOK and Facebook doesn't have it. So you can see how some of these companies that  are even moving very fast are not always able to keep up with the internet. And so I can see  the argument towards slowing them down somewhat or checks and balances. And the problem that I have  with that is having been in government for four years now in the U S government, like there's a  lot of bad regulations. There's a lot of unintended consequences. There's a lot of times where people  said, okay, this is how we're going to solve the problem and end up making it much, much worse,  especially regarding technology. And so it's a hard problem. Yeah. Yeah. And I think that one,

Transcript:  I don't know, example that really changed the way I think about this is, um, Kashmir Hill did a really  great series for Kismoda when she worked there. And she just kind of did a re-up of it at the times  when she tried to cut the big four tech companies out of her life. First, you know, one at a time,  cutting Google, then Amazon, like all of these different companies and then all at once. And  it had, it totally wrecked her life because I mean, while we think of, let's say Amazon at  this company where you go to buy stuff, they also like undergird the entire internet. Um,  Amazon web services is where Amazon makes most of its money. It is so many different other companies,  same with all of these. I mean, they're, it's impossible to kind of, uh, yeah, like you said,  unscramble the egg and take these things back from where they are now.

Start time: 4052.84
End time: 4131.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. She actually wrote a, uh, updated her piece, uh, a couple of days ago after the  testimony, um, reminding us how much they're part of, yeah, they're so integrated into everything we  do. Diapers.com is not coming back. I guess you could do what the DOJ did with Microsoft,  which is put an ombudsman in the company to keep an eye on them and say, you know, keep an eye on  things like this and stop it as it happens. Um, and there, you know, there is a, uh, part of the  antitrust law says that it's illegal to buy a comp of a competitor to put it out of business.  You can't do that. Uh, and so that would be perhaps an argument about the, that's the Clayton  Act of 1914. It's 106 years old, uh, but it's still the law of the land. If the effect of  an acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly,  it's prohibited. Um, so they could say, you know, you got to give Instagram back. I don't know how  you would do that. I think Kevin's system's long gone. I don't think here, Kevin, can you give us  our billion dollars back? I don't, I don't think that's going to happen. So I really do understand.

Transcript:  I, I, I'm right there with you. I understand the pessimism about this. I hear you on government  regulation. I've spent the last two weeks trying to understand federal and state pack law. I really,  understand the point, but I just think it's worth taking a beat here and thinking about what the  price is of inaction. I am of the opinion that we're, uh, the tech industry has to be able to  innovate and we have some very serious sectors of our economy where it's very difficult, if not  impossible to come in there and truly innovate. Like VCs generally don't fund things within the  same space where Amazon is operating. You know, Apple and Google are effectively a duopoly on  smartphones. So I, I, I hear you that this is very difficult. I think we have to try  in any plan of action here. It's a step in the right direction because if we do nothing,  it's just going to keep being this uncontained growth of power. And I think it's also worth  thinking about Facebook. I attribute in large part to the results of our last election.  I think there are real concerns to be had about foreign interference in this election  and beyond. So if we don't start having these conversations, I'm really not sure what our

Start time: 4214.60
End time: 4301.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  country is going to look like. Yeah. No, I feel like it's a wake up call. Right? Like, um, if I  were a CEO of a large tech company, I would be asking myself very hard questions about what kind  of promises I can make about the behavior that I will do or that I won't do. Like Leo, you mentioned  an ombudsman, you know, newspapers have these sort of public editor and ombudsman roles and  empowering someone who could, you know, investigate any one of these instances, report back without  fear or favor and, you know, make it, make a binding recommendation would be a really strong  thing. You know, back in the day, uh, Google had the data liberation front, which was this idea that  you could at any time export all of your data. They called it takeout, you know, out of Google.  And that doesn't mean you're going to not use Google docs, but the fact that you can export all  of your stuff was a really nice reassurance for a lot of folks. And so, you know, I think every tech  company ought to be asking themselves, look, what were the, what were the bad looks in this hearing?  How can we get ahead of it? What preemptive promises can we make? Because promises can be hard.  They bind you to behavior and they have really bad, you know, hangover effects if you break a  promise. But at the same time, having somebody else come in and, uh, and take even stronger action  or action that hopefully is informed, but might not be as tech savvy, like I'd be thinking hard  about how do you get ahead of it rather than just reacting? Yeah, I do want to say just in response

Transcript:  to that though, um, you know, we have Olivia Salon from NBC on our show, uh, just, uh, last week.  And there's this pattern over and over with Facebook where they say, uh, we're going to take  on racial bias. You know, Facebook got caught, uh, basically, uh, allowing redlining, not renting  apartments to people of color, right? And they've sworn up and down, we're going to change it.  We got caught twice and, uh, she did this breakthrough story talking about, uh, how  Facebook basically uncovered that their algorithm was encouraging, uh, racism in some very serious  ways. And what did Facebook do? They decided to shut that research down according to her story.  And the researchers were not allowed to tell people about that. I love the idea of an, uh,  an omb spudsman in that situation. And maybe Google would have the public trust for something  like that. I do think with the Facebook, uh, I would not have any faith given stories that have

Transcript:  you know, rereading the DOJ settlement with Microsoft is really interesting. This is almost  20 years ago and November 2001. Isn't that amazing? And honestly, if you look at what's in here and I,  I'll go down to the bottom where they talk about the onsite enforcement monitors, but there are  lots of clauses in here that are totally sensible and doable. And, and I think I would agree with  you Brianna that did make a difference. And Microsoft did become a kindler, kinder, gentler  company. And you know what? They succeeded even more because of it. So it didn't hurt Microsoft,  but the onsite enforcement monitors, three independent onsite full-time computer experts  to insist in enforcing the proposed final judgment. They have full access to all of  Microsoft's books, records, systems, and personnel, including source code, and will help resolve  disputes about Microsoft's compliance with the disclosure provisions in the final judgment.  As I remember, it's only been in the last year or two that that ended. That went on for a very long  time. Uh, every bit of this settlement is sensible, reasonable, and it didn't hurt Microsoft.  It did improve competition. It took them an awful long time to get it. And maybe it was too late by  the time it happened. The lawsuit went on for almost a decade. Uh, but I think that it did make a  difference. And so there is a model for the way this could go forward. And, um, yeah, I wouldn't  be too draconian. I agree with you, Matt, you can all sorts of unintended consequences, but I think

I mean, really think about that.  Think about where they were in that era. If they had had no, you know, business impetus to go do  things like their liquid data strategy is freaking awesome. The stuff Microsoft is doing right now,  in my opinion, is 10 times more interesting than what Apple is doing. And I love Apple. So I,  I just, I feel like this is, it's, it's one of those things like where the doctor tells you to  take your medicine. And even though it's not pleasant, you end up healthier. I do think that

Once your mail is ready, you leave it for mail carrier. You can even schedule a pick  up, drop it in a mailbox. Five cents of every stamp, up to 62% off USPS and UPS shipping rates.  One of the things they do, there's, I, did you know that there's a big residential surcharge  when you mail using UPS? I don't know how they did it, but stamps.com got UPS to wave that.  No residential surcharge when you use stamps.com to send your UPS packages.  Stamps.com is a no brainer. It'll save you time. It'll save you money. And we've got a really good  deal for you.

You should do it right  now. Just do it right now. I love it. Whenever I need postage, I say, honey, can you print me some  postage? And if I miss the post office, I can get her to put on a little, you know, a little thing  with the sleeve garters and a little visor and, you know, she can rubber stamp things.

These were guys that did the OG users. They were looking for the OG user  accounts. Kirk figured out apparently how to get into the Twitter god mode. But it was a two step  hack. Now this is something we didn't know before. I had mentioned that apparently he was able to get  credentials to Twitter's Slack account and they had pinned the login to the god mode in the top  of the Slack account. So he got that. But I didn't know this part. I didn't know this part. It was  two factor. See, they do have good opsec. So Kirk, not his real name, calls up 17 remember, says,

So, so, so he says 5k for all three. Yeah. Is vamp at vampire  doable? Guy wants them. Yeah, yeah, sure. I can get you a vampire. Whatever you want. I can get it  for you. Uh, one K minimum. Let's say that for a non-OJ. Rolex actually says you should charge two  and a half for OG. Nah, just make it one K says Kirk for all of them. One K is fine. All right.  All righty then. A man of the people. A man of the people. So he made a few mistakes.  Just a couple. So, so the FBI, the way the FBI got this, once they got the user details from  Discord, they got, they had the copy of the OG users forum database that had leaked online in  April. And apparently these guys were still using the same handles. The database had not only their  usernames, but emails and IP addresses. Okay. Okay. And then, um, uh, one of the guys got, uh,  got caught because he linked the Discord username from his OG users page. So now,  okay, now we got Kirk matched up, uh, Rolex matched up. Uh, and then they apparently, uh,  he used the same two email addresses to register a Coinbase account. One of the things, and by the  way, that was how he's going to get the money with the, with the Bitcoin address. One of the things  Coinbase does, and I know this because I signed up for an account a while ago, they want a picture  of your driver's license. So he sent them a photo of his driver's license  with his home address on it. He, uh, he used his home connection to access those accounts on all  three sites, Discord, Coinbase, and OG users. They used, they used the driver's license. They  used their own credit cards. So they were just kids. Here's the thing, Leo, like this is all

If you ever want to get anything out  of it, you know, that at some point, if you want the money, you're going to have to go somewhere  to get it. Right. And apparently Coinbase would not be your first choice. Coinbase, by the way,  say they blocked $280,000 from being sent to the scammers. Court documents say that they did get  12.83 Bitcoin, which is 117,000. So this was actually a very lucrative scam.

If Twitter's freaking  posting God mode in their Slack. I mean, of course. And that's so stupid.  Do you ever wonder about why they didn't get Donald Trump's account? Because my theory on this  is after that Twitter employee, you know, like deleted his account. What was it? A year ago,  roughly. He wasn't even an employee. He was a contractor. Right. Right. I bet that they  put some kind of hard-coded break in his account or something. I bet the presidents,

And now there's,  you know, there's more information. Twitter contractors reportedly used internal tools  to spy on celebrities, including Beyonce. I can't imagine a worse waste of energy than  reading Beyonce's DMs. But some Twitter contractors made a kind of game out of creating  bogus help desk inquiries that let them spy on the account of celebrities.  Twitter, you would think after the breach, you know, the Donald's account, after Jack Dorsey  got hacked last year, you would think they would have some sort of better policies.  Um, you know, Twitter probably thinks as I still do that it's just a message. It's just a thing.  It's not, but the president of the United States uses it to announce things like I'm going to ban  TikTok. So maybe it is more important. Delay the election. Yeah. Delay the election.

And this is where the magic happened. ZipRecruiter matched Alexandra to HousingWire's  reporter job because her degree and writing skills were a great fit for the role.  Only four hours after HousingWire posted their opening, four hours they got her application  thanks to ZipRecruiter that did the matching. And a few weeks later, Alexandra started her dream  career. That's a happy story. We're not hiring today, but I tell you when we do hire again,  it will absolutely be ZipRecruiter. ZipRecruiter is the best way to hire. Their automatic matching  helps you find candidates fast. They help you sort through the applications. They never go  into your inbox or your call your phone. They all go to the ZipRecruiter interface where it's easy to  scan, rate, and pick the right hire. Fast hiring is so important. Now more than ever,  do it right. Let ZipRecruiter help you hire. See why four out of five employers who post on ZipRecruiter  get a quality candidate within the first day. And by the way, we hired three or four of our employees  recently through ZipRecruiter and I will vouch for that. Well, we'll vouch for that. We got great  applicants within just a few hours of the posting. Try it now absolutely free. ZipRecruiter.com slash  twit. And if you're hiring, God bless you. Thank you. Get on ZipRecruiter. Get that right person.  They're out there. They're waiting for you. They're thrilled. They can't wait to hear from  ZipRecruiter.com slash twit. Still the smartest way to hire ZipRecruiter.com slash twit.  Oh, it's sad. What? What? I heard something. Somebody want to say something?

And the thing that strikes me is you see the sort of stuff in the headlines like  state unemployment insurance systems that are buckling under the weight of so many people who  are applying for unemployment insurance. And these are often systems that are 10, 20, 30 years old.  They're often running on mainframes. So we recently did a collaboration with the state of New Jersey.  Their site did not work on mobile phones and most people are trying to recertify their weekly  benefits on mobile phones. And so just some CSS styling later and a production push. And now it  works much better for those 8 million people who live in New Jersey. And so it's absolutely the kind  of work that everything from getting better data about COVID to helping veterans, it's really work  that matters and can have a really big impact.

So marijuana, things like that are still illegal on the federal level.  But if you're somebody who's straight edge, we would love to talk to you because you really can  make a big difference. How long do I have to be off the pot? That's such a good question. I don't know.  I've never done the pot. I've never done the Mary Jane.

And it turns out that really  needs to be upgraded to a more modern language. I'm going to be on Medicare in a couple of years.  I hope you fix it by then. Fingers crossed. I mean, that is a great collaboration with the  Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. So if you are an engineer who is unhappy and not feeling  like you're having an impact right now, or you're doing the same thing that you did last month,  you can really try something completely new and get hooked on the impact if you want to try the

So  Mac is like a Medicare administrative sort of middleman. And it turns out if you just even pull  the data off of the mainframe, I'll try not to geek out too much. If you just pull the data off  of the mainframe, then you can start to do real-time analytics. You can look for fraud.  You can look at like, oh, on the first of the quarter, somebody does a bunch of billing. They  find the most expensive procedure that gets reimbursed. And then they just submit that for  the next 90 days. And there's all kinds of ways where getting data to a place where you can actually  do real-time analysis in a way that most of the tech industry is used to. It's just, it's world  changing. Like one, go where you're rare. One technologist can really make a huge difference

But if you can insert in the right spot, you can just make a copy of it and  use it in a secure location in the cloud or wherever. And then you can use all the regular  sort of, like we're not talking, we are talking about a lot of data by government terms, but not  a lot by tech industry terms.

It is absolutely possible to make enough for a living wage. You know, that's good salary.  There's a lot of people who start at a much lower salary because of all the experience and the value  that you bring. The government can pay its top rate for general service sort of employees.  You joked whenever I would not come on this week in Google that I was Colonel Cutts.  But when I started at the Pentagon, I was the equivalent of 06. Like I was a Colonel.

I won the world series in 1928. Just real low voice. I don't know, but here's something I found  on the web. Let's talk about, since we're talking about the cyber, let's talk about the election.  I don't know if this is, yes. I don't know if this is, yeah, I've heard there's maybe going to be one  in November. I don't know. Could be later. Could be later. Could be next year. I don't know. Could  happen. Could be 2023. Some people say 2028. We don't know. There is a new election cyber surge.  I actually asked you about this, Matt, before this show. The most meaningless combination of words  election cyber surge to deploy hacker army for 2020 vote.  This is out of the university of Chicago. They are starting to pair up security experts with,  because you know, the elections, one of the things that's interesting about US elections,  they're all local, right? Briana, they're not the whole thing. Absolutely. Yeah, it's all run out  of the state and the county. And it's one of the things that makes us harder to hack

Start time: 6833.84
End time: 6904.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because it's so heterogeneous. Everybody has different things. One of the things I did when  I went to turn in my papers on like when you're when you're a candidate, you've got to go get  enough signatures to get on the ballot. And from when I was a journalist, I always found the most  valuable person to know when you're reporting on town affairs is the county clerk or the circuit  people in that office. They will give you documents. I was like,  yeah, this seems like this should be a valuable person to know. So I took a day and I went to  every single place in my district and dropped off my signatures. So smart. But this is the scary  part. So I could not help but notice while I was there, the kind of hardware that they had in the  office. And it was a variety of operating systems. They had passwords taped right above it, where you  could just see it standing in the window. They had machines around Windows 95. And if you're  trying to this is Massachusetts, like we are one of the richer states in America. And it was a  horrible, horrible, terrifying mess. So you could get a million like hacker armies. We're still

Start time: 6905.12

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do they get federal funding? So there is like, yeah, there's like Help Vote America, Help America  Vote Act have a you know, is a thing that paid for a lot of election stuff. But it's also true  that there's a lot of there's actually a startup called Voting Works is trying to get certified as  sort of this super low cost, nonpartisan secure voting platform. That's basically kind of using  off the shelf hardware. But it's it's a patchwork. You've got machines that are really old in some

Start time: 6943.08
End time: 6996.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  cases. Well, and then the money is stretched because now we've got to do vote by mail, we've  got to do social distancing voting. I mean, there's a lot more expenses, which pulls money  away from things like security, updating systems. It's, it's, it's kind of, it's not going to be  good, I feel like. And of course, the president is doing everything he can to undermine the notion  of a free and fair election. He would really like everybody to think that because I think he sees  the writing on the wall. And he would really like everybody to think that when he loses, he didn't  really lose. So that's not going to help. I just feel like we're headed we're headed in a bad  direction. Does the USDS do anything with elections? So most of most at the federal level,

Start time: 6996.20
End time: 7018.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and we're mostly federal, that that's DHS, they have the it's the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure  Security Agency, so CISA. And so they they provide various assistance and things along those lines.  So we've, we've said we'd be happy to help if we can. And so we're, we stand at the ready,  if there's anything we can do, but mostly that's Homeland Security and CISA. And I would guess

You must have at least 12 letters in your  Twitter. Yeah, right. There is another area where White House is actually, and this is kind of a  little small part of the federal budget, but they're actually causing some problems in the  internet. There is something called the Open Technology Fund. Actually, no, I'm sorry. This  is a guy from the Open Technology Fund talking about the, I don't know what this is. It's the  US Agency for Global Media. It's Voice of America. They've got a new director at Voice of America who  is apparently withholding funds up to $20 million in funding approved by Congress for an internet  freedom organization called the Open Technology Fund. The OTF is being forced to halt 49 of their  60 internet freedom projects because they just don't have any more federal funding. That affects,  according to the head of the fund, about 80% of the group's work helping human rights and pro-democracy  advocates, journalists, and others in 200 countries, among other things. They help with signal.  They help with SecureDrop. They have a Red Team Lab, which is audited and patched more than 2,100  privacy and security vulnerabilities in tools like SecureDrop. This is a small, I mean, 20 million  doesn't sound like a lot, but this is a very important small group that's doing some, I think,  significant things. And along with the defunding of Voice of America, they're losing a lot of their  funding. Richard Stengel, he's the former editor of Time, he wrote a book called Information Warfare,

Start time: 7182.24
End time: 7218.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  which I cannot recommend enough. And like he met, he decided to go into government when the State  Department invited him in to be a deputy. And he wrote a book about, as you know, former editor of  Time, learning what Voice of America does, why we fund it, and why it's in our best interest. And  it was shocking, because I had no idea how critical this was. I think like you, like me,  you assumed it was a propaganda operation. No, that's what I thought. And it's certainly not.

Start time: 7218.94
End time: 7558.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's US news delivered to countries where they don't get open free news. Well, this is also kind  of what they're doing with the internet. They fund development of Tor. They fund development of  Signal. They distribute it to dissidents and journalists all over the world. So this is,  I think, very important. And the money's already been appropriated. That's what's kind of shocking.  And the administration is just withholding it. So just, you know, I don't think it's going to make,  you know, the top of the news on any cable news channel anytime soon. But since this is our  I want to take a little break. And then I want to talk about NVIDIA and ARM. I thought it was  just rumors. Maybe there's more to it. There's some fire behind this smoke. Our show today,  brought to you by Barracuda. Man, did you know that 91% of all cyber attacks start with an email?  This came home to me, I read there was a one-time news conference, and I was like,  start with an email? This came home to me, I read there was a wonderful piece in Bloomberg Business  Week last week about the Norsk Hydro attack, which happened last year. This is one of the  biggest aluminum manufacturers in the world. They have factories in the US, Brazil, headquarters in  Norway. They were brought down by ransomware. It was a big deal. You may remember the story when  it happened. But what really stuck out for me is how they got attacked. It was a conversation  hijack, an email from one of their customers sent to an internal address at Norsk Hydro to  an executive. The email was sent with a legitimate attachment, a payload, got intercepted on its way.  The payload got replaced with malware, which then got into the network, was opened by the executive.  He expected this email. He expected this attachment. It wasn't the attachment he was expecting.  Three months later, so that for three months, the hackers were internal on the network,  wandering around. Three months later, boom, all of the computers shut down with a big  warning saying, sorry, your data has been encrypted. Please contact us to negotiate the ransom.  Cyber attacks come through the email. Now, put yourself in the shoes of that Norsk Hydro executive,  the CISO or the CEO or the operations people, and think about your business and all your employees  at home now. They're getting email on their systems from a variety of sources. Maybe they're  going to be coming back to work at some point. One wrong click on the wrong email could cost you big  bucks, could cost you customers, could cost you your reputation. Email is the number one  vector for this stuff. Of course, the bad guys are taking advantage of this situation with  coronavirus related to phishing attacks. They impersonate the CDC or the WHO, the World Health  Organization. Researchers at Barracuda have observed a spike of 667% since February in COVID  related phishing attacks. And your employees, your poor employees, they're sitting there. They get an  email says, this is maybe it came from you, came from the boss. We just got a report from the CDC  about how to protect yourself during quarantine. Open this up. Except it's not from the boss or  from the CDC. It's from a bad guy. That's why you need Barracuda total email protection. I know you  know the name Barracuda. They're the number one guys in cloud enabled enterprise grade security  solutions. We've used their boxes for email, for network protection, for data, for applications.  They have a product that you will want to know about called total email protection. If you're  using Office 365, you can actually get a free threat scan of your Office 365 account completely  free from Barracuda at Barracuda.com slash twit. Barracuda is total email protection includes all  in one email security. You also get backup very important, right? Archiving. That's a legal  requirement in many industries. Plus you get AI based protection from spear phishing account  takeover and business email compromise. Most of these attacks now are targeted. And these  are guys are constantly evolving their attacks. You need protection that evolves  at least as fast to protect you. You'll get an automated incident response. That's important.  The faster you act, the faster you can limit the damage. You'll get an automated incident  response that gives you options to quickly and efficiently address attacks. You also get training  for your workforce security awareness training. Because after all, aren't your employees the first  line of defense? So help them do a better job recognizing these problems. Barracuda can help  by keeping these malware attachments and spear phishing attacks out of your email entirely.  Uncover the threats hiding in your inbox. It's waiting for you free a secure free email threat  scan of your Office 365 account. At least find out. I think what Barracuda figures is when you see  how bad it is, you'll be calling them Barracuda.com slash twit. Don't hide your head in the sand. Find  out Barracuda.com slash twit. At least there's help out there. The best kind of help. Barracuda,  your journey secured. They're really good at what they do. We're very happy to be using them.

Transcript:  For some reason, the notion of the Emmy is happening is just baffling to me. I don't know.  I guess maybe it's that I've been stuck inside for five months now, but just that  popular culture still exists and will be broadcast. It could be the last one because

Start time: 7886.40
End time: 7921.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  they're not making any new TV shows. So this is all pre-COVID content.  What is the Emmy's next year? It's going to be some YouTuber. It's going to be PewDiePie.  Actually, Quibi got a nomination or two. Didn't Quibi get 10?  That just shows how out of touch. It's just out of touch. Let's see what Quibi got nominated for.  I hope it's the golden-off one.  It is appropriate that they're going to stream these because most of this stuff's from streaming.

Transcript:  I bet you they get a lot of awards at these streaming virtual MEs.  Did you see Bernie Sanders wants to send you a mask?  Bernie wants to send three free masks to every American. It's the masks for all act.  I don't know if the government should spend $5 billion on producing masks to send to everybody.  Maybe they should. I don't know.

Start time: 8090.72
End time: 8108.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. And I'm dubious of it just because I know a lot of people who still haven't gotten  their stimulus checks. Yeah, that would be maybe more important.  If we're going to spend $5 billion in something and then a sizable percentage will not get it,  seems a little problematic.

Transcript:  You talk about a gender gap. In the United Kingdom, there are more CEOs named Peter  than there are female CEOs in the UK.  That's a weird stat, but I had to report it. More CEOs named Peter in the UK than there are  females with any name running companies.  That's all there is to say about that.  Comcast lost 477,000 subscribers last quarter. People had enough.

Start time: 8154.32
End time: 8157.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where could they go? Isn't that the whole thing?

Start time: 8157.70
End time: 8247.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's weird is they lost 477,000 TV viewers. They gained 323,000 high speed internet users.  So I figured there probably it's a push, right?  Because they've been raising the cost of the internet so much that they knew this was coming.  Why there's still a lot of little stories here. I think I should probably mention  before we wrap up the passing of Bill English. He was 91 years old. You may not know the name,  but he built the first computer mouse, Doug Engelbart, his colleague at the Stanford Research  Institute, SRI, came up with the idea. Engelbart was a fellow engineer. They made  the mouse. He helped put on the demo, the alt, what was it called? The demo to end all demos  where we saw for the first time a mouse graphical user interface, windows.  Doug Engelbart, I had the pleasure of interviewing on the screen, say it was 20 years ago, passed away  in 2013. He brought that original mouse, which is just a big wooden box with rollers and stuff.  But very cool. So the mother of all demos, which was December 9th, 1968, where we for the first  time saw the computing that we would all be using eventually, Bill English, one of the creators,  passed away at the age of 91. I thought we should mention that.

Start time: 8248.24
End time: 8336.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Leah, before we end the show, can I tell your listeners about something really big with  gaming that's happening tomorrow? That's awesome. Yes. So, so, okay. So analog, analog makes what  is the Rolls Royce of Super Nintendo and NES. Basically, it's not emulation. It's on FPGA chip.  So it's, it's basically a modern NES or Super Nintendo or Genesis that will work on a modern  TV, like through HDMI. But is it the same? Is it as good as it's really, really? So I'm a speed  runner. So like really small differences matter. It is the best way to play these for most people.  They've got something coming out tomorrow, which is the analog pocket. It is a $200 top of the line  Rolls Royce ultimate Game Boy that will play Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advanced  Games. And it has adapters coming out for it to for Neo Geo Pocket Sega Game Gear stuff. And that  goes on sale tomorrow at eight o'clock Pacific time and 11 o'clock my time and get your order in.  If you're interested in this at all. The last time they sold their Super Nintendo, you would buy it  for $500 on the day it came out and then you could sell it on eBay almost instantly for like  $1,500. They don't make any of them. Do I have to have my old cartridges? You do. You do.

Start time: 8338.54
End time: 8343.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 8343.92
End time: 8353.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  particular games, they have emulation cartridges. You can get on Etsy like Circle of the Moon is one  of my favorite games. You can just get a reproduction cartridge for $10. I have the E.T. cartridge, but

Start time: 8359.52
End time: 8377.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  cartridges. It will. And it also has something to hook it up to your television. So I'm the eighth  fastest player in the world. Super Mario Brothers 2 with Princess Peach. What? There's a version of  it on Game Boy. Why did you never tell me this? She treats about this all the time. I knew this.

Start time: 8377.42
End time: 8381.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I knew this. So there's a version of it that comes out. There's a lot of bells in Animal Crossing.

Start time: 8381.76
End time: 8393.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. No, there's a version of it for Game Boy Advance called Super Mario Advance. I can't wait  for this because I'm going to finally get the world record on this with Super Mario. Oh my God. Can you

End time: 8435.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I should be, I clearly should be, see I was following Space Cat Gal. Little did I know.  Brianna Woo on the Twitter and I could be reading about all this stuff.  That's cool. How much is that pocket going to set me? $200. That's nothing. It's a reasonable  investment. You're getting really good hardware. I think it's so cool that they do an FPGA.  So it really is an emulation. They do all of the features of the Nintendo chipset in the FPGA.

Start time: 8436.04
End time: 8459.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's correct. But I tell you, as someone that grew up on this stuff, is very sensitive to  the smallest differences. Like in speed running, a tenth of a second is a lot of time. And I can  tell you their emulation of it is really, really, really close to the point. I can barely tell.  So I think for almost anyone, this is going to be a way to play these games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  this. Oh, I screwed up big towards the end. So you could have done better. You mean this? Yeah. You  could be the seventh fastest if you do it again. All right. Yep. Wow. So I'm just thinking this is  all muscle memory at this point for you, right? No, it's deeply strategic. Like watch this. There's
