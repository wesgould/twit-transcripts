This is not as big an increase as usual, according to.  And again, it's expectation.  When is Apple's quarterly earnings?  I'm not sure when they're gonna announce.

Start time: 404.76
End time: 443.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was before and I think that the reason I found  all these stories is because I was starting to wonder  why is Tim Cook all of a sudden on the interview trail?  He did Brian Williams.  Right.  He did Bloomberg Business Week.  He's starting to give a bunch of CEO interviews  and usually that's a sign, right?  You tried out the CEO for a reason.  Maybe to say, hey, look, this next Steve Jobs is here.  Or maybe because you see trouble ahead.  He did, but he did it.  One of the things he told Brian Williams is,  we're gonna start making Macs in the US.  Looks like he'll be partnering.  They won't be doing their own factory.  They'll be partnering with a Foxconn or somebody like that.  Foxconn has already built a Brazilian plant.  Yeah, they want to build here.  There's no doubt about it.

Start time: 443.36
End time: 449.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 449.22
End time: 454.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Wouldn't that kind of be the opposite of the whole point  of the PR move of making computers in the United States?

Start time: 454.88
End time: 458.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, as long as they employ US workers,  I guess it's all right.  No, that's part of the deal.

Start time: 458.60
End time: 465.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they also have, they're gonna put,  I understand, at least $100 million  in the suicide prevention hotline as part of the deal.

Start time: 466.04
End time: 467.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You saw the nets they put up at Foxconn.

Start time: 468.56
End time: 476.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Suicide nets.  It's crazy.  But I think that because given the size  of the Foxconn employees and the-

Start time: 476.48
End time: 477.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They made a factory of 750,000 workers,

Start time: 478.22
End time: 483.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that kind of thing.  Yeah, they didn't have an abnormal number of suicides.  There's a lot of people there.  I don't know.

Start time: 483.68
End time: 484.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  This is dark.

Start time: 485.09
End time: 497.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  100 million, yeah, we're gonna move on.  $100 million, now Apple, remember,  is worth more than $100 billion, so that's not-  They have 120 billion in the bank.  Right.  Yeah, not worth, I'm sorry.  Did I say worth?  I meant they have cash positions more than $100 billion.

Start time: 497.36
End time: 500.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they got the most cash of any corporation  in the world right now.

Start time: 500.06
End time: 505.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So 100 million, big deal.  That's chicken feet.  Jump change.  What do you think it'll be?  Mac Pros, iMacs?

Start time: 507.34
End time: 508.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_12

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  to build computers in the United States  can we recall for one moment why they're doing that?  Why?  Because of all the problems with other plants.  In China?  Yes, and they're only doing it because it's profitable  for them to look like they care about American manufacturing  when it's really costing them money.  I mean, this is $100 million worth of PR.  That's all it is.

Start time: 681.60
End time: 709.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had a good column on Friday about this exact topic.  Saying the same thing?  Well, pretty much what she's just said.  But I think what's happened because the Chinese  have moved to so many robots that somebody added two  and two and said, we could put robots in a factory.  We could do robots.  We could do robots.  We do robots very well.  And Apple still has to pay the American taxes,  corporate taxes, so you might as well just  put some of the money in the country.  And it makes you look like a good guy.

In fact, for the last 20 years,  if you talk to anybody about injection molding,  they'll tell you that the Taiwanese  are world-class leaders.  We don't even come close to it.  Most of the injection molding stuff  has to be done through Taiwan.  And there's, I think, other skill sets  that they have developed slowly in China  that we just don't compete with at all.

They can violate it with impunity.  So remember when Steve Jobs had dinner with Barack Obama  a few months before his death, he brought up and said,  you've got to relax the regulatory environment  in the United States because we can't build plants here.

When Barack Obama joined Silicon Valley's  top luminaries for dinners in California last February,  the guest was asked to come with a question  for the president.  Steve Jobs interrupted President Obama  with an inquiry of his own.  I'm sorry, as Steve Jobs at Vaple spoke,  Obama interrupted him with an inquiry of his own.  What would it take to make iPhones in the US?  Why can't that work come home?  Jobs' reply was unambiguous.  Now, this is Jobs speaking.  Those jobs aren't coming back.

However, various academics  and manufacturing analysts estimate  that because labor is such a small part  of technology manufacturing,  paying American wages would add up to $65  in each iPhone's expense.  Since Apple's profits are often hundreds of dollars per phone,  they'd still get a healthy reward.  But 65 is not insignificant.  It doesn't sound right.

Transcript:  Mike Wainer-Rutting in the unofficial Apple weblog says  Apple's US plant could be highly automated.  With Apple poised to drop $100 million on US manufacturing,  it seems very likely that they would invest in intelligent machines  and lots of them.  That's certainly one way to bring labor costs down.  Big capital investment up front.  One of the problems Apple faces is that  in order to release an iPhone now,  they have to stockpile 10 million of them before they even go on sale.  And they're in more and more countries day of launch.  It's really a big production issue.  And this is where Tim Cook, of course, is his expertise.  That's his expertise.  I would think that they would,  really the motivation here is not so much to get it in the US,  but is to make it more efficient, make it faster,  be able to crank out more.  The other issue I would bet is leakage.  One of the problems of making in China is that  we're finding out what these phones are well before we get it.  Apple announces them because you can't control leaks in China.

I want to talk with you about Joshua Brentano in just a moment.  You heard where G4...  Well, let's talk about G4 when we come back.  But first I want to tell you about stamps.com.  This is a pro tip for people who do a lot of mailing.  Don't go to the post office.  Bad idea if you're trying to get stuff done.  This is amateur month at the post office.  When everybody goes in and gets stamps for their Christmas card list and the lines get long,  people tell, do I...  How much is a stamp?  No.  You're a pro mailer.  You're sending out a lot of stuff.  You're sending out invoices, bills.  You're sending packages.  You're sending out web packages you sell on eBay or Amazon.  You don't need that.  You don't need amateur hour.  You need the pro tip and that is stamps.com.  It means you never again will go to the post office.  You don't need it.  At stamps.com you could print your own postage with your computer, your printer.  It fills out all the forms for you, international, express priority.  It even sends out emails to the recipients with the tracking and all that.  Automatically pulls the data from your address book, your QuickBooks,  or if you're on Amazon, eBay, PayPal, Etsy, or if you're a seller on sites like that,  it'll get it from there.  Yeah, he wants us...  No, you don't get to lick the stamps anymore.  I'm sorry, Tristan, but the beauty of it is the mail carrier comes and takes it  and you don't get up from your desk.  It's all handled for you at stamps.com.  Now we've got a special no risk trial offer for those of you who do use mail a lot.  When you go to the front page you'll see an $80 offer.  Please don't take that.  Even though you may say, boy, that's a sweet looking scale,  that's a sweet looking scale.  I think that our scale, even though the picture is of an uglier scale,  I think we get the same scale.  I'm sure we do.  Click the radio microphone.  Watch this.  Enter the offer code TWIT, T-W-I-T, special offer for stamps.com.  And then that $80 offer turns into a $110 bonus offer.  Yes, it looks like the clunky scale, but I just think they forgot to update that picture.  I've got to think that.  You're going to get the beautiful streamlined new USB scale.  That's very handy because you just plop the letter or the package on that  and it tells you exactly how much postage.  So you never pay more or less than you need.  No more postage due, no more overpayment.  You also get $55 in postage coupons.  You get a $5 supply kit and, of course, a four week trial of stamps.com.  So please do that for me.  Stamps.com.  Click the microphone.  Use the offer code TWIT.  It really is the pro tip for people who do a lot of mailing.  Stamps.com.  So G4, we knew that they were throwing in the towel.

Mix and match.  And this is your last chance.  Because this goes off sale in one day and two hours.  And if you're listening to this tomorrow, I'm sorry.  TeeSpring, T-E-E-Spring.com slash twitmugs.

Transcript:  The Atlantic, interestingly enough, had a very insightful piece on why the daily didn't  work.  And it involved, you know, if you're going to put things behind a paywall and people  can't share them because it's all stuck in this big app.

Start time: 2525.86
End time: 2529.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was my problem with it.  The web...  Sharing content is the way...

Start time: 2529.72
End time: 2539.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, it's huge.  If you know anything about digital publishing, sharing content is the only way you're going  to survive to get enough eyeballs to sell enough ads to make your big turkey sail the  seas of, you know...

Start time: 2550.84
End time: 2568.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That's not that cheap, is it?  That would have worked, actually, you know, where that would work really, really well?  Asia.  In Japan and in China, people are really, really used to paying small amounts of money  on a regular basis for new content.  Guess what?  People are not used to that.  Yamerica.  So, of course, it wasn't going to work here.  Also...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also from that Atlantic article...  It's on the iPad and that's not great.  This is why they did it.  If you look at this graph from the Atlantic article, this is where you spend your attention.  The blue place is where you spend your attention.  7% print, but this is where advertising dollars, 25% advertising dollars.  Internet, 26% of your time, but only 22% of the advertising dollars.  And mobile, which is where the daily was aimed, 10% of your time, 1% of the ad dollars.  Yikes.  There's a problem.  The second error, he says, and by the way, this is Derek Thompson writing,  he says the second error is subtle.  The daily doubled down on the mobile trend to the expense of the sharing trend, as you said.  The social web is on the web, the daily isn't.  That was my big problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Anyway, you know, it's a great idea.  And media types love to criticize when all they didn't do well, they failed.  And we all love to say, I told you so.  But I mean, really, who's figured how to do tablet content well and profitably like Flipboard does it well.  But do they make money?  You know, and I was talking to them the other day.  They're trying to find really great, interesting ways to make money.  But and it's not really around content.  It's around products and all the other Flipboard like products that are coming out.  They're like, OK, how can we bring retailers in because we need a way to subsidize all this content.  But subsidizing content has always been a problem with media.  That's why we have a news hole and then advertisers.  I'm going off.

Start time: 2692.82
End time: 2708.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's interesting that you should mention Flipboard because almost invariably when I say the daily failed, people said, yeah, Flipboard killed it.  It's free.  It's a much more varied source and it has sharing.  And it, by the way, looks better and it works.  John Gruber said the daily failed simply because it was a lousy app.  It took forever to download each.

Start time: 2708.84
End time: 2714.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. No, you apparently had to download the entire thing just to read one little article.  Yeah.  That's no good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I think the daily idea of it is rather charming.  Remember when the newspaper was the cool thing and you could sit down with the Washington Post or the New York Times or whatever and you could drink your coffee and spoon with your man friend and, you know, get the news of the day and relaxed.  Environment where it's not all coming at you every 30 minutes, something distracting you from your day's work when you could sit down with the newspaper.

Start time: 2740.53
End time: 2753.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can still do that if you want to.  I sit down with Flipboard, but it's not as aesthetic.  I have the New York Times subscription.  I do that.  No, I get it.  And here's the problem.  For one thing, it piles up.  You feel guilty about all the papers and you only read about one or two a week.

Start time: 2754.14
End time: 2757.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And you can't use your iPad as kindling no matter what.  Right. Well, you could.

Start time: 2758.05
End time: 2762.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, you can use this.  I think so could these New York Times and Kerosene and they're pretty good to start a fire.  But that's about it.

Start time: 2763.38
End time: 2772.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On the other hand, if you look at Flipboard, the signal noise ratio is not as good as, say, something like a curated newspaper or magazine or the Daily.  Well, have you seen Circa?  What's Circa?

Start time: 2772.72
End time: 2810.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh, you guys.  You guys and you think you know your new media.  All right.  So Matt Galligan.  We never said that.  Matt Galligan is this nifty startup guy originally from the boulder scene.  And he came back and he was like, yeah, Flipboard is really cool, but we need curation.  So I'm going to hire all these editors who are smart and who have great sources to go around and find the best, most interesting news.  And then we're going to categorize it and whatever.  And it's kind of it's like a very edited, you know, best of the web version of Flipboard where it's not just robots.  It's also smart people.  You know, one of the ways you curation is one of the best things.  Absolutely.

Start time: 2810.72
End time: 2826.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And one of the ways I try to make Flipboard be more curated is by the Twitter list that I follow and stuff.  But there's still a lot of junk in there.  Unfortunately, Circa is iPhone only.  So I won't be able to put it on my Galaxy Note.  How do you like that note?  This phone is dynamite.  I love it.  Selling like hotcakes, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the, because it has a removable back cover so you can change the battery.  Nice feature.  By the way, I understand they're going to stop doing that.  Really?  Some phones are doing it.  The new HTC 8X does not.  The Lumia does not.  And I think that's a mistake.

Start time: 2863.00
End time: 2877.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's so funny I realized one of the reasons I like the Galaxy Note 2 is because I don't use it as a phone.  I don't use it as a computer for me.  I very rarely, if I do talk on the phone it'll be Bluetooth or whatever.  Hello, Mom?  Yeah, I don't do that.  I don't make it, well, you don't even have a cell phone.  No, I have one now.  You do?

Transcript:  I just used the one that I found at Google I.O. last year.  It's a Nexus.  Yeah, well I have to give it back.  But I just found it because it was sitting in a drawer in the newsroom.  How did you find it?  We have a drawer in the newsroom full of devices and there was the Lumia that was in there  and we've got a really old Nokia candy bar and I have an old Blackberry in there too.  The newsroom drawer of dead devices.  It's a whole thing.  It's nice that they...  I pulled the Lumia out and I was going to use that because I thought, oh Windows Phone 8 is so pretty.  But you used this instead.  Yeah, well the Lumia one had that battery issue.  Remember where they would power down all the way and then you couldn't get them back on again?  The Lumia bug?  Oh, I heard about this.

So I booted this thing and it started giving me recommendations for nearby restaurants  and what I should go check out.  That's probably an ad, right?  No, no, there's a whole slew of them.  They were all 60 miles away.  No, they were all in the area.  That's a bust.  It was pretty good.  It's smart.  It does a good job.  It does a good job.

Transcript:  But I think the Google Now is useful.  And I have to say, for a long time, I've been saying Google Plus, they blew it, it's dead,  nobody's using it.  They just added a feature that may completely bring it back to life.  Tell me.  Communities thing?  Yeah.  Also, why Vic Gundotra is no longer allowed to tweet.  How about that for a tease?  The first word from our friends at Citrix, in business, you probably have meetings, don't  you?  You got to.  Everybody does.  They're kind of the thing people don't like.  But if you're going to have meetings, I can tell you they're much more compelling, much  more interesting when you use GoToMeeting.  First of all, you get screen sharing.  So you can see, you can all be on the same page.  Literally, you can see what the other person in the meeting wants to show you, whether  it is PowerPoint presentation, drawings, documents you're collaborating on.  It's great for training.  But you can also see them with this new HD faces, which I really, really like.  It makes meetings much more personal.  GoToMeeting is easy to set up, easy to use, works across all platforms, Mac, PC.  You can attend meetings on an iPhone, an iPad, an Android device.  You can even present and share from an iPad.  In fact, if you have an iPad, it'll use the camera on the iPad, the microphone on the  iPad.  You can turn the audio off.  I don't need that.  You can use the earphones on the iPad and you can have a meeting in the park.  Really gives you the flexibility to go where you want, do what you want, and still participate  in company meetings and so forth.  If you do use meetings in business, and I thought we could get away with not, you know  how much I hated meetings.  I would go to the screensavers editorial meetings every day and I just hated it.

Because you, so for instance, I joined an espresso community, Mark Prince of coffeegeek.com has  an espresso community.  And what you do is it's kind of like Google groups, except it's because it's Google Plus,  it's much more feature rich.  You create discussions.  He has one on photos of espresso.

Start time: 4168.52
End time: 4188.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I don't know why everybody is not like pitting the tail on the donkey here.  The reason Twitter and Instagram are having a problem is because Instagram is owned by Facebook.  That's pretty straightforward.  And I think anybody who would look at the situation would have seen that coming, I don't know, like a billion months ago.  So Instagram was purchased by Facebook.

Who really listens to CEOs and says, oh, okay, sure, yeah, that sounds good.  You know, Tim Cook or Kevin Systrom or whomever, they say what they need to say in the moment to make themselves and their companies look good.  But in reality, they do what's profitable for the business, and it doesn't make sense for a Facebook product to play nicely with Twitter.  Except for users.

Start time: 4222.65
End time: 4276.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You make me sound so angry.  Remember users, right?  What about them?  Well, I would like...  They don't pay for anything.  So what Instagram disabled was this...  They were supporting the Twitter cards, which is what Twitter wants everybody to do.  What?  Twitter has an API.  They want content that is going to be on Twitter.  In this case, so I take a picture of you eating a fine brownie, and I post it on my Instagram, and I take a picture of you eating a fine brownie.  I post it on my Instagram, and I check the box that says cross post to Twitter.  So then there will be a tweet from me with a link to the Instagram thing.  If you're using the Twitter client or an appropriately configured Twitter client, third party client, the picture will show up in line with the tweet in an appropriate way because Instagram was supporting this API that Twitter has published about how to publish photos so that they show up.  Instagram just disabled that.  So now you're going to get something haphazard or maybe not an image at all, but just a link.

Start time: 4276.86
End time: 4294.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, initially you're basically getting broken images or missing links.  So is there any legitimacy to what a lot of places, including Twitter, are doing where they're trying to get people to not use third party clients or basically to be forced?  Instagram says, hey, we want everybody to come back to Instagram so we get the data so we have the advertising opportunity.

Start time: 4294.66

Start time: 4309.74
End time: 4322.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not arguing.  And I do believe there's a puppet hand from Facebook that's telling Instagram what to do.  But is there any legitimacy to other actions by social media companies where they are trying to claim that they want people to come to their site to get the data?

Start time: 4322.74
End time: 4345.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I actually talked with Twitter a lot, a lot, a lot about them pulling back the API.  And it really wasn't anything like this.  I think they're actually trying to get people to use Twitter cards in the same way that Twitter is trying to get people to use Open Graph and Timeline.  I don't think they're discouraging that at all.  Twitter is discouraging people from making Twitter clients, which Instagram never does.

Start time: 4345.66
End time: 4350.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 4356.04
End time: 4371.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I mean, it's frustrating because they've either made it expensive to make a Twitter client or expensive to have any kind of a large group of Twitter.  It seems like every Twitter client that Twitter has bought has been lessened and made less useful.  Absolutely.  Tweet deck and Tweety.

Start time: 4371.78

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, they just damaged them.

Start time: 4374.49
End time: 4397.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because what Twitter really wants is you to use their web page.  And by the way, the web page is where these cards, these Twitter cards work.  And Instagram is saying, no, we want you to go to our web page, not Twitter's web page.  So it's a little spiff, but a fight between a little tiff between the two social media giants.  But I loved the chatter.  I don't have his handle who said, Geez, social media should not be this exhausting.  Web 5089. I agree with you.

End time: 4665.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 4666.14

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 4669.76

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It can be appealed.  It will be appealed.  This is patent 949, which was one of the relevant patents in the Samsung Apple case.  All 20 claims were ruled invalid, which means Apple, according to Florian Miller and Foss patents, will have to make an unusually strong case.

It was Microsoft because I remember I was covering the Oracle Google case and some Florian Miller, as an analyst, I'm sorry, I interviewed him one time.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by squarespace.com.  Got a great email from Keith.  I'm going to read it again if I can find it.  He is a new Squarespace user.  And I guess he uses his Squarespace site.  He's a DJ.  And he uses his Squarespace site in his work in some way.  I'm not sure exactly how it is.  But he said he was a little concerned when Hurricane Sandy was heading towards the East Coast  because he was afraid his site would go down.  So he offloaded all the images on his site.  He knew he would need it.  I'll read it, actually.  It says, Dear Leo, I've been using Squarespace since June of this year.  When the hurricane hit New York City, I, like others, got the email saying that  that Pier 1, Squarespace's colo, had been hit hard.  I remember that day you saying over and over in your podcast that Squarespace sites never go down.  I watched and even took the precaution of moving over 5,000 graphics from my Squarespace site to photo bucket.  I run an online radio station and virtual nightclub and rely on these graphics heavily.  We kept an eye on things and suffered only 35 seconds of downtime for the entire time  that Pier 1 had a flooded basement.  See, the generators were in the basement at Pier 1.  There was one generator, a lone generator, on the roof.  And Anthony Castellana, the CEO of Squarespace, and other Squarespace employees  basically created an old-fashioned bucket brigade to move fuel from the basement to the roof  to keep the emergency generators running.  I have never seen, Keith goes on to say, such determination to keep a data center online in my life.  This one act of putting the customers first will keep me as a Squarespace member for as long as I run a website.  I recently added Squarespace 6 to the site and I love how they don't charge me a penny more  to basically have two websites in one.  I use Hover for my domain registration. I'm very pleased with that service as well.  I just want to thank you for recommending a great service like Squarespace  and wanted all the Twit listeners to know there's nothing like a Squarespace site.  Squarespace is the best hosting, no doubt about it.  You cannot bring a Squarespace site down, but more than that,  because on top of it is the best content management system out there.  It is fast, it is easy, it is beautiful.  In fact, if you're an artist, a photographer, a designer,  a Squarespace site is a great way to show off your work, your portfolio,  because it's going to look as good as you do.  You're an aesthetic person. You want an aesthetic looking site.  And Squarespace is so great. No mobile site necessary,  because all of their sites look great on all screens.  They do a lot of work. It's called mobile-ready responsive design.  That's the industry term.  HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, all the whiz-bang features of great modern websites,  but you don't have to know any of that. It will do it all automatically.  Now, if you do, they have a fantastic developer platform,  so you can do all the coding you want.  They have syntax, color coding, and all of that.  Your neckbeard boy will love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can publish to and from social media with a few clicks.  300 fonts using Google Fonts. That's kind of a nice feature.  You like Google Fonts, right, Aaron? Isn't that cool?  The ability to use real fonts on a website. Just fantastic.  I want you to try it. Here's the deal.  You don't even need our name or code or anything to try it free for two weeks.  Don't need a credit card. Just go to squarespace.com.  Click the button that says, give it a try.  After two weeks, if you decide to buy, I want you to use the offer code TWIT12.  You'll save 10% off your first purchase.  Now, let me just talk briefly about Squarespace pricing,  because they have simplified this. They used to have many different plans.  It's really simple now. There's basically two plans.  There's the standard plan and the unlimited plan.  When you buy a year, it's $8 a month for standard, $16 a month for unlimited.  That's the one I recommend, and here's why.  Unlimited pages, galleries, and blogs.  So that's what Keith was talking about.  You can have as many websites as you want on one account, basically.  Unlimited bandwidth.  That means even if suddenly you become the hottest thing since sliced bread,  that could cost you more. No bills for bandwidth.  Unlimited storage. That's great for a photographer.  You can upload as many pictures as you want.  Each of your clients can have a different site on Squarespace.  I mean, just unlimited contributors.  When you sign up for the year plan on either of these plans,  they will give you a domain name for free, and they'll hook it up.  I just think this is such a great deal.  And by the way, if you use the offer code TWIT12,  it's an even better deal because you get 10% off.  That's why it's best to go for your plan to get the most savings.  TWIT12, the offer code. It's hip to be square. Squarespace.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just Google Docs on steroids.  Google Docs for groups, essentially.  They had a free version and a paid version.  The paid version was what you wanted to run a business on.  A lot of smaller businesses and families and people who just wanted to run URLs with email  and such were running them on the free version.

Transcript:  So we use Google Apps as a business.  So if you go to mail.twit.tv, what you'll get is a Gmail that is a Google Apps account.  The Twitter Google Apps account.  Actually, it's funny because, Chad, don't we still use our free Google Apps account  for the rundowns and stuff that we share?  I don't think that's on the Apps domain.

Start time: 5649.93

Start time: 5698.42

Transcript:  I want to know what you think of this.  So Reed Hastings, CEO of Netflix, in June Netflix hits a billion streams.  This is very controversial.  He puts this out on his Facebook page.  He has 200,000 subscribers on his Facebook page.  So he just does a status message.  For the first time, we streamed a billion hours in June.  Right.  SEC has filed a Wells notice saying we're going to prosecute.  Yeah.  Because this is material information that should have been published to stockholders  in an official way or a press release.  Channels, yeah.

Start time: 5744.52
End time: 5750.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That's a press release.  No, no, no.  Because the media ended up covering it the same way they would with a press release.  Sure they did.

Start time: 5750.58
End time: 5795.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's an out that he could have got out of.  There's a process that you could have done the next day, which would include doing the  official press release because you have to do these things through channels.  It's just one of the rules.  And they didn't do that.  That's the real screw up.  They had 24 hours to fix this problem.  And so what they did was they let the media itself create an unofficial press release,  which wasn't a press release, because I as an investor do not have access to his Facebook account.  Yes, you do.  It's public.  Well, I don't use Facebook.  And I don't expect to be finding, even though most smart investors, they got Twitter accounts,  they got Facebook, they're looking at everything.  But officially the channel is not an accepted channel as far as the SEC is concerned.  So this violation is going to be a fine.

Start time: 5796.02
End time: 5805.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says there was press coverage, as there are many reporters and bloggers among you,  my public followers.  Some of you reposted.  Again, we did not issue a press release or file an 8K as required.

Start time: 5806.64
End time: 5809.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  Curiously though, if you go to these analyst meetings, this is the thing that bothers me.  It happens all the time.  It happens all the time.  It happens with Facebook.  Quote unquote analyst meetings.  And so if you're not invited to the analyst meeting, then they get all this inside dope,  you know, and then they get to distribute it anyway.

Start time: 5837.66

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Analysts before the Facebook IPO were secretly warned by Mark Zuckerberg and other Facebook  executives that they were not going to have a good quarter.  They didn't publish that publicly.  It happens all the time.  Meanwhile, Reed Hastings, who first of all is not that material they had already told  investors were probably going to hit a billions hours next month.  Right, it wasn't a surprise.  Wasn't a big surprise.  Posts it for 200,000 people and he's going to get a fine.

Start time: 5860.54

Transcript:  Now, the SEC points out the stock price went up after this.  A lot.  He says, well, it's just a coincidence.  The stock price was driven by a Citigroup research report.  That's bogus.  No way.  I have to say if the stock price goes up because of something you say on a social network and  not in a legal forum in a way that you're supposed to, I could maybe, I don't know.

Transcript:  All right, we're going to take a break.  I want to talk a little bit about getting rid of your gadgets with Gazelle.  We got a box going together now because I realize this is ridiculous.  I have thousands of dollars of cell phones and iPods in my drawer.  Gazelle, the whole idea is you've got money.  Just golden them, their desk drawers.  Everybody I know, every geek I know has a gadget drawer or closet or a room full of  old gadgets and just too much trouble to figure out what to do with it, hand it off to family  and friends.  You should be going to gazelle.com and get cash for that smartphone, iPad or iMac.  Cash so you can get the new stuff.  Why let this stuff just fritter away there?  You got an iPhone 4S just lying around the house.  You're saying, oh man, I just, let's see, what is it?  Is it a 32 gig unlocked AT&T?  210 bucks.  Bam!  210 bucks.  That's what they'll pay you for.  What else you got?  You got a third generation iPad lying around.  You'd like to buy the new one?  Sure.  AT&T, 32 gigabytes, $300.  Now these are guaranteed for 30 days and they pay the shipping on anything worth more than  a buck.  So what you do is you say, you add all this to your cart and then you say, okay, send  me a box.  You get this nice box with the mailing label of shipping all prepaid.  Throw this stuff in there, package it up, send it off and they will send you a PayPal  credit, a check or my advice to you, get the Amazon gift card because they'll bump it 5%  if you get an Amazon gift card.  I guess they're rebating the affiliate fee or something like that.  Nice.  Yeah.  This is a nice run company.  Then no wonder they've paid almost $50 million to over 400,000 customers.  I just want you to remember when you put your Christmas tree out on the curb and the Cub  Scouts come and get it, you could also be putting a box out there full of cell phones  and the Cub Scouts would come and get it and give you nothing or gazelle and give you hundreds  and hundreds of dollars.  G-A-Z-E-L-L-E gazelle.com.  If you were smart, if actually I think they used to do this, they used to, I don't know  if they still do, they do like charity things where you can put together a gazelle drive,  a gadget drive.  I don't know if they still do that.  One million gadgets traded.  Where's my phone?  I want to play ingress.

Transcript:  Some of them I guess you would use for the body text, but mostly it's for headlines and  graphic design.  There's a lot of body text fonts here.  The point of this is you don't have to know that the person has that font.  It will automatically download if they don't and display properly.  And a lot of these are copies of...

End time: 6426.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, you don't have to.  What if they do?  They don't have to.  Sometimes because they can't get a good copy, but if they have a real good copy of the font,  they'll just roll it out, call it something different, and then you're in business.  This has been a big scandal amongst the font designers forever.  Apple did that when they first released the Mac.

Start time: 6426.56
End time: 6437.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They had what, New York, Geneva instead of Helvetica?  Right, Geneva is a good example.  New York was Times, New Roman, but they just called it New York.  Right.  That's kind of sad, really.

Start time: 6437.54
End time: 6446.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what they all do.  And I think there's a lot of these types of fonts in here.  What do you think of this?  Although Unseal Antigua, I believe, is a real font.  No, they have real, because they bought monotypes.

Start time: 6446.54

Start time: 6573.84
End time: 6581.67

Start time: 6583.40
End time: 6589.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 6589.56
End time: 6600.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  They position Pandora in such hot waters because artists are figuring out they're not making money from Pandora.  So when they figure out they're not making money from Spotify either, I think Spotify will be in the same position that Pandora's been in for like a decade.

Start time: 6600.86
End time: 6607.54

Start time: 6611.58
End time: 6629.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No?  What happened was Pandora is based off of the old web streaming radio agreements.  And so that's how they get around it.  They didn't write any.  Nothing new.  Spotify went to modern agreements.  Yes, yes.  They signed agreements.

Start time: 6637.60
End time: 6647.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's a scam.  Uber's a scam?  No, I don't think it's a scam per se.  I just think it's like what different, there's plenty of people that have car services in person.  Oh no, no, no, it's awesome.

Start time: 6647.83
End time: 6687.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've just not used it.  You know I was talking to the...  No, I haven't used it.  You've got to use it.  So what you do is you get an app on your iPhone.  You're standing outside a bar.  It's late at night.  You press a button.  First of all, you launch Uber.  It says there are five Ubers within five minutes of you.  You see the map of where they are.  You press a button.  It calls one.  It says this guy's on his way.  They show you a map as he's coming so you know exactly where he is.  That's cool.  I'm not saying it's not cool.  It shows you his picture.  Right?  So you know when he arrives, it's a nice black car.  They're all very nice cars.  You get in.  He takes you where you're going.  They pay the tip and the fee.  It's all done automatically.  You don't have to give them any money.  You don't have to have any cash.  They've already got your credit card on file.  You get out of the car, say thanks, see you.  It's really spiffy.

Start time: 6687.64
End time: 6689.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_12

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, probably during Sandy.  Yeah, however...

Start time: 6696.58
End time: 6707.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well that is bad.  They have on-demand pricing.  Okay?  This is a scam.  Demand-driven pricing.  So when there are fewer cabs, they will charge more money.  And so during Sandy, they were...  Raking it in.

Start time: 6707.74
End time: 6731.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Raking it in.  Well, they gave them, I think, one day where Uber was taking on all the extra expense to  keep cabs out on the road and not passing it on to the consumers.  However, okay, so in New York, I believe, and in Chicago, maybe they've already started  cracking down on Uber because the local taxi cab people were getting...  That's the problem.  ...kissy.  So I had an email conversation with the San Francisco taxi czar.  You did?  Yes.

Start time: 6731.72
End time: 6733.42

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  ...Uber lets unlicensed limo drivers who have not passed a regulator's criminal background  check drive unlicensed vehicles that had not passed a safety inspection.  So basically...  The Uber's...  ...he's trying to discredit the entire operation.  And that's not true.

Start time: 6747.00
End time: 6760.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uber's position is that we use licensed drivers.  And they do.  They're licensed with the firm they work for, not for Uber.  We're using excess time that they have.  These are licensed drivers and licensed cars.  And what they do is they come to us and say, I've got free time.

Start time: 6760.50
End time: 6766.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But they're not paying off the city of San Francisco or New York.  Oh, that would be...  Yes, that would be...  And it's not just New York.

Start time: 6766.74
End time: 6775.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's Washington, Vancouver, and Toronto's now just charged them.  And then what you're seeing is the entrenched taxi cab interests are saying, wait a minute,  you didn't pay to a VIG here.

Start time: 6776.50
End time: 6786.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's also...  They also...  They're not paying for a medallion.  In New York City, a medallion...  It's expensive.  But the family who owns a medallion can rent it out and basically live quite well.

Start time: 6786.82
End time: 6793.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But remember, this is black car, not yellow cab.  I understand that.  But they're taking yellow cab customers because it's more convenient.

Start time: 6793.62
End time: 6798.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_12

Start time: 6798.74
End time: 6826.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's more convenient up until the point where it either becomes grossly more expensive than  a yellow cab or the numbers of people using the service get up to the yellow cab.  Because another problem is this is so much a San Francisco problem and not a New York  problem.  Because in New York, getting cabs is relatively easy in New York.  Getting a cab in San Francisco is a nightmare.  And this makes me think of one of those...  This is like one of those startups that like, I'm under 30, I hate Muni, and I can't get  a taxi cab.  I can get funded for this.

Start time: 6827.16
