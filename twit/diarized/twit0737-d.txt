Start time: 747.06
End time: 754.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, using the Apple app, but you, it'll only come on when it detects no movements.  You've got to put it on a tripod and then it'll let you pull the little dial all the  way to 28.

Start time: 755.34
End time: 786.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Scooping Google a little bit on that one because of course astrophotography is one  of the things, uh, Google talked about in the sneakily released.  Actually, this is an interesting question.  There was a video promo video of the pixel four, which isn't out yet.  Google presumably announcing it October 15th.  And there was a video that was leaked.  Somehow somebody got it and showed it and showed astrophotography.  And there is, I think some people think Google intentionally does these leaks.  I'm sure they do.  Do you?

Start time: 786.64
End time: 790.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They said, well, because of all the links, we're going to show you the back of the  phone.  Yeah, right.  But this one was, nobody took credit for this.  This was a leaked.  What is that you have?  Oh, I think that's the astrophotography.

Start time: 800.72
End time: 818.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, so you did it.  You put it on the tripod.  Yeah.  And then if you tap the little yellow icon, it gives you a dial and you can pull  it down to zero to turn night mode off.  Normally up to three to go to full night mode, but if it's totally stable, you  can pull it all the way to 28 and then just sit there while it slowly dissolves all  the stars in the sky, which is pretty neat.

Start time: 819.26
End time: 823.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 823.48

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  know, we did, we did a test.  We took out the P 30 pro, the Samsung Galaxy Note 10, the pixel three and the  iPhone and the iPhone 11.  And just to make sure it wasn't me, I brought like a head to a houseman of Android  central and Michael Fisher, who does Mr.  Mobile.  And we all three did it together.  And the way I would sum it up is so Huawei has magnificent hardware, absolutely  stunning hardware with terrible color science and algorithms.  And Google has mediocre camera hardware with the world's most spectacular  algorithms.  Samsung is just, I don't know, they're like trying their best.  They turned my beard into plastic, which was very unusual.

Start time: 859.00
End time: 867.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 868.28
End time: 886.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's like Schmiery and, and, um, Apple's got pretty good hardware and pretty good  algorithms, not as good hardware as Huawei, not as good algorithms as Google,  but because they have both of them, like a hundred percent photo pixels and a  really good light intake, plus pretty good algorithms.  They managed to compete with Google.  And I think that that's a pretty interesting, honestly, for normal people,

Start time: 886.78
End time: 892.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  they'd be happy with any of those.  Really?  I don't think they're going to, it's only if you compare them side by side that you

Transcript:  Yeah, actually I wish he'd gone into shadow cause that would have been  an interesting, uh, test.  Yeah.  Nevertheless, that's impressive.  I agree with you, Louise.  I think, uh, especially, and it's not out yet, but they showed this on stage  at the Apple event when filmic pro comes out, which is a third party app.  It will, apparently this is a feature in iOS 13.  It will be able to shoot video from two or more of the lenses.  So you can have the front, the selfie cam on at the same time as you have  the, the, the back camera on and tape, tape an interview and record both sides  of the interview and then in editing, you can, you don't have to do a second,

Start time: 1012.06

Transcript:  So I got conflicting information on it.  A couple of people said it was limited to two, but the demo I did was shooting  all four, so I don't know if that's what the real capability is or if that was  something they're experimenting with and are not sure they're going to launch.  But the demo I did with it was four cameras.

Transcript:  So imagine that.  I mean, I'm thinking of taking this to CES because then I could shoot a close  up, a wide angle.  I mean, I could, and I could have my image on there.  I mean, that's your reaction shots, Leo.  What that's a testament to actually the speed of the processor, right.  And the speed of the storage that it can do.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, okay.  So here's the scenario, Louise.  You put them together later.  Yeah.  I'm at CES.  I get them all recording.  And then when I edit it, I can have a wide angle of me standing there with a guy.  I can have a picture of me asking him questions, close up of the product.  I can have all of that.  And then, and then our editors pick and choose.  It's like a four camera shoot.  Of course the camera is in the same position.  So it's not as good as a four camera shoot, but it's cool.

I can tell you there, I can tell you in newsrooms, there's a lot of discussion  about this particular camera and the use of it for journalism and being able, as  you said, you know, to do interviews, to show events as they happen and have  narration at the same time.  A lot of photo journalists are really interested in this.

Transcript:  Well, I'm sure all of you have done this.  I certainly have.  You know, when you're going out in the field to do reporting, very often  there's, there's, you go with a camera crew, but there's only one camera.  And you're doing an interview.  So you have to do the dumbest thing, which is you, you, you ask your subject  quiet, the cameras pointed at the subject.  You ask him a bunch of questions.  He records his answers.  Then you go, thank you very much.  Goodbye.  The camera goes, goes and starts pointing at you.  And now you have to pretend you have to go, mm hmm.  Uh huh.  Yep.  Hmm.  Oh, you have to pretend you're listening to the guy, which is totally  phony, uh, because you can't, cause you only have one camera.  So you can't get that shot unless you do it twice.

Compell me to buy another thousand dollar phone that I know the screen is going  to break, like I know there's going to be problems with it.  Uh, yeah, I don't know.  I just don't, I, I haven't found something.  That really want, you know, compelled me to upgrade.  I think now the phone, the phone's also like really look the same.  I will say the one thing that kind of was compelling to me is I think they did the  colors really nicely this year.  Uh, like I, the new problem, but that's like a terrible reason to buy a phone.  Great.  Exactly.  It's like, but yeah, show us, show us the color of your current phone.  So I have some stickers on it.

And the big one is the battery, right?  That is huge.  Yes.  And that is a huge thing for a lot of people.  And I think that's a, but I, yeah, I just don't know like how much better is your  Instagram going to be, even though these cameras are a lot more powerful, but I do  think, you know, for teens filming TikToks, having that front and back facing camera  honestly might be a game changer.  Like there's going to be new forms of content because of that.  And that might be something that people have FOMO about because there are a lot of,  uh, kinds of TikToks and a lot of YouTube videos and these sorts of things that have  that exactly as you said, the fake two shots because it's only one eye.

Transcript:  Well, I mean, they're, they're a big, uh, consumer base, right?  Like you gotta get it's hooked and you're like, it's going to,  it's what do they want for Christmas?  I think that's going to be a big driver.  And I think a lot of teens too, and like younger people are the ones who are like,  Hey, mom, dad, like you need to upgrade your phone because you need to have X  feature or whatever.  Right.  I think it's moms who were like, you know, my mom still has an iPhone six.  And like, if I don't tell her you need to upgrade, like, why would she?

Start time: 1445.54
End time: 1449.16

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So one big thing about upgrading, particularly this year, I was not going to get,  I've had a 10 S max.  I was not going to get, uh, the pro max until I saw what the camera could do.  And I became really intrigued by that.  I also was really interested in the, the extra five hours of battery life in the,

Start time: 1474.00
End time: 1484.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  in the max, but, but also let me ask you though, uh, Renee and, and, and Dwight,  cause you've got it.  Have you noticed like the battery?  I mean, I guess we haven't had it long enough to haven't had it long enough.

Start time: 1485.80
End time: 1519.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I, you know, the, what finally, the thing that actually tipped me over was  I'm on the iPhone upgrade plan and I've been paying, you know, per month for, you  know, a couple of models now.  And I definitely wanted to get the one next year because it likely will have five G.  I still would be paying on my 10 S max through next year.  Why not go ahead and keep paying and have the newer one?  And so I went ahead and did it with all the other factors.  And I think the way people pay for it now has become a real factor in terms of why  or whether they upgrade.

Start time: 1520.29
End time: 1552.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Like I finally paid off my seven and that's why I don't want to get another one  because I'm like, I don't want to add that bill.  And that's an interesting point because I wonder, will people consider that charge  when they're thinking about these new Apple services?  Like, will they think about, well, I'm already paying $40 to my iPhone a month.  I really want to pay another 20 bucks for gaming or and others are like, you know,  Apple News and all this other stuff.  Like, I wonder if people will psychologically consider what they're already paying to  Apple or if they won't, you know, they'll consider those things the way that they  think about Netflix or whatever, which is what Apple wants.

I will never be able to go back in time and get better photos of them.  So every year I want to take the absolute best photos I can.  And that's when they see a compelling camera update, they take it.

Transcript:  So get a good camera for crying out loud.  What are you doing with a iPhone?  She's I mean, they don't want that.  Carrie, it's easy to carry.  You don't have a wrist strap for my camera.  I just put it on my wrist.  Yeah, actually, I shouldn't say that because I dropped my brand new camera.  The first day I had it, it landed on my brand new lens, snapped the hood off.  I have to bring the lens in for repair and the cameras a little scratched up.  So maybe I should I should stick with the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  important. I think I think I think Louise actually is probably speaking for a lot of  people with it. You know, my phone is good enough and I don't feel like I need to do  it. It's paid off and I don't really see the the benefit to it.  But, you know, the one you have, Louise, the seven plus, great.  That's a great camera.

Transcript:  Right. Well, I want to I want to address that question you asked, which is.  When do people stop saying, I can't pay yet another monthly fee because Apple's  counting on you buying TV plus and arcade and Apple News, Apple Music.  They've got a lot of monthly fees.

Start time: 1669.92
End time: 1693.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, like you can be paying basically one hundred dollars at this point for your  iPhone plan. Plus, if you're getting all of the extra services.  Right. And I don't know if people are making that connection because that $40  payment is showing up on your cell phone bill.  So I don't know if a lot of people really realize like what's happening when they go  and sign up and get the contract and get the phone or whatever.  I don't know if they really understand worse.

Start time: 1693.42

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No. So like I remember, you know, when I was younger and I wanted to subscribe to  comic books or magazines or you go to the newsstand and you could never buy every  magazine or every comic on the newsstand.  So you had to pick and choose the ones that are most important to you.  And I got like three or four subscriptions a year, mostly on my birthday or the  holidays. And that was it.  I had to make do and you never got the biggest cable package.  You had to choose sort of the one that fit your budget.  And there was no streaming music.  So you had to pick which CDs every month you could buy.  I think our attitudes have changed and that now we just expect everything.  And music has already been smashed down.  So music is instead of buying a bunch of CDs every month is one rate.  Magazines are now smashed down.  So you never you don't have to choose anymore which magazines you got.  You're getting all the pretty much all the magazines expect effectively for one  price. TV is still a mess.  You still have to choose the TV and that may not change for a while.  But we're getting vastly more content.  We can't even conceal the amount of content we're getting.  And just because there's more available, we feel like we're compelled to have to  get it all.

Start time: 1782.94
End time: 1798.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. I mean, I agree with that.  And I think it's kind of you do need to still pick and choose.  Like, you know, I think that if you're really trying to get every streaming  service at this point. But what people do, I think, is that everyone has access to  almost every streaming service because they're getting their friend's password.

Transcript:  Sure. Deal. I'm going to drop Apple News because I have discovered we have a  company account for the Wall Street Journal.  The main reason I got Apple News is because I wanted to have Wall Street  Journal content. And now I have it through the company.  And I'm going to dump Netflix too.  I have no problem dropping and adding things like I will pick up HBO now only  when there's something on that I want to see and I'll drop it and I go back and  forth and pretty much my subscription things stays about the same and stays  relatively tolerable because I have no mercy in terms of cutting.

Advertisers are always going to pay more for that than the than the consumers want to.  But I just think we're in this, you know, subscription economy right now.

But for five bucks, Arcade is a great deal.  It's so much fun.  It's getting great. So much fun.  And that's a five bucks.  I'm happy to spend because I'd spend that much probably.  And it's for the family. Right.

Transcript:  And I can do it on my TV.  The thing that killed me over this weekend is I bought like so my godkids  have been using my switch so much that I basically don't have ownership of it anymore.  So I bought the new one for them with the better processor and the better  battery life.  And then I found out that it's the games are locked to the console,  not to the account.  Well, if I want to keep.  Yeah, it's like they've got this incredibly rigid copy protection  where you have to buy the physical cartridges repeatedly.  If you have them on different.  Oh, that's not your parents.  Reno and Stephen Kovach were trying to explain it.  And then I'm thinking Apple Arcade is five bucks a month for the whole family.  And I'll just you know, they have iPads, they have iPhones,  like older version of my iPhone.  They can still play on them.  The games are.

And I think that was what Apple kind of taught us was OK. Right.  And so I think the idea of paying a monthly fee for that  and having it be a little bit more elevated is appealing to a lot of people.  But but it was this belief that you could just download this cheap game. Right.  And I don't know if there are people going to want to subscribe in that way.  I think that's I think that's a shift.

But for people who just don't want that anymore or want an alternative to it,  they have some they at least have an alternative.  Do you have a game you like on it?  I haven't had too much time to play because I've been doing  like just a gazillion other things, but I'm blanking on the name.  I like the card game where you go into the subconscious of the of the kid  and you're playing through his memories.  Yes, like the cards to have him as card dropers.  I'm totally blank on the name.  And you're building little traverses puzzles for him.  The cards fall. Yes.  Yes. Thank you, sir.  OK, I'll try that.  Games are good.  The which ones?  No, man, they have a couple of games on there.  They've they made Altos.  I think they made Altos Adventure and they've got a couple of games on here.

Ocean Horn is as complex as the original Ocean Horn was Ocean Horn 2.  I like the what the golf for people who hate.  Yes. It's so much fun.  You think you're going to shoot a ball and then it turns out  you're shooting a house or a car or kid or a club or what?  All sorts of weird stuff.  It's a very fun game.

Transcript:  But the other ones were too hard to bring to like to market.  Like I talked to a bunch of developers there and they had dreams to make games  that there was just no way that they would have to butcher them so thoroughly.  Right. With a to play features that they would could not live themselves to launch it.  Well, they just couldn't launch it.  And this is giving them an outlet.

Start time: 2383.78
End time: 2394.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the sense I get when I play these games is these are in some ways.  These are art projects.  These are games, labors of love that developers wanted to make,  but couldn't really make. It made no business.

End time: 2398.52

End time: 2429.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. I.  I think it's I think the problem Apple is, is have so much power.  So they did that with freemium by allowing that  and not allowing demo versions of games, you know, by kind of steering the developer.  They steered the developer into this freemium model.  Not I don't think intentionally, but accidentally.  And I think they felt a little guilty about it.  So they've created arcade.  They have so much clout, though, that this could really change gaming.  In some dramatic ways.  But well, maybe in a good way, maybe not. I mean.

Start time: 2472.84
End time: 2504.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. And I think that that frees up developers  to be making things that are fun, right?  Instead of things that are like, how can we get them to spend more money?  How can we lure them towards the loot box or lure them towards the extra armor  that costs five ninety nine or whatever?  So I think that could be good.  But I just wonder how,  you know, condition consumers are not to pay for these games  and to, you know, that's been the model is that you can download Candy Crush  for free, right?  You know, or or or to one time fee.  And I just wonder.  But at five dollars, I think that's pretty cheap.

There will you have stadium on the other side, Leo, which is going to crush  from the exact opposite vertical with always streaming any device.  I will say a bunch of studio names.  Well, I mean, theoretically, you do it, like you said, to your point.  Apple is giving a whole tab of the App Store to arcade.  That is some of the most valuable software real estate in the world.  And Google is going to be promoting Stadia.  You know, I don't know if it's going to put it that much, but it probably will.  And you have these massive platforms sort of trying to reposition  gaming both at the same time.

End time: 2577.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know. This may just be me.  I was a little mad that Apple took away the tab that says update  and put arcade there.  So now in order to update, you have to tap on your head  and you have to scroll up because it's below the fold.  And you can see all the stuff.  And I don't I think Apple, though, changed update  behavior in the past.  You tell me if I'm wrong here in previous versions of iOS,  even though I turned on auto update, it never seemed to update.  I had to go in there every every week and make sure everything got updated.  Now I notice everything is being auto updated.  And I'm wondering if there that's what's made two changes.

Transcript:  I think the batch processing is faster intervals before they would wait,  you know, maybe once a day and they would run it when they thought  the phone was sleeping and wouldn't inconvenience you.  It wouldn't be wasting your bandwidth when you were roaming.  Now it seems to be more aggressive about it, but also they used to have a hard  limit and what it would download over the networks because the networks are always  petrified that a billion iPhone users are going to destroy their their their bandwidth.  Now you can go in and choose to tell it to warn you all the time,  warn you over 200 megabytes or just never warn you anymore.

And it very often wasn't very often to be 30 or 40 apps  that needed to be updated.  That's not a day.  It should be now. No, it should be now.  So I haven't had to update manually since I got the new iPhone.  And I think they've changed everything. That's actually good.  I don't mind if you take away the update tab is if I don't have to go there.  That's good. Right. It should be automatic.

And I go through and I look at kind of what the updates are.  And in some cases I think, oh, I don't want that.  I'll delete the app before it can update.  So I'm kind of picky and I'm not usual, but I would rather not have auto updates.

That was like, you know,  now there's just a line item.  You hold it down. It says rearrange icons. Right.  The two things that are still missing are the things that actually required  real pressure sensitivity, which is the when you could when you could press  deeper to switch between moving the cursor and text selection on the key  on the trackpad mode.  Yeah, that's gone.  And also anything that you use drawing like notes and you could do like  press harder to get thicker or darker lines.  That's that's gone. A bit of a loss. Yeah.

And then slowly, but surely, year after year, they knocked out  like the second year, they made native applications.  The third year, they made LTE.  The fourth year, they gave it the redesign.  The fifth year, it's not.  And slowly, but surely, they've been removing impediments.  And this one is like this is the one that stopped it being a watch.

End time: 2911.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  Now it goes back. But but no, but I do.  I am tempted for the first time.  I am somebody who's a little wary of another computer  strapped to my wrist at all times, because, you know, I don't want to be  glued to my phone any more than I already am.  But I think the price point now and there is like,  you know, I think some great features at this point.  So I am kind of tempted to have the Apple watch.  But I feel like the biggest thing is if you're like an athlete,  I think that seems to be still the biggest  draw. But one thing I'm still kind of hesitant about is the battery life.  You know, Apple advertises this is like, you know,  monitor your sleep, monitor your exercise, monitor your stress.  Never take it off.  It's going to die.  You can't you can't actually monitor your sleep cycle  and then go straight to monitoring your exercise and your stress at work  or whatever, because you need to charge it.  So I think that's still kind of something.  An open question for me is, is the battery life and that's your normal watch.  You can just leave on all the time and kind of forget about it.  But the idea of having, you know, I love my AirPods,  but the idea of having three Apple devices, I need to constantly  be worrying about the battery life on is just not super appealing,  especially if you want to be using it kind of as a health monitor,  which I think is something that Apple has pushed so much.

Transcript:  All right, Renee, what's the verdict battery life?

Start time: 2915.54
End time: 2977.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So so far, I've got about the same battery life.  Russell Holly took him on one of his giant torture tests yesterday,  and he got slightly better battery life on the new one after biking,  I'm guessing, 500 kilometers or something ridiculous like he usually does.  So it's been about the same.  And what they did this year was their goal was to give you the always on  feature without impacting it.  And you're right, like mine goes about a day and a half.  It depends on how many workouts to do during a day.  And they did address the sleep thing.  You know, Apple famously bought  bedit, but then hasn't integrated their own sleep tracking yet.  I'm guessing that might be next year's big feature and they'll address it.  But now it's sort of like do your sleep tracking, get up,  put your watch on the charger, go make coffee, go to a shower, whatever.  Then pick it up again and go to your yoga or go to work or do something like that,  which is a lot of overhead to manage, especially without air power,  to sort of do everything at once for you.  But it's my my old watch lasted for three years.  But if I had a fall on my bicycle, it wouldn't call 911.  I couldn't make phone calls on it.  It didn't do it.  It didn't remote control the alarms in my house.  So I'm willing to make these tradeoffs.  But I do hope that one day it's like every week instead of every day.

It keeps me up at night worrying about it, Leo.  Yeah, that's what actually I read a study that said the people who are using sleep  trackers sleep more poorly because they're they're obsessed with.

Transcript:  I like that a lot because I took it for granted because my phone has had a compass  for like a decade, so I don't even think about it.  Then I realized all the like just the maps on the watch.  You see it, but you don't really know which way it's going.  It tries. But I just said I was out doing one of the battery tests  and I lost track of my colleague, George, and I just said, find Georgia and it and  define my algorithm did it saying pointed me to her.  I started walking. It said, no, you're going the wrong way.  So I turned around and I walked the right way, turned the corner and she was there.  I love it. I love compass. Yeah. OK.

Transcript:  I'm into that. That's really seamless.  And I feel like, yeah, the dumbest thing I do on a regular basis  is come out of the subway and hold my phone, look down,  walk in a circle and try and figure out which way is the right direction.  And I do like the idea of having a watch that could do that  in a much more elegant way, especially with the compass.

And then we'll fix that for you.  Well, Google Maps has already added this augmented reality feature  where you hold it up and it sees this buildings and it has a big arrow  that says, well, go that way.  So there are solutions out there.  I never thought I needed a compass.  There is a compass already on the phone.  Is is the watch compass better somehow?

Transcript:  It's independent.  Well, I mean, it's a novelty now, like the starry skies app.  You can hold up your watch and move it across the sky  and it'll tell you what's what constellations you're looking at.  But I think it's really going to when it starts to come together.  I think this is all built around Apple's U1 chips and all these other things  where you're going to be able to find things and find other devices  and target other devices.  And for example, I lost my wallet when I was in New York  and it was like really stressful, but I had so many gadgets that it was fine.  But if I had just had that tag inside it and I could say, where's my wallet?  And it would have shown me and I could just look at my watch  and say, no, left idiot.  I would have gone left.  And that sort of thing, I think, is going to be transformative.

Start time: 3233.52

End time: 3301.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, but the use is the use for now.  I think that they just don't have their their new tags ready.  And that's why they knew someone was going to find it when they tore it down  and say, what is this?  They had to had some kind of story for it.  And in iOS 13.1, which is coming out on the 24th now,  it's going to enable air drops.  So like if you if the three of you are standing there  and I want to make sure I beam something to Dwight and not Leo,  I can point my phone at him and it'll prioritize him and say,  oh, do you want to be in this to Dwight?  And I just press the button and it'll do it.  That's like the sort of the first function they're doing.

So many businesses are running software these days.  I was just looking at a graph that said like 40 percent of businesses  are still running Windows XP.  And you know why?  Because it's in a closet somewhere.  Hasn't been up. You are.  You're running Windows XP.  Stop it.  Because you know why?  I bet you this is why.  Because you have to because that software that your business is built on,  your line of business software won't run unless you have IE five or or or  Windows XP running. That's crazy.  I want you to go to captera dot com captera dot com  is a directory of modern state of the art business software  for every possible business.  Seven hundred categories, everything from digital workplace software,  video management software, SaaS solutions, CRM solutions,  but also direct line of business software like mortuary management  or yoga studio management.  There is software in there for everybody.  And what's great about captera, you pick the category,  you pick pick the software you're looking for, narrow it down.  And I love it that these filters are are this is recycling software.  I love it.  There are the filters are actually tailored to the category.  So they'll ask questions that are appropriate for that on premises  or in the cloud management, that kind of thing.  And then narrow it down, then put a side by side comparison  chart together up to four different apps.  You can see all the features.  Scrap Dragon Extreme.  Now, there's a program, man.  That's a that's the one I need.  Five star rating.  But here's the best part.  A million reviews on the site, one thousand new reviews every day.  Vetted verified reviews from actual users.  That's what makes captera so special.  Before you pick software, you can see what real world people are having  experiencing with this software.  It's fantastic.  One million twenty five thousand reviews now at captera dot com.  You'll be confident when you choose software there.  And I left out the best part.  I always like this. It's free.  It's free, not freemium.  You don't have to buy donuts.  It's free.  In fact, I think the reason there's a thousand new reviews  there every day is people are so grateful.  They go back, they pay it forward.  They say, well, at least I can do this.  I can leave a review. You should do it, too.  Millions of people use captera every month to find the right tools.

So they like fly around the world.  They're often racing other teams to be the first ones to get their hands  on the iPhone first.  It's kind of amazing. Yeah.  Yeah. There was a jet lag when they when they think they see something  they did in in their defense.  But yeah, it's a really crazy race that they do every year.  And it's very impressive.

In the interest of full disclosure, I should say that Kyle Weins  and iFixit are sponsors of our shows. We love them.  Actually, we've given in the past, we've given the iFixit toolkits as gifts.  They're such great geek gifts.  Pixel 4.  Long as we gave iPhone all that time, I guess we should mention  Google's event is coming up now, October 15th.  They are going to announce more than just the pixels, though.  The invitation says a few new things  made by Google with the capital M and a capital G,  which means we'll probably see other things.  One thing Google is rumored and again, rumors, as we learned  with the iPhone, are not proof.  But one of the things Google's rumored to be offering is a 90 Hertz display.

Microsoft might go cheap.  We're going to see it because Microsoft's event is October 2nd.  It's actually an exciting time of the year. Yeah. New surfaces.

And that might be changing.  And phones and tablets were discrete devices and that's starting to change.  And it's, I like it when it's fresh and new,  like when the iPhone came out and the Palm pre came out and there was a  Blackberry 10 and Windows phone.  And there was just so many fresh and new ideas all the time.  They were sort of coagulated around iOS and Android.  And it feels like we're getting another moment in time where people are  experimenting again. And, and who knows who's going to be successful.  There'll be a lot of terrible products strewn across the floors of analyst  reports, but you might also get some really unexpected surprises along the way.

Uh,  there is a Qualcomm chip that these new ARM windows machines will be running on  that is intended for desktop, uh, processing.  It won't be an eight 55 or anything we've seen before,  but it still remains to be seen.

Ballmer was on stage at CES before the iPad and they had this HP slate and you  would press a button and this little plastic flange would pop out that had the  Intel inside sticker.  And why they did that?  Because they had to have it, but they didn't want to show it.  One of my, one of my colleagues,  Derek Kessler wrote a blistering 15,000 word review on that device.

I finally got my sleep score.  That's not good.  Most, in fact, one in three US adults don't get enough sleep.  I'm one in three.  If you're not sleeping enough,  you know it can affect your cognitive functions during the day,  like learning, problem solving, decision making.  Calm is more than just meditation.  It's a great sleep app too.  It helps you with getting to sleep and sleeping better.  With Calm, you'll discover a whole library of programs designed to help you sleep,  to get the sleep your brain and body needs.  Soundscapes,  wonderful.  I should play a few little soundscapes here.  So you can kind of mask street noise and sirens and all sorts of things.  There's wonderful sleep stories  narrated by soothing voices like Stephen Fry.  I love Stephen Fry's voice.  I just love him.  But also other famous people like Jerome Flynn.  He does a great story about New Zealand, actually.  I learned a lot about New Zealand until I fell asleep.  That's one of the beauties of these.  They're wonderful stories for falling asleep  that you don't really mind missing.  Hello.  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The point at which a quantum computer is shown to be capable of performing a task that is beyond the reach of even the most powerful conventional super-parameter.  Or as René Richie calls it, a super-ordinateur.  An ordinateur, oui.  I love that word.  Why does the French call a computer an ordinateur?  No one knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have written about quantum computing here.  And there are a lot of companies, oil companies in Houston and certainly in West Texas, who are interested in it for seismic and geological studies.  And one of the things that they're all racing towards is this quantum supremacy where you can prove that a quantum computer can actually do something faster than a good supercomputer.  That's what they did.  Right.  Well, what happened is they posted apparently a white paper about Google doing this was posted briefly and it was pulled down.  Yes.

Start time: 4573.20
End time: 4587.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And Google will...  It was posted on a NASA website before it was taken down.  Right.  Google will not respond to requests for comment.  But that to me confirms that they did it.  Right?  Well, there are...  If they didn't do it, they say, no, no, no, no, no, we didn't do it.

Transcript:  So this is what the paper claimed.  They were able to do a calculation in three minutes and 20 seconds that would take today's fastest supercomputer, the Summit, 10,000 years.  I think Google did it because they don't want anybody to know now.  They go, whoops, because that's terrifying.  Yeah.  I don't want my ad served off a quantum computer.  It's going to break crypto, right?

Start time: 4616.03
End time: 4644.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's still a lot of questions.  These quantum computers are really delicate.  You know, like we still haven't...  They're not stabilized because the technology is so sensitive to any small changes in the environment.  You know, there are a lot of questions still about what they actually accomplished here.  And I saw a lot of researchers on Twitter being like, it's not really clear exactly if quantum supremacy has really been reached here.  I think, you know, everyone's holding cryptocurrency can relax for a minute.  Would it affect that?

Start time: 4645.54
End time: 4649.80

Transcript:  What we did actually is we had mined some Bitcoin as an experiment when those consumer miner...  You could do it.  Yeah, so we tested one and then we said, oh, it's not really ethical to be holding this, so we're just going to get rid of the key purposely.  You threw away the key?  But at that point, it was worth $12. It wasn't a big deal.  And then it wasn't very clear what was going to happen because it was an ethical violation.  Wait a minute.

So Steve Gibson, our security guy, I've told this before, forgive me if you've heard it before.  Same thing. When this all first started, he said, well, let me set up a miner.  And you could at the time, you could mine it with just plain old PC.  Next morning he wakes up, he's got 50 Bitcoin.  So he just kept it lying around.  At its peak, that's worth more than a million dollars, right?  He erased the disk by accident.  Oh, no.  I kept asking him, well, come on, guy, find it.  He said, well, it's in that computer, it's in the corner.  And then he finally admitted to me, no, I erased the hard drive a long time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There have been estimates, actually, and it's like a fair amount.  A lot, actually, if you consider Satoshi's money, too.  If you want to consider that lost, then it's like actually a pretty significant amount.  And the problem with cryptocurrencies, unlike regular dollars, is that regular dollars get lost all the time and we just print more.  And that's kind of a problem with the currency, actually, is that I think it's like a fair portion, even if you don't consider Satoshi's.

Transcript:  Here's a graphic from Fortune magazine from a couple of years ago.  Total coins lost, probably as many as four million bitcoins are lost, a huge number out of circulation.  So it's really a small fraction of bitcoins that are that are actually in circulation.  So getting back to this quantum supremacy, because this could be a big deal.  The MIT Technology Review is talking about it.  They had had its ironic the week before a conference in Cambridge.  They were discussing quantum computing and Will Oliver, an MIT professor and specialist in quantum, said that supremacy, this this milestone, would be kind of like the first flight of the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk.  It would be that important for a quantum machine to actually do solve a problem and to be able to demonstrate effectively that that problem was solved at many orders of magnitude faster than the best computer out there.  And I think that that counts. If it would take 10,000 years for Summit to do it in three minutes and 20 seconds for a quantum processor, that's a big difference.

Start time: 4949.26
End time: 4953.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

There's a lot of stuff in technology like that. But that that could be, you know, that could be a big story. You just you heard it here. You could think back in the years to come. I remember that show, whatever happened to that. Oh, yeah, that's where I heard the first time a quantum computer.

Start time: 4988.32
End time: 4994.12

Facebook trying to trademark the word book in Europe.  Das Buch.  Le Book.  Our show today, I just read an article that asked the rhetorical question,  should you be using a VPN? And the answer was yes.  Yes, you should be using a VPN.  A VPN, a virtual private network, protects you when you're on open Wi-Fi, hotspot.  When you don't trust the source of your internet, it could be your internet service provider.  It could be that free airport wireless that I always see.  If you don't trust it, you shouldn't be using it without a virtual private network.  A VPN encrypts your data from your computer to the VPN server  somewhere out there, well away from any attack surface inside you, next to you, or around you.  My favorite VPN, a lot of people ask me, what do you use? I use ExpressVPN.  I'll tell you why. A few reasons.  First of all, it's easy. This one button runs on every platform I use.  You just put the app on your phone or on your desktop, turn it on, and you're encrypted.  It's running in the background. Everything you do is now encrypted going out on the net.  It's easy to turn off again when you want to do that.  It's really fast. They have lots of servers all over the world.  That's good too because it means you can emerge into the public internet in any country you want, practically, anywhere around the world.  The other thing I really like about ExpressVPN is their privacy policy.  This is really the most important point to be made with any VPN.  You're just kicking the can down the road.  Yeah, okay. That guy in the hoodie in the corner of the coffee shop can't hack you.  But as soon as you get to that VPN server, they can. They can spy on you.  So you want a VPN that you can trust. ExpressVPN you can trust.  They've been audited, third-party audit. Read their privacy policy. The audit said, yep, they do exactly that.  They even have added a new cutting-edge server technology called Trusted Server.  They're actually running their VPN server in a sandbox so it cannot write to the hard drive at all.  Not only do they not log, they couldn't log if they wanted to.  It's a whole new standard of privacy and security. No trace of your visit is saved at any time.  Third-party audit said, yep, that's exactly what Trusted Server does and it works.  Now you may say, well, I've got a free VPN. I can tell you right now, nobody runs a VPN server for free.  If they're not charging you, they're making money on you.  ExpressVPN does charge you, I think, a very fair, great price for a really great service and a 30-day money-back guarantee.  So here's what I want you to do. I want you to go to expressvpn.com slash twit right now.  E-X-P-R-E-S-S-V-P-N dot com slash twit. Don't ask me how you spell VPN. I know you know.  Expressvpn.com slash twit. You'll get three extra months free with a one-year package. It's the best.  Thank you ExpressVPN for your support of our show.

Transcript:  Please, yes. The funny thing is, Zuck didn't mention it. He didn't post it on Facebook.  It was a secret. The only reason we know this happened is, of course, the president tweeted it and Facebooked it and Instagrammed it.  No details on what he was talking about.  Yeah.  I'm guessing Trump probably said, can you get me any information on this Biden guy? What do you know?

Transcript:  All of Silicon Valley has come one by one to talk to Donald Trump, including not only the social media guys, but the Google guys.  Everybody has to come. Satya Nadella, I'm sure, has talked to Trump because you need him to be plain ice.  And he's not real happy about social media right now.  He thinks social media has an anti-conservative bias.

Transcript:  Right. Right. I think the card to play, honestly, is if you regulate us, then you're going to be strengthening China.  I think that is the card to play with Trump. And I bet that that's the card that Zuckerberg played.  That's what they've been doing.

And that's the problem exactly, like you said, is the uncertainty, I think, is what is the issue for all of these manufacturers is that they just don't know whether the tariffs are going to impact them or not.  But yeah, no, that picture of Zuckerberg and Trump is going to haunt my dreams.

Transcript:  Here's another one.  He's...  So just so you know who this is, by this, this looks like the signing of the Declaration of Independence.  It's a beautiful, beautiful picture.  That's Dan Scavino, who is the White House, or no, this is social media director.  This is, according to Gizmodo, an unknown man.  Come on, Gizmodo, you got to up your kugelfu.  That, I believe, is the presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner.  There's Mark.  Yeah.  And Joel Kaplan, who I think is chief counsel at Facebook.  And then...

Start time: 5551.62
End time: 5579.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's interesting about this meeting is that for as much as the administration and Congress and the Senate is mad at big tech right now, and they're, you know, circling them like hawks to regulate,  Trump and Dan Scavino spend a ton of money on Facebook ads, you know, just over like...  Oh, yes. Absolutely. Millions.  Yeah. So it's interesting to have Scavino there because he's probably like, you know, what kind of strategy should we be doing with our ads to win the next election?  I think it's hysterical that Jared is there.

Start time: 5581.50
End time: 5603.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I think he's pulled in because the president said, who's young? Who's young? Who can we get in here who's young? Anybody under 30 around?  Right. Who's on Facebook?  Right. Who's on Facebook?  Who's on Facebook? Any of you use the Facebook?  Mark does not look happy, but everybody who gets pictures taken with the president...  Tim Cook looked also a little grim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I think it's kind of part of the deal. You got to go. You got to make nice.  Facebook is doing what it can, I think. And I think... Look, I'm not a fan of Facebook. I quit them a year ago. I don't miss them.  I understand that many people, it's the only way they stay in touch with family and friends so they don't feel like they have the choice. I understand that. But, boy, I don't miss it one bit.  But I think they also understand that there's going to be a lot of scrutiny. They don't want to get broken up. They don't want to be told, as one congress member told them, to sell Instagram or WhatsApp.  Right.  So they're doing what they can to at least appear to be trying to get some control over Facebook before the next election. They have created an oversight board.  Right.  This is an interesting independent board, although there will be some Facebook people on it, but a great many not. And the idea of the board is it will... Facebook will present to them when there's an issue and the board's decision will be final.  They will...

Start time: 5689.22
End time: 5731.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think it's a bad idea, honestly, to have some outside people to be helping in kind of these tricky content moderation situations. But I think with this oversight board, it is interesting, but I just don't know how often it will really come into play.  Think about how many cases does the Supreme Court take? Really not that many compared to how many important cases there are across the country every year. Right?  So I just don't know how often this will really come into play. And how often is it really ambiguous? I guess it will be interesting, you know, in the Alex Joneses of the world, when someone like that appeals and it goes to the oversight board, it'll be interesting to see how often people appeal and how often there really is disagreement.

Start time: 5731.24
End time: 5734.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It kind of is like the Supreme Court, isn't it?  It's exactly like that.

Start time: 5734.50
End time: 5758.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a feeling there will be a lot of them going because everybody believes in their own sanctity and everybody believes that they deserve to be left alone and say what they want to say on Facebook.  I haven't seen exactly how it proceeds up through the ranks and at what point it can stop and not be allowed to continue. But if everybody keeps pushing it, this could have a hard time scaling.

Start time: 5758.70
End time: 5811.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's the flowchart from the Facebook post. There's two ways a case can get to the board. One, Facebook identifies a case for referral like the Alex Jones case where they would just love to pass the buck and say you decide.  The other though is users can submit requests for board review. In both cases, Facebook will assess those referrals against, I'm just reading here so don't blame the messenger, prioritization guidelines and submit for board review.  I don't know what that even means.  And then the board will have a case selection committee which will have five members. They'll rotate. That committee will then select the cases and assign them to panels because the actual review is 40 people. It's pretty big.  So they can divide it up into groups. They'll submit it to a panel.

Start time: 5813.40
End time: 5818.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So ultimately Facebook is deciding who gets to talk to this panel.

Start time: 5818.20
End time: 5821.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's right. Facebook is the gatekeeper on what gets to the panel.

Start time: 5821.83
End time: 5823.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well then what's the point?

Start time: 5825.22
End time: 5836.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well you realize that even if there's 40 people this does not scale well.  No.  It's going to be of the avalanche of requests only a trickle will get through.

Start time: 5836.70

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Facebook will select a small group of initial members who will then help with the selection of additional members. There'll be a transparency report. I think Facebook is going to be at pains to make sure this looks like it's a fair process, an equitable process.  Because they're assailed on both sides. They're assailed by conservatives who say you shut down conservative voices and they're assailed by members of Congress who say you're too big, often from the left you're too big.  So they're getting it from both directions. So they're going to be at great pains to make it look as if it's a kind of a fair process.

HBO show about media mogul, kind of a Rupert Murdoch type, and his five horrifically horrible children, each of whom are vying to take over the company, each of whom is worse than the next one.  One of the son-in-laws is in charge of their news network, which is a kind of a Fox News like, but he's just, you know, it's he's speaking at a conference like an Allen and co conference up in the ski chalet.  And they've done a lot of focus group testing for this news network and they've decided that their slogan should be ATN. We hear you.  And then cousin Greg comes running up right before the thing says we can't say that.  Why can't we say that? Well, it turns out we actually do hear them. We've got a microphone in the device.  Well, can we say we're listening? No, it's the same thing. We are listening.  So they end up coming up with a slogan. We hear for you.  Which makes no sense at all.  But that came out. That show was right before Facebook announced this Facebook. We hear you is the new slogan clearly.  I don't know. I bought the portal but immediately realized what a horrific mistake I had.

They just want to make a great product. They're engineers.  They're like, oh, this is a great problem. We're going to put four microphones in it. We're going to have touch displays.

Transcript:  Two studies just released. Researchers at Princeton and the University of Chicago looked at the Roku and Amazon set top boxes.  And guess what? We here for you.  69 Roku channels, 89% of Roku channels, 89% of Amazon Fire TV channels are actually monitoring, they've got microphones on them, monitoring what you're watching.  A second study, researchers at Northeastern and in the Imperial College of London examined an even broader range of cloud connected consumer devices.  The TVs were the worst for how many, quote, unique third party destinations, quote, they contact.  Facebook, Amazon, double click among the top recipients of consumer data from these devices.  They're sending data about what you're watching, what you're doing back to these places.  Akamai and Microsoft both get a lot of hits, but that's because they're the cloud source for all of this stuff.  Nearly all, this is the punchline, nearly all TV devices in our test beds contact Netflix, even though we never configured any of them with a Netflix account.  You don't have to have a Netflix account. They're just the Netflix software being on the device.

Transcript:  And Renee Richie in his home in beautiful Montreal,  where he's probably right after the show going to make another Vector podcast,  because the guy just can't stop.  Our show today brought you, I love, I put Mint Mobile.  Man, I just can't believe how good this is.  Mint Mobile is an MVNO, mobile virtual network operator for T-Mobile.  So if you have T-Mobile service in your area, everybody does.  You are paying too much if you're not using Mint Mobile.  Network coverage is so good these days.  No matter who your wireless provider is, you're going to get great service.  Why pay more for the same service when you can get Mint Mobile?  I pay, let me tell you what I pay.  And here's the deal.  They're online only, they don't have stores.  And I pay a year ahead of time.  So for unlimited text, unlimited phone service on the T-Mobile network,  12 gigabytes of data a month, which is more than I ever need,  I pay $25 a month.  I paid $300 for the year.  That's it, $25 a month.  You can get even less if you don't use much data, as little as $15 a month,  for the same high-end coverage.  Go to the Mint Mobile site, mintmobile.com slash twit,  and do the calculator, see how much you save.  It is truly remarkable.  Your old wireless bill is paying for expensive retail stores for overhead.  Mintmobile.com slash twit, you got to check it out.  Cut your wireless bill down.  You get unlimited nationwide talk and text, crazy fast 4G LTE.  Bring your phone, keep your phone number.  That's fine, you can port your phone number.  All your contacts go with you.  And if you're not 100% satisfied, they've got you covered,  a seven-day money-back guarantee.  They have iPhones, they have got a phone,  they have got Galaxy phones.  Just go to the Mint Mobile website,  If it works with T-Mobile, it will.  Mintmobile.com slash twit.  In fact, right now, $15 a month with their three-month introductory plan.  And get the plan shipped to your door for free.  Go to mintmobile.com slash twit.  I love the Fox.  Honestly, I spend so much on cell phone service,  because I have all the carriers.  I'm just going to move them all to Mint Mobile.  Mintmobile.com slash twit.  I knew you guys would want to know about this,  so I was very happy to say,  yes, we want to tell the world about Mint Mobile.  This is a sad story in so many ways,  but I should mention that Richard Stallman, RMS,  who is the leader of the free software movement,  he wrote Emacs, he was one of the hackers  Stephen Levy wrote about in the hackers book,  had some odd beliefs about pedophilia,  and is now basically gone from MIT,  where he's a visiting professor at the computer science and AI lab,  and he's resigned his position at the Free Software Foundation.  There's a lot of people saying it's about time.  I'm sure that's the case.  He certainly minimized the harms from sexual assault  and sex with children.  He was so strange that I never,  I didn't really know about it, but it didn't surprise me.

Start time: 6822.20
End time: 6844.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, a lot of people were coming out,  a lot of people that I know were coming out and saying,  part of the reason that I, not myself,  but a lot of people I knew were saying that,  part of the reason that they didn't participate in the free software movement  was because of his behavior,  and because of how they treated him, especially women.  That's interesting, so this is what I want to hear,

Start time: 6846.20
End time: 6894.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  because the two things I saw were posts,  one from many, many years ago, which he later disavowed,  saying that pedophilia was not bad if the child was a willing participant.  He then posted later, I've been told by a lot of,  I've been schooled and I was wrong,  there's harm involved and of course it's wrong.  Then later when the Jeffrey Epstein thing came up,  he once again kind of stumbled into it by saying,  well a 17-year-old, what's the age of consent?  That's probably okay, but this is the deeper story.  because I don't know about this.  yeah, he really wasn't very cool towards women.  I think that's a good point to be hearing.

Start time: 6895.20
End time: 6937.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think that those beliefs were maybe indicative of an overall attitude.  I've seen a lot of talk about what does this really mean  for the free software movement and for open source,  because I think that there's been this whole movement about how it's being open,  about anyone being able to use it,  about it being this kind of utopian vision for what the future of technology would be.  I think this is one example of how it's not really open.  There are gatekeepers.  There are gatekeepers like him who actually stop a lot of women  and other groups from participating in technology.  I think that's kind of what it's about.  It wasn't just about his beliefs on pedophilia.  It wasn't strange beliefs.  I think those beliefs manifested in the way that he treated people.

Transcript:  Then people started coming forward a little bit.  Dana Boyd, when she received the EFF award,  talked about being at MIT and talked about the really difficult climate.  She transcended.  She was able to continue, but it wasn't a very positive climate.  She was very angry about it.  There was this tweet from Star Simpsons.  She said, I remember being walked around the MIT campus by an upperclassman  during my freshman year.  The upperclassman pointed out,  look at all the plants in her office, referring to a professor.  All the female CSAIL professors keep massive amounts of foliage in their office  because Stallman hates plants.  He won't come into their office because of it.  That's a hostile environment.  If you've got plants in your office to keep somebody out of it,  that's not good.

Transcript:  Go ahead, Louise.  I just think that there's this excuse of the weird eccentric genius.  This is a really good example of that.  You can act because you're so brilliant.  I think what was at play here was that we're just going to ignore his weird hatred of plants  and his weird preferences because it's worth it.  Is it really worth it if people are getting treated so horribly?

I'm going to try to platform them as fast as I can.  And then you hire for diversity and you put diverse people in charge of the hiring.  And then you create a way better world for everybody and these things will fall into hopefully a terrible memory.

You're allowed to be a jerk, but you're not allowed to discriminate against people because of any, for race, gender, religion, and take a field and pray on them, praying on them even worse, right?

The other shoe that's going to drop is Google, is Sergey Brin and Schmidt, Eric Schmidt. There are, I'm hearing lots of stories about Andy Rubin.  We know about Andy Rubin, very poor behavior that was part of the culture in the early days of Google.  Louise, you're a woman.  I don't know what to say. No old white man should have a say in this, right?  Yeah. I mean, I think it's complicated and I think it has to be kind of done on an individual basis.

Start time: 7295.20
End time: 7335.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think that like the just like canceling is not helpful either.  Like I think that we have to figure out when we do discover this behavior, like what is a good reconciliation, right?  Like what kind of justice do we really want here?  I think that that's something we haven't figured out, especially when the behavior is not criminal, right?  When it's criminal, we have a legal system and it seems clear.  But with something like Stalman, it's like, you know, we don't know.  And I think how do you as a community, especially like, you know, the open software movement is a community.  As a community, how do you deal with that? What do you do?  And what is justice?  I think that that's something we haven't really figured out, especially not in tech.  Not to put you on the spot, but is there a discussion?

Start time: 7336.24

Start time: 7354.20
End time: 7364.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or do you put a thing up at the front that says a disclaimer?  Stalman's is I mean, what do you do?  Right, right.  Yeah, I think it's a little bit of a hard question.

Start time: 7366.20
End time: 7373.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's something we're still figuring out.  Yeah, how do you give readers that context that they come across that article?  But yeah, it's still I think kind of an open question.

Start time: 7376.43
End time: 7390.20

Start time: 7408.58
End time: 7438.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I heard him interviewed on NPR and it was kind of interesting to hear his viewpoint.  One of the weird things is that a lot of people think Edward Snowden is like working for the Russian government.  And I find that line of thinking kind of strange and not true because he did apply for asylum all across Europe.  You were the only people who would take him.  Yeah, the only people who would take him.  And he has said over and over again, I will stand trial as long as I can use a public interest defense.  And the government has said over and over again that they won't let him use that defense.

Start time: 7440.99
End time: 7451.20

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that'll be kind of an interesting turning point.  And now we have this lawsuit that the government wants to seize all the profits from the book because he violated his NDA.  Which is just like, they really just don't give this guy a break.  He can't even write a book.

Start time: 7466.76
End time: 7473.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He can write a book, he just can't prop it. They're not trying to censor the book.  They're just saying the profits, you can't get the profits of it.

Start time: 7475.10
End time: 7488.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it is interesting that we're still six years later from the disclosures.  But he's still such an important figure and I'm excited to read the book.

End time: 7494.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  50 years from now, 100 years from now, it'll be interesting to see, or maybe even 20 years from now, it'll be interesting to see how he's regarded.

Start time: 7494.78
End time: 7524.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, I think there's no question he was a man of conscience.  He acted on his conscience and he felt that there was no other way but doing what he did.  You know, the normal whistleblower route was just not open to him.  He tried and failed at the NSA to say, look, look what's going on. This is not right. This is not legal.  And was rejected.  And by the way, we're seeing that being a whistleblower is not necessarily a good position to be in right now.

Start time: 7528.20
End time: 7568.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. So maybe I understand why he did what he did. I think he did it out of conscience.  He didn't do it out of maliciousness or out of some sort of profit motive.  He did it a very brave thing because he was a patriot. He believed he was a patriot.  So you have to respect that much anyway, whatever you feel about what he did.  I think he did it in a very sane way, actually, trying to protect the people whose secrets he was revealing by sending it to a number of newspapers,  having them vet it to make sure that anything that was released to the public was not a security, you know, did not compromise US security or the security of individuals overseas.

We do this week in tech every Sunday afternoon after the radio show about 2.30 Pacific, 5.30 Eastern time, 21.30 UTC.  You can ask your Amazon Echo to play it. Just say, Echo, play TwitLive and it will play whatever is going on in the live stream at that time.  You can also go to our website, twit.tv slash live and watch video or listen to audio of our show.  If you're doing that, you should certainly be in the chat room where everybody else who's listening live or watching live is hanging out at irc.twit.tv.  On demand versions of the show will be available as soon as our editors can cut out all the bad stuff.  It's going to take a long time tonight.  Long time.  You can, no, they don't cut anything out. Everything is kept in.  We might bleep Louise a couple of times because she said that.
