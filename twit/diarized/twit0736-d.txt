Start time: 210.12
End time: 217.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, way back in time.  I've had a few, few jobs since then.  Last time you were here, you were working for Conde Nast, a digital director.

Start time: 217.38

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 223.03
End time: 244.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Working on a startup called, called Entail.  Entail.com, E N T A L E dot com, which is a visual interactive podcast app.  So as you're listening to your podcasts, you get the links that people are talking  about and you get the profiles of the people that are on the show.  It lets you kind of deep dive into, uh, into the audio that you're listening to.  We need that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  According to Eric in the chat room, you haven't been on in four  years since December, 2015.  Oh, wow.  That seems impossible.  That can't be right.  Well, welcome back.  I apologize.  Well, thank you very much.  Yeah.  So, uh, I guess Apple had some sort of shindig on Tuesday by innovation only.  There were a few people who said, okay, if you're going to have an invitation  that says by innovation, you best innovate.  Devendra.  Now, first of all, you probably already have an iPhone, but you can't say  it because it's embargoed.

Start time: 283.80
End time: 287.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't have it, but I have touched them and they're very nice.

Start time: 289.96
End time: 382.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you could say that about any old phone.  Um, yes.  The iPhone 11, it was a weird, it was kind of a weird event for Apple.  First of all, they had so much to talk about that they had to jam it in.  They didn't start with their traditional owed to moneymaking and the stores, but  they kicked, they kicked right into Apple arcade plus and then TV plus.  And then they went to the watch by the time they got to the iPhone, which I  thought was going to be the story of the, of the hour, they only announced one,  the iPhone 11.  They said the most successful iPhone this year was the iPhone 10R.  Here's its successor, the iPhone 11 now with two lenses.  And I thought, well, this is interesting.  The big, I think the big story there was the price, which is 50 bucks less than  the iPhone 10R at its launch 699.  Uh, and then they said, Oh, Oh, and by the way, there are some other iPhones,  the iPhone pro iPhone 11 pro and the iPhone 11 flow max.  I mean, sorry, pro max.  I say flow max cause I can't remember the all the, all the, they all have slow  fees, they all have slow fees, slow mo selfies.  So, um, these, this is Apple is now in a tick tock talk situation, aren't they?  Since the iPhone six, they don't used to be every other year would be an S and  kind of the same form factor, but a little bit improved and then a big improvement  in the next year, like the 10 was a big improvement, but the 10S was a talk.  And this is really a talk to the talk, isn't it?

Start time: 383.22
End time: 419.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it kind of that speaks to like how a smartphone upgrade cycles are  working now too, like most people keep their phones two or three years.  Um, it kind of makes sense.  There's no point like killing yourself to bring something new and groundbreaking  out every two years when you can kind of coast on how people actually buy these  phones and take some more time with that hardware.  Uh, so yeah, I'm not surprised that this year's phones aren't too revolutionary.  It is nice having an extra lens across the line.  Uh, the three lenses on the pros, uh, that's going to be really interesting.  Um, they really cleaned up the phone names too, cause the 10R and the  10S and those were all really dumb and confusing because it was a

Start time: 419.90
End time: 421.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Roman numeral, so it looked like X.

Start time: 422.70
End time: 434.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just, it was a mess.  So I found 11 nice and clean.  I found 11 pro just like Mac book and Mac book pro.  It's all good.  Um, and I think we're all expecting the big, big upgrade to be next years.  Uh, when we're going to see 5G most likely the 2020 iPhones.

Start time: 436.56
End time: 440.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  But is there such a thing, Georgia as a professional phone?

Start time: 441.52
End time: 452.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, really, you know, professional for the phone that you have in your  pocket better than, but you know, no, I understand a Mac and a Mac pro.

Start time: 452.78
End time: 459.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I understand a Mac book and a Mac book pro or even an iPad and iPad pro.  Right.  Yeah.  That's now you're starting to stretch it.  Yeah.

Start time: 459.42
End time: 471.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Phone more pro is just easy and quick and it makes you feel a little bit more elite.  Yeah.  So, you know, but they need something that's short and snappy and easy.  And people understand that you're getting a little bit more for it.

Start time: 472.98
End time: 497.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think the, the thing for me that makes it pro is like, as someone who  spends like literally all day on your phone, cause I mean, they're like  listening to podcasts or making software that's making podcasts.  It's like, I just need more battery life.  And I think the fact that this year Apple finally put more, more battery  in the back of these things.  Um, you know, for me, like having that extra battery life is what makes it pro.  Actually, we don't even know if it's more battery.

Start time: 498.86
End time: 508.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You, you, yeah, you make a huge case.  So now let me ask, cause I wasn't clear.  Is this five, so the iPhone pro max is saying has five hours  more battery life than what?

Start time: 509.14
End time: 526.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The tennis max, like their equivalent.  So it is, it is head to head.  It is more, but we don't, we don't know.  A lot five hours.  Yeah.  We do know that the new display they're saying, I think the new O-Lite is  like 15% more efficient and the, the new processor is likely more efficient too.  So these, this is where the battery life is coming from.  Probably.

Start time: 527.20
End time: 543.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've also been hearing from a lot of people who've installed iOS 13, the  public beta and 13 one that that's much more efficient.  They're getting much better battery life.  So it's great.  It's on all three fronts.  Apple, the new processor is the a 13 bionic.  Is that right?

Start time: 544.82
End time: 584.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Believe so.  Yeah.  Sorry.  It's okay.  I think, I think that's the, that's the other annoying thing, by the  way, with the pro designation.  Last year, the 10 R and the tennis phones had the exact same processor.  Yes.  And that was a big price difference.  Now it's like an iPhone 11 basic and iPhone pro still with the same processor.  Yeah.  And that's, I, I don't know.  I kind of wish there was a little more of a bump there just to really  earn that pro title.  Cause right now you have the extra camera.  You have the OLED really nice refresh OLED screens and the kind of slick, not  slick, but like the matte glass back and the stainless steel construction.  That's kind of all you're getting.  That's surgical stainless.  Surgically.  Yeah.  Surgical grade.

Start time: 584.58
End time: 593.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was really weird.  Cause like, I'm not going to perform an open heart surgery with my phone.  I could see that in a scalpel, but a phone, I don't know.

Start time: 594.51
End time: 608.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think for me, the most frustrating thing about the whole, um, you know, 11, 11,  pro 11 pero max is that as you can see here, they ship the case for your new  phone, a whole week ahead of the actual new phone.

Start time: 608.22
End time: 612.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hate that you get a box from AI and you go, Oh boy, it's here.

Start time: 612.44
End time: 612.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's here.

Start time: 613.70
End time: 618.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my word.  It's here.  I opened the box and it's just the flipping case.

Start time: 619.10
End time: 628.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You really, you really all in on Apple.  Cause you bought the Apple clear case, which is $40.  And as far as I could tell functionally identical to the 799 one I bought

Start time: 629.62
End time: 632.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  surgical grade clear plastic.  That's what you're paying for.

Start time: 635.14
End time: 655.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you know, it'll fit just right.  So that's probably important.  Um, okay.  So the, so the, this is a seven nanometer processor.  This is actually, I think Apple deserves more credit for its custom  processors than they're getting.  Uh, this looked like, and it was interesting cause they brought somebody  for the first time I can ever remember from the processor group up on stage.

Start time: 656.08
End time: 658.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  It was like an Intel keynote for, for a second there.

Start time: 659.70
End time: 674.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was like, what, what, half billion transistors or something.  It was just, it's mind boggling what they're doing.  I think they're, my guess is they're highlighting these guys because they're  eventually going to be making processors for the entire kit, right?  All the way up, all the way up to the computers.

Start time: 674.88
End time: 689.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think if we're, we're seeing Snapdragon laptops already and, you know,  windows machines running on Snapdragon.  So they are kind of setting the stage.  It just kind of makes sense.  Like, oh, but by next year, if we see a MacBook powered by the  A 14 or whatever, uh, we wouldn't be too surprised, I guess.

Start time: 691.02
End time: 740.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do have to say that increased battery life and it's across the line,  although five hours is the longest on the pro max, if that's accurate.  And we won't know until I guess I'm going to guess that places like in  gadget and I more have embargoed units that they'll report on.  And I'm going to guess Wednesday, usually a few days before they ship,  they get the, the reviews start coming out and all the main stream publications.  So we won't really know.  And then Friday I fix it.  We'll, we'll be in Australia and then we'll get at midnight.  They will get their iPhone and take it apart immediately.  So we'll then know how much battery we'll know a little bit more about the  processor, uh, the cameras and all that stuff, but I, you know, I think  if they really get literally get five hours more, that's huge.  That's 30, 40%.  That's a big difference.

Start time: 742.54
End time: 749.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a big deal.  Like, I don't know if it's enough to upgrade from like the 10 S models.  If you have one of those, you're getting all day battery life on an iPhone.

Start time: 749.88
End time: 766.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It depends what you do with your phone.  Right.  It's nice not to have to find a place to charge your phone.  So if you're using it all the time, this may be worth it.  I think it's exciting.  Carry one of those not that lovely, you know, hunchback kind of  battery cases on the back.  Yeah.

Start time: 766.60
End time: 802.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I carry the, uh, I carry, I currently have the 10 S max with the battery case.  Oh, wow.  And it is like carrying a brick in your place on this.  Yeah.  So one of the, um, so these all come out on Friday, Friday coincidentally  happens to be my birthday, so this could be like the birthday birthday on the  planet because, uh, going and picking those guys up and then getting the pipe.  Wow.  I was going to say getting the Python out of the pocket, the Python  is full with the battery.  That would be, um, would be very exciting.

Start time: 802.76
End time: 829.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a Brett Kavanaugh story from college.  You don't, you don't want to share that one.  Um, too soon, too soon.  Way too soon.  Um, so that's an example of, and no, it's not cause Johnny I have left, but the  Johnny I've era, it's always been thinner, thinner, thinner, thinner, thinner.  Apple didn't say thinner once.  They said better battery life.  Hallelujah.  They're fine.  And they're heavier.  They are.

Start time: 830.68
End time: 839.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, after the bend gate, I think they went, you know what?  Thinner is probably not better.  I think that people really panic stricken.  Let's make sure it's actually better.

Start time: 839.91
End time: 855.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Then enough battery life is better.  I feel like they are getting added weight because of this, uh, the surgical  grade steel and maybe the new display.  Like I, so from just the specs alone, the 10, the 10 pro max or the 11 pro max,  uh, weighs half a pound.

Start time: 855.76
End time: 858.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the heaviest iPhone we've ever made.

Start time: 859.48
End time: 883.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I feel, I feel like they were waiting between that and the, um, the new  keyboards on the new MacBook pros.  I feel like they were just literally like waiting for Johnny to leave.  Thank God.  Take the butterfly keyboard.  When you're Johnny,  put the keyboard back on and an extra little bit of weight on it.  Like, thank God Johnny's not here to say, I know that can't be the case, but still

Start time: 884.02
End time: 886.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it does feel like that.  Doesn't it?  I can't, I mean, he just left.

Start time: 891.60
End time: 896.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Before he left, has to have been on the work pipeline already.  Yeah.  This wasn't a quick fix.

Start time: 896.56
End time: 902.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unless there was a skunk works, you know, in the back of the campus when  Johnny leaves, we're going to show him this new keyboard.

Start time: 902.58
End time: 904.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, we're just not going to tell him.

Start time: 905.55
End time: 911.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  The reports were that he basically checked out for the past couple of years.  Yeah.  So who knows, like how it was all kind of lined up.  Yeah.

Start time: 912.00
End time: 951.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I hope you're right.  Will Harris.  I do hope there is a new, and by the way, I think it's pretty clear cause Apple  only announced the low end iPad, the 329 version and with the giant vessels,  boy, they look big now, don't they?  Those giant vessels, the home button, the fingerprint reader.  Uh, they only announced that's which means, and we know, thanks to the, um,  the, uh, European, uh, database that there are at least two more models coming.  I think that I saw that.  So there's gotta be, and they're going to, we know there's a Mac pro coming  this year, if you can afford it.  And we know that.  So we, I think there's going to be an October event with all of these things.  Right.  Does that make sense?  Yeah.  Yeah.

Start time: 953.40
End time: 973.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, yeah, I would have to say I was disappointed like on the, you know, back  to the sort of entry level iPad thing is like, it was great that they had a pencil  support.  I really thought a good feature for the, for the, for the 11, the 11 pro models  would have been pencil support.  I was really, I was really disappointed if we didn't get that.  Oh, wow.  With those giant pencils.

Start time: 974.04
End time: 976.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It'd be nice to have a shorter pencil so that your pencil isn't longer.

Start time: 976.80
End time: 980.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, just like the Note does, just a little bitty, you know, stylus there.

Start time: 981.66
End time: 982.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My biggest disappointment.

Start time: 982.68
End time: 993.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wouldn't have minded if it just magnetically stuck to the end and like it  charged just like it does on the iPad.  It has to be smaller.  You would lose it so fast.  I'm good.  I would lose it anyways.  Right.  I would lose it anyways.

Start time: 993.60
End time: 1009.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although it would be, it would be the full circle, right.  Which is Steve Jobs announcing the iPhone in 2007 and saying like, who wants these  like really awful styluses?  Yes.  Right.  You have to sharpen your fingers.  Support the phone would be like, yeah, that would be a sort of heretical move.  Wouldn't it?

Start time: 1010.78
End time: 1028.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My worry would be how the stylus is charged.  Oh, that's okay.  My worry would be how the stylus is charged.  You know, like if you were plugging them into the end, that always makes you want  to go up to like, you know, when the old iPad had the pencil sticking out of the  end when I charged, then you want to go up and just grab the pencil and break it off.  I had this very strong, a natural urge.

Start time: 1029.08
End time: 1043.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Samsung is, Samsung has completely nailed this.  This is the Note 10 plus.  They've got the stylus.  It's in the body.  It pops out.  It's charging while it's in the body.  I mean, this is maybe Apple didn't do it because they would have to copy this.  I mean, this is the only sensible thing to do.

Start time: 1043.20
End time: 1045.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, but other phones did that beforehand.  Yeah, yeah.

Start time: 1046.08
End time: 1052.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's not Samsung that invented it.  I'm not saying.  But it would look an awful lot like a Note if Apple released a stylus.

Start time: 1052.64
End time: 1067.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Apple does have a history of like terrible charging things.  Like the fact that you still have to, that you can't use your wireless mouse while it's  charging.  The light on the bottom.  It goes right up the bottom.  Come on.  Like that was a Johnny I.  Stupidest thing on the planet.

Start time: 1068.70
End time: 1070.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I blame Sir Johnny for that.

Start time: 1070.93
End time: 1077.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh boy.  Before we move on from iPhone, I want to say the one thing I'm disappointed we didn't get  on the pro phones is a fast refresh rate.

Start time: 1077.72
End time: 1087.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I was going to ask you, I was going to ask you because because pixel rumors are 90  hertz.  The which one was it?  Was it a Huawei?  No, no, it was the one plus seven pro has a 90 hertz refresh rate.  Yeah.

Start time: 1088.12
End time: 1109.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we've seen, I think the Razer gaming phone that Razer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like we're seeing more and more of that on smaller screens, like just having that that  movement when you're scrolling is just so much smoother.  It's like butter.  Like once you see that on a phone, you kind of want that everywhere.  And a pro phone, that that's your time to put it in.  There are high refresh rate OLED panels out there.  They could have done this.

Start time: 1110.71
End time: 1124.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  Are the other high refresh rate panels LCDs or they are OLEDs?  I wonder if I can't.  I have to look that up.  Yeah.  Remember, refresh rates also tied to battery life.  In fact, that was so the other thing they announced is a new Apple Watch, a Series  five.

Start time: 1126.04
End time: 1154.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

And the all the straps that come in seasons, but it feels like they just picked  your phone is something that you're going to change less often than your watch strap.

And yeah, I've heard, I've heard there were some crazy stress tests.  People basically like almost hammering these screens and just like wiping off  the remnants, like not leaving much of his crats.  So I really want to see how tough they are because I don't like cases.  I just want to feel the phone.  And I've had to had cases for so long because these things have glass.

It's got night mode somewhat like night site, which is of course from Google.  In fact, it's doing ironically, I think exactly the same thing Google does on  their pixel three with the stacking of nine photos.  Um, it does look good.  Apple's somewhat playing catch up on this phone.  You think three?

Start time: 1459.72
End time: 1480.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's a different process, right?  Because the pixel three, what it's still just one lens and they're kind of doing  that all on software.  So this is kind of Apple approaching it through their hardware thing, like their  hardware expertise.  And personally, I like having that hardware more, but I bought my wife pixel three.  I'm still so jealous of the photo.  She gets out of that phone.  It's an amazing thing.  It'll be interesting to see.

Transcript:  But Apple, so I'm really hoping, I'm really hoping that having the, the, the sort  of three cameras on the back is going to mean less of a need for like, I really  enjoy taking, um, like, like photography as a hobby, but I never want to have like  a real camera.  So I have those little like the lenses from moment, which are really good, like  high quality glass that will do you, you know, animal vehicle, telephoto, all  those kinds of things.  Um, the ability to, to, to maybe not have to have those would be amazing.

Transcript:  I have already three lenses on my Samsung phones and I have to say I fell in love  with them immediately, especially the ultra wide.  It's really nice to be able to be in a sit.  I like wide angle photography in general and to be in a situation where you can  get everything is fantastic.  So we're going to see better photos.  I love this high key thing they're doing.  This is a new portrait mode, uh, where the background falls off to bright white  and the picture, the portrait is high contrast.  I think that's a make your own Apple ad portrait.

Start time: 1564.96
End time: 1591.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they have that, that is it the fusion feature or something that takes,  I basically takes a picture with all three cameras and then uses AI fusion to  kind of figure out the best shot based on all the different shots it has.  So I think for those kinds of things, it kind of does that.  But we also saw the preview of this, uh, I forget the name, but it's a video  recording app and it can shoot video.  Yeah.  Holy cow.  Across multiple cameras at once.  That's pretty insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Front and back.  That's a testament to the speed of the a 13 bionic.  And one other thing, which they didn't talk about, but it's going to make a big  difference, which is high speed storage as well, right?  They're using much faster class.  As, as our many new phones, much faster class storage.  Um, and so the ability to save two or three high resolution stream  simultaneously, they also, the selfie cam, the front cam is now 12 megapixels.  So you're, I can't wait.  I'm going to take it to CES and interview people cause I'll have the reverse shot  in the, I mean, this is going to be amazing.

Start time: 1625.30
End time: 1658.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And also portrait mode from the standard wide angle.  Now you don't have to like move back just to do portrait.  So it's all, it's all more functional, nice upgrades.  I feel like storage is going to continue to be a problem, right?  Everything is 64 gigabytes by default.  Uh, all these photos, all this stuff, like those fusion photos are going to be huge.  Uh, recording 4k video decently on these machines, like that's going to eat up storage.  I would like to see a nice solution for that problem.  Uh, maybe making 128 gigabytes, the standard, uh, maybe making  iCloud a little more modern.  Cause it's still kind of a clunky thing to use.

Start time: 1659.62
End time: 1679.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The fact that the pro, the fact that the pro max comes with 64 gigabytes  as default is like criminal, like it's criminal.  The amount of money you're paying as an extra, I don't know what it is, uh, with  you guys, but it's like an extra 150 quid over here, um, to get two, five, six.

Start time: 1753.24
End time: 1793.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's cause the carriers, I think the carriers really didn't want Apple to  do this, so Apple a day of sale wouldn't do it, but then they'd sneak it in a few  months later, um, but yeah, of course unlocked.  Why would you, you know, why wouldn't you?  Uh, all right.  I don't, I don't think anything more to say about the phones.  I just, I mean, you have to spend some time on it.  I think this is a nice upgrade, right?  Yeah.  I think Apple's getting a little sensitive to the price issue, which is why  they cut 50 bucks off of the 10 R to offer the iPhone 11, 50 bucks, 699  starting point.  That's a good, that's a good place to put it.  Obviously, uh, as I just said, you can, you can end up spending almost 1500  bucks if you want on the phone.

Start time: 1794.54
End time: 1844.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think what's interesting is that on the price sensitivity side, it's the  first time, um, that I've seen when, when you go to buy the phone as part of the,  like the choosing your options process, it asks you, do you want to trade in  your old phone?  So suddenly, or, you know, your thousand dollar phone becomes a $500 fan.  Although I will say that the, the Apple trade in program, like I ran my last  year's gear through it and the, you know, the answer was like quite jokes.  It was, there's no price difference.  There's no price difference for trading in a 64 versus a two five six.  They offered me, um, I have the series for, uh, gold stainless steel watch  with the Milanese loop last year.  I paid 804 and the trade in value was 80 pounds.

It's not causing us, it's not costing us that much more, you know?  So we're, we're valuing it the same for you.  Like things like that.

Like it was a feature that was supposed to work really great to help you with low  coverage areas on T-Mobile.  It's always been kind of terrible.  And it's one of those things you can't really rely on it unless you know, you  have rock solid internet and I don't know cellular coverage in most places, I  think is good enough.  Like that's the thing.

Transcript:  I had a big issue with Verizon buying an unlocked phone and bringing it to them.  My grandparents took my kids to Canada this year and I checked all of our plans  and it said like you free roaming in Canada, free roaming data in Canada and  everything's fine.  And I, as soon as they crossed the border, I got this alert.  You've, you've currently spent $250 on, on, on wifi.  What?  I blame Canada.  We're going to turn it off.  You've currently spent $500 like 10 minutes later, you've currently spent $500  on, on, on roaming data.  We're turning it off.  And it was because my younger son's phone, I had brought in, I had bought it  Best Buy and, and brought in.  And so they said, they said, we don't offer, uh, international roaming  on phones you bring in.  So that's terrible.

Start time: 2001.38
End time: 2050.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Always turn off international data.  Yeah.  Always.  So here's the, on the Apple site, this is the explanation, which is clear as mud.  Will my new iPhone be unlocked?  And it says nearly all iPhone models sold on apple.com and at the Apple store are  unlocked nearly all, uh, the exception is when you buy a phone with AT&T next,  then it's locked AT&T, which makes sense.  That's a pay as you go phone, but, but any carrier, if you pay for it outright or  use iPhone payments will be unlocked.  So I don't know how the SIM free model just doesn't come with a SIM.  So it says purchase a SIM free model.  This is just like any other iPhone, but doesn't have a carrier's nano SIM.  Since you have to have a carrier's SIM to use it.  I can't imagine that it's limited in any other way.

Transcript:  I wear Lacoste while I drink La Croix.  Is that OK?  Our show today brought to you by something very easy to pronounce.  Stamps.  When you get stamps, you could go to the post office,  take the time to park, get in line, do all of that,  or print your own stamps at your desk with your computer and your printer.  No special hardware, no special ink, nothing.  I love Stamps.com.  We've been using it for years because we do a lot of mailing.  Anybody does mailing, whether you send bills, brochures,  or maybe you're an Etsy or Amazon or eBay seller and you've got to ship stuff.  Stamps is so great.  It makes you look more professional.  You slap that Stamps.com sticker on the box.  No more licking stamps, trying to guess the right amount of postage.  No more hand addressing the brown paper wrapping the twine.  No, you do it right with Stamps.com.  I love it.  All the amazing services of the U.S. post office come to you and your computer.  Never leave your desk again.  Whether you're a small office, sending invoices or even a warehouse,  sending thousands of packages a day, Stamps.com can handle it all with ease.  And you already have everything you need.  Your computer will print official U.S. postage 24-7 for any letter,  any package, any class of mail, anywhere you want to send.  Once your mail is ready, just hand it to your carrier.  And with Stamps.com, you get savings you can't get at the post office.  Five cents off every first class stamp, up to 40% off priority mail.  And don't even think about an expensive postage meter.  I mean, that's crazy.  This saves you a ton of money and a lot of time.  No wonder 700000 small businesses use Stamps.com.  We do. We have for years.  Anybody's doing mailing.  I love it because when I need stamps, I go to Debbie and I say,  print me some stamps and she even could put my picture on them,  which really confuses people.  I try to wear a white periwig and ruffled shirt,  so at least it looks like a president.  Right now, you can enjoy the Stamps.com service with a special offer  that includes a four week free trial plus postage and digital scale.  No long term commitment.  But don't just go to the front page. Do me a favor.  See that microphone in the upper right?  Click that. You're going to be amazed at what happens.  Type in Twit.  T-W-I-T.  And then that offer on the front page goes, boom, bam, wow.  Plus, you get a free USB scale, which is really nice.  You always have exactly the right postage.  So remember now, go to Stamps.com, click the microphone  in the upper right hand corner, enter Twit for an amazing free trial  of the best, the best way to do postage.  Stamps.com. We're big fans.  So.  The series three, they killed the series four watch.  They dropped the price in the series three to one ninety nine.  I think my theory is that the series five isn't that different from the series four.  So they wanted to kind of, you know, have a bigger jump  from the base model to the higher end model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will say that, like, I don't think it's just a sign for the first year.  Just be free. Yeah.  It's not a sign of lack of confidence.  Like they are bulldozing their way into this market in the best way,  like in the way they know how.  So for them to get any dent, they need to get as many subscribers  as they can in their first year.  And this is the way to do it. Just make it default.

Start time: 3336.16
End time: 3347.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't you think, DaVinci, that if they just made it free free,  like everyone gets it, we were in, we like it.  And then you start to make it like then we subscribe to it afterwards  when they have a little bit more than six.

Start time: 3348.12
End time: 3362.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. If you start if you start with free as we as you're offering  and then you start charging, then people freak out.  And then people get annoyed if it's like it's free for this year.  If you buy this thing, then you know the deal.  You know what you're getting into.  So I feel that feels at least a little more honest and transparent.

Start time: 3362.44
End time: 3395.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it also it also plays into Apple's like whole  service pricing offering anyway, like the pricing of iCloud  for like something that's so outdated is like completely ludicrous.  And it's like I'm paying, you know, ten bucks a month or something  for some stories.  You don't even know how much you get or why you get it or where it is on the phone.  It like it's just my back.  They're good all over the place.  Yeah, exactly.  And I don't know why that isn't rolled in.  Why is that the TV service not part of like just my Apple service?  I feel like there should be a larger bundle.

Start time: 3395.02
End time: 3419.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think there might be a larger bundle.  It's everything because you've got Apple News Plus for ten bucks.  Way overpriced.  You've got iCloud for whatever.  No one knows.  Way overpriced.  Definitely that much.  You've got Apple Music.  That's something worthwhile.  Maybe what's that?  Fifteen ninety nine for a family.  Ten bucks for an individual.  What if you said 25 bucks, you get everything, something like that.

Transcript:  Yeah. Apple Ultimate.  Like Microsoft is doing that with the Xbox Live plan and Game Pass.  Right.  And really selling that as the ultimate thing.  And that's that's great.  That kind of works, I think.  So I wouldn't be surprised if we see that next year.  Like there's so much stuff for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  Well, that's kind of I guess what Apple wants to do with Arcade Plus.  If you're not in the Apple ecosystem, if you're one of those people sitting at home  saying, why are they talking about Apple all this time?  Does Apple TV Plus have any draw for you at all?

Start time: 3451.12
End time: 3473.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't think TV Plus does.  But I think Apple Arcade does like 100 titles.  A lot of them sound really compelling.  Yeah. Just just looking at them on paper.  These are games I want to play.  And I don't normally want to like devote time to mobile games,  but they actually have really interesting developers and really cool artists  involved with this whole service.  And I think that's really interesting.  So people would jump on board for that.

Transcript:  This one's kind of for you, Devinder, because you covered this with slash  film, your podcast about film.  Apparently, according to The Hollywood Reporter, Apple offered J.J.  Abrams half almost half a billion dollars  to for a production deal with Bad Robot, which he turned down.  And ended up going with AT&T's Warner Media for less.  Wow. Five year deal for for 250 million.  But the sources said it was Apple's offer was almost twice as much.  That showed that's a problem for Apple.  If they can't woo these guys,  for whatever reason, and I don't know if it's a content issue,  if it's it was an exclusivity issue, they didn't want it.  He didn't want the exclusive.  He would have been allowed to work on Star Wars or Star Trek or other TV projects.  So but you're paying a lot for that exclusivity.  I'd be exclusive for half a billion.  But he has enough money that he doesn't care.

Transcript:  Well, and J.J.'s got this great relationship with with with Disney, right?  Like producing the Star Wars films.  You've got to imagine you're going to have some Star Wars involvement going forward.  And we already saw this week Bob Iger resigned from the board of Apple, right?  Because of a conflict of interest over Apple TV plus and and Disney plus.  So I'm sure that's an issue.

Start time: 3580.82
End time: 3600.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure there's something going on too with Disney,  like trying to keep him around or available.  So there's a lot.  Also, I think these stories reported like he could potentially be getting more money  from AT&T as well, like through other types of deals or other other financial incentives.  So it's not just the cash that he's probably looking at.  There are potential issues.

Transcript:  The Hollywood Reporter says bad robots can develop not only film and TV,  but video games and digital products, because, of course, Warner includes HBO,  the new HBO Max service.  I mean, if you're a creator, yeah, that's a much better.  Even if the dollars are less, that's a much better long term offer.  So I can kind of understand that.  And he's working with Apple.  He's doing three shows at Apple, but there but through Warner.  So, yeah.

Start time: 3630.44
End time: 3639.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

You know, Silicon Valley, when I was running Channel Flip,  I used to run this all the time, right, which is that people at YouTube  are driven by algorithms and the creators that make stuff are driven by creativity.  And it's like people talking to completely different languages.  And they just they just don't get it.  And I don't think they, you know, there is just nothing that will overcome that.

Only California and Alabama  are not in this 50 U.S.  states and territories announced a broad anti-trust investigation  of Google. The pile on continues.  But the toughest thing is it seems to be their different constituencies.  Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton says,  you know, they're worried about Google's left leaning slant.  They're focused on online advertising and censorship.  They dominate the buyer side, the seller side, the auction side,  the video side with YouTube.  Some are worried about monopoly. Some are.  It's it's a complicated thing and it's an interesting coalition.  How worried should Google be?  How about we start with you, Will, from across the pond, because the EU  has also been pretty critical of Google, another big fine.

Start time: 3878.37
End time: 3939.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the the answer is probably not that worried.  I mean, if you've got 50 50 U.S.  states and territories, the chances of coordination  between a bunch of people who are going to be fundamentally  politically unaligned, as you say, there are people in Texas  who want to go after it for left leaning bias, people on the left  who want to go after it for being a monopoly that's, you know,  that's a capitalist disaster.  Like, you're not going to get anybody to agree on anything.  And I think if you so at the state level, I think, you know, from  from, you know, my rudimentary understanding of American politics  is going to be a disaster.  And if you look at the federal level, look at what the, you know,  the kind of level of fine that Facebook has been getting for stuff  that arguably is far more egregious and the completely free pass  it's getting on, you know, electioneering.  I don't think there's this, you know, there's any hope that there's  going to be any regulation or any kind of penalty that's going to  incite a meaningful change in behavior in these people whilst  they're making so much money doing it.

Transcript:  There are still investigations being like, I think, who's it?  New York attorney general?  Yeah.  Letitia James.  Yeah, is still pursuing something against Facebook.  So it's like everything is being looked at now.  But the key is like Google and Facebook are now both under fire.  I don't know if this like this seems so haphazard, like 50 different  states and a lot of different things like there are too many ideas  and there are too many people pursuing different angles for any of  this that really have much of an effect.  But I like seeing the state governments and the federal government  paying more attention to these companies.  They just need a smarter and more concerted effort and way to like  actually hold them account for when things go wrong.

You break YouTube off from Google.  You're going to have an absolute massive creation of shareholder  value. If anything, the fact that these investigations are ongoing  should be assigned to, I mean, no investment analyst hold my hands  up, but like, you know, I would be bye-bye-bye.

Start time: 4073.98
End time: 4139.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think that anyone has to worry right now because they're  deciding, they're opting to not put any major penalties up for them.  So that's pretty much going to become a slap on the wrist.  I think that what Google is really worried about is that they're  going to put it regulations or which probably in the end is that's  what's going to happen.  It's happening in the EU.  Interesting.  It's going to happen.  It's just going to happen in a certain amount of time when people  understand a little bit more about the Internet and they become  lawmakers. But even with the EU issuing like, you know, like 9  billion in fines for Google, that's a slap on the wrist.  That's like they make 40 billion a year.  This is like three months of change for them.  So it's even that is nothing to them.  Regulations they will care about and if anyone has to go to jail for  anything that they will care about.  But until that happens, Google.  Yeah, exactly.  I'll be honest.  That's my feeling to it is that, you know, you mess with people's  privacy, you try to, you know, mess in elections.  That should be something that is a crime.

Transcript:  How's that?  Yes, I think he should go to jail.  He's doing this for sure.  I think it has to be made a crime before he goes to jail.  But I think it should be a criminal offense to mess with elections  because that ruins a democracy.  I don't think that anyone's feeling that Zuck is doing this, you know,  for anything but for profit.  And I think that's...  Here's an interesting point of view from...  You tampered with a machine.  Oh, sorry.  But if you tampered with a machine, you got caught tampering with  an election machine.  You'd go to jail.  Physically, you'd go to jail.  Right.  So digitally should be no difference.

Like, there's a lot of this where they were responsible for this platform  and did nothing and kind of let things continue as they were going.  So I think there should be some way to stop that or at least punish them  for allowing something like that.  Yeah.  It's the only thing that will stop them from doing it.

Start time: 4242.74
End time: 4263.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

And in fact, Microsoft didn't continue to win.  So it didn't really matter, right?  I mean, that was a way.  Don't you think that Microsoft prosecution by the DOJ and the EU was wasted time in the long run?

Start time: 4264.92
End time: 4270.36

Like I would roll through every single stop sign.  I'll just be honest here.  If Georgia.  If a cop wasn't going to stop me, I was going to get a ticket.  We have to have something in place and until the entire political system kind of gets with the technology  and understands it enough to make regulations that matter and criminal offenses where criminal offenses would make sense.

I think the closest thing to what we're seeing now is like, you know,  the unraveling of the financial system in 2008 and how many people went to jail over that, right?

I think the big thing is like the tech companies just did the best job of milking as much capital as they could out of this entire system.  And algorithms helped and everything helped.  And it didn't matter if there was potential like issues along the way or human costs because at the end of the day,  all that mattered was like, yeah, following the algorithm and getting as much profit as possible.

Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, pretty much.  I mean, there are plenty of things to like we talk about within tech circles.  We talk about these ideas like privacy and kind of what's going on at these companies.  But I'm I'm amazed how like typical users,  mainstream users don't hear about much of this stuff.  And I guess I shouldn't be surprised.  Like I I'm surrounded by the media bubble.  So I think like everyone thinks like I think and I should probably realize that's not the case.  I remember I was doing shortly after after the election.  I was holding some 1984 readings here at the Brooklyn Public Library  and we had a great group of people.  That's cool. It was cool.  It was a great discussion because we were like, oh man, what it what are we approaching here?  And I talked to it was a great group of people like smart, funny, thoughtful people who read the news.  And I was like, well, you know, this is really similar to, you know,  the things Snowden revealed and the, you know, global surveillance network  that he kind of unearthed that our governments are portraying or perpetuating.  And they didn't know anything about it.  They didn't hear about this story.

But I think that Devendra's point of how like mainstream people don't are,  you know, really knowledgeable about what's happening.  It should be taught at the school and and to children so that they understand what they are,  you know, that you're the product if you're not paying for something.

I I know Google's got a lot of information about me.  But as a result, my Google Assistant is smart.  You know, I just installed the Google Home Nest Home Hub Max.  God, these names are just oh boy.  It has a camera.  Yeah. And when I walk in front of it, it says hi Leo.  Isn't that creepy?  It knows me.  Well, and by the way, it asks you it asks you when you set it up.  Is that okay?  And I said yes.  And it says here's your schedule.  It sees me.  It recognized me says here's your schedule.  Here's some stuff you'd be interested in.  I think that's great.

How much information that they take and where it's being used.  So yeah, that's it's wonderful.  I would love to have a digital assistant that was intelligent.  But would I trade my privacy and you know, do I trust Google to be able to have that information?  I want to cut Google as far out of my life as is possible.  Even if I'm using a, you know, sad duck duck go browser system instead a little sad.  It's getting better.  It's getting better.

Yeah, show me pictures with those people and now I have a lovely slideshow because I have given Google over 70,000 photos taken over the last 15 years and it has a wonderful.

Transcript:  When when once we started realizing like oh Amazon and other companies in Google are people are actually listening to your voice clips to make this voice recognition tech better, which seems kind of obvious on the Facebook, but they never admitted to that and they never told us exactly that was happening.  I I think we should be a little skeptical.  Like what is just for it to recognize your face like is a video clip being sent back to Google?  Is somebody actually making sure like actually massaging the facial recognition?  We don't know what's happening with this.  So I just think that's the bigger problem when I got the home Max Nest thing.

See who your camera already knows apparently doesn't know anybody and says familiar face detection uses feature in compliance with the law.  Thanks.  Don't tell me what the laws depending on where you live.  You might need to get the consent of people visiting your home.  Do I have to put a sign up on my front door that says your face is being surveilled?  You are being recognized.  I probably do.  And the camera.  Yeah.

It gets better at recognizing their face or other body parts tap a face to see how the camera did and if something's not right delete that picture from the group.  So I'm training Google aren't I I'm saying here's what here's what anybody comes to my door.  Here's what they here's what they look like.

Start time: 5152.82
End time: 5181.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you are.  Yeah.  But one of the big questions is going to be like what is is not what Google is doing with the data.  It's what the the government is going to tell Google to do with the data that they're not going to tell you about right.  Remember the whole scandal post 9 11 when you know the government forced all the phone companies to put you know logs into everything to collect all the cool metadata and nobody found out about it for years.  So what's going to happen.

Start time: 5181.86
End time: 5223.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tell me that.  So I just read as an example I read an article in the New Yorker this week that says forget it climate change is going to happen.  We're all dead.  So I ordered a book.  I've ordered two books that it said you know what.  It made a strong case.  Oh great.  You ordered.  Yeah.  So I ordered books killed some trees on these books is written the worst case scenarios like the sea rise temperature rise so that I can plan for the next 30 years where you know where I should live what I should do should I wear sunscreen that kind of thing.  And I figured that's a sensible reaction to something that I can't change.  I don't know why I brought this up.  There's a reason I brought this up.

Transcript:  I think what's scary is that a lot of this stuff is happening and we can't I think we're moving faster than science fiction in some ways.  Who could have predicted like what happened with this past election and then our response to it isn't to like say hey maybe maybe maybe we should do a redo.  Maybe we should do something about the fact that there was this weird interference.  There was like yeah a lot of things going on at once.  We don't have the mechanisms to respond to issues when they occur.  So I don't think there is a simple fix for this but we talked about regulation before.

Start time: 5282.12
End time: 5306.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is fine.  I do think like I don't trust the government like intrinsically but I do think like it's worth having something.  We need regulations of some sort.  I think we will need like a federal Department of Data or something like that because like that scares the hell out of me.  Yeah but why what kind of keeping your car secure.  What is keeping like everything we have to rely on in our food.  It's not perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Seatbelts have made people safer and that was regulated and now there's like I'm not saying I'm with Devendra on that like the government is always going to do the right thing.  But you know usually we vote the government in that we have chosen because of what they stand for and hopefully that is aligned with the culture the change and the technology that's of the time.  And when they do a good job they save lives and seatbelts is a great way of you know in the states that they have them.  They do save lives and airbags save lives as well and when they make sure that cars are now safer than they ever used to be because of different regulations that are there that can be great.  I'm not saying that it can't also go sideways but I think that in most cases we want to trust the government officials that we have chosen to be elected to do the right thing.

Start time: 5353.86
End time: 5374.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And remember the car companies fought seatbelts they fought all these safety additions to cars tooth and nail like they fought so hard to keep seatbelts out because it's a little more cost for them even though it's literally saving people's lives.  So I can I don't think we should ever just leave the really precious commodities in the hands of the people you know banking off of it.

Start time: 5374.66
End time: 5384.84

Start time: 5385.32
End time: 5424.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you have a really hard to do anything like like a lot of the pressure around yes there was government regulation around seatbelts but it became socially you know it became a peer thing right.  You can see if someone wasn't wearing a seatbelt and it was almost like a peer pressure thing to get you to do it.  I think that was a long long while.  Yeah one of the challenges with with data is like because it's so intangible we can't see you know the lack of it or we can't see where it's going.  We can't see that there is a seatbelt or there's not a seatbelt.  We've got no idea what the heck is going on.  So it's really hard to kind of to have any kind of visibility over it.

Yeah this sort of thing is fine.  But Leo to what you're saying when there are issues when there are issues like if there's a data breach we've seen so many companies just kind of just kind of hide it.  It's kind of say yeah we'll talk about this in a couple of months or something.  Okay but thanks to GDPR now that's not the case.

Start time: 5506.72

And as I understand this Mike it's the poster boy for nothing.  And maybe no people.  It's the poster boy.  No no no over over here.  So over here we've had to do like I mean I.

Transcript:  Yeah there were there's a lot more insidious stuff that was going on particularly with ad tech before GDPR.  And you know if you follow you know a lot of ad tech blogs you know the way that GDPR has impacted user data has been pretty.  You think it's been on the balance it's been good.  It definitely has been good on the balance.  Now do consumers see you know the effect on the consumer is having to click a sodding pop up thing every time you go onto a website.  But behind the scenes.  It's just a bad UI implementation of this whole thing.  It's a bad UI implementation.  But behind the scenes it's made a huge difference to the way that ad companies including Google think about data collection.  And at least it's the starting point for a conversation about how we should be doing data you know is it is it better to have no GDPR at all.  OK maybe there's no you know massive outcry.  But you know when something goes wrong but at least there's something there is a mechanism to hold some degree of accountability and maybe going forward we can build on it and have GDPR version 2.  But put Zuckerberg in jail right.  There's going to be.

Start time: 5635.22

Like how deep that goes and like that was that was targeting the minority weaker Muslim population in China and like that's terrifying.  Like we we need better mechanisms worldwide to deal with this stuff.  But the very least I think like GDPR was a start.  The U.S. needs similar sorts of regulations.  I think we need stronger stronger federal departments to deal with this stuff too.  Like it's you know this is how we're going to get there.

If we like I do think we rely I think Google's doing a better job of monitoring Apple than the U.S.  federal government because they understand it more.  But we rely on the CIA to filter international chatter to see like where the potential terrorist attacks like what are the potential  dangerous to the U.S.  What things could happen in the world.  I don't think it's too much to ask.  I think we need something on that level to deal with the data that's actually happening around us and like the vulnerabilities that data opens up basically.

Your first thought will be how do I protect myself from this instead of how to make sure that I follow the law to do the right thing.  So because of that we need some sort of oversight that comes from outside of all all agencies period government agencies computer you know companies  because it's impossible.  Our base nature is protection and save ourselves.  It's a horrible thing to say.  But we are you know altruistic after the fact.  Not really during the moment when there's a shortage of something or we're in our own harm.  Let's take a little break.

Transcript:  We're going to get a little demo of the Knuckles controllers.  While George is getting her Knuckles controllers our show today brought to you by WWT.  Worldwide Technology and their Advanced Technology Center.  They started building this 10 years ago.  It actually filled a gap because it used to be I remember we worked at the Ziff Davis Labs in Foster City.  And there were these labs and we would do all these reviews.  But that went away.  Where do you go now if you're enterprise and you want to know is this going to work with what I'm using already?  How do I incorporate NetApp or Cisco or VMware into my system?  It's an amazing lab.  Half a billion dollars of equipment.  Hundreds of OEMs.  Key partners ranging from heavyweights like NetApp, Cisco and VMware to emerging disruptors like Tanium and Equinix and Expanse.  This lab is used by WWT's engineers to beta test new equipment.  To build reference architectures.  To set up custom integrations for WWT customers.  To help those customers make the right decisions.  To see what's going to happen.  To see results with a lot less investment.  It's really an incubator for IT innovation.  On demand and schedule labs.  I'll give you an example.  NetApp Cloud volumes on tap.  On tap on flash.  NetApp Disaster Recovery as a service.  You could try all of these out.  You could see is this right for me?  Is this going to work in my enterprise?  Along with hundreds of other labs representing the newest advances in things like flash storage.  Multi cloud hyperconverged infrastructure.  Cloud data management.  You need to learn about these products before you launch them.  WWT's engineers use these environments to spin up proofs of concept and pilots.  They have a sandbox.  That way customers could choose the best solution.  But here's the best part.  They now offer lab as a service.  A dedicated lab within the ATC.  Where customers can do their own programmatic testing.  Using this half billion dollar ecosystem WWT has built.  And because it's virtual.  You don't have to go to St. Louis.  You can use it anywhere in the world.  Anytime.  24 7.  This digital platform is so cool.  It is now launched.  It covers the entire Advanced Technology Center ecosystem.  And man it is the it is a multiplier for knowledge speed and agility anytime anywhere around the world for their customers.  You get access to articles to case studies.  You get those hands on labs.  You get tools that can make the difference.  In today's world things are changing fast.  You need the ATC.  You need WWT.  To learn more about Worldwide Technology.  Their Advanced Technology Center.  And to sign up for access to their new on demand lab platform.  All you got to do is go to WWT.com slash twit.  WWT.com slash twit.  WWT simplifies the complex.  WWT.com slash twit.  Worldwide Technology.  Worldwide Technology delivering business and technology outcomes all over the world.  That is awesome.  Hey if you apply for the $125 in Equifax refund.  You got more to do kids.  I love this register article.  If you put in the $125 claim.  By the way you ain't going to get $125.  But if you put in a $125 claim.  You got an email on Friday.  That says validate or amend your claim.  And Equifax explains even though.  You found out about its settlement.  Which they didn't want you to know about.  You found the online address where you had to apply.  Even though you inputted all the details you were asked for.  Even though you selected to take the cash option.  You're not done.  You now need to give them more information.  Quote.  Your claim will not be received by the settlement administrator.  Until you click the submit button after your electronic signature.  For security reasons.  Once you hit submit.  You will not be able to make any changes.  To your claim form.  You have until October 15th to reconfirm.  I did it.

Transcript:  Something.  The problem is it's a giant.  It's a pool.  Well here's the problem.  FTC announced the $575 million settlement in July.  Of the $575 million.  They earmarked $125 million.  To compensate you and me and everybody who was affected by the Equifax breach.  Oh but wait a minute.  In fact.  Those were the headlines.  But in fact FTC has only really agreed to $31 million.  A pot of money that will split equally among all the people who apply.  If only a quarter of a million people out of the 175 million people affected apply.  Then you'll get $125 per person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No no I'm sorry.  What is that?  Four times 175.  If one in like 650 applies then you get 125 bucks.  But it goes down fast.  If more people apply.  You're right.

Start time: 6187.20
End time: 6193.12

Transcript:  If a million people out of the 175 million apply.  You'll get $31.  But Carson if everybody who's eligible applies.  You'll get 21 cents.  Woohoo!  I'm rich!  That's the postcard to send you the money.  It'll cost more.  The stamp.  Yeah.  You know I just.  I agree.  It feels like we should do something.  But I'm afraid that anything we do is going to be the wrong thing.  And it's going to make it worse.  I just feel like that's the problem.  Let's talk about something nice and happy.  The Pixel 4.  What do we know?  Because Devinder.  There are a lot of leaks.

Start time: 6253.14
End time: 6258.11

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's Pixel Time.  There's so much.

Start time: 6269.14
End time: 6305.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the most notable thing about the Pixel 4 and the amount of leaks.  Yes it's got great camera.  All those extra things.  I think the thing for me that is the most interesting about the Pixel 4 is how much more integrated and how much better.  The Google Assistant is compared to Siri.  It really is.  It's kind of unbelievable how far.  I hate.  As a bit of an Apple fanboy I hate saying it.  But how woefully bad Siri is compared to Google Assistant.  Why don't more people buy Pixels?

Start time: 6305.54
End time: 6306.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The camera's better.

Start time: 6307.22
End time: 6363.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Assistant's better.  Because you're in the ecosystem right?  I think we just saw in that promo for all about Android.  They've got the feature that will put you.  If you're on hold on a call.  Put them on hold.  It will tell you when someone's come back.  And it's like how.  I can barely get Apple to do that.  I can barely get Apple to call my mum at the right time.  It's true.  It's true.  The fact is that Google is collecting all this stuff.  And it is making those products better.  And the Pixel 4 will be a better product.  Because you've got that camera on your porch.  And you know.  I think it is interesting that we talk about all this stuff about data.  When you're talking about the interesting new things on the Pixel 4.  And you know.  It's interesting that we talk about all this stuff about data.  When you're talking about the interesting new things on the Pixel 4.  For me the assistant stuff is like the most interesting stuff.  Microsoft.  It makes a huge difference too.  Like I have to say using Siri is a painful painful experience.  That's because you need more people to listen to what you're saying.

Start time: 6363.14
End time: 6369.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And grade it to make it better.  But they're not spending the time where they should be 100%.  And you know I do sometimes think that she's suffered a head injury.

Start time: 6369.30
End time: 6372.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 6373.38
End time: 6394.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or something's wrong with her.  And I think that she's suffered a head injury.  And I think that she's suffered a head injury.  And I think that she's suffered a head injury.  Or something's wrong with her every time I speak with her.  Whereas Google's assistant is brilliant.  Whereas Google's assistant is brilliant.  Go home Siri you're drunk.  And listens and can do so much more.  There's something. She needs a little bit of help.  But I mean that's the point.

Start time: 6395.14
End time: 6402.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Siri needs to tell me when to go home because I'm drunk.  Siri needs to tell me when to go home because I'm drunk.  And I feel like Google assistant can do that.  And Siri hasn't got a head.

Transcript:  The hell with you Siri.  You're wrong. Go away.

Start time: 6407.14
End time: 6433.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It definitely has more to do with the way those two assistants work too.  Siri is more like locally based.  Siri is more like locally based.  Like a lot of the processing is happening on your phone.  The sound, the voice recognition isn't as good.  The sound, the voice recognition isn't as good.  Even though they're still using some of the cloud based things.  I believe from Nuance.  Whereas Google assistant is very much cloud based.  Whereas Google assistant is very much cloud based.  Like it's doing all that work and very quickly.  So Google has done that work.  Basically to make all that integration work.

Transcript:  On the Moto X it was help me Obi Wan Kenobi.  Which was a phrase I was very unlikely to say in any other context.  I had to be careful when watching Star Wars Episode 4.  It was a very long phrase.  But it was a nice thing.  Now if that phone ages ago could do it.  I still don't understand why no one is doing that.  Why can't we customize the trigger?  Wouldn't that help with these false wakes and all that stuff?  Well I think it plays into what we're doing.  I think it plays into what we're doing.  I think it plays into what we're doing.

Transcript:  Well I think it plays into what Devendra was saying about doing things locally versus doing things in the cloud.  And I think it's the wider, there is a wider trend that we see even across the camera things.  And these combinations of better hardware and better software.  Combined with computing in the cloud.  The fact that Google can do all this computational photography that layers things on top of each other.  You've got to imagine that they're doing similar level of sophistication stuff.  I think it has to be on device.

Start time: 6665.79

Start time: 6669.18
End time: 6682.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember the Moto X had a low power processor that was kind of doing stuff in the background.  It was always on.  So that was a really unique hardware setup basically.  No other phone had that.  Google didn't really bring that over to other phones.

Start time: 6683.22
End time: 6692.45

Transcript:  I want a one word trigger honestly.  No you don't.  I wanted to understand.  If it's a unique word.  To me that would be more convenient.  And I also wanted them to pop up.  We need more natural language interactions.  So if I look at something and it's like hey can you do this?  I would like my phone.  We are getting eye tracking and things like that.  We'll get there.

I've been following Nuance and Dragon Naturally Speaking  and all this tech for so long.  They can do it.  They've held a strangled hold on this technology  because they've been super anti-competitive  for so long.  There's a lot of stuff  that we still are waiting to get.

Explain, because I haven't seen it,  the kids came home and started digging a trench in our backyard.  Is there some scene where they dig a hole in the ground?  It's a good sense.  Yeah. A good time.  Now I have a trench in my backyard.  They say, yeah, we want to cover it with a tarpon.  They're trying to trap  clowns in my backyard. What are they doing?  Man, kids today.

Transcript:  I need some shovels, some duct tape,  rope, and a couple of oven mitts.  You got those?  Okay.  Sure. They're right over there.  Our show today.  Just keep it outside, kids.  Kids today, I tell you.  At least they're not out in the streets  getting in trouble, right?  That's true.  Right. You must have a tape for that.  What to do if your kids are digging trenches in your backyard?  Our show today brought to you by Wasabi.  You know when you have sushi,  you get that nice green ball of hot wasabi.  That's not what I'm talking about here.  I'm talking about something hot.  It's hot cloud storage.  Wasabi.  Wasabi.  It's hot cloud storage.  Wasabi.  Such a great idea.  This is created as an alternative.  It's hot cloud storage.  It blows away the competition, including Google,  including Microsoft, including Amazon.  Created by my good friend, David Friend.  He started Carbonite.  He's actually a serial entrepreneur.  Goes way back, ARP synthesizer and stuff.  His CTO, Jeff Flowers,  they came up with a way back in the Carbonite days  to lay data on disks sequentially  as opposed to in blocks.  They have got the patent.  And as a result, you get storage  that's 80% cheaper  and up to 6 times faster than Amazon's S3.  Just because it's a fifth the cost of S3.  It uses Amazon's API,  but they don't charge for egress.  There's no hidden fees for API requests.  You get 11 nines of durability.  You get data center redundancy,  data integrity checking.  Here's the thing I like the best.  And this is a real answer to the  true ransomware crisis we're in right now.  You get something called immutable storage.  You can't at any time say,  that data there, that can't be changed.  That can't be touched.  No ransomware can destroy it.  No human error can erase it.  That is immutable storage.  That makes it more secure  than your on-premises storage.  It's amazing.  HIPAA compliant, FINRA compliant, CJIS compliant.  Go to the cloud and everybody is these days.  And I know  you've got the list.  It's Google, Microsoft, Amazon. I know.  I just want to add a fourth name.  Just check it out. Wasabi.com.  W-A-S-A-B-I.  This is hot cloud storage.  And in order to compete with the big boys,  they've got to be better. And they are.  Lightning fast, totally secure,  completely affordable, never any charge  for egress or API requests.  This is disruptive technology.  You've got to try it. Look at all the companies  that are starting to use Wasabi. I feel  really good about this because  I've known David for years. When he  launched this company, we talked.  He said, I believe in this.  We've got to get the word out. And I'm glad to help.  Wasabi.com.  I'll tell you what we can do. We've got a free trial for you.  You can get one anyway at the site. But what we can do is make that  an unlimited free trial. Use the offer code TWIT.  Put all the data you can  possibly put up there.  If you use the offer code TWIT, unlimited  free access for a month. So upload  it like crazy. And if you have petabytes  of data, ask about the Wasabi ball.  You can get  that data up there fast. It's really cool.  Wasabi.com.  Thank you, Wasabi, for your support.  So we don't know when the Google  event will be.  We do know there will be a Microsoft event.  They've announced October 2nd, just a few  weeks off. And  it'll probably be a surface event,

Start time: 7211.28
End time: 7258.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right, Devendra? Yeah, most likely.  I think last year, October 2nd,  was the last one. It's the same exact day.  I think so, yeah. And  they typically have a surface event every year now.  What's interesting is that they're always pretty  low-key. Like, Microsoft doesn't run,  like, they don't have a stage presentation.  Last year, they didn't even live-stream  it. It was just like a short,  small thing for press. This year, it's going to be  live-streamed. I think  we're going to see some really  interesting things here, too. We are  waiting for some surface laptop updates,  some surface book updates, and it sounds  like  they're hinting at new experiences.  And I'm thinking, given  how everything is going this year,  I'm thinking we may see something dual-screened.  And that would be kind of fun. There have been  rumors, haven't there? Yeah. And there is even  code. Like a dual-screen tablet, like a courier thing.

Start time: 7259.14
End time: 7277.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there's even code in Windows that would  encourage us to think this.  So we will stream it. We'll cover  it live, October 2nd. It's out in New York City  because they're streaming it. We can.  Do our traditional Mystery Science  Theater 3000 coverage of it. We sit  in front of the screen and mock it. I love those, by the

Start time: 7283.50
End time: 7305.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  way to watch anything, like an Apple event or  a Microsoft event, is with friends.  Like in a big group. Like watch it at work or with  friends. Other people would care. Because it's so  much fun to throw spit  balls and mock it and just  talk about it. And then get excited when it's  something to cheer about. So for those of you who can't  watch it in a group like that,  watch it with us. We're a group.  We'll all watch it together. I will say, for people

Transcript:  who don't pay attention to Microsoft hardware  anymore, I'm far more excited by  Microsoft's hardware these days than Apple's  hardware. Especially when it comes to  PCs. They're making some of the  best laptops around. They're consistently  great. They have keyboards  with travel and they feel amazing.  I'm just so impressed with what they've been doing.  They're the underdogs. They have to  rise to the occasion and do something

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  here for a long time and I've switched over to  a Lenovo all-in-one that does  the same thing. It's got the shallow angle.  It has a knob. The knob  is a USB knob that plugs  in like that.  It doesn't have the dial.  Well, it is like a dial though because I can program it  to do different things. This is the mute button.  It's programmable. In fact, it will sense  different apps. You can't really see  because of the wire. It will sense different apps.  The color will change if I'm running Photoshop.  You can have different tasks  assigned. The other thing I really like about this,  it also comes with a pencil. It's half  the cost of the Surface with a much  faster processor, 32 gigs of RAM.  This pad right here,  you can't see it, but behind it,  is a Qi charger.  I can put my phone on it  and it charges.  Does it go fully flat, Leo?

Also, it's 16.9, not 3 by 2.  What do you think of 3 by 2? Microsoft  really likes that 3 by 2 aspect ratio.  I think for laptops, it's kind of nice.

Transcript:  I like having a little more vertical space.  I can see more in a  web browser. 16 by 9 is so  limiting. I think we've all kind of gotten used to it.  It was because of TV, right?  That was the reason.

And what's neat is they had built a...  I'm running a bunch of Minecraft servers at home,  and they had built like this giant city.  It's like...  It's got a sewer system.  It's got a lighting system.  It's got a subway.  It's bigger than New York. It's huge.  It's got hospitals. There's helicopters.  There's a medevac helicopter.

Transcript:  And finally,  MoviePass calls it quits.  So long.  If you were smart enough to get a MoviePass  and you were able to raise money,  that was crazy.  You helped burn that $100 million  in funding.  It's amazing that they were able  to raise money on a business model  that just didn't seem to have any way  to make money.  I remember you talking about

Start time: 7699.38
End time: 7703.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Start time: 7747.89
End time: 7753.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's the thing. MoviePass  I think launched in 2012.  They went through a lot of different forms.

Start time: 7753.20
End time: 7755.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was expensive when they first started.  It was $40 a month.

Start time: 7757.14
End time: 7774.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was like $40 to $50.  Before the card came out, the card was like  their little tech innovation.  Before MoviePass, there wasn't a way to remotely  add funds to a debit card or something.  They had figured something out  that was kind of cool. But before, you  would have to print out a sheet and bring it to the  theater and get them to scan it.

Start time: 7775.14
End time: 7777.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The theaters might turn it down. The theaters hated it.

Start time: 7777.30
End time: 7839.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The theaters rebelled against all  of this. The theaters didn't want them.  It was a big, big fight. And when the  $10 pricing happened, I  talked to the new CEO. I think his name was  Mitch Lowe. He was a guy who came out of Redbox.  He was the guy who was like,  $1 a night. He seemed like  a smart guy. He seemed like he had a plan.  And that's his plan. It's basically  super low pricing to encourage  as much growth as possible. And that worked.  But they didn't have the rest of the plan  figured out. So when millions  of people actually signed up,  they didn't know how to actually  keep buying these tickets. And then  they had to start canceling  tickets from major screenings,  major movies. They just wouldn't  list it in the app. And it just got  so shady and so messy as a customer  experience. I called this company dead  a year ago because it felt dead.  There was nothing really going on here.  But the very least, we got  all the cinema chains paying attention  to this and launching their own subscription services.  So I'm a big fan of  AMC A-list.  If you live near an AMC theater, it's a good

Start time: 7839.24
End time: 7842.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  MoviePass will be the  native cinema passes.  We have that. Because they can't beat that.  When Mishlo took over, they had 20,000 subscribers.

Start time: 7855.42
End time: 7872.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was really good at hyper growth.  Got them to 3 million subscribers  by a year ago.  5% of all the movie tickets sold in the US  were purchased through MoviePass.  And they were losing 21 million  dollars a month.  Did they pay the theaters the full  freight? Is that how it worked?

Start time: 7873.14
End time: 7894.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They pay the full price. That's how it was.  I think they got bought by a private equity company.  And that's the problem.  Once that happens, they want  to multiple, you know,  they want to sell this company for multiples of what it's  worth or something. And they  weren't getting enough funding to kind of keep it all going.  So too successful,  too quickly, I guess, at this final  stage. That was their big problem.

Start time: 7895.26
End time: 7902.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They didn't think of step two. When they have all of  those subscribers, what do they now do?  I think  Lo did have a plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He knew the marketing. He had the marketing  down. They didn't have the logistics down.  They didn't have like  basically a parent company that would actually  support them to grow. Like if they got  a decent amount of funding  in to keep it going, I think if this was like  five years ago, maybe  in the dot com bubble was like a  bit hotter. Like they probably would have been able to  fight through it. Like Uber, how much money is Uber  losing? You know, Uber  as a company, who knows if they'll ever be  profitable. But they're still going because they got all  this early VC money and everybody  just wants them to succeed basically.

I'm seeing it next week, but I've heard good things.  I'm also going to be talking about Undone,  that new rotoscoped animation  show on Amazon. It  is incredible. So  the one takeaway from everything I'm saying tonight,  go watch Undone. You won't regret it.  It's an amazing show. But you know, I missed.  It's on Amazon Prime.  It's from the Bojack Horseman creator and  one of the writers from Bojack.  And it's so good. It's just  great science fiction rooted in a really great

Transcript:  Yes. And it's very  intuitive. So you whistle.  You put your hands just to your mouth  and your Falcon will come to you.  And if you point to what, on  one hand, it's sending, you know, it's your Falcon hand.  You point to something, the Falcon will go  and attack or bring it to you.  And so it's  really cute. You can fist bump  the Falcon. Oh, you can give it  a beard. It's like the cutest thing  ever. And when you touch the Falcon  and pet it, you actually feel a little  bit of a rumble on your  controllers.  I like seeing this because this is innovative.
