Dvorak off for a turkey day.  But we've got some great people in studio with us to celebrate starting with Dwight  Silverman from the Houston Chronicle, a regular on the show and always a welcome guest.  Hey Dwight.  Hello Leo.  Good to see you again.  Good to be here.  Also a rare visit from Mr. Paul Thurotte, who is the host of Windows Weekly.  I've broken my blockage of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you were banned after a while, but I think enough time has gone by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was my defense of Vista three years ago, wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes it was.  No, no, actually your wife asked me to have you on to try to break the hold of Modern  Warfare 2.  I don't know if it's going to succeed, but.  I have completed the multiplayer.  Consider this an intervention.  You can't complete the multiplayer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree.  And I'm going to prove that contention correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm really thrilled to get Jerry Pornell back.  The last time Jerry was on, he was undergoing treatments that caused his voice to be pretty  gravelly and make it difficult for him to talk.  Jerry's better and feisty and we're so glad to have you back on Jerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank you.  Yes, it feels a lot better.  50,000 rads of hard radiation will do strange things to your memory and your voice and other  things, but it also does fatal things to the cancer.  So that's the good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the treatment was successful then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Very.  I have no cancer whatsoever.  I have some residual effects from radiation damage, but they mostly have to do with very  short term memory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well I couldn't.  And not much of that.  I speak for all of us saying we couldn't be happier.  I have to say worried.  And so we're really glad that you're back and better.  That's great.  Sure.  Yeah.  The reason you're here Jerry, well there's several reasons.  One is that Audible has released two of your classics.  Swarms was the only one for a long time and now The Moten God's Eye and Lucifer's Hammer  are both on audible.com.  And I've been reading, I am ashamed to admit I never read Lucifer's Hammer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I may pander to Jerry, two of the greatest books ever written.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well I'm going to agree with you.  Thank you.  I mean I'm just going crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact there are a handful of books that I can say probably contributed to me wanting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to be a writer and certainly to passion for science fiction and Lucifer's Hammer is one  of them.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you.  Well that was in fact I think the conversation Paul and I had was how much you and your column  in Byte Magazine for many years influenced us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah discovering that Jerry wrote for Byte was a watershed moment.  No I'm serious because most computer, all computer writing to that date and most since  has been very dry and interesting.  Garbage.  It's terrible.  Yeah.  No I mean it had personality.  You could tell it was a real person having real problems.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well when I got into Byte, Byte Magazine was one of the early computer magazines.  This is CPM S100 days and the most Byte articles were done by professors of computer science  whom the editors tried to hammer the stuff into something readable and sometimes they  managed it and sometimes they didn't.  So when I talked to Carl and he said well why don't you try seeing what you can do with  it.  They didn't have to edit me.  Whether or not what I had to say was useful it certainly didn't need editing if you know  what I mean.  And I tried to keep it useful in the sense of here's what I'm doing to try to use these  darn fool machines which in those days you know you rewrite the bios in the typical way  when you got a new machine.  Yeah.  So you do an interface with CPM in order to be able to use electric pencil.  Wow.  I have to say I go ahead Jerry.  I paid twelve thousand dollars for that first machine which is now by the way on display  in the Smithsonian.  Is it?  Literally yeah if you go to the hall of computing in the Museum of American History the third  from there's an old IMSI paddle wheel there's a course in Altair and the third one is old  Ezekiel my old Z80 that was the machine I wrote all those columns on and wrote the first  novel anybody ever wrote using a computer to write a novel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really what was it which novel was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We don't remember.  It wasn't Moat.  Moat was finished as a novel but it wasn't written on Moat it was written on a typewriter.  So it was probably Inferno and a couple of my individual ones and of course by that time  I was writing the columns on it and I was the science editor of Galaxy so those columns  got put together into a book called A Stepfather Out.  Nobody's quite sure which one and I didn't save the stuff.  And now they exist only on 8 inch floppy disk 64K.  Imagine 64K on your mass storage device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're going to have to go to the Smithsonian just to read the floppies borrow Ezekiel back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah I was thinking that you know I woke him up at the Smithsonian so he'd know where it  was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh that's so neat.  That was one of the things I always loved about the Chaos Manor column they all had  names.  I loved that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And the Larry Niven stuff you know you were almost like tech support for Larry Niven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yeah well Larry's answer to the computer revolution was to get an exact copy of mine.  In fact he being a Doheny millionaire he got two.  That way he had a spare.  That was back when there were $12,000 for the darn for of which six was the Diablo printer  which was essentially a Selectric with electronic printing.  It could print 1200 characters a minute.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And probably pretty noisy doing it I would say.  I was going to say and cause earthquakes in California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well it took all night to print and of course they print it on fan folded paper and you  had to tear the I'd bribe the kids to tear the ears off the paper and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To burst and decolate.  Wow.  That's one of my favorite phrases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Burst and decolate.  You know I don't think I ever heard that before.  That's a great quote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's you know bursting is taking off the ears.  Yeah.  And decolating of course is tearing it up and putting it, recolating it effectively.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah recolating but I wish I'd said that and probably in a couple hours I will have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can steal it.  I'll give it to you.  It's the least I can do.  So tech news there's a lot to talk about.  Of course this is Black Friday or we're post Black Friday tomorrow is Cyber Monday a day  that I think a lot of if you look at the numbers it's pretty obvious which was just  made up by some journalist somewhere.  He had to make up the idea that there's some magic special magic on Monday.  The theory being that people go back to work and use the fast connection.  Get off of the only computer they have other than what at work.  Yeah it must be from 1988 they came up with this Cyber Monday.  I mean use the fast computer and the fast connection at work.  I think most people have faster connections and certainly have faster computers at home  these days.  In your coverage of Black Friday and Cyber Monday Dwight do you have any trends you saw?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well you know one of the things that I thought was interesting was that the Black Friday  the brick and mortar stores they actually did a lot better.  I think the numbers that I saw they actually did like 3% improvement over last year which  in a down economy is pretty good and that the online sales were just a little were just  up a little bit more but when people were buying online the numbers I saw they were  buying bigger things they were buying more expensive things online and maybe they were  just buying Macs.  But it strikes me that I agree with you I think Cyber Monday is kind of bogus.  It is bogus.  It is by now anyway.  Although I think that there are a lot of people who have probably faster connections particularly  if they you know there are people now who have you know automobile mechanics who have  an internet connection who may not necessarily be able to afford a really fast connection  at home so there is probably a little bit of that type of thing demographically but  the majority of people I think just shop at home and probably shopped over the weekend.  I think that probably if you take a look at numbers that will come out Monday for  the whole weekend I think there is probably a lot of it that happens on Saturday and Sunday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It seemed like last Black Friday I mean it was such a zoo somebody got killed at Walmart.  This one is kind of completely uneventful compared to it.  You know why?  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were home playing Call of Duty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We know that is where Paul was.  Wait a minute Paul you have a tradition don't you going to Best Buy at 4 in the morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah and I did not do it this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well see there you go.  And what were you doing instead?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well sleeping at 3 o'clock in the morning but yeah I did some Call of Duty.  You can do all this stuff online now.  In fact I actually did some Christmas shopping on my iPhone this year.  Wow.  So what did you buy?  The world has changed.  How do you?  I don't know I am afraid to say it.  Did you use the Amazon app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did yeah.  Yeah.  And by the way I will say this it was a book book like an actual book a physical paper.  No why?  Why?  Because that is the only way that this book comes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jerry what do you think of these ebook readers Jerry?  Are you a fan of the Kindle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They are beginning to get I think the whole publishing world is changing in ways that  we can't even figure out.  It will not be very long I think especially with these ebook readers being sold that payment  for somebody's book or work is optional.  You are not going to enforce it with by law because right now the Kindle format you have  to buy something from Amazon to get it on a Kindle but even that is not true anymore.  No you can email your Kindle yeah.  Yeah you can email yourself.  They used to do it for a dime now I understand it is 15 cents a megabyte or some.  Oh that is interesting.  Some number like that which yeah they just raise the price but it doesn't matter almost  anything anybody ever wrote is available somewhere online if you really wanted to go about finding  it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well not always legally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh that is what I mean pirate editions are available for almost everything and at that  point law and copyright are not the primary.  Right now I think most readers think they don't want to do the author and they don't  mind paying because they think that the creator the artist actually gets the money.  That is not true with records because it got built into the DMCA and that famous late night  edition by a staffer who later became a vice president of RIAA that the default in the  contract was that the publisher gets all the money.  So music fans don't really think they are stealing from the artist and they don't like  the publishers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you are right I don't think you have the same animosity towards book publishers  and you certainly I think people have a real affinity for book authors.  Maybe it is a more intimate relationship because it lasts longer I don't know but I think you  are right I think they care more about the author.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that relationship is important to preserve and as Kendall's and various who  did Amazon just came up with.  Barnes and Noble has the nookie reader.  And there is the Sony one which has been pretty good for a long time.  Some of my fans got together and bought me one when they first came out and they engraved  with my name on it which is nice.  But they didn't take off until recently but nowadays with these big price wars going on  and Amazon selling books that are $27 for $9.95 if you buy it on the Kendall and by the way  Amazon is paying the full royalty of a $27 book to the author for that $9.95.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah isn't it they lose money on every one of those sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do they get a cut the publisher gets the same cut too or is it a cut rate because it is  an e-book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Publisher gets the same amount publishers basically sell books for half the cover price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that is the same for an e-book or a printed book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And printed books.  Interesting.  People are getting different arrangements maybe but the standard is still authors get  a percent of the cover price typically 10 percent.  Stephen King gets a little more some authors and new authors get like 8 but it is between  8 and 15.  And that is percentage of the cover price not a percentage of receipts or anything like  that the way the movie houses do.  So the result is that to have all of these deep discounts in books is a very expensive  proposition and best sellers often don't make as much money as you think simply because  in order to get people in the store they discount best sellers down to zip.  The author still gets the money but nobody else does it is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well we are going to actually the price war has heated up considerably.  We are going to talk about in just a second Amazon and Walmart at each other's throats.  Microsoft and Google at each other's throats.  It is the holiday season.  It is the holiday season kids.  Before we do that I want to mention my good friends at Citrix.  I know Jerry knows Citrix.  I go way back with them since the good old days with Ed Iacobucci and they made such  an amazing remote access product that Microsoft promptly licensed it and made it their remote  access product.  They also have a product that makes it very easy for you to meet online and that is called  GoToMeeting.  When I say easy I mean easy.  GoToMeeting.  You could try it right now for free for the next month and see how simple it is to save  money on your business meetings.  GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  According to American Express the average cost of a business trip these days is $1,000  when you add up the plane fare, the hotel, the meals, the per diem, the cab fare.  Not to mention the stress of taking your shoes off in the security line and getting  the middle seat.  Forget it.  $49 a month.  Unlimited meetings as long as you want, as often as you want.  I tell you these are more engaging, more fun, more interesting because they are seeing your  computer screen on their desktop.  So you are showing them the PowerPoint.  You are showing them the drawings.  You are working with them.  If you and Larry had had that when you were writing the books imagine the collaboration.  I will write a sentence, you write a sentence.  I will write a sentence, you write a sentence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I bet it doesn't.  We tried to do that.  We tried to do a book on Twitter around Robin with Tom Merritt and Molly Wood of Buzz Out  Loud and me.  What was happening is it tug of war.  I would have an idea and I would write a line and they would pull it in a different direction.  I would pull it back.  It was terrible.  Worst Menur's novel you ever read.  I take full credit for how bad it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not quite.  Naked came the stranger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Alright, okay.  There are worse.  I agree.  You heard it here first, folks.  Let me just say go to meeting.com slash tweet.  Go there right now.  Try it free for 30 days.  We know you are going to love it.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, the government could have saved a lot of money if they had used Go To Meeting  a couple of weeks ago.  They paid for a number of us to go back to, well, to Tyson's Corner, Virginia if that  means anything to you.  It's pretty near McLean.  SAIS sponsored the meeting.  It was a conference.  They put it on.  Who paid for it is, let's say, a government agency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Three letter agency, no doubt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, a government agency.  They had a bunch of people including three Nobel Prize winners plus me and a couple of  other science fiction people to comment on this subject.  We sat around and talked about it all day.  It was just talking heads at a table plus some PowerPoint presentation.  Look at what we do here.  It could have been easily done right here, what we are doing.  But of course, this way you and the other taxpayers got to pay for me to go back to  Washington where I could see my grandchildren.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm glad to do that, Jerry.  What was the topic of conversation, if I can ask?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It had to do with enhancement, human enhancement.  Wow.  Yes, one of the people who was there, I'll give you some example.  You remember Bubble Boys?  They don't exist anymore, right?  You never hear of them anymore.  They don't.  They're not in the United States.  And the reason for it is because a man named Friedman down at the University of California  at San Diego and his colleagues came up with a technique.  They discovered that it's a gene deficiency, this immune deficiency at birth.  For those who don't know, a Bubble Boy was a kid who has no immune system whatsoever  at birth.  And they raised some of them literally in a plastic bubble.  They kept them separated from the outside world so they couldn't get infected.  Of course, that makes for a very strange life.  And I guess they did a movie about one, a boy, where he finally died at age 18 or something.  He had essentially never been touched by a human being in most of his life except through  a plastic barrier.  You don't hear those anymore.  It turns out to be a gene deficiency and they had developed a technique whereby you take  a virus, you infect it with that gene.  Now you take that gene, that gene carrying virus and inject it into a human being.  It goes in and infects him and infects the bone marrow and the bone marrow now starts  producing non-defective blood cells.  And what do you know?  No more Bubble Boys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, I had no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And there are about 40 kids alive, of whom some 32 are still alive having been treated  by this and are just normal children.  You don't know that they were born to be Bubble Boys.  Well, this chap who invented that was there.  Now imagine that technique when we're thinking of other kinds of enhancements, other genes  to make people have better vision, stronger, smarter.  Now those are not generally single gene control things.  But there are a bunch of things in human behavior that are in fact single gene controlled.  There is no reason why they can't be enhanced at birth by injecting this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to ask, is it military application since it was a government agency?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think a concern, you have people who are interested in maybe trying it, but also there  is some concern about how to inject if somebody else is doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love it that they brought in science fiction authors.  All of us love science fiction.  I probably have everybody listen to the show that loves science fiction.  And it's pretty obvious, and I've talked to a lot of scientists, that great many, if  not most, scientists were heavily influenced by sci-fi and focused their research on areas  that science fiction inspired them to study, which is why in so many ways modern scientific  advances parallel what you guys are writing about decades earlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When you get around to listening to the Moten Godzai, pay attention to the pocket computer.  I wrote that in 1972 and we had what amounted to, well an iPhone does most of what it says  in there, but of course we had to set it a long way away because even in 1972 nobody  thought you would be able to, that I would live to see, to be carrying a pocket computer  like we have in the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we directed some of those.  So Jerry, is it a case of the chicken and the egg?  You know, Arthur C. Clarke came up in theory, came up with the idea for satellites, and  I've talked to the guys at Palm who did the original Palm pilot who said they specifically  designed their device, which was kind of the precursor of things like the iPhone, PDAs,  to look like the communicator in Star Trek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Gene basically got that out of Moten Godzai.  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So which comes first?  Do science fiction writers usually come up with what the scientists invent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Al Ron Hubbard would have said so.  First you have to have somebody bring the drink and then they get to work doing it.  Whether that's true or not, I suspect that Michael Faraday never wrote any, never wrote  any science fiction, nor I guess did Einstein, but a great number of, Dirac did as an example.  Dirac was a fan of H.G. Wells and Verne and many, many, you got a minute and I'll tell  you a story.  Sure, got nothing but time.  The night that the Mariner landed on, no I'm sorry, the Viking landed on Mars, first soft-landed  vehicle on Mars, right?  We had got a bunch of science fiction writers invited to JPL as press.  In my case I was press, I was editor of Galaxy, science editor of Galaxy magazine and I also  was a science correspondent for the National Catholic Press, which was like five million  circulation.  But Mr. Heinlein was there as a science fiction writer, but he had a press badge.  Well about an hour or so before the landing, some PR guy said the place is too crowded,  let's get everybody out of here who doesn't have a real press credential and it will start  with Robert Heinlein.  Out.  So Robert starts charging out and I say Robert, that's terrible, they can't do that to you  and he said, Jerry don't worry about it, there's not going to be cameras up in the cafeteria.  So he went out and I started following and somebody asked me where are you going and  I said they're telling Mr. Heinlein he can't stay here and I'm not going to stay thinking.  Before it was over, over half the science press corps was following us up the hill to  the cafeteria, they brought the cameras and when the Viking actually landed, instead of  the camera being on the governor who had come down to Jerry Brown had come down to be the  big man when it landed, nobody was paying any attention to him.  They were all trying to interview Robert Heinlein on what it felt like to see the first  landing on Mars.  Love it.  So I guess we, and a bunch of the project scientists were up there too and they wanted  to talk to Robert and said you know we got into this business because of guys like you.  So there is something to that, I guess we have some influence in showing kids that maybe  if you spend the time to learn calculus it will do you some good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep, I keep trying to explain that to my kids but it's not working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Have you seen the manga book of calculus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that sounds good though, I'd like to get that.  I think Henry would be impressed.  It is, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There is a manga book of calculus and you'd think that has got to be the dumbest idea  I ever heard.  I'm about to review it from my column.  I like it.  I like it a lot.  And there is also a head first physics book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those head first books are quite good, I like the head first books.  Yeah.  They are both from O'Reilly.  Yeah, they are both from O'Reilly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I could actually hold one of them up probably, I've got them around here.  As I say they are in my review stack.  And there is also a head first here.  I'll get it.  Careful.  Head first statistics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have, I got that from my daughter when she was taking statistics.  It was excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is excellent and it's sound.  I have a master's in experimental statistics so I'm competent to review the book and it's  quite sound.  I would wish I had had it instead of the book I had in statistics when I had to take calculus  of statistics so, probability.  So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is a lot of stuff like that.  We are learning a little bit about how to make stuff more interesting, thank goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, getting to trouble.  As kids are more and more going into social sciences and of course if you really want  to make money you learn how to move money around in circles and you don't create anything.  You just take a percentage as it moves past your hand and you are the smartest guy in  the room.  That I think is probably not the best course of the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah I often wonder that the financial crisis that we are going through which is partly  created by these crazy derivatives created by math geniuses who instead of using their  MIT degrees to make a difference in the world used it to create bizarre financial instruments.  I wonder how much we lost, not merely money and our economic crisis but how much we lost  from the brain drain to Wall Street.  And some of the smartest mathematicians that's where they went because that's where the money  was.  Walmart and Amazon in a fight not just over books.  You mentioned Jerry the price cutting on books but now according to an article in the New  York Times from a couple of days ago it's going to DVDs, toys.  Last Wednesday Walmart dropped the price of the Hasbro Easy Bake Oven which we all grew  up with.  Even Jerry you probably had a Hasbro Easy Bake when you were a kid.  They dropped the price to $17 from $28.  Amazon which had been charging $28 dropped it to $18.  And I'm sure they are losing money on a lot of these things.  Yeah but it's like…  They sure are on the books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead.  They just want to get people into the stores.  Right.  So it's a loss leader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think that Amazon is a real threat to a brick and mortar store like Walmart?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Paul what do you think?  Yeah I think that we're already seeing the disappearance of the small book stores.  Well I should say the medium sized book stores.  The book stores that falls…  The independents are dying.  Yeah they're dying.  Yeah so some of the real small mom and pop stuff you see some of that in small towns  and so forth and then you see Borders and Barnes and Noble but these mall book stores  are all pretty much gone.  They've all been swallowed up and they're being shut down by Borders and Barnes and  Noble now.  Yeah.  Yeah it's as cutthroat as any other industry.  Barnes and Noble is a company that has their own imprint.  They publish their own books.  That's kind of a scary thing in some ways.  And then Amazon of course by as Jerry mentioned earlier is selling their Kindle books to the  loss in many cases.  They're trying to create this platform so they're willing to take a loss and they have  enough money to make it happen.  So yeah absolutely.  I think Walmart and Amazon may ultimately be the two book stores that are left.  That's sad.

Transcript:  Walmart offered a $15 gift card with the purchase of Modern Warfare 2.  Amazon matched it.  That's an awesome decision.  Nothing wrong with that.  Walmart and Amazon offered the Xbox 360 for $199 then threw in a $100 gift card.  Now they're offering the Palm Pixie phone for $175 off suggested retail.  $30 for the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well I point out that if you live in California Amazon starts with a 10% advantage to begin  with because there's no sales tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right.  I don't know how long that will last.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know that's true in Texas too.  California would love to change that but so far they haven't been able to do it and the  feds don't really.  You have to get it past Congress and there are some fairly powerful lobbies involved  there so it will be interesting.  It's interesting to see what happens but you start with a 10% advantage.  How many dry goods stores do you see nowadays?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.  Hardware stores out of business.  They got cleaned up.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There are a few hardware stores because of the technical excellence of the clerks and  it's really the only way they stay open is you've got clerks who actually know where  to find things and what thing you need to unstop your drain and that sort of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm with you.  I keep telling them, you're competing against Amazon.  You better have service.  You better make it easy to find a book.  You better be able to recommend stuff because you're competing against somebody who's going  to undercut you every step of the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You may not have thought of one of the horrible consequences of what's happening with the  bookstore concentrations.  Every time a big Barnes and Noble or one of those book warehouses opens, it's good for  because they have lots of backlist.  You remember when the industry was dominated by B. Valton and they were mostly in the malls  and it was small stores, so they didn't have many books and almost no backlist.  Well, those stores are all going away.  Thank God, those were awful.  You think so, but think about this.  That was the recruiting ground.  If you go to Barnes and Noble, you went there to buy a book.  If you went to Fashion Square Mall, you probably didn't go there to buy a book, but you might  see a book in the window and decide to buy one.  Nowadays, we don't have recruiting grounds for non-readers anymore.  People who are non-readers never get to bookstores.  They never see one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a really good point.  Plus, the few chances they have to read are basically the reading versions of soundbites,  into blogs or email or whatever.  The very short form text, not long form stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, my website tends to run to essays and fairly all text, but much longer sorts of  ... I try to stay at a higher intellectual plane, which is one reason why I don't have  blogging on the site.  I don't know.  It seems to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One exception to the idea of going to websites and things like Amazon.com, keeping you from  kind of having a serendipity discovery, is that Amazon has that very cool feature that  recommends things to you.  If you've bought any books at all or even browsed any books at all, when you first go  to the Amazon homepage, it gives you some recommendations.  That's probably about the best way that you could do it.  At least getting away ... That's kind of the same thing as the window in the mall.  The one thing I'm really interested in is the online battle between Amazon and Walmart,  because Walmart wasn't just matching stuff in their brick and mortar stores.  They were matching stuff online.  I wonder if any of these companies don't have scripts that say Walmart watches what a price  is on Amazon and immediately changes it.  It tweaks it.  You could almost have an eBay situation where you bid things down as a result of the scripts  competing with each other.  That would be interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's a shocking story.  Half the money spent at retail on desktop computers in October, you're not going to  like this, Paul, went to Macintosh.  What's this?  Paul put down Modern Warfare.  Not desktops.  No, it's desktops.  The Mac US retail desktop computer revenue.  I know.  I'm going to give you a chance, Paul, because I saw your tweet.  Actually, this is different from the operating system.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're talking about the amount of money people spend at retail.  Is that what you're talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  According to NPD, Mac US retail desktop computer revenue, yes, you're right, 47%.  Two things there.  I'm sorry, go ahead.  Up from 37%, up from 33% a year earlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so, yeah, Macs are expensive, I think is what we're finding out here.  When this quarter is all said and done, the Macintosh may amount to 8% or 9% of sales  overall in the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You did not like this computer world story, however, about Windows 7 market share.  No, that's a different thing.  That's a different thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People always talk about market share and they don't mean market share and that drives  me crazy.  As far as sales, retail sales, I don't know.  NPD is actually very reliable and I know that from a Microsoft perspective, one of the conversations  I've had with those guys is when NPD came out with numbers about things like iPod market  share and so forth, I'd go back to Microsoft and say, what do you think about this?  And they'd say, oh yeah, we use these guys.  We trust these numbers.  But they're talking about revenue share.  What are you talking about money, dollars?  They're not talking units sold.  Two of the things that are occurring in this economy of ours, which are very interesting  and completely at odds with each other, is that there are only two types of computers  that are selling well in the United States, Macs and netbooks.  Netbooks cost nothing and Macs tend to be fairly expensive, typically more expensive  than your average Mac.  You get like 10 netbooks for one Mac.  Yeah, actually in some cases you can.  This number is interesting.  I mean, I don't dispute it, but I think that this just reinforces the fact that when you  look at PC sales, PC sales this year will be down overall, or down slightly I would  say.  Netbooks are up and Macs are up.  So this makes sense.  Macs cost more money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So do you think that there are really two markets?  There's the rich buyer who isn't price sensitive and is buying the Mac and then everybody else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well sort of, but Macs are high quality machines.  I'm not disparaging Macs.  Actually, one of the really smart things that Apple did, although this comes in retrospect,  I'm certain when they started this campaign I didn't think it was smart at all and I'm  sure a lot of people didn't, is their retail stores give people an opportunity to go in  and look and play with these things and they can see what they're like and I think that  makes a big difference because when you go to a Best Buy or they don't have computers  it's not a great experience.  It's not a good experience.  Well PCs are not a great experience in these stores because the people there don't typically  care and they're destroyed or they don't work or they're sitting there with a blue  screen or whatever it is.  Apple stores are a great experience and most people I think who go into Apple stores are  really coming at it from an iPod, iPhone perspective but then they see the Macs and they think  oh you know, these are great.  And I, yeah, I mean I'm not surprised by this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're saying the Apple store is the B. Dalton of computer sales?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, much, much, much nicer.  No, not at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well there is a point to that in the sense that you get again people going into the Apple  stores in the malls now who didn't go there to buy a computer.  They're wandering in.  They look and they see all that excitement and people moving around and at least in my  local mall the store is filled.  In contrast to about five years ago when Apple stores were filled with salespeople who were  stupid and really insulting almost, they have completely revamped their staff, their customer  attitudes and I think they've done it wonderfully.  I'm quite impressed but people who go to a mall don't necessarily go there to buy a computer  but they get sucked into the Apple thing and they see them and quite often they think golly  that looks, especially with Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh no, even I can get sucked into this.  It's amazing I haven't walked out of one of these stores without a MacBook Pro already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah and especially after Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Apple stores are destination stores.  I think some people are going in there but people will go to the mall just to go to an  Apple store.  Absolutely true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Every single mall visit I've made in the last five visits has been just for the Mac store  but I don't like that.  I would say that.  This is a lot about you by the way.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wouldn't be too much into that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Certainly most of the people who go to an Apple store go to a mall but I do not think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the reverse is a true statement.  False syllogism again.  It gets me every time.  Every time.  It wasn't to buy PsyStars, I'll tell you that.  The clone maker which basically is out of business now thanks to the recent court decision  saying that they did not have any right to put OS X on their PCs that they were selling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can I go and buy one right now?  Are they online?  That's a good question.  Would you guys go to PsyStars.com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they're still operating but they were so mortally wounded by that decision that  it's probably just a matter of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'd think that people would be going there like crazy, like last chance to get one.  I think what's telling is that they sold very few.  They told venture capitalists when they were looking for investment that they were going  to sell hundreds of millions.  According to this article in Computer World, they said they'd sell 12 million machines.  This is a number.  I just pulled it.  Yo, we'll sell 12 million machines in 2011.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love their burning bridges thing too.  They have this rebel EFI thing which is their scorched earth policy.  If Apple won't let us do this, we'll give away the tools so that anyone can do it.  It's so petty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can go to the store right now.  You can call them.  I'm looking at the store right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Would anyone, I know, but could you imagine giving your credit card number to these people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I know.  There's an open duo with Mac OS X 699.  You can download the rebel EFI.  That's free.  Apparently, according to this article, I don't know where they get this number, but according  to this article, PsyStar sold not 12 million.  Six or seven of them.  Not one million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know where they got that number.  Even TechCrunch sells more computers than that.  Does anybody know if it works?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it does work.  I've got a hackintosh.  I know someone who owns one.  They work quite well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's such a dicey proposition.  The problem isn't that it works.  The problem is what happens six months from now when this company is long gone and Apple  releases Mac OS X 10.6.3 or whatever and it just doesn't work on this machine.  This is a horrible future to contemplate.  I can't imagine buying something like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What you pay for with a Mac, of course, is the whole Mac experience, the support group,  the enthusiasm, the genius bar.  You get it all in one package and trying to clone it and hack your way into building a  different kind of Mac is just not, that's not the kind of thing that sells very well.  There won't be many people who want to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think exactly right.  It's 768.  They're well known.  There are more Linux computers.  There are more any kind of computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's more POS computers.  In addition, there are a lot of people who build their own Intel systems including PCs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There are a lot of people who would prefer to build their own high-end gaming machine.  Most of my machines, in fact, every day in one of my look at around here, every PC I  look at, I built myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's less common though than it used to be.  That really was the thing, but I think now people just go to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would actually, if I could throw OS X on a machine, I would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not hard to do, especially with this rebel EFI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not hard to do.  There's probably more hackintoshes out there than the 768 SiStar machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Colleen has 768 upstairs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You don't have ROMs and things.  You have to duplicate the way you did back with old Apple when you were trying to hack  an Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oddly enough, you don't.  That was Apple's kind of anti-piracy measure in the early days is if you didn't have the  ROMs, but now there's nothing to copy.  You build a stock PC.  The only thing is that they don't use BIOS.  They use EFI for booting, but that's easy to get around.  Then it's all on the disk.  It's all in software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what the future of PiStar is, of course, is the Amiga.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If they make an Amiga, they'd sell a few of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They'd probably sell more than 768.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this group right here would buy five or six.  I would buy one.  Steve Gibson's already purchased, I think he's got 20 PDP8s in his garage.  Just in case.  He's got a PDP8 cluster that has as much power as my iPhone almost.  Yeah, that's good.  It's his goal.  Steve's goal is to, after he retires, to write a PDP8 operating system from scratch.  Wow.  Why?  Good question, Jerry.  I think you better run over to Irvine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He is anticipating having time to kill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He just likes the instruction set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess what's happened is that it is hard disk is so cheap.  Nobody refurbishes them with Spinrite anymore.  You just throw them away when they start skipping and giving soft errors.  You clone the disk and throw the old one in the trash.  That was his main pleasure in life was keeping hard disk running that nobody believed could  run.  The man's a miracle worker, but nobody wants the miracle anymore.  Well, you know what the real problem-  Being able to cure Berry Berry, we already know how to do it with vitamin.  We don't need a physician who could lay on hands and magically take your Berry Berry  and your rickets away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually Steve did a show about vitamin D. He's very big into vitamin D, so that's more  apt than you know.  Oh, boy.  I'll tell you, the real end of the line, the light at the end of the tunnel, the oncoming  train for Steve is that SSD, these solid state drives, Spinrite doesn't work on.  You don't need Spinrite.  They don't work the same way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've just got a solid state drive, which I am going to put in this MacBook Pro.  It would be in it already, except that I'm using the MacBook Pro for today's show and  I didn't want to take it apart in case I couldn't get it back together again.  We have a hundred something gigabyte solid state drive for a Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got the Intel, Newegg was selling the Intel X25M for 468 bucks.  I just bought it because it was so cheap, 128.  What's the storage?  I think it was 160.  It was a great deal.  It's the new one, right?  This is the-  This is X25M, yeah.  And it's the drive you want to get.  Jerry, I did what you're about to do on my MacBook Pro.  Unbelievable response.  Just fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Phil Thorpe's got one.  He says when you turn the machine on, it just instantly boots.  It just went wop and there it is.  Instant boot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you said 468 dollars and you said it's really cheap.  I can't believe that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For an SSD.  I almost called him on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, it's like-  It's still 460.  You know how many real hard drives?  I know.  Real hard drives.  160 gig hard drives now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because nobody bought one.  I buy for recording all the video, we buy one and a half terabyte drives from Newegg  for 99 bucks.  So you're right.  That's seven or so terabytes of data that I could get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think if you have a lust for speed, you might want to do that.  I had one of the Samsung 256 gigabyte drives that I tested in a Dell Inspiron and it was  beautiful.  They're touting it for gamers, which is really interesting.  As they get up higher and faster, that's kind of the marketplace that will drool over it.  But it's still like that was $700 for a hard drive.  And-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, it was Purnell's law back in 1983.  I said silicon is cheaper than iron and therefore silicon memory is going to displace spinning  metal and spinning metal will go away.  26 years later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You didn't mention that part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Eventually I triumphed.  It just took a while.  Your wish has been granted.  However, it may take a little time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's true.  I thought, you know, I probably was reading you and I was sure that mechanical drives  were on the way out that by the year 2000 we'd be using, you know, some sort of optical  or, you know-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I said it flatly that by the year 2000 spinning metal would go away.  That was in the days when a five megabyte hard drive was the size of a file cabinet  and house like them when you turned it on.  I had a Honeywell Bull along with a Lilith, if you remember the Lilith bit slicers.  And it had a Honeywell Bull five, maybe it was ten megabytes, a hard drive.  And it literally was the size of a two-drawer file cabinet for the drive.  Well Shoemaker, when I was on the board of the Lowell Observatory, Shoemaker used to  keep his asteroids on old deck platters.  The platters were ten inches across and they held 32 megabytes and he had, you know, 300  megabytes of asteroid data and he had to keep swapping those disks back and forth.  I managed to get him a 300 megabyte Winchester and he put all that stuff on it and he bought  me the best dinner I've had in a long time.  He was happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now I have ten times that in my pocket.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I thought back in those days, I thought it was obvious that silicon was cheaper than  iron and what we didn't factor in in that prediction was that the faster computers made  data separation so much easier so you could get so very much more onto a piece of spinning  metal than we could.  So we went from five megabytes to 300 megabytes to, you know, to a thousand megabytes in very  little time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I remember when Office 97 came out, it was something like 400 megabytes and I complained  that it was bloatware and said so in the column and that turned out to be a silly thing to  say because within a few months, gigabyte hard drives were cheap and ten gigabyte drives  were coming out and you didn't care that it was 400 megabytes to have Office be that big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what's funny about that is the new version of Office isn't much bigger than that.  I just noticed on one of the downloads it was about 450 megabytes.  This is Office 2010.  The beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  That looks like a real improvement.  That's worth going from 2003 to I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We were talking…  What's 2007 as a download?  Oh, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know how big it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We were talking, Paul and I on Windows Weekly about this new installation technique that  Microsoft's using for one of the versions of Office 2000, one of the betas.  What do they call that?  It's a…  Click to run.  It's a streaming install.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's application virtualization.  You actually get a virtualized version of Office that runs sandboxed from the rest of  your system.  It's wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And is this the way they're going to do it from now on?  Is that the idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's one of the ways.  I think this is sort of the future of application deployment on Windows.  It takes the application deployment model from the Mac, which is sort of drag and drop,  and it adds sandboxing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, none of you guys got to PDC, did you?  No, Paul was there.  I didn't see you there.  Oh, did you?  I didn't see you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Paul saw you because that's how we were talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I helped you find the Splenda.  You might…

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's the handsome guy with the pseudo sugar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I had just come back from Washington, so I even missed the first day of it, and I got  to the second.  But I was impressed with how much progress Microsoft has made in incorporating sanity  into cloud computing operations and integrating it all with Silverlight and Office 2010.  They're really bringing all that stuff together, and they're quite impressive to me.  Was it Ray Ozzie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They haven't got it yet, but they will.  Is that Ray Ozzie's influence?  Must be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would think so.  Yeah.  But they seem to have their fun together.  One of the things they were saying is nobody really wants to have his livelihood out in  the cloud.  You want local copies of important stuff.  You just want it, that's all.  And to try to think that you're going to live off of the cloud is crazy.  On the other hand, there are a lot of things you can do with it, and particularly collaborations.  Devin and I collaborate by essentially sending files back and forth and using Office Word  comparison to compare versions.  You still working together?  Oh yeah, we got a big advance for a new novel, which is due in about a year or so.  Oh, that's exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had no idea.  That's wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, we're hitting the earth with something big again.  Oh damn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You made such a mess last time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The most lucrative thing I ever did in my life was hit the earth with something big  in Lucifer's Hammer and then in Footfall, which was the number one bestseller list at  one time.  And so we thought, well, in these hard times, what will we do?  Let's destroy the earth again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why is it, I wanted to ask you this, the books like The Stand, Your Book, The Road, why is  it we love these post-apocalypse stories?  What is it about us, do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because I think most people, well first it doesn't take in the imagination of future  technologies.  Yeah, all you get is stoning.  Because you basically take a little bit ahead of now and then you cripple it.  But I think most readers can imagine themselves in that situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you're right.  In fact, I have this, I'm in the middle of, almost towards the end actually of Lucifer's  Hammer and my whole worldview has changed.  One of the things that you say in there, which I think is so important, is that we live on  this thin shell of technology that really very few of us understand.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was the Alderson character, the guy with diabetes, the JPL scientist.  He was the only one who understood how the hell to make the farm run, you know?  Everybody else had the ability to do things, but they didn't know what they were doing.  And a postman, he didn't know anything about it and yet you've got to keep the civilization  running with what you have and who you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You point out that there's only 30 days worth of food in the US that you take away the electricity  and there's going to be riots within 30 days, it's just a given.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, our power went out last night because they were working down the street and my daughter  started asking who we were going to eat first.  Cannibalism, instantly, they go right to cannibalism.  No, the neighbor's dog first.  I'm taking the bruh, I'm taking Mark, that's all I'm saying.  Kind of the weak link in the chain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, as long as we're talking about these great books, I should do the Audible ad because  what a great opportunity to mention that you can now get, thanks to this great Audible  Frontiers program, you can get two of Jerry's most wonderful books.  You just heard Dwight say that the greatest science fiction books of all time at audible.com.  I don't know about you, Jerry, I mean I love reading but there's something about listening  to a book that just brings it to life.  I feel like I'm watching the movie of Lucifer's Hammer.  I can see what's happening, it's vivid because I'm listening to it.  You don't lose a word, it's not like these are abridged, these are the full versions  which means they're long listens, I like it.  I can get it absolutely free right now and Jerry still gets paid.  So that's good.  It's just a way to get you signed up to the Audible Platinum account.  If you go to audible.com slash twit2, that's the account I have, it's two books a month.  That's kind of my minimum.  I don't even have a commute but I just make a point always to listen to Audible.  The book I'm listening to right now is Lucifer's Hammer, that could be book one, 24 hours and  32 minutes.  Mark Veder I think did a very good job.  You agree, Jerry, of reading it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jerry I have heard it and I think Audible does a great job of finding people to read  these and they do read it.  They read the book before they start reading it into the mic so they have some understanding  of what the book is about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mark Did he contact you at any point and ask you  for clarification or pronunciation or anything like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jerry Not really, not really.  I think I have had a few questions, I'm not quite sure on which book.  I get emails asking, particularly when I'm made up words and that means it's more likely  to be moat or one of the books with aliens in it.  Everybody can't figure out how you pronounce fumes.  Mark That was obvious to me and I'm curious where

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  anyone had from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mark Larry did that in Protector too, he's got  an alien and the narrator on that is a very old audio version of it but he did a very  good job.  He talks like this.  Mark The second book, Moat in God's Eye, another  great classic by Larry Niven and Jerry Pornell.  How come Larry's name comes first Jerry, is it alphabetical?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jerry It's alphabetical but it's also the case that  while I was well known in the technology field, you must remember Leo, I didn't start writing  for a living until 1972.  Mark So these were among your first books?  Jerry Those were among my first books and there's  a reason why Niven's name on them.  I decided to stop being an aerospace scientist and to stop being a college professor.  I was head of the political science department at Pepperdown at one time.  So when I decided I was going to try being a writer for a living, I decided alright,  is there anybody around who's well known so I can get a bit ahead in this business  without having to build up from scratch?  And there were two people I was sure I could work with.  One was Paul Anderson who's dead now, he was my best friend for years.  But he lived up in the Bay Area and that's before we had small computers so we went out  of mail stuff back and forth and it just wasn't practical.  The other was Niven who I hadn't met but I'd read his stuff and I thought yep, that's it.  So I looked him up at the science fiction club and we got to talking and we sat down  one night with a couple of bottles of brandy and a big pot of coffee and by morning we  had an outline for the Moten God's Eye and that book has sold like four million copies.  That is or was the last time I had occasion to see their books which was when they sold  the science fiction line to Bane Books.  Moten God's Eye was the top earning science fiction book in the history of Simon and Schuster.  It out earned Sagan's Cosmos.  Now Sagan got a bigger advance for a movie but in terms of sales Moten outsold Cosmo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They haven't made movies of either of these have they?  I was going to say where's the movie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh I'm sorry not Cosmos.  Sagan's big book.  Contact.  Contact.  Contact I'm sorry.  Both are about first contact right.  Contact did not sell it.  In fact oddly enough Contact didn't sell as well as Inferno.  But the reason Niven and I worked together, I mean we worked together well but it was intentional  on my part that I looked him up and he was better known than me at the time so naturally  his name is first.  It's also alphabetical but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well either way you want to get these books and you can listen to them which brings them  just marvelously to life and you can get them for free.  But as I said Jerry still gets paid.  Audible.com slash twit to get your first two books free and I think this week in honor  of Jerry's visit to us you've got to get the Moten God's Eye and Lucifer's Hammer.  I've got them both.  I'm in the middle just about to finish Lucifer's Hammer and then I'm starting the Moten's  God's Eye which is a story of first contact which is a great classic science fiction theme.  L.J.  Ganser narrates this one and it's one of those new recordings from Audible Frontiers.  Both of these just came out in July.  They never were recorded before probably right Jerry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think those were.  By the way you also asked why do I work with Niven.  Niven writes better than I do.  I plot better than he does.  Well I have a science background and I do a lot of logic.  On Lucifer's Hammer Nature magazine a few months ago had a big 25th or 30th whatever  it is anniversary review of Lucifer's Hammer.  It was big.  I mean it was pictures and it was like a four page review in Nature magazine and it's kind  of interesting because what did they start with?  They started with that dang surfer scene of course.  I love it.  He surfs Los Angeles.  I would never have been mad enough to have written that.  Niven wrote that piece and that's what I pay him for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a great scene.  And the guy of course it's just his one cameo appearance in the book but he surfs the tidal  wave across Los Angeles.  Right through Santa Monica.  I love it.  Well anyway there's our pick for the week and highly recommend it if you've not listened  to audiobooks start with the best and do it from Audible.  There's no one better.  Audible.com slash twit two.  They're yours for free.  You cancel it anytime you get to keep the books and we thank Audible for supporting  this week at Tech for the last few years.  So let's see.  I know you wanted to talk Paul Therotte a little bit about this story that Apple or  Windows 7 Market Share has finally topped Apple's Market Share and you say that's bogus.  It's ludicrous.  What is it?  I don't.  Okay this is from Computer World.  Market Share is sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's it.  Very simple.  Market Share in the computer industry is typically measured by quarter.  I suppose we could look at it from a month to month basis but no one really does that.  And the figure that you're citing and the figure that has been cited online is from  net applications.  Yeah from a web analytics company.  So what they're doing is they're looking at people who browse to their websites, to  the websites that they monitor, whatever they are and they determine who's running what.  So what they were saying was that over two days last weekend Windows 7, I guess I would  call it Web Usage Share, exceeded 5%.  But it's really Web Usage Share for the sites that they monitor, whatever those sites are.  So there are some generalizations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Windows 7 users surf more than Mac users.  You're right.  It doesn't really tie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well it doesn't, you know, you can make some general statements about it.  There's no doubt, you know, Windows 7 just by virtue of the fact that it's going out  on all these new PCs this quarter, it will exceed the actual market share of the Mac  by a huge percentage I would assume this quarter.  And the usage share, the actual number of people running Windows 7 day to day will exceed  that of Mac OS X probably this quarter as well.  But whatever, I mean, you know, that doesn't, that's not a profound statement.  It's just a statement of fact.  So this web analytics company, whatever they are.  Net applications.  Net applications.  That's not what they measure.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So.  Actually Bomber told the shareholders meeting that Windows 7 had sold twice the number of  copies of any other Microsoft operating system in the same time span.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So as.  Which is pretty good.  I mean, you know, not to be a jerk about that, but I mean, the market for PCs, the number  of people using PCs is bigger than it's ever been.  Right.  I think it's bigger.  Comparing it to Vista is important because obviously they want to show that Windows 7  has turned the corner.  It's better than Vista.  But, you know, if you were to go back three years ago and look at the numbers for Vista,  they were pretty solid right in the beginning.  You know, it wasn't until the next quarter that we sort of saw some issues.  Of course, all the complaints started coming in from people with incompatibility issues  and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So.  I love Bomber's statement to the shareholders.  When I asked about Apple's market share, especially with young people, he said some of its marketing,  some of its phase of life.  The truth is we do quite well, even among college students.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Sorry about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even those hippies buy Windows sometimes.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.  The company NetApplications is pretty controversial.  A lot of analysts like to point to them and a lot of journalists like to point to them.  And I have done that myself.  It's a story.  But yeah, all they measure is what's being used on the web.  They have a pretty big database of companies that they pull from, but it's still not going  to be, you know, the whole web.  It's good for showing trends, I think.  I think it's good for showing trends, but for complete numbers and, you know, the kind  of a real picture, it's not always accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  It doesn't mean that five percent of the people on computers are using Windows 7.  It just doesn't mean that, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, of course it doesn't.  It's very early days, isn't it, for Windows 7?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think, right, and everyone is looking for some indication that Windows 7 is doing something,  whatever that something is.  It's either doing great, it's doing okay.  If it's doing anything other than great, it's obviously a little bit of a disappointment.  There's always some story to be told around this thing, but, you know, I don't know.  To me this is nothing.  I just, this doesn't mean anything.  You know, sometime in January, the sales figures will come out.  That's what really matters.  We'll know how many PCs were sold.  We'll have some market share numbers.  Obviously, Windows 7 is going to be a big deal.  It's going to be, it will go out on most of the computers that are sold this quarter,  of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I would just like to say that 63 percent of the people who visited Twitter used Windows  and 26 percent used Macintosh.  So Macintosh market share is jumping on my website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's huge.  It's never been bigger.  And it's weird that the people who listen to your stuff would be big on the Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, five percent use Linux, two percent use the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Five percent use Linux.  That's insane, right?  I mean, five percent.  That's a lot.  Five percent.  Five percent are using Linux.  That's bigger than the Mac's worldwide market share.  Yeah, you're right.  Okay.  But get this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, among Windows users, this is twit.tv.  This is the website that people go and this is in the past month.  Forty-four percent used XP.  Yeah.  Thirty-three percent used something that identified as NT.  Twenty percent used Vista.  And I don't even see Windows 7 on here.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So no one's using Windows 7.  Twenty-four people visited with Windows ME.  I think we have your headline.  Nobody.  Windows 7 global disaster.  The exclusive by Leo Laporte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The NT must be Windows 7.  I don't understand what NT is.  Well, you're looking at browsers.  This is the 6.1 thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a browser string.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just what the...  It shows up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so a lot of the Mozilla type browsers will say NT something.  So this is completely worthless.  Absolutely.  But you should write a story because Greg Kaiser will pick it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's huge.  It's massive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would advise all those who are using Vista to immediately convert to Windows 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, I agree with you on that.  I'm concerned about the people who are running Windows ME.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, who are those 24 people?  What's up with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, I'm still running the original version of Windows Movie Maker.  I'm just curious.  I'm going to ask you some technical questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How come it doesn't work?  So Jerry, you've been happy with your Windows 7 experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have, as you know, I have Macs and PCs.  And I am finding that the differences, even in the operating system philosophy and the usability, are flat vanishing.  Microsoft is long known for being an embrace and extend company.  And I think they kind of got it with Windows 7.  It really is easier to use.  And a lot of things that used to be very complicated are very simple.  And I can recommend, again, I didn't write it, Windows 7 Ultimate Guide by O'Reilly, right?  It's a brand new book, Definitive Guide from O'Reilly.  And if you were to go through this thing, I found tons of stuff built into Windows 7 I didn't know was there.  And it's just getting more Mac-like in a lot of ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Paul, I think you need to send him a copy of Windows 7 Secrets, because there's even more stuff in that book.  Well, I told you.  I guess send me a review copy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess my reviews are popular, because I get more books to review than I really feel like doing, but I'll certainly pick yours out.  Oh, you'll like it, Jerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'll like it.  You'll like it or else.  It's a good book.  Why did you say something happened in the Netherlands with you, Paul?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Someone asked me, actually, what I thought was a profound question, which was some guy came up to me in the Netherlands,  and he said, I'm looking at your book here, and I just have one question.  If Windows 7 is so easy, how come this book has 1,000 pages long?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Good point.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I bought it on my Kindle, the whole book.  I got the full version.  Did you ever do the stripped down version for the Kindle, Paul, that you were going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there is a stripped down best of version for the Kindle.  But I got the whole thing, and it's a lot lighter that way.  It's much lighter on the Kindle.  Actually, if you get the full version, it's still as light as the other version.  You see?  You don't really save me anyway.  It's yet another benefit of the Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who published yours?  Paul, how do you decide what to take out for a stripped down version?  Well, the stripped down version was truly stripped down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was an odd request.  They wanted a best of version, and they wanted it to be a very small selection of secrets.  It doesn't actually work out to find out.  Just the big secrets.  I looked at each chapter and I thought, what are the biggest things from each chapter?  Some of them, there was one, some of them there were two.  One or two, I think there were three.  It's a very finite selection of, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dwight, are you writing a book on Windows 7?  No, I'm writing a Mac switch book at the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Switching to Windows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're fading out, Dwight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody's fading.  It's a Mac switch book.  I actually approached Peach Pit, the publisher who did the Windows Vista book that I wrote  with Larry Magid.  They didn't want to do a Windows 7 book in the same series because the Vista book had  not done well.  They didn't want to take the chance.  This decision was made a while back.  Big mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Larry wrote a little...  Vista will go away and 7 will replace it on every machine running Vista.  There is no reason not to replace it with Windows 7.  It didn't even cost that much if you use those family upgrade packs that Microsoft sells.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's going to be Vista Who very soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's an odd thing.  By the way, whatever it's worth, Vista, especially now after the upgrades and so forth, isn't  terrible, but we are going to be in this world where it's going to be XP and 7.  It's such a weird thing.  It's never really happened before in the Windows world like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If they get their virtualization technology, installation technology running properly so  that you can essentially go from XP to Windows 7 in one jump without having to go through  Vista first, I think a lot of the XP machines will cease to be XP and become Windows 7 also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My Dell laptop is 7 Professional.  That means, Paul, I could go to Microsoft site and download...  Do I need a copy of XP or I just download...  I'm sorry, what are you asking?  I have Windows 7 Professional, which means I can do the...  You mean Windows XP Professional?  No, no, I have 7 Professional, which means I can run the XP and virtualization thing.  Oh, gotcha.  I'm sorry, I misunderstood.  When I download that, does it come with a copy of XP or do I also have to...  It does.  So it's the whole thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.  For free?  The virtualized version of XP.  XP, so good.  It's like a little toy.  We throw it in the cereal box for free.  We're giving it away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But your processor supports that.  You're silloning on us.  Hold on.  Do I...  Unplug and plug in.  You're silloning.  Oh, no, no.  Hold on, I gotta go to the back.  By your command.  Look at this.  Oh, that's silloning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  quite explain to me what that meant.  Now you know.  Now you know.  Do you watch Battlestar Galactica, Jerry?  I have.  I...  You're...  I have a...  I have a...  I have a...  I have a...  I have a...  I have a...  I have a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a...  I have a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have a...  I have a...  I have a...  I have a...  You're...  You're getting...  Your processor has to support it.  I made an awful lot of money out of Battlestar Galactica when it first came out.  You made money on it?  The original one, yeah, way back when Universal did it.  The way I made money on it was that Fox sued Universal for plagiarism of Star Wars, and  they claimed that there were something like 82 points of similarity between Battlestar  Galactica and Star Wars.  They were counting stars.  I guess I had just been president of Science Fiction Writers of America, and the lawyers  for Universal came and said, here's $20,000, write us a brief showing we didn't plagiarize.  Wow.  And I looked at it and I said, well, that's easy.  If you ask me which is the better movie, then no question, Star Wars is the better one.  But if you ask me which is the most original, there ain't an original frame in either one  of them.  It's the most derivative from Science Fiction that was published since, for instance, the  male pair bonding between Han Solo and Luke Skywalker was echoed in Battlestar Galactica.  I said, yeah, and they both got it from Homer, didn't they?  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's been around a few years.  So you were saying, Dwight, before the Cylon Invasion.  We were talking about XP running and virtualization on Windows 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, and it doesn't work with every machine.  Yes.  You have to have a particular processor that supports hardware-based virtualization in  order for it to work.  And a lot of high-end processors don't do it.  I've got an Intel Core 2 quad processor, a Q8200, that's a great processor in a home-built  machine.  It won't do it.  It won't handle XP mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's frustrating.  That's how Microsoft works.  I don't know if you're familiar with this company.  But could you run VMware?  That's how they do things.  You can.  You can run VMware.  You can run a Sun's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then run XP under VMware.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can run Sun's VirtualBox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It works fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So for whatever it's worth, the stuff that they do for corporations, application virtualization  and Microsoft Enterprise desktop virtualization, don't suffer from this issue.  But yeah, it's true.  If you're an individual and you want to run virtualized versions of XP, although to be  fair there are only a few instances where you'd want to do that, the compatibility...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to have a processor that supports Intel's VTX technology, which I happen to,  so I know I can do it.  The AMD version.  Yeah.  And AMD, all of AMD's recent processors do.  Not all of Intel's recent processors do.  Right.  Did Ed Bott...  Well, the iCore stuff does.  Ed Bott did a table, right?  You can go...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or do you have a table?  He did.  Yeah.  He did a table.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So good.  I now know.  I can run Windows XP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's tough because a lot of the Core 2 Duo processors, the dual core chips work  fine, but what Dwight's saying is he has a quad core processor.  Right.  It doesn't.  And that's true.  Some of the initial ones, the quad cores don't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We do now, by the way, know what causes the siloing.  And that's why Jerry...  Subspace...  Subspace for good.  Jerry has the different headset, Plantronics headset, which doesn't have that problem.  And we sent Dwight the DSP400, which does.  It's the chip in it.  So you did it on purpose.  I did it because I wanted him to suffer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if I took it out of the...  It comes with a couple of plugs that go into the back of a...  If I just plug the two analog plugs into the back of my Mac...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  I don't know.  Probably not.  Probably is the adapter chipset you're right.  All right.  I'll just do that next time.  Well, we find USB works better.  That's why we do it.  Anyway, a couple more stories.  I also want to mention my Mustang because it really wouldn't be a twit unless I talk  about my car.  But first for Paul.  Yes, sir.  Activision says, Call of Duty series, all of the titles in the franchise pushed past  the $3 billion mark in global retail sales.  Sure.  Remind me again, how much money did Titanic make?  I think what?  $200 million?  I'm estimating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bet about $1 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had about $500 million if you count overseas sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But not anywhere close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A sad, sad joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Compared to Call of Duty.  But now this is since 2003.  But what a franchise.  Six titles, the most recent modern warfare.  I think I've contributed to this figure demonstrably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Amazing success for Call of Duty.  And you say, and I'll just repeat it here, it is in fact the best of the series, the  best first person shooter of the year, and nay, perhaps even the best first person shooter  of all time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just remember everyone was talking up Halo 2 at the time and Halo 3 when that came out  and I kept telling these guys, you know, Call of Duty is where it's at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, our brilliant chat room by the name of Ratty says it's $1.8 billion for  Titanic.  For Titanic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's pretty good.  Not bad.  Not Call of Duty numbers, but not bad.  Not bad for the all-Soran.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's so competitive, that Paul Therot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not really so much a market share number as it is a number.  It pales.  It's lower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's lower.  It pales, however, to the market valuation of Facebook.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which, according to the most recent stock sale, DST, which is one of the investors, has  been buying Digital Sky Technologies, is a Russian investment company.  Do you know that the Russians own a big stake in Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's good stuff.  And by the way, that's the plot of a Call of Duty movie, or video game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is.  It probably could be.  Sure.  Russian social media expert takes over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, when Microsoft made a stake in Facebook a year or so ago, I don't remember the exact  figure, when you make an investment and you buy a certain part of the company, that investment  then betrays what you feel the company is worth.  And I remember at the time, the figure for Facebook was incredibly high based on the  fact that they sell about $17 in ads a year.  I mean, there's nothing there.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It really didn't include what Microsoft was getting in addition to the stake in the company.  But this case, DST bought $100 million of Facebook shares in July from employees and  ex-employees at a $16.5 billion valuation.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, I wonder how much they were paying over, what percentage, the value of the shares they  paid on average to get those shares.  Right?  16 times?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there a value because it's not publicly…  That's a good point.  It's not even public.  So there's no value.  These are just made up numbers.  Just made up numbers.  Facebook, however, has just established a dual class stock structure, which always scares  me when I hear about that.  That's how I got screwed by Tech TV.  The existing owners have one class, the class A stock, and then the rest of you got class  B, which means that we can vote, but you can't.  And we're the first to be paid on a transaction.  A Facebook spokesman, Larry Yu, said, we did introduce a dual class stock structure because  existing shareholders wanted to maintain control over voting on certain issues.  The thought would be that they would do this because they're about to go public, and  they would issue B or C class shares to the public offering.  But Mark Zuckerberg went and asked, said, no, no, no.  IPO is a few years out.  He said that in May, and the spokesman says Facebook has no plans to go public.  What would Facebook really be worth if they went public?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not even possible to guess, right?  Because the tech stock market especially is crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would buy…  I would buy…  Well, what is Google's valuation now?  Six billion?  Right.  Sure.  I mean, Facebook's got to be worth that much.  What do you think, Jerry?  Do you have a Facebook page?  That much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but half of what people…

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry.  People maintain one for me, but I don't have anything to do with it yet.  I probably should start incorporating Facebook into my operations.  It's just that I never have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The social media thing is all brand new.  We talked before the show, trying to persuade Jerry to get a Twitter account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He was notably not interested.  Not interested.  Good for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  He thinks that Facebook would do him good, but Twitter would not.  Isn't that?  It's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Only as a marketing tool.  The only thing I would use Facebook for is to get people to come over to my regular websites.  I have…  What energy I have left over from writing fiction I put into the website.  I'm not going to do that on a Facebook page.  I just don't care that much.  I certainly don't really feel like letting the world know every time I'm going to have  a turkey sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's…  You know what, Jerry?  More power to you.  I just want you to do more writing.  I think that that's a reasonable thing for a fan to say, no, Jerry, focus on the writing.  Don't be wasting your energies on 140-character blips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leo, it's a long tradition in science fiction writing that fans maintain sites for their  favorite authors.  Several, and in fact several do in the case with me and with Niven and so forth.  I just let them do it.  I pay little attention to the site unless some friend of mine tells me they're doing  something goofy.  Like for instance, Wikipedia had some stories about me that just simply weren't true.  They were flattering stories.  They just weren't true.  I had to go in and try to edit some of that.  Generally, I try to stay away from that sort of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've never had anything flattering on Wikipedia, so I'm curious what that must feel like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They had me getting a direct commission in the Army, which I'm the only person I ever  heard of who got a direct commission with Audie Murphy for Heaven's sake.  Is that like a battlefield promotion where you go, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A world-renowned lover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Paul, you're not allowed to do it, but I'm going to go on your Wikipedia page right now.  Anyone can edit it.  In fact, I would suggest the chat room go in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like the Simpsons episode.  Is that true?  It will be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It will be.  Make it so, number two.  How do you all feel about Internet gambling?  You remember that the rules were, I can't remember, I think it was legislation, wasn't  it?  Internet gambling.  The Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, who are charged with enforcing this, basically  what they're doing is they're telling credit card companies, financial institutions, you  cannot accept payments to settle online wagers.  That basically makes it impossible to do online gambling.  Financial industry complained that the new rules would be difficult to enforce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like the auto industry complaining that the seatbelt rules would be hard to enforce.  So hard to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they say, and actually there may be some merit in this, they say, what is Internet  gambling?  They petitioned and now those rules, which were supposed to take effect in a week, are  going to be delayed until June 1st.  I'm betting that the Gambling Enforcement Act, which was passed in 2006, will pass a  few more years before that comes close to being enforced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They want to try to overturn it.  The Democratic Congress wants to overturn that.  Now why would they want to overturn that?  The only good thing you can get, and it's not good, the only thing you're certain to  get at a gambling site is spyware.  I wouldn't mind seeing them go away for that reason alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really not gamble at the gambling site?  It's a gamble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really a gamble.  Well, anyway, just to, anybody have an opinion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think sites like Darwin's Law and Action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.  They culled the herd.  I think the problem is that it's point of access.  If it's really easy to gamble, I kind of feel for people who have a gambling problem  because at least if the ponies are somewhere out there, you got to go to the track.  Now you just, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We do this thing on Thanksgiving called Bagels and Beer.  We get up early in the morning and go to a local bar.  We drink beer and we have bagels.  This is a friend of mine said, hey, they have Keno.  Are you going to play some Keno?  And I said, I have a Keno system, which is sort of like a gateway gambling problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  By the way, according to Wikipedia, Paul, you have cured the common cold.  No, I haven't.  And let's see, what else have you done?  This is amazing, Paul.  I had no idea your worth and net worth is $3 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Listen, if it was, I wouldn't be here right now.  No offense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm offended.  No offense.  I'm offended deeply.  All right.  Real quickly, just want to mention before we finish this show up and we have some great  final gifts for you all, so don't go anywhere.  Because you really shouldn't say the show will be over after this commercial.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Listen to the commercial and then we're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, there's great stuff still to come.  But I do want to mention Ford's SYNC.  And hey, this is great stuff.  A chance for you to win a Nano or a Zune.  Time is ticking though.  You only have until December 9th.  They've got 15 Nanos and 15 Zunes.  They're giving away one every day.  Kind of as a way of underscoring the fact that Ford SYNC works with Nanos, works with  Zunes.  To be honest, it works with my Droid.  It works with almost anything that's USB.  In fact, I've got a USB key here.  You plug this into the USB port in my car and it'll read the MP3s on there, index them,  and then I press a button on my steering wheel and I can say, play the Beatles.  I could say, in fact, I do.  I say, play Lucifer's Hammer.  And all of a sudden I'm hearing Lucifer's Hammer right where I left off.  This is Skynet.  It is Skynet.  The car is smart.  The car is the computer.  I love it.  I love it.  The car is the network.  If you get a chance, go to a Ford Lincoln or Mercury dealer.  Take a look at Ford SYNC.  It is so slick.  It's Bluetooth phones.  It's got 911 activation if your airbags activate.  It's got vehicle history reports.  It knows the traffic conditions and will reroute you automatically.  Turn by turn directions even without a GPS built into the car.  That's the Ford SYNC doing it.  I just love it.  And to find out more, you go to the website, syncmyridepodcast.com.  And if you'd like to win, the rules are there, but if you'd like to win, I can give you the  short version.  Just tweet.  Say, listening to Jerry and the gang on Twitter right now and I'm loving it.  I can't wait to read Dante's, I mean, I always call it Dante's Inferno, Lucifer's Hammer.  Add the tag, pound SYNC My Ride Podcast.  The incredibly intelligent people at Ford will notice that.  Add you to the drawing and you'll be in the drawing to win one of those Nanos or Zooms.  Full details and more about the incredible SYNC.  It's in my car and I'll tell you, I drive, it's, I love it, at syncmyridepodcast.com.  We're trying to decide, Paul, if I should drive the Mustang, the Twitmobile down to  CES.  I was talking to Scott Monte, who's their social media guy, he said, come down and you  could give geeks test rides and show them SYNC.  So maybe I'll do that.  It'd be a lot of fun.  Drive it to CES.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Listen, if you do that, I will fly there and I will drive it down with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'll fly to San Francisco and drive down with me?  Of course.  That would be great.  Road trip.  That would be that.  You bring the beer, I'll bring the bagels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure.  We might be using a Zune though.  I don't know if that's going to be a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no.  If I could find my Zune HD, that's what it would be.  We'd be living in the, I can't find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's going to be, you know, it's on a plane somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  It's in a pile here somewhere.  It's small and it just disappeared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's almost too small.  It's too beautiful.  Too small.  It's too beautiful to succeed.  It couldn't.  It's just, it's the technology that was too good to ever catch on with the past market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Syncmyridepodcast.com.  Thank you, Ford, for supporting.  Our wonderful little homegrown network here.  Jerry Pornell is online.  If you, as we all did, cut your teeth on the Chaos Manor columns, they're still going.  You can subscribe to them by email or you can read them online at ChaosManorReviews.com  or go to Jerry's site, JerryPornell.com, where it's all there.  You said there's some politics there, Jerry?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I tend to be rather libertarian in my views of the world, but yes, they...  By the way, a lot of good science on this side.  I get into politics and political strategy on my website.  I don't in the column.  I try to stay politically neutral in the columns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I need that because people don't want me to talk politics on the shows, but  I love to talk about, I think politics is, I had no idea you taught political science.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I used to be head of political science at Pepperdown.  That was a very long time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's great.  So there's an education crisis.  You talk about Afghanistan.  Oh, this is fantastic.  I'm going to have to start reading these, Jerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The latest big one is the climate consensus, turns out maybe to have had as much conspiracy  as consensus, which is interesting.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So where do you come down on global warming?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  With Freeman Dyson, I don't know how you can get CO2 to be useful in heating anything except  cold, dry areas because the water vapor already overwhelms the CO2 effect everywhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you don't think it's the CO...  You don't think it's not even a question of man-made or not.  You don't think there is global warming because CO2...  No, I think there's global warming because there has been since about 1326 when the little

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  ice age ended and we started warming up.  But I think that most of the warming was in between 1800 and 1870.  You know this, but you don't remember it.  In 1776 at Harlem Heights on Manhattan Island, Colonel Alexander Hamilton brought the guns  captured at Ticonderoga across the frozen Hudson River to General George Washington  saving Washington's army.  Right.  The Hudson hasn't frozen solid enough to walk across since about 1826.  In other words, things have been warming since 1776 and everybody who's went to grade school  and had grade school history knows it.  In 800 to 1000, the Vikings had dairy farms in Greenland.  Dairy farms.  Dairy farms.  You can see them.  They're under about 30 feet of ice.  Some of them are finally coming out again, but there's still plenty of ice over them.  The earth has been a lot warmer and a lot colder in human history.  We know.  We know for a fact.  So the fact that it's been warming at one degree per century ever since about 1700 should  not surprise you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I feel a lot better about my Mustang.  I've got to tell you that right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank God for your...  Is it a rag top?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's a hard top.  You know, because of this global warming, I probably should have gotten a rag top, but  I wasn't that confident.  Now I know.  JerryPornel.com.

WinsuperSight.com.  He's author of the book that Jerry hasn't read.  The one book that Jerry hasn't read.  The one book Jerry hasn't received a copy of, hasn't read, never heard of.  By the way, you asked Jerry who publishes it.  It's Wiley and Sons.  You've heard of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, of course.  They used to send me review copies.  I don't know why they didn't send that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Paul, I think a call to the editor is in order here.  I love my people.  Call your people.  Keep busy.  Take it from me.  I'll give you my review.  I love it.  I've read it cover to cover.  And it makes me love Windows 7 even more.  It's called Windows 7 Secrets.  A love letter to Windows 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  That's pretty much what it is.  By Paul Therot.  It's a love letter.  That's right.  It's a chick lit kind of a book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, it's for women.  Yeah.  The hidden part of the PC market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

It starts at eight o'clock central time.  The main host is Jay Lee and he's always giving me grief for being on your show.  It's like, oh, you're going to go on that other show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
