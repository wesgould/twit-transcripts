Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  yeah yeah I've been watching this on tech meme it's been bubbling up but they  say they wouldn't consider an acquisition anymore now this is from the car I can  you know Carl I can't announce last week that he was going to replace the Yahoo  board with his own hand-picked people or try to get the you'd have to get the the  stockholders to do that including mark Cuban which cracks me up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah I think it yeah I wrote about this in market watching is a very good column  if you want to read my take on it I think the whole idea is to put mark Cuban  is the new CEO and then sell off the company in bits and pieces over the next  six months before the basketball season began again press release came out today

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Microsoft doesn't do Sunday press releases very often this must be a first  Microsoft announced is continuing to explore and pursue its alternatives to  improve and expand that they like you know divide and conquer engulf and  devour they like those what is that where you do to embrace and extend embrace  and extend why is what doesn't that come from the old English jurisprudence when  they had French and English and they had to use two words in legal jargon so that  people would understand both you know I'm saying I think it stems from the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  cease and desist I think it actually stems from the popularity of the verbosity  half-and-half that was very popular in Seattle in the late 70s and early 80s I

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  believe it comes from cockney rhyming slang anyway this is they've done it  twice in one sentence no three times listen to this Microsoft announced it is  continuing to explore and pursue its alternatives to expute improve and  expand its online services and advertising business this is the quote in  light of developments since the withdrawal of the Microsoft proposal to  acquire Yahoo Microsoft announced it is continuing to explain I already said all  Microsoft is considering and has raised you know they've got they've got the  really kind of the low-level flax in the day because it's Sunday so what's the  news in there well Microsoft is considering and has raised with Yahoo  an alternative that would involve a transaction with Yahoo but not an  acquisition of all of Yahoo Microsoft is not proposing to make a new bid to  acquire all of Yahoo at this time but reserves the right to reconsider that  alternative depending on future developments and discussions that may  take place with Yahoo or discussions with shareholders of Yahoo or Microsoft  or with other third parties there can be of course yeah no assurance that any  transaction will result from these descriptions discussions so there's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  lot and at Microsoft according to Todd bishops Microsoft blog over at the  Seattle PI they are not talking to Carl Icahn this is not part of the Kyle at  Carl Icahn bid well there or there well probably it's one of the reasons why  they agreed to do it but they're not talking to icon in other words icon is  not involved in this this is directly between Microsoft and Yahoo yeah I can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  just a middleman a trouble maker he's a catalyst is gonna be Jason you were the

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  guy who said this would be this deal would be done in one day what's going on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah how many one days ago is that listen everybody shocked to have this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  has gone down not me really just very well well you're so clairvoyant about  these such issues but exactly Yang doesn't want to sell it rich yeah  exactly however what probably is they're trying to do right now and who knows if  to be successful is what Google did with AOL which is Google bought five percent  of AOL for a billion dollars and got all the rights to the advertising space so  if you can't own it on the advertising which is what this has always been about  the advertising dollars and the amount of leverage Google has over AOL right  now is tremendous like they can ask AOL at any point in time to give them the  billion dollars back or like force them to go public and have a liquid stock for  AOL IE spin it out and so AOL can't really do anything without Google's  blessing I mean unless they want to just give them all their money back which  would be pretty hard to do so that's probably what yeah Microsoft's gonna try  to do with Yahoo and it's probably not going to succeed is this something like

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  the like the Facebook Microsoft deal or they put in a couple hundred million

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  just you know yeah it's basically you you invest you get a piece of it so  you've got an interest in it and then you take all the ad inventory that the  meta issue here is that advertising is moving over to online faster than  anybody thought that's why you saw CBS by CNET this week because CNET is like  the number five player in terms of advertising after Yahoo AOL Google and  Microsoft online even though it's only a couple hundred million dollars but it  gives you this massive jump start everybody's just like we have to get  these advertising digital advertising dollars into our systems now so they

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  were you so that's it that's that's interesting let's let's let's fold in  CBS CNET into it into this so they bought them not for the audience share  or anything else it's all about online advertising the audience and the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  properties are great but the CBS knows that outdoor advertising radio and  television are going to be flat to downward businesses they already are and  so where is the growth going to come from nobody wants to be in a declining  business you can ask AOL about that with their dial-up subscriber business so  everybody's desperate to have a growth component of their business so that  their stock price goes up and so that they can you know make money off of  these you know the senior management can make money off the stock options they're  granted at a certain price right so CBS has to transform that offline revenue  into online revenue and this is just in a huge way to do it and CNET has so many  properties that are undervalued and not really paid attention to it was a good

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  deal it was a good it was a good thing for them to buy even at 1.8 billion

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  brilliant that's a 44% but Amy that's pretty high it's a lot higher the stock

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  was under price but let's back up a minute besides the fact that of course  Jason thought this other deal was gonna go through too but let me ask the big

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  question all right John I'm gonna give you props I gave it to you a couple of  weeks ago John was the only guy I've ever heard of who said this deal would  never happen the Microsoft Yahoo deal let's ask this question what is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Microsoft trying to prove by becoming a media company they've never been a media  company before they've tried it over and over again for some stupid reason it's  like becoming a hardware company when you talk about everything moving over to  the internet in terms of advertising yeah you're talking about media companies  worried sick that they're gonna lose their advertising edge in the in hard  media like TV newspapers magazines things like that Microsoft's a software

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  company for God's sake John John they want more leverage control online

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  standards that would be one reason oh that's interesting you think seeing it  would give them leverage or Yahoo would give them leverage for online standards

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  about seeing it yeah it has a lot to do with what they see Apple doing I mean  Apple's clearly going that direction and Microsoft's they have to keep trying

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they don't really have much choice it's all about going that direction what ads do they run on  what what what sites do they have a search engine that's a good point

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they're not doing it with ads but there's certainly involved in the media

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  side not to mention live.com hotmail various and sundry other properties

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  interesting article in the New York Times to actually they they by the way the  New York Times or at least Brian Stettler Stelter writing the New York Times  agrees it's all about the online ads of CBS's deal for seen it interesting  article saying that Mike this is by Stosser the San Jose State business  professor who I think writes pretty good analyses of these things says  Microsoft's really faced with this issue of not you know not being able to turn  the corner just as IBM was unable to turn the corner when times change it  can't survive paradigm shifter and and that Microsoft's just history and that  nothing they can do at this point is gonna make a difference

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  aren't the numbers at Microsoft going up aren't they making more and more

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  stock you've been complaining about their stock like crazy that's because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  everybody talks like you guys are talking which is it downplay everything  Microsoft does because they're not somehow involved in selling advertisement  when it's a software company for God's sake software really runs everything it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  not like Wall Street has a clue half the time anyway I mean when I mean the

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  stock price doesn't indicate the real value you're saying yeah no I mean well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the stock price usually reflects the growth rate and so the growth rate seems  to be you know I actually I think it I think it is undervalued I think  Microsoft stocks always been kind of undervalued for the last couple years

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but I don't think Microsoft's making a lot of money because of its internet  plays it's still making a lot of money based on its software but it continues  to try to push and push and push I mean even since Windows 5 with with the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  question I'm asking is why do they persist right right I think it's because

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they think the average they think that the concept of selling software is going  to change to advertising based software and they want to have another growth  business they think that you know the the software business they have has  reached you know monopolistic portions and it's not going to grow that great  it's incremental and this other business online that's adjacent to them is  growing phenomenally well so they don't want to have all the software they  create and all the services they create be advertised and supported by other  companies like Google and Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Doug K do you have anything to say on this you've been silent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No I haven't been completely silent but I agree with Jason I think you know this is a  company that is pretty much maxed out they they can't grow I think if they  take a long-term view I first wrote that in 1990 by the way yeah but it's it's  and it's still true John I think I think that I think that their legacy business  has at least capped out and if they look long term they need a new future and  they're looking at many things they're looking at ads they're looking at media  and they always have they've always and they're looking at cloud computing with

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  mesh that's right. Video games was a big push for them five years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they've succeeded in that one okay but they're you know they're they're big  enough that they have to try all these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well and they're big and they have so much money they can afford to throw  money ridiculous amounts of money in so many different areas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right they're big enough they can't try all these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah it's I mean at this point it's almost like record company economics let's start a  thousand projects in you know a thousand different areas and if one hits you know  hey we've got a major.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think if you go back ten if you go back ten years ago I don't think any of this would have said that a big  challenger to Microsoft would be somebody who came out of the search engine business.  Google yeah.  Yeah so so they they've got to keep their eye on everything and I don't think they can afford to  leave any niches untouched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is you know Dwight you should go work for them because they have the same paranoid  attitude that has led to some of these crazy decisions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Randall Randall-Stross writing in the New York Times gives some some some numbers which do tell  you something for instance in the 2006 fiscal year online services 74 million dollar  loss the year before a profit of 402 million.  The numbers have gotten worse and worse in 19 in 2007 the online businesses lost 732  million dollars in the nine months subsequent through March 31st of this year for 745 million  dollars.  They're hemorrhaging hemorrhaging online.  Google of course the exact opposite.  You know he he says it started in 1993.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With MSN is when it started these guys have been taking the wrong road on every

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  made money though it made money until a couple of years ago was making money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well if they had all this money that they're losing if they'd be distributing it to their  shareholders instead of throwing it away left and right on one crazy idea or another or this 44  billion for example and give it to the shareholders that would push the price of the stock up.  Pay the shareholders their money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah but that's actually implying that Wall Street's that logical about how they  price stocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They don't like it they don't like it the Microsoft doesn't play pay a dividend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah people people also want a growth company they want to see the price of the shares go  up and so what John's you know advocating is saying okay pay dividends and be you know  a dividend bearing stock and that's not the business that people who own that stock want  them to be in.  They want them to be in the growth business and by John's logic they would never have done  the Xbox and so in order to get like an Xbox you may need to have 10 Zunes and you know  you know that's just that's just the nature of the business and when you're that big it's  hard to do things right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No but when you're that big that's the time to calm down give up on these crazy ideas  that you can do other things where you have no core competency whatsoever and give the  shareholders their money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right well in related news Steve Jobs is going to pull back the iPhone because he  he should have just given a dividend.  This is why you don't run a company John that's why you're a journalist  that's because you have an illogical view of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Jason you're saying put the money in R&D and new products not into not don't pay back the  stockholders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You pay back the stockholders by increasing the shareholder value.  I mean yes dividends are great but it's not why people are buying technology companies  they want to do both things and it's really in the online advertising space on the internet  is in the second or third inning max.  It's just starting and the impact is going to be global and so you know just like Windows  was a global story and Office was a global story and their server business was a global  story.  This is a global story it's talking about you know tens of billions of dollars a year  already it's going to grow to hundreds of billions of dollars a year.  It could be a business that's bigger than Microsoft's existing business so they have  no choice but to go for it or split up the company and go for it three different ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well also that's actually a better idea than anything else you've come up with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know of that many technology companies that pay a dividend anyway.  Off the top of my head I think does IBM even pay a dividend?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People do not give dividends.  No it's not a dividend bearing business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well they don't have to you know when you have a bunch of cheerleaders like Jason in  the background you know pushing that concept that you should never pay a dividend just keep  you know reinvesting the money until you go completely broke which is what happens to  a lot of these companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Guys IBM's paying 40 and 50 cents per share dividends.  As a matter of fact they've been paying 30 cents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're an old school company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah I'm not you know.  You don't buy IBM for growth.  You don't buy IBM for growth in the pre dot com bubble too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it's also been but also IBM's more like Coca-Cola.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah yeah you don't buy them for growth they're a blue chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When you get that Mike you've got to change your strategy.  You can't just start throwing money away in the same proportions you did when you were  a small company.  The 44 billion dollars that Microsoft wanted to drop on Yahoo was basically all the money  they had in the bank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's why they didn't join Fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes.  I got a question for everybody.  How does this impact the average listener?  Not at all.  Of Twiq.  Is Microsoft going to go out of business?  Are they going to lose their core competencies as demonstrated with Vista?  They're going to slowly fade away.  Should they have sold all of the money at making Vista better?  Are they going to be replaced by OS X and Linux?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Slowly fade away.  Less and less relevant over time as Google becomes more and more relevant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So we're all going to be doing cloud computing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Cloud computing baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Off our iPhones once they get that Bluetooth keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Here's a question talking about spending money.  Burst mode, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, I was just watching a 4 gigabyte download and it slowed considerably after  about the first 300 megabytes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You're on Comcast and you're downloading stuff in the background while you're talking to me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I turned it off a half an hour ago.  That's how long ago that part of the conversation started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Leo, just to interrupt for a second.  Yes.  The Frank at Comcast Care says that he'll talk to us and explain Burst on the show right now.  If we wanted to get a hold of him.  And I wonder how I get him on.  Well, let me send a note to him in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Find out what his Skype panel is and we'll add him in.  I'd love that.  We were talking before the show and actually it might have been during the show.  At this point, I have no idea what the show, when the show began or what it is.  But we were talking about this Burst mode, which is, or what is it?  What do you call it Dwight?  What are they called?  Power Boost.  And I've got Comcast business here and I was kind of blown away when I did a speed test.  It was 22 megabits down and three megabits up.  And what are you getting in Houston?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I'm on the Puny six megabit residential service and I get about 10 to 11 megabits  when I do that speed test.net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So the power, your assertion was is only for a limited period of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  As they've told me here, because I covered when Time Warner switched over to Comcast  in Houston, it's on the first 10 megabits.  And there's also a power boost going up too on the upstream.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So don't get fooled by that.  So while we're getting Frank, who is Comcast cares on Twitter.  By the way, I stopped following him because it was just all these messages to people.  Oh, we care.  We care.  Really, we care.  He's worse.  Scoble.  He's terrible.  It's awful.  But if you need him, it's good to know he's there.  So you wrote a bit on your blog on the Houston Chronicle,  asking, querying whether you think 1.8 billion is too much for CNET.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it just strikes me.  And that's a 44% premium.  That's a huge premium.  The only thing that Jason talks about the advertising and that's a good point.  But the other thing is, is they have a lot of domains that have not really lived up to  their potential.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's what Patrick was saying, that there's some value there.  And CBS, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  TV.com.  CBS now owns TV.com and MP3.com.  That's a lot of potential there.  CNET was really squandering both of those.  What is TV.com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know if they were squandering, but they just never managed to get the kind of  traction they wanted because they got MP3.com from our favorite Linux developer.  Right, Michael Rogers.  Yeah.  That just never, they were trying to do something to make it as competitive with any other music  service and it just never quite gelled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you think that-  TV.com is like a television news.  I mean, it's news about television and clips and so forth.  It's really, it's almost like a TV guide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'll be honest, that would make more sense to me.  I can't understand what CBS would want with a tech news site or tech reviews.  To me, that's the last thing the network would ever want.  But that makes sense that they want MP3.com and TV.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they've been acquiring a lot of other properties though.  Right?  They've picked up a lot of other properties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They have Wallstrip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And remember in the early on, they at one point owned MarketWatch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they were just partners.  They never actually owned them.  It was CBS MarketWatch.  Yeah, it was called CBS MarketWatch, but it was kind of a joint venture.  MarketWatch had its own share prices and when they finally did,  tried to do a deal where CBS was going to buy MarketWatch completely,  Dow Jones came in with a better offering that took them over.  It wasn't like they ever really had that much.  It wasn't like CBS sold them to Dow Jones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So is CBS interested only in the online advertising and these little  kind of mainstream sites that have been underutilized?  Are they going to gut the tech side of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they also, CBS said that they were interested also in their global reach.  CNET has got a strong foothold in China.  And they were very interested in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Should Tom and Molly be worried, Patrick, you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, not at all.  Not about that.  What should they worry about?  Well, I mean, one, they're a pretty successful story on the channel in a number of ways.  And two, CNET has a very good ad sales team.  And three, there's still millions of eyeballs shopping up and making,  buying decisions based on CNET recommendations.  But it's interesting because if CNET or CBS comes in and says,  all these product reviews cost too much, you have to reduce costs.  There's a bunch of ways to reduce costs through eliminating a lot of the in-house development  because CNET just developed a lot of software over the years rather than buying it from out of house.  There's obviously duplicities in the accounting and finance department.  I think duplications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There may be duplicities, but we know there's duplications.  Duplicities.  Sorry.  The accounting department, there may be duplicities.  You never know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I assume that was a misstatement and not an accusation.  I liked it.  I apologize.  But I mean, to get to the point though is there's a bunch of ways to reduce cost and  there's some really interesting core operations.  I just hope they don't start taking out some of the funding for the reviews program over there.  Right.  There's a lot of good content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We have a lot of friends in the tech side there.  I watch what happens with mainstream media takeover properties that some of the properties  they don't seem to care that much about the tech side of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know why they buy a company like that.  I mean, that's their still their bread and butter is the tech side.  Is it though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It sounds like all this other stuff is what they're interested in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That stuff can't be.  Come on.  I've talked to people over there.  I checked the Mevio offices right up the street, so I wander by.  Those things are, except for the Tech Republic, which is another tech site,  those other things aren't adding much to the bottom line yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How about their gaming sites?  They have gaming, don't they?  GameSpot.  GameSpot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that's one of the three biggest gaming sites online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they have a really large auto site.  Don't have one of the biggest auto sites.  Tell me what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  See, it sounds like a pretty good deal when you put it all together.  I mean, 1.8 billion is like what Google paid for YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, I think Jason had it right when he said there's a lot of underutilized stuff over there.  If you can get somebody in tech and manage it, but I don't know that CBS has those skills.  Well, that's the other thing.  It's a nightmare to manage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know the guy who did this deal.  His name is Quincy Smith.  He's also an investor in Mahalo.  He previously worked at Allen & Company.  CNET's been on the market for a long time.  I was approached to be the senior management and a takeover bid by some private equity guys.  I've looked at this asset a number of times.  You have to have a theory when you buy one of these  as to how you're going to double, triple the revenue.  When we looked at it for different things as a standalone company,  unless you were going to invest a couple hundred million dollars, I couldn't come up with the theory.  The theory that CBS has is they have television, radio, and outdoor.  Outdoor and radio, especially radio, are very good at driving traffic to online assets.  Radio is awesome because people aren't looking at something.  They're typing, et cetera.  They're in front of their computers listening to the radio.  They can push a lot of traffic to these brands.  That's what they're going to do.  Then the advertising people over at CNET are going to be doing group buys.  You have all the digital people who will be able to sell up to advertising,  and the online advertising and radio and billboard people selling down into  packages with digital assets.  When they talk to Nokia, they can put Nokia on TV, on a billboard, in radio, and online.  It's a very compelling package.  CBS isn't so huge that they couldn't make that happen.  CBS is sort of a tweener.  It's not quite as big as Time Warner, but it's not tiny.  It's got $14 billion in revenue, and this is adding $400 million.  So this is an acquisition.  They can actually do well and allow these small  com they own.  They could really blow this stuff out, and they could do television shows based on  GameSpot or radio shows based on GameSpot.  This could be a beautiful...  This could be what the Time Warner AOL merger was supposed to be.  HM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you're pretty focused on them.  I think some of that's okay, but come on, the radio shows and TV shows.  I mean, look, they got the G4 network to compete against.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Nobody wants to watch technology on network television.  That's pretty obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you like to listen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I'm not...  It's a fine niche, but the numbers that we produce or anybody produces are...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Technology's never been on...  It's not...  It's not...  Like, broadcast, network, television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's not a big enough number.  I mean, it's just...  It's not in the millions.  It's in the hundreds of thousands.  It's because most of the people...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Imagine the person from CNET.  Imagine Molly being on the early show, which gets 3.5 million viewers per day.  Imagine Tom being on the news, the six o'clock news.  And imagine on their radio network, other people from across their properties,  whether it's Metacritic, which is a radio...  ...and stuff, or Chow, which is food.  Chow.com could easily become a television show or a segment on a show.  And so that kind of stuff would actually drive real numbers.  But it's really about the integrated ad...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You're saying drive real numbers to the website.  And really, if we remember, that's how CNET  became so big in the first place.  It was originally a television network.  And then Halsey Miner said, well, wait a minute.  This internet thing could be big.  But he used his TV properties to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did the television stuff ever work very well?  It worked well enough to drive people to see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It drove a lot of traffic.  It drove tons of traffic.  You were on it, John.  It was all because of Kevin Wendell.  He was the one who did the...  The new Skype name for Comcast Cares, Frank, is Comcast Cares.  That would be his Skype name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do you think he really wanted us to put that out?  I guess why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's got it on Twitter right here.  It's not like a private message.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm going to add him right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So regarding CNET, imagine if your CBS and your television business is drying up,  which it is, and you want to spend a billion dollars to bootstrap yourself into more online  than you've been doing.  Who else are you going to buy?  What else are you going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know what else you could do.  What?  Improve the crappy product that you already have.  Like newspapers do.  I want to see Molly Wood on Survivor.  They cheapen the product, they cheapen the product, and they start losing readers,  and then they wonder why.  It's unbelievable to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the TV business is not doing well, and they want to bootstrap it.  They want to give themselves a quick way to improve the online business  since they know that's their future.  What are they going to do?  They've got to do it with an acquisition.  Who else could they buy?  Who else is out there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's no person after CNET.  After that, it drops down from $400 million in revenue to like $50 or $100 million.  Sounds like we have an agreement here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This was a good deal.  It was the right deal to make, and it was probably close to the right price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Jason's right.  I think the 45%, whatever his percent premium is, is not so bad for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It was undervalued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's been undervalued for a long time.  It's been on the market for two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Janna Partners has been pushing.  They're a minority holder, and they've been pushing for a while to shape up CNET.  They've been saying, well, CNET's not well run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The problem with it is they're doing too many different things.  No management team can be running a food site, a tax site, an entertainment site,  a this site, a games site.  It's too much for one management team to handle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Can Leslie Moonves be the guy to whip it into shape?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you put a lot of managers on this, like a lot of mid-level managers on each project  and give them each budget, yeah, because that's a bigger scale company with thousands of employees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let's add Frank Elias, and he is Comcast Cares.  I don't know what the, for some reason I'm getting a lot of Tokyo Metro sounds in here.  I don't know what's going on.  Hello, Frank.  Are you there?  How is everybody today?  It's Comcast Cares, ladies and gentlemen.  Yes, he speaks.  Hey, Frank.  Hello, Frank.  How are you?  So welcome to Twit.  You are, we found out about you last week.  It's more than 140 characters.  Yeah.  You can actually use longer sentences now, Frank.  Frank is Comcast Cares on Twitter, and that's how we became aware of him.  Last week we talked about it on Twit, and now we wanted you to come in here  for one simple thing, to explain what this power, what is it?  Power Boost, what does it do?  How do it work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, first of all, you have Power Boost, then you have Blast.  Power Boost does up your speeds for the first 10 megabytes or so,  as was pointed out earlier.  That's available for people that have usually the eight megabyte plan,  as well as the six megabyte plan.  But then Blast, which is what we set John up with, is 16 megabytes.  16.2 is his speed.  Then Blast is on, or Power Boost on top of that.  That's why, like for myself, I was actually registering 30 a few moments ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, Frank, does Power Boost increase your 16 megabit per second?  Basically, it only gives you additional bandwidth on your cap  if the server at the other end is capable of sustaining it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is correct.  Not only is the server on the other end is capable of it,  but also what is going on within the node that you're in.  Is it allowing if there's available bandwidth at that time for you to take advantage of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's why it does area tasks.  Hey Frank, are you in the New York subway walking past a buster?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Get closer to your mic.  That music that you're so lovely hearing is the swing.  I have a two-month-old baby who is swinging behind me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I love that.  I have one of those in my office, actually.  They make them adult size now.  Two-month-old babies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's get back to this.  Now, Frank, so I got the 16, so it bursts up to high numbers just for it,  but it falls back to 16 if I can get 16?  Is that what you're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It will fall back on sustained downloads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If nobody else is using your node and the server at the other end  can support more than 16 megabits?  You're going to be taken care of.  So it's not going to increase your split on the local node  versus the other clients on the node,  unless it exceeds your existing bandwidth cap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, and everything's available.  That's exactly it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the likelihood of any of us ever seeing power burst  between the hours of 6 a.m. and probably 3 a.m. are pretty slight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, to be honest with you, I almost always see pretty good speeds most of the time.  The only times that, especially those of you like John in the Bay Area  where we've done a lot of upgrades,  doing those upgrades a lot of times,  splitting out some nodes that were overloaded.  And so you will see in those areas much better sustained burst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What song is your swing playing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am trying to figure that out.  I don't know.  It's very beautiful.  I tried to use a microphone instead of the one on the computer.  No, that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I'm like, I can't move over to turn it off.  My plane's Metallica's Enter Sandman.  And I really find that very resonant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It also attracted the shiny objects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It sounds like ZamFear, the Pan flute, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Frank, I have a question for you.  I'll see what you're working for.  Hey, Frank, what's your official title there at Comcast?  What are you really doing in your day job?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is my job?  My job is changing quite a bit thanks to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Was this your idea to go on Twitter and to say,  let's do some customer service on Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, actually what happened, I started at Comcast in September.  And at the time, I started to get information off the internet.  And then within a few days of doing that,  I started reaching out and calling people.  And we started seeing success with that.  So my job has kind of evolved into doing online social media work.  Oh, that's interesting.  And then about two months ago, someone who's on Twitter,  can't even think, W Scott W3, he's actually an ADP for Comcast in New Mexico.  He sent me an email saying, you really need to check out Twitter.  And so I started watching Twitter and my head was spinning.  So we were watching it quite a bit.  And then about a month or a little over a month ago, Michael Arrington,  we reached out to him.  We reached out to others on there too.  But because of the publicity with that,  I decided the next day to start actually writing on Twitter too.  So it's been actually great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And how has Comcast reacted to what's going on there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The reaction has been extremely positive.  In fact, we just brought on seven people to join  a new group that I'm putting together for social media.  And to get more involved.  That's very smart.  It's actually been very much embraced.  At the same time, I have to kind of show people what Twitter really is.  Because a lot of people don't understand it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hey, Frank, could you help me out?  Because I'm only 19 people ahead of Kevin Rose right now on Twitter.  If you could just send some of your followers my way,  just say, Leo Laporte, nice guy, follow him, unfollow Kevin Rose.  I'd appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, you've already passed up Barack Obama.  I'm trying to catch up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, but I don't want Kevin Rose to beat me.  This is the part where we all give our Twitter locations.  OK, everybody give out their Twitter.  And then we're going to end it.  Frank, as Comcast cares on Twitter, Patrick, you are Patrick Norton, right?  Patrick Norton.  John C. Dvorak is the real Dvorak.  Dwight, are you D Silverman?  Is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm D Silverman.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  D Silverman.  I'm Dwight.  Yeah, that's D Silverman.  You're talking to him.  The D Silverman.  Dwight's great.  Oh, yeah, I follow.  I've been following for a long time on Twitter.  Jason is Jason Calacanis.  And Doug Kay, I think you're not on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I'm on Twitter.  Doug Kay with a knee on the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, I can't believe I'm not following you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm the best cat picker on Twitter.  Including a did a column a couple of weeks ago on a woman who was crying out for help  out of Houston for Comcast and he wound up taking care of her.  And what was really interesting were that we have comments under our stories on the  website and the comments from people who basically said, well, Comcast doesn't help me.  And then Frank jumped into our comments and started helping folks in our comments.  So he goes where he's needed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Frank, do you think this is going to be a trend among other corporations?  I mean, I think that not just Twitter, but using these social networks for customer service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I actually do.  I think if you look at the Dell model from a few years back and everybody remembers Dell  hell and it really started perfecting the reaching out on the Internet.  I think most companies are going to actually eventually find their way there.  But I think most companies are like the executives are showing me you need to show them  what the benefits are.  And I think you will have someone who works for them that actually just does it.  And we'll see the similar phrase that we've seen.  And the executives say, well, why aren't we doing more of this?  So I think it's going to evolve.  And I think the publicity we've seen, I think it's going to force some evolution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Frank, thank you so much for joining us.  I hear you're your baby waking up.  So I'm going to let you go.  Well, thank you, everybody.  Great to talk to you.  See you, Frank.  Frank Eliason, who is Comcast Cares.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So does anybody find it ironic that he had like the worst connection of all of us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wasn't his bandwidth.  His bandwidth was fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was my yeah, come in the microphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It was purely the microphone because he had to reach over and push that swing.  I've no when the batteries die on those swings, it's a real pain.  I hate that.  No!  I have to go, Colleen!  Wind me up!

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So there you go.  Does that answer your question, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, when you have like the 16.2 service, that means it bursts up to some high speed,  for sure.  Well, then drops back to 16.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But if you think about it, that's really kind of mostly what you want.  Because when you're loading a web page or something,  the first 10 megabytes are the most important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true.  But at 16, I mean, I don't think I really need any more of a burst.  But the thing is, I'm not getting 16.  I mean, I'm getting 16 on the test, but there's nobody's delivering 16.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No outside site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they don't deliver 16.  Why would they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the content delivery networks do.  If you go to Akamai, Limelight, anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Very rarely, very rarely do they get that high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'll tell you, when you download our podcast, I noticed because we're on several different,  Cashfly, we're on AOL, and then we're on just kind of a regular internet service  provider, DSL Extreme, for the radio show.  And I'll tell you, I could see the difference.  AOL and Cashfly, those are both CDNs.  It comes in fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But also, we benchmark Limelight and Amazon S3.  Both of them are capable of extremely high sustained levels.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  IT Conversations is on Limelight and S3?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We've used both.  Right now, all the content's on Limelight.  But we've used S3 in the past for some of our other stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did you do that on a consumer account?  Did you benchmark those on a consumer account or a corporate account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We had to do it on multiple accounts in order just to get enough bandwidth to soak it up.  Because I'm on Comcast in the Bay Area, too, Patrick.  And I've got one of these PowerBoost accounts.  And I have the same things you get, which is it's great for a few seconds,  and then it slows down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One of the things I found is if you can find college students with Internet 2 connections,  we had one guy who would help us out because we were having some issues with Limelight.  And he could basically max out anything because they had the most insane routing.  They had some of the shortest routing I've ever seen on the planet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's so complicated because it's who's peering with whom.  It's how their routing goes, how many hops.  There's so many variables.  You can never really be sure where the issue is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, you can.  You can be really, really sure if you take the time to trace it down.  Do a big trace route.  Yeah, you start with a trace route, then you do individual files.  It's a pain in the ass, but you can figure out a lot about where it slows down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It wasn't that long ago that your average server only had a 10-megabit connection to  its internal network.  And so there's no way that it's going to serve as even a single person any faster than 10 megabits.  Now they've got 100-megabit and gigabit connections.  But if you think about how fast can you literally get the stuff out of a box,  you're limited by some of those physical internet connections.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's just a matter of time before the hard drive speeds are going to start limiting you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and now everything's being cached.  So you're not subject to the disks, but you do have an issue of once you start to download  a file, all of that file comes from a single server.  You can't typically switch servers in the middle of a download.  So how fast can you get it out of the box?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's an issue.  And the servers get overrun.  And we're dealing with that with streaming video.  I mean, that's a very demanding thing as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You'll find in a lot of cases also is that when they're sniffing the packets,  they're taking a pretty close look at what type of file it is and what the source is.  And I've actually seen pretty heavy...  Enough evidence where it's going from circumstantial on to pretty likely  that a lot of consumer ISPs are throttling video traffic and throttling traffic from certain CDNs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, that's it.  Not just BitTorrent, but from certain CDNs as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's...  You know, and it's in some cases, one of the justifications for it is imagine if you have  a huge number of teenagers in your particular local ISP.  Like you just have a...  It turns out like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have mixed feelings.  I mean, I don't want to put Frank on the spot.  It's not his job to defend Comcast's peer-to-peer policy and so forth.  Yes, it is.  Okay, let's get him back on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's get him back on because we...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll get him back on some other time.  Yeah.  Well, I don't mean now.  I'm not even talking about peer-to-peer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm talking about straight HTTP downloads.  I mean, it's kind of amazing.  You start looking at the way packets are handled.  And there's some really interesting stuff that you can't really...  When you basically start tracking the speed or tracking the ping times between servers  and you start looking at people who can download from site A at 5 megabits per second and site B  at 300k and you start...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I used to use this really great piece of software out of Israel called Download Accelerator,  which was number one on download.com, which is a CNET property, for a long time.  And what it would do is it would open multiple FTP connections to servers,  download four streams at once, and then put it together.  That's polite.  And then it got so popular people started blocking it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, because you're basically ending around...  Ending around their bandwidth limiting techniques because you're opening multiple  connections to them.  They hammer the servers.  Yeah, but I could download Doom 2's trial in Alaphast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I use it too.  Remember that there was actually other software that was really bad, which what it used to do is...  32 caches.  Every time you would pre-caching it, every time you would load a web page,  it would open up the first 20 links or something in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Firefox does that now.  Firefox 2, that's the problem with Firefox 2 is pre-caching all the pages on the page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That seems to me to be a very bad Internet citizenship, I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it was a good idea long ago, but now with all these pages loading up with all kinds of ads  and going through double click and it doesn't work anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't load JavaScript.  It doesn't.  We have fast enough connections.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It makes sense if you're on a 300 baud connection.  It doesn't make sense on a broadband connection.  By the way, a German company, the Max Planck Institute,  I'm glad that Max Planck, one of the great physicists, quantum mechanics,  there is now a Max Planck Institute for Software Systems.  And what great important deep subject are they studying?  Comcast and Cox are slowing BitTorrent traffic all through the clock, all times a day.  They use more than 8,000 nodes worldwide to test BitTorrent blocking.  Found that Comcast was interrupting at least 30% of BitTorrent upload attempts around the clock,  contrary to what Comcast has said, which is that we're only doing it during peak hours.  At noon, Comcast was interfering with more than 80% of BitTorrent traffic, 60% at other times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because noon is actually one of the noon Eastern standards, one of the heaviest times for web.  Everybody does it at work.  Surfing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cox is interfering with 100%, Cox, which is another cable company, smaller cable company,  interfering with 100% of BitTorrent traffic, 1 a.m., 4 a.m., 5 a.m., so all around the clock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So is this, I mean, it's kind of funny that the same ISPs that don't want to be held accountable  for being able to control what's on their network, which would make them a publisher,  which would make them liable for it, which would open to all sorts of interesting lawsuits,  are finding themselves finding it the necessity either out of fear of the RIA and the MPAA,  or because they just don't want their network saturated or throttling.  That's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm a little sympathetic as a user of a broad, I have four different broadband,  five different broadband connections in here.  If some kid down the street all of a sudden decides to download the entire Arnold Schwarzenegger,  I don't want to have to suddenly shut down TwitLive because I can't get the bandwidth for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, the flip side is, don't you want to be able, if you're paying this monthly fee,  don't you think they should be honest about what you're actually getting for this monthly fee?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the ISP business has always been based on aggregation of traffic.  Back when it was modem pools.  Yeah. I mean, no one has ever been able to supply all of the maximum bit rates of all of its  customers. So that's just a name of the beast, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot of places outside the US that have bandwidth caps, here in Australia,  people have bandwidth caps that are pretty onerous. And what they really should do in the US is they  should offer one rate, which is for, with a bandwidth cap that's cheap, 10 bucks, 15 bucks,  and they should offer an unlimited, which is 75 bucks or something. I know that sounds crazy,  people don't like that, but these providers do have to pay for this bandwidth. They do have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  pay for this infrastructure. They're peering, Jason. They're all peering. I mean, the major  ISPs are all peering and they're not paying for the bandwidth, which is what they're paying or

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  not. They're protecting me as a customer by saying no one customer can be a pig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, no, Leo, they're not protecting you as a customer. They're shutting off other customers'  ability to do what they want to do with their neck. Yeah, which is in some cases being piggy.  Yeah, but throttling is one thing. You're right. They're blank. It's completely different.  You're right. That's true. Fine. I have no problem with throttling. I don't like it. I would like to  actually get the bandwidth I think I'm paying for. I think that would be reasonable. But,  you know, because when AT&T is like, well, to actually get the bandwidth you think you're  paying for, you have to go for a business account. Okay. And that's how much. Well, we'll find out

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  because we've been downloading the entire Arnold Schwarzenegger ervra for the last four days in  we'll find out what Comcast if Comcast really cares. I have no problem with prioritizing and

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  stuff. I just don't want to see them shutting down. Yeah. And you're right. What they're doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  by turning off BitTorrents, regardless of how much you've downloaded, I mean, they're cutting the  seeds. That's a whole nother thing. And I think you're right, Patrick, that is entering into the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  editorial realm saying, well, BitTorrents bad. And the next thing you know is suddenly you're  getting sued in various states for allowing, you know, obscenities to your cross your network.  Obviously filter this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The ISPs are starting to look at doing tiered pricing in the United States. Time Warner is  trialing it over in Beaumont down the freeway here and but primarily with with new customers.  But I think it's probably gonna come even Comcast has said they're looking at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it's tiered in a way. I mean, I you know, you pay for power boost, right? I mean,  it's not something you get automatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, you do get it automatically.  Oh, you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Our boost is free. Power boost is a bonus. It's a gimme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But as a business class user, I had a choice between two tiers. And I opted for the higher  tier. So I'm tiered. Maybe and maybe maybe home users aren't yet tiered. But I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they actually there there are tiers. We're talking about bandwidth cap tiers,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  tiers based on the amount of  Well, that's what we've been talking about this 250 gigabyte per month cap. Yeah,  we talked about that a couple of weeks ago. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had to pay extra for power boost. What did I do wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I thought. So you don't always

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are you confusing power burst with power boost with burst because power boost is something  that basically ups the bandwidth for the first, you know, 10 megabits of a download.  Burst is a product that's basically a tiered level of service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I got I got the first thing I got it about a year ago. I called them up and they said for  an extra $10 a month, we'll double your download and upload speeds. I said, how long will it take?  When? When do I have to make one? We said, well, no, we'll do it in about the next two minutes.  And sure enough, two minutes later, my download speed was that's not power boost.  Oh, that's not okay. Yeah, that's basically magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Power boost is applies across all the tiers of services. What you did was basically is you

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  bought the new cool guy. I'll tell you one thing. We're just glad we are not customers of the  fabulous Paul Allen Charter High Speed Internet Service. Not that we have any issues with Paul  Allen. Not that we care one bit. By the way, Patrick, happy 10th anniversary of ZDTV. Oh,  you weren't at the beginning there at the beginning. So it's actually I was there at the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  beginning. I started in March. I started before the launch. May 11th. You just weren't on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  screensavers yet. May 11th, 2000. I'm sorry, not in 2000. 1998. Yeah, because I moved to San

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Francisco March. I've lived longer in San Francisco than anywhere else. I've lived in mine. You came

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  with Jim Latterback and you were kind of more in the lab at first. Yes, I was bringing products

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and actually helping solve some of the production issues with computers on your set. I was one of  the little people. I didn't notice you then. I didn't know who you were. You kept confusing  me with some intern named Roger. We look alike, you see. Yeah. And John C. Dvorak, were you at

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Silicon Spin? Did that start at the beginning of TechTek? Oh yeah, we were a startup show.  So May 11th, 1998. We didn't mention it last week. I was remiss, but it's the 10th anniversary of  the founding of ZDTV was one week ago today. Not that it means anything. I just thought I'd  mention it since really in many ways what TWIT is is a successor to that. What you're doing  at Revision 3 and with Tekzilla, Patrick, is a successor to that. So I'd say it had a pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  dramatic impact on my life and your life. John's life, not so much. He was already famous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What did you think of the Dash unit, Leo? Oh, I'm going to get to that in a second. I just want to

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  talk about this charter thing and let's talk about Dash because I think they're doing something very  interesting and they are not an advertiser by the way, but we'd welcome their money.  Charter, which is doing deep packet inspection, is using it for a unique purpose. And I love the spin  on the Charter website. They have an FAQ. This is the answer to the question. And I know I get this  question a lot. What enhancements are coming to Charter's high speed internet service?  While continuing to deliver the same fast and reliable internet service you've always received,  innovative new technology in the field of online advertising enables Charter to provide you with an  enhanced online experience that is more customized to your interests and activities. As a result of  this service, the advertising you typically see online will better reflect the interests you  express through your web surfing activity. Translation, Mr. Norton, would you like to  translate that marketing speaker? You seem very good at that. Well, for all eight of you out there

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  in Charterland that use our browser and our interface every time you log in, much like the  AOL of your. I mean, basically they're just tracking and targeting ads. It sounds like they're  going to insert ads into sites. Yeah, that was why I was wondering. I want to know if they're  basically talking about the classic AOL style filter for the internet. You can't opt out of this,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  but it sounds like they're going to. Yeah, you can opt out of it, but it sounds like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have this at AOL through the Dakota acquisition. What they do is,  and some other people are doing this, you want the ISPs, there's third parties that take the ISP data,  then they sell it to other advertisers. And then those advertisers say, okay, if this person  has been on these 100 technology sites before, then give them technology ads. The thing I think  about it is I think it's anti-competitive. I think there's a lawsuit waiting to happen, which is  it's interfering with the ability of those sites to sell advertising. So if I was running  Weblogs Inc. and somebody was going to people saying, I can sell you in gadget readers,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I could sue them. I think that's what's going to happen.  Yeah, that's absolutely where this is headed. And the thing is, I think that the giveaway is,  and people out there should know that we were talking about this before the show began,  but the fact of the matter is there was some discussion, Lyle, maybe you can find it in this  document where it said you will not get more ads. No, you'll just get the same number of ads,  but they'll be more targeted. Yes, but that means they've got to be  bumping somebody off. If you've got a page coming in with five ads and you're not going to get more

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  ads, how does that work? So you download a Mahalo page, instead of getting ads from Mahalo,  you're getting ads from somebody else who's buying? No, no, no. The way it works is they will sell

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  this data, so it's not going to happen for all advertising. They basically go to the advertisers  and to the double clicks and to those kind of people and say, if you would like to buy our  targeting service, we've targeted these users on our network. So they're not inserting ads in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, that's really interesting. So they can work with existing ads?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. So they'll say to Yahoo, when our users are using Yahoo, we'll let you know what they've  been looking at recently. So Yahoo gets better results. Right. So publishers buy this service  as well. And so it's like, Tokoto also tried to do this, which was they tried to get us that  gadget and autoblog when I was running it to put tags on our page. And then they would give us  30% of what those users made for other advertisers on other publisher sites. So when there was an ad  on another site, they would say, let's say Gizmodo was part of this. Gizmodo would get 60% the  advertisers and then we would get 30% and then Tokoto would get 10%, let's say. Absolutely not.  Why not? This is a win for everybody. No, it's not. Because what happens is then you have more  people selling your inventory and I wanted there to be only one place to get the inventory at a  high price. And I don't like people being able to buy my inventory through somebody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's true. No, I agree with you.  You know, at Charter I actually got a couple of letters from congressmen on Friday too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, there was-  That's because they were confused. I mean, if the twit panel is confused,  the congressmen are going to be lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. All right. So I feel better about it. It doesn't sound quite as nefarious as I thought.  I thought they were replacing ads as I was surfing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that would be totally illegal. That would be like ad hijacking. They're selling the data to  other publishers to target ads. And how do you think consumers feel about that? The consumers

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  might. I mean, don't they win because they're going to get ads that are more targeted to their

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  interests? Yeah. The answer is consumers don't care. They see the same number of ads. If they're  more targeted, it makes them, frankly, when they're more targeted, it makes them feel better. So it's  a non-issue there. It is an anti-competitive issue and there is going to be some issues about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right. More importantly, Houston is being overrun by ants that are eating electronics.  Can you fill us in on this, Dwight? This sounds like a terrible, terrible problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's these little tiny ants. They're called raspberry crazy ants.  They're named for the guy who discovered them in the US. Apparently, they came over on a cargo  ship into the port of Houston and they started showing up on the southeast side of town.  Although I've seen them, I saw them several years ago. I used to live up by the Compaq  campus on the northwest side of town, the old Compaq campus, and I saw them there.  But they don't move in like the straight little lines that you see ants move. They move kind of  haphazardly almost randomly. They're crazy. They're crazy. They're crazy. And they can cover more  ground this way and find food quicker is the theory. They also are very attracted to electrical  current as are a lot of ants. In fact, fire ants in the same way. I don't know if there are fire  ants where any of you guys live. They're a real problem down here in the southwest. Fire ants suck.  They're awful. And you'll see sometimes in like a, you'll see the green underground electrical  transformers around here. You'll see a lot of times a fire ant mound piled up against it.  So ants are used to that. But all ants are interested in electrical current. But here  they've been getting into people's computers if they get in the home and essentially gum them up.  They'll get into the fans. They'll get thick enough in there that they can cause heat problems.  That's disgusting.  It is disgusting. We had in a townhouse I was living in in San Antonio years ago,  we had fire ants get into an outdoor air conditioning compressor and gum up them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sorry, I was envisioning fire ants being shot through your AC at high speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is worse. When the repairman came to take the compressor apart, he pulled the motor out and it  was sticky. So this happens a lot down here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Dwight, my understanding is with these ants, and by the way, there's an ant in Hawaii I've  seen before that has the same characteristics. I don't know if they're related. But anyway,  I understand that these ants take on the fire ants and push them out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They eat fire ants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, that's good.  Do they taste like raspberry?  I don't know. Let's pause for a moment for a word from our sponsor audible.com slash  twit. You know, audible is the home for great audio books. I'm thinking probably on that  flight to Sydney. By the way, Jason got recognized. He got recognized on the flight to Sydney by a  twit listener. And he said, he said, now I know what it's like to be like be Kevin Rose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was crazy. Guy was sitting next to me is like, oh, how you doing? Where's your knot?  Where's the knot? And I love when you and Dvorak and how's the Tesla? And he means the guy had  every piece of information about our lives. And it was awesome. He's like, can I take a picture?  I was like, yeah, of course. I was like, wow, can I sign your booby? You know, like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  it's okay, because you're in first class, you're not going to run into the low lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, okay, so I remember when you were traveling with me back with the cattle on  Virgin America. Are you talking to me or do to Jason?  Jason, Jason and I ended up seated next to each other on a flight back from Vegas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That was a fluke. That was a fluke.  How did that happen? Oh my god.  They sold out the first class cabin.  I'm sitting in the back. Did you see the guy who's suing JetBlue?  We'll get back to the island in a moment. There's a guy suing JetBlue. He gets to the counter.  The counter attendant, the person says, I'm sorry, the flight sold out. He says, oh no,  I got to be on this flight. So there is a JetBlue employee who's deadheading on the flight. You know,  she's going to ride in a seat. She says, I'll give up my seat and I'll fly in the jump seat.  You can, so the guy says, thank you. It gets on JetBlue, gets a regular seat,  about two hours in the flight. The captain comes back and says, I'm sorry,  our employee is really uncomfortable. She wants her seat back. You can sit in the toilet for the  rest of the flight. The guy is suing because he says, I'm sitting on the John on this flight for  three hours. There's no seatbelt. The turbulence, I'm getting very scared.  Sounds like he's got a good case. I can't believe a captain would do that.  That seems pretty awful. Maybe he really liked the flight attendant. I don't know.  Anyway, that's neither here nor there and it has nothing to do with audible.com. Did you listen to  any audio books, Jason, on the flight? It's interesting you mentioned that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo. Confessions of an Economic Hitman is a book that's been recommended to me over and over again.  I'm a busy guy. I don't have a ton of time. I went on audible and lo and behold, on audible.com,  Confessions of an Economic Hitman, boom. I'm listening to that great book, really intriguing.  It's about how these economic hitmen have gone out and loaned money to all these countries around  the world. Then the money goes directly to American companies to, this has happened over  the last couple of decades, to build out their infrastructure. Then they owe that money back to  the United States and the United States can then go put military bases and whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Warhack recommended this a long time ago. John's been ...  Oh, did he?  In fact, I think he has a new book, The Economic Hitman Guy. Doesn't he? He's got a new book coming  out. John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the guy is ... The problem is there's a couple of things about that book that are  interesting. First of all, I think it's accurate in some funny way, but the guy's been discredited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's what I think. I'm wondering if it's just like Carlos Castaneda writing about ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no. I don't think it's that at all. I think the guy's been discredited for other reasons.  I think the idea is that you don't want anybody taking this book too seriously because then you  start re-evaluating what you see when you analyze what's going on.  Economic policy, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We talked about this last week with the disciplined investor, Andrew Horowitz, who suggested,  and I think this is true, that it's being turned ... This exact ploy is being turned on us with the  Chinese. Their economic imperialism against us now. We owe them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's possible. But anyway, the point is I think it's an enjoyable book. People should just  read it and then consider it, but his newer stuff is not going to be the same. This was a  one-shot deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You don't think he was making it up. You think he's been discredited because it's too dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I don't know about how dangerous it is, but it's not the kind of thing you want everybody ...  The entire American public should not be believing this because it's not in their best interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's very profitable and they don't want it stopped.  They. It's about they.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like some serious X-Files stuff.  It is X-Files, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If half of it's true, it's really disturbing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's totally credible. You don't think it's true?  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who knows what's true, what's not? I think so far it sounds pretty realistic to me and it seems  anyway. Let's not ruin it for everybody. Everybody go to audible.com slash twit,  get the book. Jason recommends it. Dvorak recommends it. It's the only time we're going  to agree about something. You have an obligation to go support twit and buy the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I was going to recommend The Chronicles of Narnia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Nerd.  That's a very nice book too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's great. Does anybody die?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think Prince Caspian is really cool. All right, so we have a consensus.  Confessions of an economic hitman. It is our book of. It's really our book of the year.  I think we started our audible commercials a year ago recommending this book.  And thanks to John. It's resonating, John. You know, I think what it is,  because nobody heard of this book until you started recommending it.  I think you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I heard about it at a conference too. So this is the thing about what you have to love about audible  is you can just take the recommendations, put them on your iPod or whatever device you want,  burn a CD, whatever, leave it in the car, leave it in your travel bag.  And then when you have that downtime, you can do something with your brain besides  ruin it on junk food like television.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was it was actually a New York Times bestseller about two or three years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay. And his new book, which you say is less credible, the secret history of the American Empire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One rarely gets to participate in international conspiracy and write about it twice. Leo Ergo,  the next book's probably not as scintillating because we're not taking our countries in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to I will read the next book and then I'll have a valuation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're both on audible. It's called the secret history of the American Empire. John Perkins is  the author, J O H N Perkins P E R K I N S either one to be a great listen. And you can get it free  just by going to audible.com slash twit. We love audible. We really love the idea. I love the idea  of audio books. We love Jason. So great. I don't I don't fully understand why you do this, Jason,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but I thank you for it. He's a economic hit man. I'm a fan. Okay. Listen, if I wasn't a fan,  I wouldn't do it. We're all fans. Tell me Comcast is the is the sponsor and I'll tell you, I don't  know. Tell me audible. I tell you, I know that product. There you go. Free years. Great product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There you go. I'm honest. There you go. Thank you, Jason. I appreciate it.  audible.com slash twit. Thank you for your support. Let us move along to the dash. Now this is  something that again, I owe you Jason. I didn't know anything about it. I'd used Garmin newbies,  which I like Magellan's, which I liked Tom Tom. I know you're a Garmin fan, Patrick. In fact,  I really learned about GPS from Patrick who used them early on Garmin and next day. I really like  me at the low end. Me, I was good. I have a me that I hang around my neck. That's a, you know,  kind of a walking GPS and I really like it. But I have to say this dash is interesting because  first of all, it's got wifi. It's got GPRS and wifi. So it's downloading new maps all the time.  Here's the thing I think is super cool. It sends anonymous information about your travel times up  to the server so that when you have traffic from other dash users and the travel times are constantly  amended so that they're more accurate. So when it says it's going to take 15 minutes to get  somewhere, it's not just based on some calculation on a map. It's based on other dash users,  which I think is very cool. You can also send your location of where you're going from the internet.  So that you have to pay for, which that's like 10 bucks extra a month, but you can go online and say,  okay, I did this the other day. I said, all right, I need to go somewhere in Santa Rosa.  And it sends it. So I don't ever have to enter it in the car, which I love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Awesome. That's a great feature. My assistant will, I'll be out and my sister will be like, oh,  you know, your next meeting is here at this place. And then you go in here tonight and I send them  to the dash. I turn on my car. Boom. It's already there. Your assistant could do it for you. Yeah.  She does and works great. And so they just opened the platform, which I think is really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's going to be like the chumby of GPS devices. Let's hope it's a little more successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's another feature. It has Yahoo search on it. So if you search for Starbucks or pizza,  it then gives you in distance order, the Starbucks or pizza around you, you click it and boom. And  so you can just like, it saves you a thousand clicks on trying to find something. And it's  pulling data from what I understand from like the internet data sources for traffic data. And,  you know, the units are creating this little, you know, real time traffic. So  every time I leave my house in Brentwood, I have the option of taking the four or five to work,  which takes four minutes if there's no traffic or the streets, which take 12.  And I never take the four or five because you know how that can be in Los Angeles. It could be on  there for an hour. Right. Now when I leave, I look and I say, oh wow, it's green or it's yellow. Okay.  And what I think is going to happen is people will not get on the road when they see red, right? They  just won't. If it's like a Saturday or they're going to go to the whatever, the airport, they'll  just change their travel plan. So I think it's going to have the effect of people not getting  on the road when there's traffic jams. I didn't realize this, but they're using Open MoCo,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  which I didn't realize the Open MoCo open source platform. They better be really, really, they

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  better be very careful that this doesn't become popular with bicyclists. Suddenly it will look  as though traffic is really slowed on all the bike pads. That's a good point. I never thought

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of that. I don't think they have cigarette lighters on bikes though. Yeah. Well, then they should

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  have a battery. Yeah. Generated by the wheels. Yeah. So Leo, if there's no, if a lot of people  in a particular given area aren't using the dash, it's not getting a lot of information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And how popular is this thing? I mean, is this- Right. Then exactly how accurate is that data

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that you're getting? I think they only need 50 to 100 in an area to have it be pretty accurate. And  they've preceded a lot of the major cities and they get the information from the traffic services  online. So you at least have that, you know, like the stuff you get on your iPhone. So you at least  have that. And then over time, more of these, you know, the sort of mesh network of dash units will

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  come online. Is this their first product? Is this like Houston and LA are huge? Houston's 600 square  miles. So, you know, you have 50, that's not going to do much. You're going to be relying on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  traditionally available, IP available traffic data for a long time. It would take a huge number of  these devices in the market, I think, to make any appreciable impact and accuracy. No, not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not true in the major cities. It's already effective in Los Angeles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, if, yeah, but yeah, LA maybe because you're mostly dealing with the five and the 405 is the  decision half the planet's trying to make there. I think for San Francisco and Houston, where you've  got a lot of competing arteries, Manhattan, North Jersey, I don't think it's going to help as much

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  till there are a lot of units. I think they're preceding it and they're going to give out a  bunch of these. How long have they been selling this for? I don't know. I got mine. I met the CEO  and I gave him some blogging advice. He sent me a couple units for free. That's why I send you one.  Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate it. It's an incredible product. I'm a big fan of it.  I was blown away. I could actually buy it for my other two cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they're 400 bucks. I have asked Dash and Amazon for a review unit and they haven't sent  me one. They have communicated to me that they're interested. So it could be that they now have  enough people in Houston to make a difference for me to see something. I suspect that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting. Yeah, maybe they hold, maybe they're holding off until they've got a good

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  story to tell in Houston. Yeah, they also may need to sell out their initial shipment to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have to say, it works pretty well in Petaluma. I don't know where it's getting the information  from, but I mean, there can't be many Dash users. You're getting traffic information in Petaluma?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, you're getting the 101 information. No, I'm getting street traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, you get street traffic too. It will tell me cross streets like D Street, which is historically  pretty busy. It's actually been fairly accurate on how busy D Street is, which is pretty surprising

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  to me. Maybe there are a lot of Dash units there. Maybe also in cities like Houston and also in

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  California where everybody has the electronic toll pass, here they call them EZ passes. In Houston,  they read those all along the freeway. So in order to do the traffic maps, that's how they do a lot  of it here. And I suspect that that may be what's happening in the cities where they don't have a  lot of Dashes yet. They're reading kind of the traditional traffic agency data that's coming out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but D Street in Petaluma, I find fascinating that it would actually have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know how it knows. And you know what? It's funny. As soon as you get, there's a certain  point on D Street where it kind of opens up because you're getting out into the country and  immediately it goes from orange to blank. It's fine. It doesn't have any information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Does it basically do a color overlay over the street on the Gs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes. Okay. So it's red, green, orange, yellow. I don't know exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And so you're getting that for streets in Petaluma?  Yeah. That's fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Isn't that wild? I'm telling you, this thing is really intriguing. And I love it that it's  based on Open MoCo. That was the cell phone design that everybody's, oh, we're going to make a cell  phone that'll compete with the iPhone and everything. I don't know where Open MoCo stands right now. But  the fact that they're basing it on an open source platform like this really is intriguing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's also less expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But it also means when they have it, they now can have a developer platform, right? That people know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  how to develop for. They're going to be able to put your own applications on there. So for example,  I don't know, Yelp could make an application for it. And so you could just say, click over to the  Yelp application and be like, here's what's going on. Or somebody who's got upcoming.org could show  you events going on tonight on the map and take you to them. I think there's an argument when  you think about planning in cities and stuff like that and traffic and congestion problems.  The cost of making every car have one of these or a similar device might be less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We must have a dash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it might be actually less to have this than to actually build out roads because in some cases,  because the problem is- Just be more efficient.  Be more efficient. I've gotten off the highway in LA and taken one of these,  because that's the other thing it does is it's like, by the way, this alternate route on the street  is faster than the highway route. So you just switch over, boom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they'll actually have data that they can sell back to municipalities and others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They should just give it away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I'm saying. It should be mandatory built into cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I think what's in to me, what's also interesting about this is it's the intrusion  of social networking, which is clearly very powerful online into devices. And boy,  you can really see some value. I think you and I, Patrick, were talking about the notion of this,  of cars talking to one another and talking ahead of time about what's the conditions like up ahead.  This is an implementation of exactly what you were talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Imagine if they put a thermometer in it. You could actually get the exact weather in different  locations. As you're getting it.  Like across the entire mesh network. Here's a temperature everywhere. It'd be like having  a hundred million thermometers hooked up to a network. You could see an overlay of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  entire country's weather. Yeah. As long as they position the  thermometers in the right location. Right.  They are. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let me ask you guys a little bit about this. The Orphan Works bill. Have you been  following the Orphan Works bill? This is a copyright law that has been hotly debated.  The idea, by the way, they're using Twitter to do markup on this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes. Leo, I'm sorry. I got to take the baby and put him down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Put him down. No. No, don't do it. Don't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Another poor choice of words. I apologize to all the parents in the audience. Although some of them  will relate more than others. No, I just, I just, I got to put him down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How's he doing? How's he? He's a sweet little boy. I bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's good. We've actually had a diaper change while we've been on and he's just, he's got,  he kind of looks like Doc Holliday. It is common. Isn't it? Molly's changed diapers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They changed, they changed John's diapers twice, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Three times. Get over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like a NASCAR pit crew over there. John, I had, I had a, John, I had the,  I had the Tesla for a week. It was incredible. I thought you bought one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Patrick, we'll see you later. Thank you, Patrick. Take care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Take it easy guys. All right. Bye bye.  Before the Tesla conversation starts. Cause Patrick won't want to leave then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. They loaned me the, uh, did you buy, somebody said you bought the number one car.  No, I wish I could. I have one of the cars over a hundred, but the number one car,  I know the chairman of the company, one of the investors, and he loaned me the first production  model for almost a week. And it is unbelievable. It is so fast. It is like driving like an X-wing  fighter or something. It's unbelievable. And it's a totally quiet and it's faster than the

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  topic at hand. We're going to get back to it. I'm just saying, I wanted to just make sure John

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  knows that they are shipping them now and there's a showroom in LA. So you have yours.  All right, John, you may have been right about Microsoft a couple of months, but Microsoft's  still going to get Yahoo probably. And I'm going to get my Tesla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just wait, just wait. I'm sorry. When do I get a drive? Do I get to get a ride in it or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely. You're going to get a ride in it. I just have to make sure they have a defibrillator  defibrillator for you in case something happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a good one. All right. You're just killing me, Jason, with this material.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. Thank you. I'm here three more nights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sydney, Australia. Are you at the Chuckle Hut in Sydney tonight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm at the Chuckle Hut in Sydney opening up for Carrot Top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. So the Orphan Works is a new copyright bill which has been hotly debated. The US Register  of Copyrights, Mary Beth Peters said, this is why we need it. People will go, he should use this as  an example, they'll go to a photographic shop with a photograph, an old photograph they want  retouched. The photographic shop will say, no, you have to produce evidence that you own this  photograph, that you own the copyright to it before we are allowed to retouch it. Or there are many,  many previously copyrighted works that no one cares about, no one's claiming. I remember  Larry Lessig very famously introduced the idea of having copyrights renew, but you have to pay  a dollar for it just to assert that somebody cares enough about this. So the idea of the Orphan  Works copyright law is that a photo or a book or some sort of artistic work that is presumably  still under copyright because a copyright has gotten so long is an orphan work if no one steps  forward and says, yeah, we own the copyright. That it can go out, in effect, go out of copyright  prematurely if no one asserts that they want it. Now a lot of photographers are very upset about  this. I think, you know, Howard Berman and Patrick Leahy introduced this, the Orphan Works Act of 2008  allows new creators to use old works without fear of lawsuits provided they've made a good faith  effort to find out if the work is copyrighted. It seems to me a sensible law. Has anybody,  have you been following this, John? No, I mean, I've been following the basic

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  trend. We're getting close. I mean, I know Larry and I have talked about this a number of times.  What does Larry think, Larry Lessig think of this? He thinks it's a disaster what we have,  which is a bunch of orphan works that are floating around out there that nobody knows who owns the  copyright. The person who may have written the thing is dead. The publishing company has been  bought and sold and bought and sold a half a dozen times. You don't even know who, if somebody  did own the copyright, it's impossible to figure out who. No, and there's probably a lot of  publishers out there right now that don't even know they own some of these copyrights. Meanwhile,  the fear is that, yeah, you could probably republish some of this stuff or use the material  over time, but the real problem is that the one guy out of a hundred that you roll out his thing,  nobody could find that this guy even lives. And the next thing you know, he's suing you for $100  million. You're at extreme risk to do any of this stuff and there has to be a law to prevent this  because the public domain is very important and it's very valuable. It's our commons. Now,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm going to give you, Dwight, I don't know if you want to argue on the other side, but  your colleague Nick Anderson, who's an editorial cartoonist at The Chronicle,  is very upset about this. He says copyright, this is basically flushing copyright law down the tubes.  He says, you know, this legislation imposes an onerous burden on copyright holders like me,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to protect my work. Yeah, he's taking the issue that, you know, if you have a work that you're not  diligently sitting on, that somebody can claim that they have done the due diligence that's  required by the law and then take it and do what they want. And, you know, I'm not familiar enough  with the law to know exactly what it's saying constitutes, you know, the good faith search,  but it seems to me that it does leave a lot of room for somebody to just walk in and say, yeah,  I looked for this and here's documentation to prove it and I'm going to go ahead and use it.  I don't think, on the other hand, you have, it's particularly a big problem with software,  particularly with old games and older programs, as John said, where people have traded or have  acquired companies and sold companies who owns it. It is a real big issue with software. People  online trade as wares, you know, software like this and who knows whether it has any ownership or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Public knowledge is behind it and, you know, the real issue here is getting Larry Lessig on. Larry  is taking the month of May off. He's off the grid until June, so we will get him on to talk about it  as soon as he gets back. But the problem is this is moving pretty quickly. The bill is,  it just came out of committee. It's sailing through Congress. Congress seems to really  want to pass this. There's kind of unilateral support from the Registrar of Copyrights and  Public Knowledge who are usually at odds over this stuff and yet a lot of copyright holders,  including a lot of photographers, illustrators, are very upset about this.  Well, this is the second time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leo, what's the period of time for it has to lay fallow before it becomes available under this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What's the timing of it?  Okay, that's a very interesting question. I think that you just have to, let me look and see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, how often do you have to, you know...  You don't have to re-up.  I mean, the point of what Larry's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think what they want to do is create a database that you could search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But there's so many things that are... I mean, that's in the internet age where it's so easy  to create something, that's just unrealistic. The internet is the database.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If a copyright holder does emerge later, you can, you know, he can pursue it. He just,  he can't seek punitive damages. So the statutory damages are over, which is really a big problem.  These damages are massive. You can claim reasonable compensation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is going to be very dangerous because a lot of copyright holders will, large, large archives  of work and the burden to catalog all this stuff and then submit it and, you know, it's going to  basically create all these ambulance chasing kind of people or people who try to basically  deliberately steal stuff knowing that the penalty is going to be low. We already have a massive  problem with people stealing stuff. We don't need to give them any excuse. Like people...  Well, before you use something, you have to file a notice of use with the copyright office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You have to provide whatever attribution information about the original owner you can find.  There is a special orphan works symbol that would be put on these uses.  So that if you see your picture used and it has this orphan work symbol, you have,  you know, you have some recourse to say, no, it's not an orphan works,  but you can't pursue statutory damages. Right. So if you took my orphan work, it was an orphaned,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I could basically say to you, you used it in a magazine, the normal use would be 750 bucks.  Yeah, you have to give me market value for it.  God, I could see this just overwhelming the copyright office with claims.  I don't see it that way. You know, you're making it sound as though people are out there looking

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to steal content left and right because they can. Well, in fact of the matter is this is mostly  about stuff that is known to be floating around in the public domain. It's not about, you know,  taking something from one of these, this guy from the Houston Chronicles of First World War,  this guy from the Houston Chronicles of photographer or illustrator, whatever he is,  who's they're all paranoid, those people, because they do get ripped off a lot,  but it's usually by the people, their publishers, but not by the, you know, somebody out in the  middle of nowhere. And if something became really popular, then it wouldn't be a big deal to,  to pay off the guy, you know, at the, at the normal market rates. The fact of the matter is  in publishing today, there's a lot of accidental plagiarism that takes place. You get a, you get  somebody that comes in and then they sell you something and you put it in. It turns out they  stole it from somebody else and you can't have any recourse. And then the original author comes  along typically in publishing. They, do you do a deal? There's no big lawsuit that's involved. If  you're not trying to screw somebody, then you, we had a definition in my telecom book that I wrote  back in the 1980s, that first one. And there was a couple of definitions in there that were apparently  taken from somebody else. And they went from hand to hand to hand and ended up in the book.  And so it was just in the glossary and the publisher, it was like a $10 deal. We gave  them a check and that was the end of it. I mean, that's the way it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. I don't know where I sit on this. I really want to hear from Larry Lessig. It sounds like  something that Larry is, it has been in favor of in the past. I mean, it's very clear. There are a  lot of great orphan works out there that are, that are nobody wants, but because of the copyright law  and part of the problem is that the copyright law, the Disney extension, you know, has gone on as  long as, you know, as Walt Disney asserts the copyright to Mickey Mouse, you know, that copyright  law will continue. So anything after 1924 is copyrighted. And a lot of, 90% of that stuff,  nobody wants or cares about. So, and it's not, but it's not in the, it's not in the creative  comments. It's not in the public domain. It can't be used by anybody. And that's what Larry's point is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I bet you there's a, I bet you there's a cost to filing that document, which then I would have  to agree with John's point. That would be a burden. Because that'd be a massive throttle,  you know, like nobody's going to steal stuff that they put in $150 or $400 paperwork.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, but on the other hand, artists are creating, oh no, are claiming, oh no, there's  going to be a price for registering our stuff. So that would put a burden on the rights holders  or maybe an unburdened, undue burden of diligence anyway, on the rights holders to protect their  copyright. You know, it's a, there are definitely two sides to this. It is, it is difficult. It's  something we have to address. And again, I think Larry, because he's the been the point man on this  stuff for so long. He's missed. He needs, we need him in the conversation. So when he gets back from  his month long vacation, he does that every year. Smart guy. Yeah. We will address it. Speaking of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  vacations, I gotta go to the zoo. Are you going to the zoo, the Sydney zoo? Yeah, I'm going to go,  or either that, I'm going to go to breakfast at Bill's, which is a famous place. I had breakfast  there yesterday. It was great. And I saw Mark Pesci, if you remember him from the internet.  Really smart guy. I had breakfast with him. He's down here. Is he living in Sydney now?  He's in Sydney and he does a TV show. That's like the, the dragon's den in England, where they do  like inventors and stuff like that. Oh, that's great. Yeah. So what? Yeah, it's great. Any tips

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  for Sydney? Cause I know you were here. I wasn't in Sydney. I was only in Tasmania and I'm sad.  I missed Sydney. I would have loved very much to see more of it. We have to do a twit road

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  trip at some point. I want to get awesome to get like four guys to go somewhere. Deal. And I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  that I know for a fact that we would be, we were invited to Australia to do that for sure. The

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  problem is getting all you guys to go anywhere. Six months ahead. I would make a trip out of it.  It'd be fun. It'd be fun. Me and John. You could have a cage match every Sunday. Share with share

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  a room with me. Two double beds. Yeah. And if it's okay with you, I'll carry your bags.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hey, we can take my dad if you want. Are you going snorkeling? Are you, is that what you're down

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  there? No, I I'm giving the keynote at seabed, which is sort of becoming a big deal down here.  And then I'm going to go for three days to the great barrier reef and dive the reef. So if I could  take him by a shark, it's been nice knowing you guys. It's been a blast. We'll call them one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, come on. We're not going to get that lucky. Do I get the card? I want the Tesla. I'm going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  leave my Tesla into John DeVore. Hey, what about me, man? My share shooter to Leo. Thank you. Thank

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just kind of miss Jason quitting the show so early because we're, you know, my little gauge  here on the name dropping dropped a zero and now the machine's not working as well. It's a counter.  You have a little counter. Yeah. Yeah. Every time he drops a name, sometimes it spins really  fast. You don't need to think is up to 150 tonight. Jason's a character. If you can just send me some  followers, John, because I'm only 52 ahead. What's the deal with that? How did Kevin Rose start  catching up to you? I'm at 17,000 by the way. And I thank everyone who's following me because now I

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  did. I found out I'm in some Derby. Yeah, we're in a Derby all together. If you go to Twitter,  hollick.com, they have a link to a Twitter. Hollick is one way to follow. It doesn't update  as much. I like Twitter, twi, t, w, i, t, d, i, r dot com, but Twitter, hollick shows you who's on  top. And there's a, they've started a hub dub. They've started a twit Twitter Derby. Kevin  is currently 67% chance to be the most followed by midnight, May 25th. He, you are, you only have  11% chance. I only have a 19% chance. I don't have a shot at Kevin. He's headed me by 10,000.  You're number three on this. Jason Calacanis has nine, no, he's number three. He has 19%.  Yeah. You have 11. Oh, wait a minute. I'm sorry. Jason has 2%. Robert Scoble is 1%.  Will Harrah is 0%. This is betting. People are betting on this. Yeah. I have to be like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  horse in the preakness. I don't know if you saw that race. Holy mackerel. We need a surge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It says John C. Dvorak coming from the back of the field and not the youngest in the pack,  but could be one to watch. Old horse. Well, hey, I'm, I'm, they say for me,  that horse, they said horse. This gray may be a late starter, but should demonstrate a powerful

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  finish. No, no, no. I think Kevin's going to take you. Well, he's bribing people. He's saying,  so is Alex. They're both bribing people. We're doing it legitimately. Well, I was thinking

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  of bribing people. I was, I'm feeling terrible now. I don't, I don't want to lose. Kevin's like,  he's like nipping at my butt now. I mean, what's he bribing them with?  I don't want to tell people. I'll tell them now. Cause I said he's bribing them. He's,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  why don't you just do the same thing up the end and make it two. Well, it didn't work for Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Remember Jason was trying to give away a Mac book air. Kevin says I'll give my old iPhone.  I'll give my iPhone away. My old iPhone away to some follower. When he gets a new iPhone. I think  that's lame. That's lazy. That's totally lame. And I don't know what is Alex giving away. What

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  do you get if you follow? He's giving an X-Box his old X-Box says give away used equipment. I mean,  they're getting people. Okay, I'll sign up. It's the Dignation crowd. Where's the tweet crowd in

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  all this? Don't you guys care? You're going to let Dignation beat us on this. Most of them,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  most of the tweet crowd, I don't think are Twitterers. They, they take the approach that  what is this? It's crazy. The kids love it. The Dignation kids love it. I don't, that surprised  me. Cause all the young people, older people use it. Yeah. It's mostly middle-aged people that use  it. That's what I thought. So I think the Twitter crowd is a bunch of old surfers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe that's it. Maybe I should give away a surfboard. Hey man, dude, they're drinking beer.  Twitter, Twitter. So what can I give away? I don't want Kevin to beat me.  Well, it has to be something big and interesting. You know, one of the things we're going to do on,  on Twitter Live, cause we did this when we first started tech TV 10 years ago,  Kate and I built the ultimate gaming machine, which in 1998 was a Pentium two,  three 50 with 128 megabytes of Ram. You know, it was like $12,000 cause we had a big widescreen  monitor. What if we built, I was thinking maybe for Twitter Live, we'd build the new millennium,  ultimate gaming machine and then maybe give that away to one of my followers. But don't I have to,  aren't there legal rules about content? Yeah, there are, but they're, they're not that hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to figure out and you can get a lawyer to help you out. These other guys are, I think, you know,  going to get thrown in jail. We can only hope. But anyway, but I'll tell you what,  if you want to opt the Annie on that, why don't we do it? So we have the main twit crew.  For one thing that we had, I want, I need some followers too. So I'd have to be part of this.  I'll never catch up. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, you want to be in that too. We'll do an autographed  case with your signature, mine, Patrick Norton. And then maybe we can trick Kevin into doing,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  signing it before he knows. Yeah, we'll do that. Don't tell me, don't tell Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll give the computer away to some, to the, some lucky winner that's chosen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So we'll choose at random from the following, the followers pool of Leo Laporte, John C. Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who else? I think that's just the, that's the two of us. Patrick Norton. We'll make Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Patrick's not in the Derby. It doesn't make, he's not in the Derby because this has to be by May

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  25th. Yeah. So you and me, baby, Jason can give away a Tesla. I mean, the best I'm going to do is  come in fifth, but at least it'll push me up a little bit on the, on the, on the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. You're really like down there. That's not, that's not right. That's not right.  Why I got a late start. You're a late starter. You're, you're, you're, you're, you're,  you're a mudder though. And if it starts raining, you're never going to be great.  All right, John, thank you very much. Dvorak.org slash blog. Everybody will figure this out. I like  the idea of building this thing and giving it away. So that's what we'll do. We'll give it away  to a follower on Twitter. So we'll choose randomly from somebody following either me or John,  May 25th. I don't know what the value of this will be. It'll probably be pretty valuable, right?  We're going to make a night. We're going to, and the way we're going to choose the components is  we're going to let you guys choose. So we'll be doing this on the air. You know, week one will be  the CPU week. We'll figure out which CPU week two will be motherboard and we'll work our way up and  we'll, we'll debate it. We'll hash it out with your help. So we'll figure out. So you're going to get  what the consensus agrees is the best gaming machine. We're going to build it. We're going to  make it work and then we'll send it to you autographed by everybody on Twitter. And all  you have to do to take this Kevin Rose, all you have to do is be following. Should I say,  but not following Kevin, should I say that? That would be really mean. All right. Colleen's egging  me on. So it'll be somebody who's following me or Dvorak. No, you have to follow both.  So here's the deal. I'm going to, I'm going to choose at random from somebody following me on  May 25th at midnight. I will choose a random name from one of those, whatever thousand people. If  that person is following Dvorak. Okay. If that person's following Kevin Rose, that's it. You're  out. And I go to the next person at random. And Alex Albrecht, if you're following Alex Albrecht,  no, sorry. You got to, you got to unfollow both of them. I think that's okay. It's a little  competitive. Is it mean? I don't know. I'm all alone here. Oh, you and me, Doug. I'm here. Do

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you want to, you want to be part of this Doug? Hey, listen, I picked up, I think 26 new followers  since we've been doing the, uh, yeah, I'm one of them. I didn't know you were on Twitter. I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
