It's time for Twit This Week in Tech,  the show where we talk about the week's tech news.  Sometimes we have a show where we know that the hosts,  the co-hosts, the people who join us in the show  have such strong opinions or so engaged  that we really need only a couple of them.  And this is one of those shows.  I am always thrilled to have these two on with me.  Christina Warren, film girl,  senior cloud advocate at Microsoft.  Just the greatest.  Hello, Christina, how are you?  I'm good, how are you?  I am so glad to see you.  You're off your travels for the day,  for the week, the month?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, a little bit.  I will be in Portland just doing some personal travel  next week, but I don't have any international travel  until November, so I've been enjoying basically  like the summer off.  I did so much kind of around the world stuff  the first half of the year  that it's been nice to kind of be at home,  even though summer, which is now over, Labor Day,  but it's been nice to not have to go anywhere,  to be honest.

Start time: 179.14
End time: 195.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You will see Christina at a lot of Microsoft events  all over the world, and she'll be back, I guess,  in November going all over the place.  So it's great to have you on.  Also from the UK, speaking all over the world,  joining us from the Packet Pushers Network,  our friend Greg Farrow.  Hello, Greg.

Transcript:  I should just do enterprise stories today, you guys.  She focused on .NET.  Actually, Microsoft is going to have a big event  October 2nd, do you go to New York City for that or no?

Start time: 247.10
End time: 249.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Start time: 249.10
End time: 251.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You probably don't, because this is the surface division  most likely, right?

Start time: 251.92
End time: 279.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this is the surface division.  I don't know anything about this.  To be honest, usually what happens is if I'm trying  to find out what's going on,  I ask my friends in the tech press,  because I'm not going to like,  the internal people aren't going to tell me,  which is completely fair.  So no, I'm just like anybody else watching from afar,  but I'm certainly excited because I'm a big fan  of the Surface devices.  I got my husband a Surface Go last year.  I love my Surface Go.

Start time: 279.82
End time: 288.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would love to see a little more juice in it,  but it's such a great little portable tablet.  It's about the size of an iPad,  it's running Windows 10, and it's just, I love it.  That's my go-to.

Start time: 288.66
End time: 299.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a great little portable machine.  Yeah, I would like one a little more powerful too,  and I would really love to see Surface laptops  with a Thunderbolt 3.  That would be like my kind of wish for Windows laptops.

Start time: 299.26
End time: 327.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You may get your wish.  There are kind of some rumors that that may be something  we'll see October 2nd.  The other thing people are expecting is a device  that was shown around Microsoft a few months ago  during internal meetings, codenamed Centaurus,  a dual-screen laptop-tablet hybrid.  I won't ask you, Christina, but I'll ask Greg.  What do you?  Yes, please ask Greg.  Yeah.  What do you, she's suddenly silent.  What do you think?

Start time: 327.62
End time: 328.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I genuinely have no idea.

Start time: 328.48
End time: 330.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No idea, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, okay.

Start time: 331.83
End time: 363.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not sure.  I think the challenge here is,  as somebody who's been using a desktop and a laptop  for 20 plus years, and I've sort of been,  I still very bitter about Microsoft.  After 20 years of using the rubbish products  like Microsoft Office and Microsoft Windows,  I just don't believe that Microsoft  will ever get these products right,  and they should all just be thrown in the bin,  and we should walk away and hope that something new emerges  that actually works.  We have a dissenting view.  I think, you know, 20 years of Microsoft rubbish,  it's, they've clearly never gotten the product right.

Start time: 365.80
End time: 379.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you know, it's interesting, though.  This kind of hardware, anyways, is new.  I mean, they've made mice and keyboards before.  They made a, famously, a DOS card for an Apple II,  but this is laptop computing and desktop computing.  That's kind of new for Microsoft.

Start time: 380.26
End time: 405.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I guess the thing here  is that Microsoft's bringing the bundle together.  Apple sort of proved the idea  that if you make the hardware and the software,  and then your absolute, and the trick here  is that Microsoft is now responsible  for actually making it work.  They can't blame the computer maker or the BIOS.  They have to take responsibility for it.  And then, so what we're actually seeing, in my opinion,  is Microsoft has to grow up  and make these products actually work  instead of just ship some trash that never worked at all.  I don't think they're trash,

Start time: 405.50
End time: 428.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but I do feel like Microsoft,  see, I don't want to give them a pass  because they're new to this business,  particularly the Surface Book, the first Surface Book,  which I had a lot of trouble with for six months,  and I think it was because it had a detachable screen  that had a GPU that was detachable,  which was kind of problematic for the operating system.  I felt like these were kind of newbie mistakes,  and I do feel like the Surfaces have gotten better.  We had a Surface Studio for a long time.  I like the line.

Start time: 429.28
End time: 447.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a $100 billion company  that's had 30 years of experience of doing everything wrong.  They never get it right,  and yet we always sit there and say,  oh, we'll give them another go.  But no, wait a minute.  No, wait a minute.  Like if you bought a car that was as faulty  as Microsoft Windows is,  you'd set the bloody thing on fire and send it back, right?  There's no evidence that Microsoft in the Windows.

Transcript:  Carson, help me, I'm in trouble.  Help me, Carson.

Start time: 450.22
End time: 469.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They are, they are starting to ignore the things  they're bad at and pay much more attention  to the things that they are really, really good at,  like enterprise software.  There you go.  Cloud software.  There you go.  They are really, really good at the enterprise.  Much better than any other good company.  They are not so good at personal computing.

Start time: 469.32
End time: 477.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't you think that they made a great pivot, though,  that Microsoft did a very good pivot,  and they are, in fact, no longer really the Windows company  or even the Office company?

Start time: 477.32
End time: 483.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look how many times.  They're the cloud company.  Azure is pretty strong.  In the past few big conferences.

Start time: 484.98
End time: 486.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they're a hell of a Linux company.

Start time: 487.40
End time: 538.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I guess the point, I agree with Carson here, right?  My point would be is that Microsoft's consumer division,  which makes Windows and Surfaces,  is just, as far as I'm concerned, a waste of time.  And you should just, I would much rather see  something else emerge to take up that space  that actually works and hasn't got 25 years  of baggage behind it.  Like, you know, as we've seen the Android and iOS  actually make products which work fundamentally reliably,  and yet Microsoft Surface or Microsoft Windows 10  is demonstrably incompetent by comparison.  So it's hard for me to get excited about a Surface thing,  Imigigi, that Microsoft's consumer division would pad out.  I think that you're right about Microsoft Azure.  I'm very excited about Azure.  I think they've done some good work there  to make that product actually work,  but it's pretty hard not to,  because they're on the hook for the whole thing.  There's nowhere for them to shift blame to,  so it's a different product market  and a different business focus.

Start time: 538.82
End time: 565.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The good news about the Windows ecosystem is,  I mean, for instance, I've replaced the Surface Studio  which I had here with the Lenovo,  which is about half the price,  and I think in many respects a better piece of hardware.  I like it a lot.  And again, Christina, you can recuse yourself,  this is the invitation,  we spent a long time on Windows Weekly  trying to figure out exactly what these Tron-like traces are.  It looks like it's a fragmentary version  of the Windows logo.

Start time: 566.10
End time: 597.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it kind of looks like  the original Windows logo.  There was actually a really cool, I thought,  kind of tie-in with Stranger Things, season three.  They did a Windows 1.0 release in the Microsoft store,  which was kind of cool.  Wasn't that fun?  Yeah, I loved that.  I thought that was really fun.  And so it kind of looks like the Windows logo,  the Microsoft logo.  Obviously, I don't know anything about this.  I don't want to comment.  I'm happy to hear everyone else speculate  to see what they think it might be.  But yeah, I mean, it looks like,  trying to kind of draw lines between things.

Start time: 598.56
End time: 620.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're taking a page from Apple's playbook.  Apple always sends out famously obscure invitations  to their events, and then gets two weeks of solid press  of people speculating about what Apple's going to announce  because of this.  We're pretty sure they're going to do a two-screen system.  I don't know if that's what we're seeing here.  I don't know.

Start time: 620.36
End time: 651.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  The one thing I will say,  and I don't want to be the resident Microsoft shill here  because that's not my role here,  but I do want to just stick up a little bit for,  I don't work on Windows, I work on Azure.  So thank you for the kind things you say about our cloud.  But I actually have,  I hadn't used as a day-to-day kind of device  or anything Windows for quite some time  until I joined Microsoft,  and I still primarily use Mac OS.  But I really do think that the surface line of hardware  is quite good.  And that's all I'm going to say.  I'm not saying it's perfect,  but I have a service book as one of my work laptops.

Start time: 651.08
End time: 656.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She gave her husband a Surface Go for crying out loud.  I did.  Either you don't like your husband  or you think the Surface Go is pretty good.

Start time: 658.12
End time: 665.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I bought it and I tested it out.  I wanted to see, oh, how good is this?  And then I gave it to him  because he actually, he broke his MacBook  and I was like, I'm not buying you a new MacBook.

Start time: 665.82
End time: 669.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  You gave your husband a Windows machine  instead of another MacBook?

Start time: 670.28
End time: 673.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He spilled stuff on it.  So this was his punishment.

Start time: 673.50
End time: 674.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Surface is his punishment.

Start time: 675.36
End time: 698.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it's funny.  He's actually, he's been a hardcore,  I switched him to Mac when we first started dating  and now he's gone full on Windows again.  But he loves that Surface Go  and it's a really nice little machine.  I think it's cute as hell.  I love it.  I wish it were a little more powerful,  but I think in terms of something that's that small  and that you can do almost everything with, it's good.

Start time: 698.62
End time: 707.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Another thing that we may hear at this Surface event  is a new stripped down version of Windows.  We're expecting them to announce it at some point  in the near future.

Start time: 709.32
End time: 741.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now this is really interesting  because this comes back to my argument  where if Microsoft took away all the stuff from 20 years ago,  you might have an operating system that's actually secure  and securable and modern and runs at speed  and doesn't waste battery and power, just pointlessly so.  So if this happens, then I'll actually be quite interested.  But at that point, Microsoft isn't innovating.  It's just copying what other people have done,  which is to say, if you're gonna build a modern networking,  a modern computing device,  start by throwing everything away  and building from the ground up.

Start time: 741.84
End time: 748.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Windows Lite is supposedly for this dual-screen display.  Go ahead. I'm sorry. The hard thing about...

Start time: 748.18
End time: 793.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What I was gonna say...  Yeah, the hard thing about starting over,  because I understand when you have 20 years of legacy,  and this is true whether you're looking at Mac OS or Windows  or even Linux to certain degrees,  is that you have legacy systems that you have to do.  I know, for instance, for the Windows terminal,  which they are in the process of rebuilding right now,  and it's actually really awesome.  It's gonna be modular and you can get it from the Microsoft Store.  And it's just in kind of previews right now,  but it's really, really awesome.  I was talking to that team at Build,  and they'd wanted to kind of replace some of that stuff  for a long time.  But the issue was, is that if they made changes  to some of the code, then certain machines that run like...  Oil reserve, like pipelines, would potentially crash.

Start time: 794.02
End time: 805.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This has historically been Microsoft's problem,  which is that they have had to keep legacy hardware  and programs working.  And they've always done a very good job of that.  No, they haven't had to.

Start time: 806.12
End time: 810.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've wanted to.  You could make a choice to step right.  I don't know, if you're running at Oil, Reagan,

Start time: 810.60
End time: 815.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  all of a sudden your Windows is gonna...  I was gonna say...  So you fork the operating system,

Start time: 815.32
End time: 825.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and you have Windows legacy, and you have the new Windows,  which is what you're talking about now.  There's gonna be a fork, and there's like old Windows,  insecure, you spend $1,000...  I agree, I agree.  Apple, Linux, these have had an advantage over Microsoft

Start time: 825.96
End time: 852.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because they haven't been in a dominant operating system.  And so Apple has been completely sanguine about saying,  sorry, your five-year-old machine's not gonna work  with the new operating system.  That's life.  Microsoft's already getting heat for Windows 7  not working in January.  That's more than 10 years old,  and people are already saying,  what are you breaking Windows 7 for?  So Microsoft is in a different position,  and that's because they're dominant, I think.

Start time: 853.22
End time: 881.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it made a business decision  to never fork Microsoft Windows.  It should have gone like, here's Windows legacy,  it's developed, it's got all the problems of Windows legacy,  it's awful, it's unsafe, it's insecure,  you have to run virus and malware scanning,  and you have to have scheduled backups,  it's gonna be not resistant to malware.  But over here is new Windows,  and we want you to start moving to that,  and let's start forking the two and going down the path.  And Microsoft's never made that decision.  And they have done this before successfully.

Start time: 881.88
End time: 893.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They have...  In their corner, they have done this successfully,  but once before, they split off and made Windows NT,  that turned into Windows 2000.

Start time: 894.58
End time: 908.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Microsoft actually, I think, is still a PTSD from that,  because they had two tracks of Windows  that were mutually incompatible,  and it was a nightmare for the company,  and they eventually re-merged them by choosing NT.

Start time: 908.26
End time: 912.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It wasn't a nightmare,  it was a natural industry progression.  It's just a dead customer.

Start time: 912.84
End time: 921.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, I think that they did not like the fact  that they had the Windows 98 track and the Windows NT track.  That was a problem for them,  and I think they decided to resolve that problem  by making NT the victor.

Start time: 921.92
End time: 931.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that Microsoft internally wasn't competent enough  to make the decisions that part of it wanted to stay with,  part of it couldn't make the decision to go forward.  Well, historically, they had to go through ME to do that.

Start time: 933.22
End time: 937.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They had to, their consumer,  their consumer fork had to utterly fail.

Start time: 938.34
End time: 971.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, honestly, this is historically  the problem with Microsoft, which is you had these,  and many companies get in a situation  where you have these little fiefdoms,  and you had the Office Group,  and you have the Windows 98 Group, or ME Group,  and you have the NT Group, and they all sniped at each other.  Nobody, the power that the Office Group had for a long time  was to keep the Windows Group from changing Windows too much  because it would break off, things like that.  And that is a structural,  it's an institutional issue.  And a lot, but it's not at all uncommon,  it's a very common problem.

Start time: 971.26
End time: 983.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very common, but let's call it what it is.  It's institutional incompetence, it's poor management.  It's dysfunction, yeah.  And it's perfectly natural, it's perfectly normal,  all big companies are stupid,  all big companies are inherently dysfunctional.  Let's give credit to Sajan Adela

Start time: 983.66
End time: 991.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because he came in a little more than five years ago,  and I think he fixed that problem.  I don't know, Christina, you work there, but my sense is-

Start time: 991.90
End time: 994.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wouldn't work there if he was not the CEO.  I think that's right.

Start time: 994.96

Transcript:  If Balmer was still there, it wouldn't be a good company.  I don't know if-

Start time: 998.40
End time: 1021.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, he fixed it by just saying,  Windows doesn't matter, so stop fussing about it.  Let's go over here.  Yeah, well, he was right.  Let's go and do Azure, right?  He was right.  And that's where the future is.  He was right.  And the people who are running the Windows  and the Office team and who are all going,  wow, wow, wow, my problems are bigger than your problems,  just got told to shut up and get on with it,  and lo and behold, the problem got solved.  This is what I mean.  Institutional incompetence is normal, right?  I'll be watching, I think we'll all be watching

Start time: 1021.84
End time: 1035.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  with interest on October 2nd  because if Microsoft does announce Windows Lite,  and I think there's a very good chance they will,  this is an opportunity for them  to answer your specific critique, Greg,  and say, this is the fork you were looking for.

Start time: 1036.62
End time: 1089.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right.  And the same way that Apple proved that iOS  needed to be completely different from Mac OS,  one for this, one for that,  and they've been able to run the two,  and now they're merging them back together,  which is, but notwithstanding,  they're doing it fairly progressively.  We're gonna go through a thunking.  Remember the old thunking, the old Windows 2 thunk layer?  We're gonna see something, Win 16 thunking.  We're gonna see that and that sort of thing,  but I do believe that Microsoft needs to bite the bullet  and bring its customers into 2015  and stop letting them run around  and pretend that 2005 is still here in 2019  and say, you need to start iterating,  you need to let go, and they've been doing it, right?  You look at what happened, they've taken, what is it?  Windows 2000 is end of life.  Windows, one of the big Windows releases  goes end of life in January.  That's one of seven.  Yeah, I don't follow the following news.

That's a very recent, that's from 2018,  and there are a lot of people who can't upgrade  to 1809, 1903, or the H2 version that's coming out  because their hardware, for one reason or another,  they don't support it.  I talked to somebody the other day who,  on the radio show, said, yeah, I have an HP computer.  It's 10 years old.  Now, maybe it's time to buy a new computer,  but he said, I can't go past 1803  because HP's not updating the BIOS.  Microsoft tells me I need an updated BIOS to go to 1809.  I'm gonna be out of support in two months.  I feel for the guy.  I know what you're gonna say, Carson.  Yeah, but it's a 10-year-old computer.

Transcript:  I was gonna just say, the one point I will make on that  is that, and I primarily am an Apple user,  but I can't think of a 2009-era Mac product  that will be able to run Catalina.  No, that's right.  And so I think that at a certain point,  I totally empathize and I feel like it sucks,  especially when it's something that seems  like it could be easily solvable, like a BIOS issue,  why you can't go from one version of Windows 10 to another.  There are going to be these edge cases.  But when you're at a certain point,  you have to have a cutoff somewhere, right?  So it's almost like we're having this,  we're having two parallel conversations.  On the one hand, we're saying,  you have to push people forward.  And then on the other hand, you're saying,  but when you push people forward,  people are going to say, but wait a minute,  I can't use my old stuff.  So there's, like, if you wanna move things forward,  then at a certain point, you have to maybe say,  okay, even if your stuff is still working,  the downside is you're not gonna be able  to run the latest version of Mac.

Transcript:  For right now, I mean, the interesting thing there, though,  is that with all the, some of the big distros  dropping 32-bit support, you'll obviously be able  to find some Linux distro that will still be there.  But I mean, there is the whole thing  with Ubuntu dropping 32-bit binaries.  They've backtracked on that because Steam hitched a fit  and the community was, we're gonna revolt.  But Canonical was gonna do that  with the very next version of Ubuntu coming out in October.  And it's, a lot of the Linux packages  are not optimized for 32-bit and aren't going to be.  There's also a big Python end-of-life happening.  2.7 to Python 2 is going end-of-life at the end of the year  and that's gonna impact a bunch of older packages, too.  So even though Linux is the thing  that everybody always goes to,  and yes, you'll be able to find specialized distros,  I'm sure, that will always be optimized  while for older hardware.  If you're looking at even the mainline Linux distros,  you're looking at Ubuntu, you're looking at Fedora,  you're looking at Red Hat, whatever.  But there's a difference.

Transcript:  Those are distros created by companies,  just like Microsoft, and the distros  that are kept up to date are not by companies,  but they're by enthusiasts and they say,  well, I want my old hardware to continue to run,  so I'm gonna make sure it does.

So at a certain point, obviously,  if you know what you're doing,  you can find a way to repurpose your hardware,  but whether it's Microsoft or Apple  or the major Linux distro.

Transcript:  And then, so let's go back to why  Microsoft hasn't abandoned Win32.  And the answer is they don't want to give  a competitor a chance to enter the market.  Because if they force customers,  like they are saying to customers now,  your 10 year old computer's no good,  there's a pretty good chance that they'll just  throw the computer out and go and buy an Apple iPhone  or an Android and then Microsoft in the consumer division  has lost that customer going forward.  And we've seen plenty of evidence of that  as the desktop market strengths of the service market.

Transcript:  I don't think that's the motivation.  Because I don't think Microsoft cares.  No, you're wrong.  Microsoft doesn't care about Windows at all anymore.  The motivation is, just as Christina said,  there's a nuclear power plant in Belarus  that's running 32-bit software.  And honestly, I think Microsoft  is being a good corporate citizen.  They're just saying, look, I understand,  you gotta have 32-bit, we're gonna keep supporting it  even though it's a security nightmare.  And I think they're not doing that for economic reasons.  I don't think there is a good economic reason for that.

And they have to bite the bullet and be pushed.  If they can keep going back to people like you and me  and saying we can't upgrade because wah, wah, wah,  they don't, they just sit there and put,  and as long as it's working, it's fine.  And that's the problem because we have an insecure internet

I don't disagree that this is a problem,  but this has been a problem that's been around for,  I mean, at least 20 years now  that we've been having this conversation  where older infrastructure, people will not upgrade  and will not pay for the price to rebuild  as long as it's working.  That they will have to be pushed, prodded,  and threatened with some sort of catastrophic thing to.

Now folks, you know what I was talking about  when I started the show and saying,  all we need is two.  That may even be too many.  Greg Ferro of the Packet Pushers Network,  Christina Warren from Microsoft,  who can definitely hold her own.  When Karsten said, we've got Christina,  and Greg, I said, stop, that's perfect.  That's perfect.  Say no more, say no more.  Our show today brought to you by our friends at ITProTV.  We've been with ITProTV since they first started.  Tim and Donna were great friends.  In fact, I had lunch with them last week  when I was in Orlando.  We're trainers.  They trained people to get the certs they needed  to get the IT jobs they wanted.  But they were doing it in a classroom environment.  They came to an NAB presentation I was part of  talking about what we're doing at Twitch, streaming,  and they said, you know, this would be a great way  to do IT training, and ITProTV was born.  They now have over 4,000 hours of on-demand IT training.  They're the official video training partner for CompTIA.  In fact, they have 12 CompTIA on-demand courses.  These are the most hotly demanded certs  like A+, Network+, and Security+.  They are amazing.  They are teaching so many people,  thousands of people now have gone through ITProTV  and got a great job.  Most of those people stay with ITProTV  because it's not now just for getting the certs,  it's for keeping your chops up so you can continue  to become a better and better IT professional.  You know, there's some stuff that ITProTV now is doing  that we've never mentioned before,  but I want to let you know about.  They can help, if you want to do training videos,  they can help you in your organization make your own videos.  They have an amazing studio they built in Gainesville  with robotic cameras, HD video, DMX lighting,  dimmable LED lighting.  They've got an overhead talkback monitor.  You know, the voice of God.  We don't even have the voice of God.  I always wanted the voice of God.  A direct live streaming system.  You can pick from multiple HD studios,  bring your own host, or use one of their great,  personable, smart hosts.  So from planning to post-production,  if you want to make for your organization training videos,  ITProTV is a great company to check out.  So I just want to throw in one more little thing they do.

I don't know if she knew something or something.  She said, I predict Thursday.  So that's it.  It's a week from Tuesday, it's September 10th.  That's kind of what we thought.  It'll be of course at the Steve Jobs Theater in Apple Park.  This is the invitation.  It's kind of a beautiful glass apple with all the colors.  They're gone back to the colors, haven't they?  The rainbow.

It's expected there'll be three new phones,  the successors to the low price 10R,  the medium size 10S, the giant 10S Max.  Will they be the 11R, 11 and 11 Max?  I don't know.  Lately they've been saying the 11 Pro,  and it does make sense because you got iPad Pros,  you got MacBook Pros, so that Pro line kind of would fit in.  They've never done that with the iPhone.

Transcript:  I'm less interested in the iPhone per se  as I don't think there's going to be a jump.  It's hard to imagine that there's a technology shift.  Nobody's doing jumps anymore.  Five to six, yeah.  And the six to the eight, there was a substantial jump.  If it gets half a millimeter thinner,  I'd actually be rather happier  if they put a bigger battery in it.  Me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you're gonna see that, Christina.  I do think you're gonna see that  because this is now the real battleground  is no longer phone, screen, fingerprint, touch ID.  The battleground is camera.  They are gonna do what Samsung did  a couple of generations ago at Huawei also.  They're gonna put three lenses in.  I love it on my Samsung phones  where I have a telephoto lens, a normal lens,  and a wide angle lens.  That's nice.  Apple is rumored not to be quite doing that.  They're gonna use the three lenses  to do more computational stuff.

Start time: 1907.52
End time: 1926.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what they've always done.  The two lenses is to try to kind of create that effect.  You could obviously switch between one or the other,  but they try to use them all together.  No, that'll be interesting.  Although what I'm hoping is if they do have the three lenses  that they will allow the APIs to be used  by certain camera apps.

Start time: 1930.68
End time: 1948.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I like that a lot too.  And that would be nice if they have those features  so that you could isolate them if you wanted to,  if you're using the right tools.  But I think that they like to err on the side of simplicity  and really just make it so that,  oh, we're going to give you the most perfect photo.

Start time: 1948.72
End time: 1957.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

End time: 1987.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And of course, you're going to see a Pixel 4 a month later,  and it seems to be that Google keeps leapfrogging  the camera capabilities of Apple.  Right after Apple announces all these new features,  Google says, well.

Start time: 1988.36
End time: 2090.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, because Google is so much further ahead  with the AI stuff, right?  I think that when it comes to the hardware,  Apple has historically,  they've been able to source the best sensors from Sony  and do really good stuff.  And for a really long time, they also had the best software.  They were able to really write the software  to make those sensors just do amazing things,  where you could have the exact same sensor  in a Samsung phone and an iPhone,  and the iPhone would give you better results.  But Google, because they are so much further ahead  with the AI stuff,  they are doing some really incredible things  on the software side that it's,  I think that honestly, this is one of those areas  where Apple's commitment to privacy hurts them,  because they don't use their user data the same way,  because they have this both public  and kind of internal kind of policy  about how they're using this information.  They don't have all those data points  where they can build models to do things like,  okay, we're going to light up darker images  and expose them so that you,  so it looks like you've got full light,  like the Pixel can, and to do even things  like a portrait mode and whatnot.  Like if you compare the AI portrait mode  on the iPhone XR and on the Pixel,  there's no comparison, the Pixel's significantly better.  And I think it's because Google,  because they have so many more data points  and because they're not opposed to using those  while they're building their software,  they're at a big advantage.  And so I'm interested to see what Apple's able to do  on that front.  I don't doubt that they have the engineering talent  to do amazing things, but I do wonder,  it's like, you know, Google does have this huge  treasure trove of, you know,  billions of data points from users who've been using

Start time: 2090.64
End time: 2134.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's overstated.  I don't think, I think that Google's much touted AI thing.  That's not as a competitive edge as people think.  Really?  I think it's, yeah, no, I think it's much more  about getting the software right down on the camera  and the control of the sensor,  but Apple's been very conservative  about the sensors that it buys.  And Google's been much more willing  to throw more resources, but-  The Pixel 3 had a dedicated AI chip for photo imaging.  Yeah, but correspondingly, the Pixel 3 is weaker  in a number of other areas.  It's the rounding out of it.  No, I agree with you.  Apple balances, Apple balances the photo,  like focusing on the photo capability ignores  dozens of other features of the phone that are just-  No, that's a good point.  The Pixel 3 for a long time closed out programs

Transcript:  So my point would be don't over rotate  on just taking photos because that's one of 400 features  in a smartphone that you want.  That's a good point, well taken.  I would be much more looking for wireless charging.  I'm very tired of lightning cables, super tired.  Well, Apple has wireless charging now.

End time: 2177.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they already have it.  X, the XS, yeah.  And what about the watch?  Watch is wireless, but you have to have a special puck.  And remember Apple tried to make the air power  and couldn't, but Mophie and others have done it.

Start time: 2178.52
End time: 2188.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would like to see the sort of the promise  that we got with wireless charging out of the last event  actually come out.  So Apple ships its wireless charger using an open stand.  Air power's dead.  Get with it, Greg.

Start time: 2193.17
End time: 2215.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm aware of that.  What I'm saying is the commitment was  they're coming with wireless charging,  but a couple of models of phone isn't the whole range.  Why isn't the, don't just have a charging pad  that all my devices go on.  I'm expecting to see new AirPods.  I think Apple's making a big commitment to wearables.  I think they see that everybody's gonna buy a phone.  It really doesn't matter what they ship.  They'll make good money out of it.

Start time: 2215.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I expect their way of growing their business  is to get more services,  but also to grow adjacent markets to their smartphones.  I think Apple's watches, AirPods, and iCloud,  the cloud services and so forth.  So I would expect at this event to see growth in watches  and AirPods and other accessories,  heart health accessories.

Transcript:  So you don't think that Apple has a disadvantage  because of its stated privacy policy compared to Google  and even Facebook and Amazon,  where these companies are happy to gather  all the information about you they can.  Doesn't that help them with their,  at least with their voice assistant?

End time: 2274.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't believe so.  I think you can hear the story that Google pushes  and you think that it's correct.  But when you go and talk to people who do DLMLAI,  they'll actually tell you that once the models are trained,  you don't need lakes of data.  The data lakes aren't actually all that relevant  and you can send it down.  So you don't need.

Start time: 2275.28
End time: 2285.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google even said that at Google I.O.  They said, we're gonna take these trained sets  and we're gonna compress them way down  and you're having it all on the phone.  And of course, that's what Apple's wanted to do  for a long time, which is all on phone.

Start time: 2293.52
End time: 2313.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was gonna say getting to that initial model  because I mean, the thing is, is that look,  Apple has finally started to publish things  in AI journals, which is great.  But Google, with TensorFlow,  I mean, I don't think it's arguable.  I think it's actually completely inarguable  that Google is very far ahead when it comes to AI  as compared to Apple just all out.  You know what I mean?

Start time: 2313.26
End time: 2325.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  From Google's point of view.  I'm not making that statement.  What statement that I'm making is  whether you've got a one petabyte data lake  or a hundred petabyte data lake  doesn't necessarily improve the models.  I don't disagree with that.  My point is I don't think the models on iPhone

Start time: 2326.08

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They bought Siri in 2011  and Google Assistant came out later  and Google might've been doing some voice up,  but they certainly,  it wasn't as if they were years ahead of Apple.  But I mean, even just looking in terms of like,  your data models though.  So look at Google Photos.  I don't use this,  but most iPhone users I know do.  Look at Apple Photos.  Some of the big features with iOS 13  and I joked about this like in June,  I was like, oh, finally,  Apple Photos is going to be getting  some of the same features that Google Photos  has literally had for years.  But if you've ever,  but I know even without using the final version of iOS 13,  it's not going to be as good as Google Photos.  Now I just personally don't like,  I don't, I feel weird trusting all my photos to Google.

Transcript:  I think Apple focuses on the 90-10 rule.  And if 90% of the people take a photo  and that looks good, we're done.  We just don't need to keep-  You're exactly right.  Nobody cares.  Quite honestly, I don't care.  I can take my phone out.  I can take a photo and it's perfectly good enough.  I don't, all these things that you're talking about  make no sense to me whatsoever  because I take a photo for my personal menu memories.  I do not expect to pull out Halide  and start adjusting the focus and the white balance.  All I want to do is take a photo of my daughter at dinner  and I'm done.  Right?  I don't think this camera matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  has a problem between this desire for privacy  and this ability to make Siri better.  And they just two days ago put out a press release  talking about changes they're going to make  in the way Siri gathers data.  They even say in this section here  how data makes Siri better.  They talk about the thing they got in trouble for,  grading, which is having humans listen to the requests.  And they said that there's a value,  but as a result of people's privacy concerns,  we realize we haven't been fully living up  to our high ideals and for that we apologize.  So they're not going to by default retain audio anymore.  Users will have to opt in to help Siri improve.  I think that's going to hurt them  because most people are not going to opt in.  And when customers opt in,  it will no longer be contract workers listening.  It'll be only Apple employees.  That's going to cost Apple,  but of course Apple has plenty of money.  So I think Apple is caught.  I think Apple put that big sign up at CES saying  what happens in your iPhone stays in your iPhone.  They got caught by the guardian because it wasn't true.  Credit to Apple.  They're going to improve Siri's privacy protections,  but I think that's going to hurt them.

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I was going to say-  I use it all the time.  Yeah, and what's actually funnier to me is that  I probably, it's like the more technical people that I know  probably use them less.  I see less technical people using Google Assistant  and using Amazon devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you've got a different audience.  That's actually what Christina was just saying.  The more-  That's kind of like a-  Because you have a more technical audience.

Start time: 2614.90
End time: 2671.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I was going to say more technical,  and actually what's interesting too is when I see kids  all the time interacting with them, very, very actively.  And that's interesting to me in the same way that touch,  we very quickly kind of, starting with the iPhone,  there's been this whole generation  that's been this touch first generation  where you see it, where they touch every screen,  whether it's a TV screen or a computer monitor or whatever,  they just expect to interact with it.  That way, I don't think we're quite there with voice,  but I'm starting to see more and more kids of,  especially younger kids who just immediately,  instinctively notice to start talking to their devices.  And I would use Siri more if it were better, right?  I use it to set alarms and I use it,  that's basically kind of what I,  and sometimes to play music,  but I wish I could use it for more things.  I just haven't been able to rely on it in so long.  Whereas I do use my Amazon devices for, to grab-

Transcript:  Here's some more stats.  This was from the podcast movement  we were at a couple of weeks ago.  Edison Research interviewed two different groups  of podcast listeners, long-time listeners,  they called them veterans,  and newer listeners, they called them rookies.  Of the veterans, 7% listen to podcasts most  on a smart speaker, of the rookies, 9%.  That's a larger number.  And I honestly, in fact,  I think what you're really seeing here is  fewer of the new listeners listen on computers  and more and more phones and smart devices.  And so I think voice, I honestly think voice is,  I think Greg, you're an outlier.

Including the new AirPods.  Including the new AirPods, including the watch,  including the iPhone, they all wireless charge.  Everything with the iPad.  The watch doesn't charge very well on TVX.  Do people want wireless charging?

Start time: 2759.20
End time: 2798.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Some people do.  I use it for, I wish it were faster.  I wish it were faster, right?  Like I have a pad on my desk at work  that I drop my AirPod case and my phone on.  If it were faster, I would probably use it more.  And I would say this, like I don't drive,  but I could imagine that if you are in a car  and you have like a Qi charger mount thing,  like I know Mophie makes them,  that would be really useful, right?  To be able to kind of wirelessly charge your phone  while it's in the car without having to have  yet another kind of plug hanging out.  But for me, it's the slowdown that's the issue.  But I see people using it all the time.  I just often forget that I even have it.  Like I said, I've got the pad on my desk.

Start time: 2798.88

End time: 2828.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so, yeah, so I just kind of plug everything in.  But at work, I finally found a use for that Qi charger  once I got the AirPods with the wireless charging case.  I was like, oh, that's useful.  I can just drop my AirPod.

Start time: 2869.76
End time: 2909.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I didn't say that it wasn't there.  What I was saying was that I wanna see more progress  around that front.  I think that we've had a good first effort  and I'd like to see more wireless  and instead of having to pay a hundred pound premium  for AirPods that support wireless charging,  it should be the default.  It shouldn't cost a million dollars.  I'm sure that's what's gonna happen.  And then as Christina says,  it should, can we get faster wireless?  Now I know there's perfectly practical technology reasons  as to why there's not, but you know,  I'd like to see that happen.  I also wonder if Apple will start to focus more on fitness.  People are very much in love with these rings  that monitor sleep and heart rate.  And I think that's a natural market for Apple to be in.

End time: 2958.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.  I think that I might've been dehydrated.  I'm getting some stuff checked out,  but it was, having the watch was amazing  for a couple of reasons.  A, I was able to run the EKG,  which even though it didn't detect anything,  it showed the sinus rhythm  and so the doctor was able to look at it.  B, it had the whole history of like,  because I started to feel it higher in my resting heart rate  when it was like 115, 120, I was a little concerned  and then it started getting higher than that.  Did you get the warning from the watch?

Start time: 2958.92

You're too young to have a heart attack, Christine.  I know, I know, and I didn't have a heart attack.  It wasn't that, we were not really sure.  It might've been some dehydration,  might be some anemia, who knows?  But I have an appointment on Tuesday.  It's gonna be fine.  But having all that data there.  If I had known this,

Transcript:  This is fun.  But genuinely, you know,  it's probably a bad thing for certain hypochondriacs  to have access to all your health information that way.  But for me, it was really beneficial.  And I wasn't, it wasn't one of those things  where I was even, like, it was funny.  When it got super high and we went to the hospital  and we were telling them, they were like,  were you freaking out when it was this high?  And I looked at my husband and he was like,  no, she wasn't really.  I was like, no, I was the calm one.  He was the one who was freaking out.  But having, you know, the history of all that stuff to show  I think is so important.  And even the doctor was talking about how great it was  that people come in now with this information.

She's very calm, relaxed, soothing,  and we could save Greg for somebody we want to wake up.  I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  She'll be fine.  Let's take a break, because actually,  I kind of buried maybe the most important Apple story of all.  Apple is changing its right to repair stance.  This is dramatic.  And we'll talk about that in just a little bit,  but first, a word from our sponsors.  Give y'all a chance.  Let your heart rate go down.  Calm down with the blood pressure.  Do you ever have panic attacks, Christina?  Because that sounds like it could have been a panic attack.

August 29th, two days ago,  Apple announced that they are going to allow  independent repair providers access to genuine parts  and Apple manuals.  This is something Apple fought tooth and nail.  Many states, almost 30 states now  have right to repair software in the legislature.  And Apple's been going to legislature  to legislatures to stop it.  But somebody sat up and said, no, wait a minute.  That's not us.  That's not us.  Jeff Williams, COO says to better meet our customers' needs  or make it easier for independent providers across the US  to tap into the same resources  as our Apple authorized service provider network.  When a repair is needed,  a customer should have the confidence repairs done right.  This is huge because it's the opposite direction  Apple's been going in for years.  Christina, are you shocked?  I'm shocked.

A million, a jillion years ago when I was in college,  I was a tech repair, PC repair person at Best Buy  and I was certified to work on Apple stuff.  And this is before we sold a lot of Apple stuff.  This is when they were still the power PC stuff,  the G3s and G4s and whatnot.  And the process of getting certified  to be an Apple repair person,  because this is when they only had a handful of Apple stores  was arduous and was complex.  And remember having to study this exam  and go through all these other things.  And so the fact that they're A, making this,  no charge to join and that you just have to be certified  that they're going to be offering the manuals  and the parts is massive because the problem has been,  regardless of your opinion on unright to repair  and some of the things that might be asked  and some of that legislation  or by some of the companies that are lobbying for that,  which I can kind of see the other side of and say,  this isn't necessarily fair.  You talk about a user base of what,  for iPhone alone is about 1.4 billion people  for iOS devices.  You're talking about people who don't all have access  to go to Apple stores or to existing authorized repair places.  And so you wind up getting shoddy battery repairs  or shoddy screen repairs or other issues.  And as we've seen with the recall  on the 2015 15 inch MacBook,  this can have major repercussions  if you need to get something switched out  and you don't have a place to go.  So I think this is great.  I'm shocked to see it, but I'm very, very happy to see this.  And I hope that this means that,  I hope this will make it easier for people  both to get legitimate parts and offer quality repairs.  I think the challenge is going to be now,  how do you make sure that where you're going  is going to be giving you good qualified service?  You know what I'm saying?

Start time: 3590.34
End time: 3603.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you'll go to an Apple authorized repair person.  If you're doing it out of warranty,  and that's the thing is, if it's out of warranty,  you don't wanna spend a lot of money on repairs.  That's who this is for, this independent repair provider.

Start time: 3603.82
End time: 3651.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think there's a few-  I think everything Christine said  is quite accurate and correct.  I think it's good that we have more choices  about where we get our equipment repaired  because Apple stores are not conveniently located  to everybody.  They're often in arcane places like town centers,  which are hard to get to if you happen to live rurally  or whatever like that.  So having, being able to get to alternative supplies.  What concerns me is that part of the reason  that Apple stopped letting other people do the repairs  was because of repair fraud.  So in China, particularly, there was companies,  what they would do is buy iPhones, open them up,  put cheap copies of the parts back inside,  and then send them back to Apple as faulty phones.  Apple would replace them under warranty,  and then they'd sell those parts as genuine, right?  So there was that, and apparently-

Start time: 3651.74
End time: 3656.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is a good way to address it,  which is to give you an opportunity to buy genuine parts,  which you didn't have.

Start time: 3657.54
End time: 3732.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly, right?  So there is a risk that you'll have  fraudulent repairs going on.  And the way that Apple's done it at the moment  is if you take it in to Apple,  then the repairs will always be of a known quantity.  Yes, they're expensive.  No, you don't have any choice,  but you know exactly what you're getting.  This opens them up for the risk of repair fraud  where people use non-genuine parts  to repair phones and blah, blah, blah.  Now, the second part about this  is also supply chain integrity,  which is a lot of these modern phones  are moving into secure enclaves  and chips that have security technologies,  like for example, the chip that does your thumbprint  is completely isolated from the phone.  And when you change that,  you actually have to have a piece of software  so that you can update the crypto key on board  and link it with the secure enclave  that's on the motherboard of the phone  and so on and so forth.  So part of what Apple's doing here  is actually taking the software  that enables those parts to work together.  So when you replace the board inside of an iPhone  and match it with a screen,  there's actually a security handshake between the two.  You can't put a third party element in there.  And the reason for that is because everything that's in there  is in theory hackable,  like we've seen with the baseboards  and the BMCs and the BIOS.

Start time: 3733.38
End time: 3830.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And we actually, they had an issue with that,  I guess it was three years ago  when they started having kind of faulty repairs  with the thumbprint sensor,  where if you, because a lot of times  what would happen is exactly what you said,  is that the secure enclave between the home button  and the screen are linked.  And so a lot of times what would happen  is that repair places that were not genuine  would replace the screen,  but keep the button the same  so they wouldn't have to go through that handshake again.  But if they did something else that might work at first,  and then there was an operating system update  that broke those devices and gave like a certain error code.  And there was a bunch of pushback on that  and Apple eventually issued a software update  that overcame that.  But yeah, I mean, this has been something  they've been grappling with,  where obviously they had these secure enclave parts  of the devices that they wanna protect  that are very important to kind of the integrity  of the phone, but you've been in this catch-22  where you either have access to the official parts  or you don't.  I still think the biggest issue comes down  to a lot of it, consumer education.  And I mean, I agree with you,  they do, they're going to be running the risk  of having some like fraud in terms of repair  and parts and that sort of thing.  But hopefully this could be the sort of thing,  at least my hope is that if you have more places  that are authorized and that can buy the authorized parts,  then you limit, I guess,  the A, the likelihood of people having bad repairs,  which does actually become a hazard,  not just for individuals, but for everybody around them,  but also making situations like replacing  the fingerprint reader or something else.

Start time: 3831.82
End time: 3885.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My point is that there's two sides to this argument.  There is the right of people to repair the systems  and to make them good, but the other side is Apple  has demonstrated commitment to protecting their brand.  And part of that is to make sure that the parts  that are in the gear are secure and safe  and haven't been compromised,  which is something that we've seen in the Android land  where people take phones in and they come back  riddled with malware, right?  So just be aware that opening up the repairs  opens you up to a security risk, albeit,  and this is why Apple is keeping it very closed,  approved repair centers, people will be issued with software.  That software will have to have a supply chain  because if those people plug it in  and that secure enclave gets linked to that motherboard,  then that has to be, this is not just let them buy parts  and fix it, it's a little bit more complicated, I think,  than most people would think until you start  to understand some of the pieces.  That's what I was trying to highlight with my points.

Transcript:  Well, those pieces may cost 15% more as of midnight today.  The US tariffs have gone into effect September 1st.  They've been deferred to December 15th for laptops  and phones because the Trump administration  doesn't want to quote, hurt the holiday buying season,  but they are already in effect now for other parts  that come from China, including this will affect Apple  AirPods, Apple watches, headphones, some IMAX,  the HomePod, and parts, the kinds of parts you get  to repair these devices, those are all going to be affected.  And it's not just Apple, of course, it's any company  that imports parts or products from China.  15% now, December 15th, I think it goes to 25%.  So.

Start time: 3942.18

Transcript:  I think this is going to be interesting.  What we're seeing in enterprise IT  is all of the major IT companies are shifting their,  they call it production to Vietnam or to Indonesia.

Start time: 3954.34
End time: 3968.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's exactly what Apple's doing.  Yeah.  They're not bringing them home to the United States.  No.  Well, because.  It's another country.  The problem is tariffs can chase you everywhere.  They can go anywhere you want.  So.  So what they're not actually doing

Start time: 3968.14
End time: 3993.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is they're not actually producing them.  They're not actually setting up factories.  They're doing the final assembly phase.  So the actual parts and everything  is still being made.  So it goes back to, I don't know if you remember  the trade wars of the 1970s and the 1980s,  but there was all these ways of saying,  we had import tariffs on things and all this sort of stuff.  And then people would ship the prepped unpacked,  like the unassembled and it would go to somewhere  and then it would be assembled.  There's always ways to game this stuff.  Oh yeah.

Start time: 3993.58
End time: 4054.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I mean, Apple's a great example of this.  Even before this trade war stuff,  exactly what Greg is talking about.  They've had this process set up for years now.  This is part of Tim Cook and now Jeff Williams's brilliance  where they have all the parts kind of brought into  where if they need to be brought in,  they're assembled in a certain area  where it's kind of like this almost like tax-free  kind of jurisdiction place where they do the assembly  and then they ship it out from another place.  It's just a maze of loopholes  to make things as cost efficient as possible.  And so yeah, exactly.  It's not as if the stuff's not still gonna be made in China.  It's just gonna be assembled in Vietnam.  Similar to kind of, India has been a little bit different,  but that was one of kind of the first ways  people were trying to get around  some of the various Indian tariffs,  which was, okay, we will do everything,  but the final assembly in India  and be able to say that this was a made in India phone.  India has made some other provisions  that make that more difficult,  but yeah, I mean, this is what's gonna happen.  China is still gonna be the hub,  but they just assemble in Indonesia.  So the question is whether prices

Start time: 4055.10
End time: 4067.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for these products will go up.  And I think in the case of Apple,  Ming-Chi Kuo's predicting,  and I think he's probably accurate,  at least initially Apple will absorb the cost.  There's enough margin in their products  and the products are so highly priced.

Start time: 4068.42
End time: 4189.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a reflection of the political environment,  which is unpredictable.  We don't know if the tariffs are gonna come in or come off.  The way that the current US government is negotiating  is it says something and then it unsays it  and then it comes back again  and is using that as a negotiating tactic.  I'm not gonna comment on the politics.  I'm just saying this is where the situation is.  I think the challenge here too is also  that a lot of these companies set up supply chains  that are running just in time.  The car factories, for example, in the UK,  they carry four hours worth of stock  and they literally have this consistent delivery cycle.  And the factories that are working in China  have the same thing.  So now if you're gonna pick up the goods  and then trans ship them from China to Vietnam  for assembly to get to the US market,  what you have is a much more complex supply chain  and your ability to react to your orders.  It matters less for Apple,  which is usually shipping in such volumes  and has the money to have very strong discipline  around the supply chain.  But in terms of enterprise IT,  where we're buying small numbers of high value goods,  which is where I operate,  the risks are that you suddenly have a situation  where the American market has products  that are 15% more expensive and the supply chain is messy.  Things aren't in stock or modules aren't in stock  for short periods of time  because they have to go through Vietnam  to avoid the taxes or whatever.  Or you have some things which have extra costs  out of balance with the other thing.  So you buy a module that's not got the tariff on it.  And then over here in Europe,  we have a different situation where we pay VAT,  but we don't pay the tariffs  and there's gonna be an imbalance.  And the market's gonna shift.  You might see something that used to happen a lot  when I was a young IT person,  where we would buy stuff in one company,  in a US operation,  and then get them to freight it out to us in Australia  to bypass the taxes, the tariffs.  Yeah. Yeah.  So it is an interesting impact.  It's gonna mess up the way that we buy goods  from the consumer market and also in the business market.

Start time: 4190.20
End time: 4264.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I was gonna say,  I mean, you opened some really interesting things.  You make great points about  what'll happen in enterprise IT.  I think in the consumer space,  I think at least in the short term,  I don't see prices going up,  but it really depends on how long this goes on, right?  Because historically I know that Apple has actually,  both when there have been UK things  and various like taxes, tariffs,  and other back concerns also in Australia,  and based on varying prices of the dollar,  where they've had higher prices there because of that.  So if you were to do even just the currency conversion,  the prices would still be on average higher.  And a lot of people in those countries would complain  and you would see a lot of people,  like a lot of my UK friends would come to the US  to buy their Apple products  and then smuggle them through the airport and whatnot.  I could see,  it becomes a difficult political position for Apple,  but I could see,  but it becomes one of those places where if this becomes,  if the administration is insisting on continuing  this sort of trade war and going back and forth  and making blunderous decisions,  and if these prices are, if these tariffs are sustained,  companies like Apple could be considering and saying,  okay, well, we're gonna have to raise our prices in the US.  And that makes a certain political statement too, right?  I think they won't.

But I'm saying if this were to continue afterwards,  then I could see a realignment.  And then you could almost,  you could see kind of the almost a political push to say,  well, we have to raise prices because this, this, this,  and this, because that has been something they've tried to do  in other countries before.  And in this case, if enough big, you know,  consumer brands, values together against that,  that would be a powerful kind of statement, I guess,  to the administration.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Just, I mean-  You could build a wall with it, I guess.  You gotta remember that a tariff is a tax.  It's a tax, and it goes to the government coffers.  I do wonder, you know, you're facing an election season.  And here, you know, the government is going to have  somewhere between 100 and 250 billion extra dollars  in revenue that isn't a tax, nominally,  but it is a tariff and, you know, whatever.  It does seem, it strikes me that this is something  that could be used for various purposes.  I've just never seen anybody ask that question,  and I'll be interested to know.

Transcript:  Oh, please.  Now, let's move on, because it is often presumed  that the iPhone is somehow magically more secure  than Android devices, and maybe it is,  but Project Zero at Google discovered  a very interesting iOS exploit chain.  Five separate, complete, and unique iPhone exploits  covering every version of iOS from 10 to 12,  the most recent version, and these chains,  they discovered, were being used by websites  to hijack iPhones in drive-bys.  So, and then there's some question about  what these websites, but according to  the Google Project Zero blog,  they discovered sites have been using these chains  for years to hack iPhones as they drive by.  Little bit later, the next day,  TechCrunch had this story, sources say,  China used those iPhone hacks to target Weger Muslims,  and that's an interesting use of this.  It was a state-based attack.  I don't know how many Wegers are using iPhones.

Start time: 4428.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And this was the same group that they were forcing  when they were coming through the borders  to install Android software,  that they could spy on them, right?  That's right.  That's the same thing.

Start time: 4436.12
End time: 4453.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, the company that was going into China,  in that area of China,  was compelled to install spyware on their phones.  I think this is an example of how these exploits are used.  I presume that Apple will button them up  as soon as possible.

End time: 4463.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The patch story. Yeah, they have already.  Yeah, I'm assuming that if they've been,  like, disclosed that they've already been patched,  but that's, it's still really interesting.

Start time: 4470.76
End time: 4507.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so there's really no way of knowing who was doing this,  but the researchers said the attacks  were indiscriminate watering hole attacks.  In other words, not targeted,  but TechCrunch says they have evidence otherwise.  One of the sources told TechCrunch  the websites infected non-Wegers  who inadvertently accessed those domains,  prompting the FBI to alert Google  to ask for the site to be removed from its index  to prevent infections.  So, some leak on this.  You know, it's a fairly sophisticated attack.  It requires daisy chaining a variety of exploits,  one after the other.

Start time: 4510.20
End time: 4543.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the interesting part,  the thing that struck me about this is,  although it's fairly shocking to find a series,  like there's a half a dozen  zero-day vulnerabilities attached here,  is that it must not have been widely propagated  or impacted people,  or it would have come to light sooner.  So, they must have kept it very much on the quiet,  and even though it was a watering hole,  they must not have widely spread it, if that makes sense,  because people would have seen it  if it had have gotten into a mass outbreak.

Start time: 4543.46
End time: 4549.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  A watering hole attack is that the website is there,  and people would come to it.  The point is that you have to generate,  people have to know about the watering hole to hit it.  And these are semi-random webs.  The hinted in the Google blog post is,  these are not websites that you and I would go to.  You would have to have a specific reason for going to them.  So, in the sense that it's a watering hole attack,  in that it's just an open website,  but you still gotta get people to come to the watering hole.  They have to know the watering hole is there.

Transcript:  Right, honey pot more than a watering hole.  The Project Zero blog does imply that they say,  real users make risk decisions based on the public perception  of the security of these devices.  There's definitely a widespread perception  that Apple devices are somehow magically more secure.  Even Phil Zimmerman, the creator of PGP,  says I can't use an Android device, it's not safe.  That's why I use an iPhone.  But Google points out the reality.  The fact remains, security protections  will never eliminate the risk of attack,  and this is the important part, if you're being targeted.  To be targeted might simply mean being born  in a certain geographic region,  or being part of a certain ethnic group.  All that users can do is be conscious of the fact  that mass exploitation still exists and behave accordingly.  Treating their mobile devices as both integral  to their modern lives, yet also as devices,  which when compromised can upload their every action  to be potentially used against them.  Those are kind of chilling words.  Go ahead, Christina.

Start time: 4643.24
End time: 4759.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, what I was gonna say is what's so interesting  to this to me is when you look at these various chains  and you see the OS versions,  and you see what models are impacted,  it really does kind of, the time period,  the vector where it is potentially available  gets shorter and shorter.  So by the time you get to chain five, for instance,  you have a fairly limited window.  But it's still, you're not talking about  the old model phones, right?  Which is typically what we see in even these targeted attacks  where what we've kind of told people,  and obviously if you're being targeted for a reason,  it's a little bit different ball game,  but the general advice we give to people,  regardless of what mobile operating system you use,  is to get the latest updates.  And Apple users tend to be better than most  updating their software and getting the latest versions  more quickly.  But what's really kind of, I guess, scary to me about this  is you look at this and you see how quickly  they're able to get these other chains up  to impact the other devices that are on the market  so that they can continue to do those exploits.  It's also interesting because the IOS,  the jailbreaking community has basically died down  because it's been really hard to kind of exploit things,  with the exception of China,  where all the active kind of activity in jailbreaking  still remains is in China.  And that I don't think is a coincidence.  And I think that obviously you have two different sides  there, you have some people who are enthusiasts  and are trying to do things for their own purposes  and maybe creating malware for other purposes.  But then you do also have, I think the idea  that maybe you have state sponsored or targeted  attacks that might be done,  that might be not as widespread as we see here  in the Western world,  because that's just where a lot of that  reverse engineering has really become concentrated  at this point, which is interesting.  There's a big financial effort,

Start time: 4760.56
End time: 4790.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  very financial effort in China.  People find paying $5, $10, $20 US dollars for an app  very difficult.  And so there's a substantial effort over there  to break apps or to sideload apps onto your phone  so that you don't have to pay for them.  And so there is also just a straight out cultural issue  where in a country where $20 US dollars  is a substantial amount of money,  side jacking or side loading or hacking your iPhone  or breaking your iPhone is highly desirable.

Start time: 4791.88
End time: 4819.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the good news is Apple was made aware  of these problems.  Google says we reported these issues to Apple  with a seven day deadline.  Usually there's a 90 day deadline,  a seven day deadline, the first day of February,  which is why you may have noticed an out of band iPhone patch  on February 7th, that was 12.1.4.  So the good news is yes, as you pointed out,  these have been patched.  The bad news is that they existed for years.

Start time: 4820.18
End time: 4841.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, but again, if they had have existed for years,  we would have seen, and they were being exploited widely,  we would have seen that.  And or somebody would have, the general,  the reasonable assumption is we would have noticed  and it would have been discovered.  That's not to say that nobody got infected  or that people were not, no one got compromised.  It's just to say it's not a massive risk, I suspect.

Start time: 4842.64
End time: 4887.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it's probably, you're probably right in saying  that it's not a massive risk.  I do think though that it's something  that we should be considering, not just, you know,  looking at China, but looking at other nations,  including the United States where, you know,  it is very common where you will have  security organizations, things like the CIA,  who will hoard zero days and will have vulnerabilities  that they might have access to for years to access things  just because we don't see widespread uses of it  doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.  So to me, you know, looking at this  and seeing that this exists makes me think  there are probably more of these things out there,  not just for iPhone, but for other very popular devices  as well that we don't know about because by design,  they are being hoarded and they're probably-

Transcript:  Yes, precisely.  And that, you know, because one of the big questions was,  why can't you do this?  And one of the arguments from many of the experts was,  well, hey, you know, ask the CIA,  they have access to a lot of this stuff.

Start time: 4918.26

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So in a way, this is interesting because yes, it was,  it sounds like it was in fact a targeted attack,  but it could have been a watering hole attack  had this government decided to use it that way.  But as is often the case with governments-  We don't have the information.  They keep it secret so that they can use it in targeted,  important, surgical ways.

Start time: 4938.62
End time: 5027.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of the interesting things is there's websites out there  like VirusTotal, which can, you know,  where they have a list of known malware or known attacks.  And what's happening now is the government, you know,  the UK government, European governments,  and the US governments,  once they know that the cyber weapons,  if you want to go with the terminology,  has been compromised or they know that their opponent  has a particular weapon, they'll upload it to VirusTotal  so that the weapon is dead, right?  So once it's exposed and everybody knows about it.  So we are seeing a much more mature attitude.  Once upon a time, they would never have released it  until somebody in the community found it  and then it would have been burned.  Now what they're saying is, well, if our opponents have it,  we might as well burn it so nobody has it.  So there is a very much a,  that whole security industry is very difficult to discuss  because it's very nuanced.  Attribution is very difficult  because you don't actually know, like, for example,  because Google hasn't given us the websites,  we can't draw conclusions that there's watering holes.  Are they watering holes or are they honeypots?  Because if we could see that they were specifically targeted  with content for a particular audience,  you asserted that that might've been the Wigos in China.  It could be, you know, they could be using the same thing  for people in Hong Kong for what we know.  Whoever, could have been the Russians targeting people  in Eastern Europe, in Ukraine.  There's an undeclared war going on in Eastern Ukraine still.  So until we know those sites,  you can't state with any certainty  that a watering hole attack or a honeypile attack.  But quite honestly, when it comes to security,  I'm much more worried about conferences  and where people go who have measles.  Did you see that?

So as somebody who travels a lot  and somebody who I used to go to a lot of conferences  and now I don't,  this is one of the reasons why I've stopped  because this is actually a problem.  So for example, Auckland in New Zealand  has 800 cases of measles in that town.  Now that is the capital of New Zealand,  but New Zealand only has a population of 3 million.  They are actually fully stretched to code.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by LastPass.  Hey, October 3rd, we're gonna be in Boston.  Steve Gibson and I are gonna do an event  with LastPass's CISO and the legendary Bill Cheswick,  the guy who invented the firewall at Bell Labs.  And we're gonna be talking about authentication,  the problem with passwords.  It's gonna be a lot of fun.  More details about that event to come.  LastPass is our host.  And of course, nobody knows better.  The problems with passwords,  and LastPass is really the cure to many password problems.  Someday we won't need passwords,  but we live today when we do.  Lots of them for lots of sites, lots of apps.  And of course, the number one risk with passwords  is reusing passwords.  Actually, probably the number one risk  is using monkey123 as your password.  Then you compound it by using monkey123  on every site you visit.  Now you're really in trouble.  LastPass protects people with a great password vault  that's fully encrypted, only decrypted on your device.  It runs everywhere you are.  First thing I install when I set up a new phone,  I set up a new computer, whether I'm using Linux,  Windows or Mac, I install LastPass,  because all my passwords are in it.  All you have to do is remember a master password.  And here at Twit, we use LastPass Enterprise  because we know people are people.  They do silly things with their passwords.  And in this case, our employees have passwords  to the most important things in our business,  our bank accounts, our websites, our databases.  And if they're gonna have access to those,  I wanna make sure we're giving them access  in a safe, sane way.  LastPass Enterprise is getting better.  They just set up an expanded business lineup  with some amazing features that will do something  that normally in security is impossible.  It'll make you more secure  and your users will have more convenience.  How is that possible?  Well, let me explain.  LastPass Enterprise is now using single sign-on  for 1200 plus SAML integrated apps.  And you don't have to worry about training  because each has its own getting started guide.  So it's very easy for your users to set it up.  The nice thing about single sign-on is  they don't even use passwords.  They just do an approval on their phone  and it's all good to go.  I love this.  Google and Microsoft has started using this.  Now you can extend it to over 1200 apps in your business.  They're also doing something I really like  called multi-factor authentication.  It leverages biometrics like your face or fingerprint  plus contextual factors like location or IP address.  It goes beyond what two-factor can do  to really guarantee that the people  who are using your stuff are the people  you expect to be using your stuff.  True authentication with LastPass MFA.  They call it LastPass identity.  It combines LPE, LastPass Enterprise with LastPass MFA  from single sign-on and password management  to adaptive authentication.  LastPass is great for the IT department  and it's great for users.  Frictionless access all in one simple secure solution.  I put everything in LastPass including by the way  my social security number, my passport.  When I travel, they used to say  bring a copy of your passport.  I do but it's in LastPass.  So it's super safe, super secure  but I've got it wherever I go.  And of course it's great for online shopping.  LastPass will fill in the credit card number automatically,  fill in your address book.  Don't trust it to your browser.  That's not secure.  Trust it to LastPass.  We use LastPass Enterprise at Twitter.  I use LastPass families at home.  I'm very excited about the steps LastPass is taking  to take us into the 21st century.  Beyond passwords, I think you will too.  From authentication to access to passwords,  LastPass manages every entry point to your business  so you can mitigate risk while improving  employee productivity.  We're big fans.  I know you will be too.  Learn more at lastpass.com slash twit.  Lastpass.com slash twit.  Maybe the single sign on, you know, this is so easy.  I think a lot of people will be using it.  It's just a great way to go.  I love it.  So you posted a little something.  I think this is gonna stimulate some conversation  from the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  Don't play in Google's privacy sandbox.  Google has been modifying Chrome significantly  to make it safer.  But one thing they don't wanna get rid of is cookies.  This is kind of controversial.  Cookies, especially third party cookies,  are the number one tracking technology.  But Google says blocking third party cookies,  which every other browser does,  will hurt user privacy.  It's gonna break the web.  It's gonna be terrible because instead,

Start time: 5494.66

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you know, actually, it's kind of,  I've gotta give them credit.  Their rationalization is sort of brilliant.  It's complete BS in my opinion.

Start time: 5503.34
End time: 5506.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's sort of brilliant.  EFF calls it privacy gaslighting.

Start time: 5506.82
End time: 5555.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it's complete gaslighting.  But I have to say, it's sort of brilliant  because what they're saying is they're like,  if you block these third party trackers,  which are so invasive in this and that,  even more invasive trackers like fingerprinting and pixels  and this and that will be used.  So please, let's use this thing that we know  and accept is bad, but that we can block  and not these other things that are much harder to.  It could be worse.  Yes, it is security gaslighting.  It is hilarious.  But I mean, I have to give them credit.  Like, I mean, I personally, as I said,  in my opinion only, and I'm speaking for myself,  I'm not speaking for any employers or anybody else.  This is just me speaking.  I think it's total BS.  But I also, I have to kind of applaud them  and be like, you know what?  That argument is really brilliant.  Oh, I know, it's outright evil.  That is great.

Transcript:  It is outright anti-vax.  This is literally anti-vaxing on browsers,  taking a tiny little claim of truth  and blowing it into the entire truth  and ignoring all the false words around it.  It's absolutely taking privacy  and turning it into anti-vax and saying,  you don't want privacy because, blah, blah, blah.  The good news is you have a choice.

Start time: 5578.78
End time: 5605.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, there are very good, I use Firefox,  which not only blocks third-party cookies,  but also attempts to block fingerprinting.  I don't know how complete its blocking is,  but it's built in there.  I always turn off the trackers,  like the Facebook like button and the Twitter sign in.  There's lots of things you can do  to improve your privacy online.  And I also understand that Google,  which is the world's largest ad agency,  doesn't want to do too much of that.

Start time: 5606.12
End time: 5670.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's actually not Google in this case.  It's Google's customers.  So people who go up to Google's ad system,  they use that to track you as you move around the web.  And if, so if you go and read the WebKit security policy  or the Mozilla security policy,  I'll put some links in the show notes there.  They actually state quite clearly  that they are going to take active steps to block tracking.  They are actively going after anti-tracking.  They will block cross-site tracking.  So this idea that you go to the verge  and they lay down cookies for about 40 or 50 sites  in your browser, and then you go to another one  and those cookies track you as you go around the web.  It's a combination of one pixel cookie  and all this sort of stuff.  We know all about that.  And they ID you.  And then if you suddenly go from the verge to a store  and you put something in the cart,  but then you walk away and go to another site,  then they contact you and say,  you've left this in the cart,  why don't you come back and buy it?  Or they track you as you go from a review site.  And those review sites live by these.  Well, that's okay.

Start time: 5670.62
End time: 5687.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there is an issue here,  which is a lot of the web is monetized this way.  A lot of the web is free because of that.  Isn't it the case that if we break too many of these systems  that, I mean, I know sites are going out of business  right and left.  Totally.

Start time: 5687.84
End time: 5736.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's free in the sense that people don't know.  The problem is that the ordinary human doesn't understand  where the money pays for that review.  And they don't understand that.  It's like when you go to a car yard  and you negotiate with the car dealer to buy a car,  you know where the commission is  and you know where the money's coming from.  When you go to a review site,  ordinary people don't understand that these people  may be making recommendations on the bunch,  on the back of the fact that they're getting a spiv  or a kickback, right?  And the amount of monitoring,  it's like if people knew that when you walked into Walmart  and then you went around the road to the target  and then you went around the road to the next shop  and the next shop,  and each one of those shops knew exactly where you went  in each store and every item that you picked up,  they would be horrified.  And that's exactly what's happening on the web.  Well, which was honestly-  Go ahead, Christine.

Start time: 5736.62
End time: 5742.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which people have tried to, well, I was gonna say  what you just described was beacons,  which is something that they, you know, companies have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 5747.76
End time: 5754.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely, and iBeacon is a thing and big stores do it.  I mean, this is, they're very much,  if they could do that, they would.

Start time: 5754.16
End time: 5754.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're trying to.

Start time: 5755.62
End time: 5815.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, there are active industries,  like, you know, sub industries within, you know,  like a retail that are dedicated strictly to that purpose.  And so if they can get people to do that, they would.  And I agree with Greg to a certain extent  that people will be horrified.  I also think that it's one of those issues  where we're in this place right now,  which I think is really good,  where people are getting freaked out about privacy  for good reasons.  And the pendulum has swung for 10 years or so.  Everybody was pretty willing to just be like, eh, whatever.  And now people are getting really freaked out about it.  I do think that it's important in some cases  to be understanding about,  and I'm not saying this is what Google is doing at all,  because I actually am in disagreement  with their rationalizations,  but understanding the differences between things  like first-party cookies and third-party cookies.  And I'm not going to take a hardlining value  and say that all analytics and all tracking  and all telemetry is bad,  because that would make me a hypocrite.  My past life as a journalist,  Yeah, you worked at Massable.

Start time: 5815.52
End time: 5817.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Massable exists because it was free.

Start time: 5818.52
End time: 5851.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Well, and advertising, some of it's direct ad deals,  some of it's other things,  but even beyond that, knowing what people click on,  knowing what people like,  knowing what content is doing,  that's valuable information.  Now, I personally, even for my own personal websites,  I would like to know that.  I don't need to know any information  about the people themselves.  I don't want to have something that's linked  to some profile that could be  personally identical information, right?  But it's not, I'm not going to make an argument  that where I'm going to be a hypocrite and say,  it's not useful for me to know  what countries people visiting my website come from  or what content is most popular.

Start time: 5851.96
End time: 5886.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there's a difference between first-party analytics  and third-party analytics.  I agree with you.  So I went on and researched this a little further.  And what I've discovered is that there are businesses  out there building business intelligence on companies  by tracking their employees as they move around the web.  So one of the issues that I'd like to draw  to people's attention is that if your company uses Chrome,  you're actually giving information to your competitors  about what's happening inside of your company.  Because I can target you  and see what your purchasing department is buying.  I can go and monitor what your IT team is looking at.  How would you get that information?

Start time: 5887.04
End time: 5888.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where do you get that?  Do you buy it from somebody?

Start time: 5889.08
End time: 5890.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you buy it from a third party.

Start time: 5891.76
End time: 5959.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So there was a great Ars Technica kind of co-investigation.  There was a guy, he was an ISP,  and he discovered that he was seeing weird data logs.  And he did some investigations  and found out that there was this third-party company.  They'd even been on product content stuff  where they were basically selling  a Google Analytics dashboard  where people could see their competitors  and they could see what their internal  Google Analytics stuff looked like.  And they were doing this because there were very popular  Google Chrome extensions where people would opt in  and by opting in, it just means clicking  whatever dialogue would come up  when the extension was installed  to letting any of their data go across.  But a lot of the information was personally identifiable.  They claimed that they were scrubbing that information,  but it wasn't.  I'm gonna find the link and put it in the IRC.  But yeah, I mean, there are, but like Greg is saying,  there are whole industries involved  with selling this sort of information  that people can get either through extensions  or third-party trackers or other things.  And I do agree with you, Greg.  There was a difference between.

Start time: 5959.42
End time: 5985.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry.  So you remember the debt collection thing  that happened a month or two ago?  And they were able to find anybody anywhere.  There's exactly the same business as debt collectors  and except they're tracking what companies are doing  and then selling that information to your competitor.  So if you're a company using Chrome today,  you are literally giving your competitors information  on what your business is doing  if you're in a business that's competitive.  Well.  That is why you should be switching to WebKit,  which is Safari, Firefox, Missoula.

Start time: 5986.12
End time: 5988.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you use as a browser, Greg?

Start time: 5989.70
End time: 6005.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I run Safari most of the day  and then I have a special Firefox hack,  which every time I shut Firefox,  it wipes all the cookies, everything inside of it.  So if I'm running to a site where I'm not quite safe,  I fork to Firefox, fork the link to Firefox.  And that every time I shut Firefox.

Start time: 6005.54
End time: 6025.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I use Firefox focus on my iPhone and Android phone.  This does that.  Every time you use it, you can flush everything out,  all the tracking cookies, everything after you use it.  I think that's a nice choice.  Although I am on no iPhone, so I'm using WebKit,  so I feel fairly safe,  but it's just nice to have that as a choice.  Of course on Android, I do.

Start time: 6026.92
End time: 6032.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The switch here is that everybody but Google  is switching to an anti-tracking policy.  And that's why Google's doing this.

Start time: 6032.40
End time: 6049.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we should be very clear.  They're seeing Safari and WebKit  move in this direction, anti-tracking technologies.  Firefox does it, Brave does it.  I bet you, I seem to remember when Microsoft said,  we're gonna start using the Chromium engine for Edge.  They said, but we're gonna strip out  all that tracking stuff, right?

Start time: 6049.32
End time: 6075.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, to be clear,  and because it's still in betas,  and one of the beta actually just came out.  And I've actually been using the Chrome  since it was just in Canary.  And I like it a whole lot, or not Chrome, Edge.  And I like it a whole lot, but I use Safari as well.  But I primarily these days use the Edge browser.  There is some telemetry,  and there is some Microsoft syncing.  It's not the same extent of Google stuff,  but I don't know the details about how all of that works.  But yes, that was one of the big things.

Start time: 6075.98

Start time: 6087.88
End time: 6109.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you can, according to FirstPost,  you can enable, through experimental flags in the new Edge,  you can enable tracking protection.  And very much like Firefox, they have three choices,  basic, balanced, and strict.  And so you can turn on strict tracking protection.  Sounds like it's doing very much  the same thing Firefox is doing.

Start time: 6109.58
End time: 6116.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's following the same guidelines.  I think that the balanced is the default one,  but those things could change  by the time the final version comes out.

Start time: 6117.48
End time: 6137.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think this makes, a little bit makes sense.  You can show it here, Carson, I've got it on my screen.  I think it kind of makes sense, which is,  for most people, you don't want to break  their experience of the web.  If they know what they're doing,  they can make it more strict.  I certainly go into, and Firefox starts with a less extreme,  it's very similar to Firefox's tracking.

Transcript:  This is an intent to change future versions of Firefox  to be actively hostile.  It'll move to the strict as a default,  but it'll be progressive so that nothing breaks over time,  or in an attempt to manage what,  I mean, I already have a problem today  with my ad blocking settings and my outbound filters  and so forth.  Well, isn't that going to be the real problem,

Start time: 6160.32
End time: 6163.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is that soon websites will just reject you  if you do any kind of privacy.

Start time: 6164.12

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was going to say, this becomes the thing,  although what's really interesting,  and Greg, I'd like to know your thoughts on this,  and this obviously becomes very geeky,  but this is the sort of thing that could be productized  very, very easily, where you see people  creating like a Raspberry Pi holes,  where they're creating kind of like ad blocking  like at the DNS, at the router level,  which is much harder to, because yeah,  you do have the issue where websites will just break  if you are running, tracking, if you turn off tracking,  or if you have ad blockers running,  but if you're blocking things that kind of like  the request level, a lot of times,  it does, things are still able to get through.  So it'll be interesting, I think,  if somebody, if they haven't already,  a way to productize, because it's a fairly simple process  to set up a Pi hole, somebody productizes out.  Let me stop you and just say-

Start time: 6212.56
End time: 6239.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think there are some people doing that.  Google's ahead of you there, Google's ahead of you there.  They've already invented a protocol called DNS over HTTPS.  It's been ratified by the ITF.  It's nearly complete through the standards process.  And a future version of Chrome will actually use the,  won't use your computer's DNS.  It will actually use an internal setting to the app,  and it'll make its DNS queries directly to Google's DNS.  And you will never be able, so Pi hole will die.  And you won't be able to filter this.

Start time: 6239.20
End time: 6249.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they'll die if you're using Chrome.  I'm using Firefox, which also uses HTTPS over DNS,  but uses CloudFlare's 1.1.1.1 DNS.  And I trust CloudFlare, I think.

Start time: 6250.12
End time: 6260.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I was gonna say, what if you're using  like a CloudFlare or what's the other one, Quad9?  There are a couple of other privacy-focused DNS things.  So, I mean, I hear what you're saying,  but I do wonder, like-

Start time: 6260.32
End time: 6270.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think DNS over HTTPS is a good thing, though, right?  On balance, if you were forced to use Google,  that'd be different.  But because I don't use Google,  I think that's a good thing.

Start time: 6271.88
End time: 6273.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a balancing act here.  There's a few things-

Start time: 6273.76
End time: 6275.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because now my eye, it's protecting you from your ISP.

Start time: 6276.52
End time: 6291.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I've just spent five days researching DNS over HTTPS  and getting inside of all the issues,  and I've got a head full of stuff that,  so stop me if I get a little bit.  So the idea was is that most DNS queries are in the clear,  and anybody can capture them.  Your ISP or any-  Your local DNS server.

Start time: 6291.36
End time: 6291.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you know.

Start time: 6292.28
End time: 6415.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then a lot of services actually use that metadata  and sell it for money.  So a lot of ISPs force you to use their DNS server,  and then they sell the DNS data.  And a lot of companies have since got up and said,  so companies like Cisco bought OpenDNS  so that they can get the security data.  So now they get the analytics data streaming off that.  Part of the reason that Google created its DNS  and Cloudflare has its DNS,  they might say it's for the good of the world.  No.  But it's actually analytics data that drives them.  They get to know what's happening on the web.  They can also find malware and spyware and sites  that are set up that aren't otherwise found.  So there is some good,  but the challenge here is to encrypt DNS.  We have a number of things.  DNSSEC won't ever get legs because it's too hard.  No.  Any form of PKI with a root to tree infrastructure  means the root becomes a single forward point of failure  and becomes a key weakness.  And we keep trying to work with DNSSEC  and it's just never gonna go.  DNS over HTTPS means that the DNS query  gets embedded in HTTPS.  And all of a sudden,  inspection engines that look for that data  will stop working.  Now, what I want you to think about  is when something like the Facebook app on the iOS  has that DNS over HTTP built in.  So you never see the Facebook DNS queries.  That's a whole filtering mechanism that's suddenly cut off.  Or people start building JavaScript apps in web pages  that do DNS lookups in JavaScript  so that it never uses your local DNS.  And that's good in the sense that my metadata,  the DNS lookup I have is no longer available  to somebody in the network.  But we're also in a situation where my client,  my DNS queries are no longer under my control.  And also the servers become centralized.  So Cloudflare, Google.  And the challenge that I have is that Google and Cloudflare  aren't actually good people.  They're all what I call princes of privacy.  That is they've got their version of privacy,  but they don't have a common version of privacy.  So we actually, you know,  Matthew Prince says,  I just woke up this morning and decided to kick HN  off the internet.  Well, it shouldn't be his choice.  There should be some, you know,  maybe that's a topic we can touch on.

Start time: 6416.40
End time: 6419.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you want to let's encrypt of DNS basically.

Start time: 6421.64
End time: 6426.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you know what the real solution is?  Have an ISP you trust.

Start time: 6427.32
End time: 6429.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this is true.  No, there's no ISPs I trust.

Start time: 6429.94
End time: 6432.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I trust SonicNet.  That's our ISP.  I know because I-

Start time: 6432.96
End time: 6434.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I trust WaveG.  I trust WaveG completely.

Start time: 6435.06
End time: 6439.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I know that SonicNet is not harvesting  or using my DNS queries.

Start time: 6440.74
End time: 6447.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, same.  But they're all in clear text, right?  If I'm monitoring them upstream,  like the reason that Verizon-  Well, you don't see it upstream, do you?

Start time: 6447.40
End time: 6451.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I get that query satisfied by SonicNet,  you don't see it upstream.

Start time: 6452.68
End time: 6454.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Only upstream resolve is also leaked data.

Start time: 6455.70
End time: 6461.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but if there's no upstream resolve,  if it gets solved downstream,  I don't go upstream, do I?

Start time: 6462.18
End time: 6468.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the cache has to be refreshed.  And if it's not in the local resolve,  a cache that goes up to the root server,  they're all clear text.

Start time: 6468.40
End time: 6501.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I understand.  ISP is out in the public.  But most of the time, your server,  your queries are cached,  unless you're going strange places.  But maybe those are the places  you most wanna protect yourself against.  So can I set up my own DNS server?  Because this is Firefox's settings.  It's in the general,  under network settings at the very bottom,  I can turn on DNS over HTTPS.  The default provider is CloudFlare,  but I could set up a custom provider.  I'd have to just know enough to set up a custom,  secure DNS provider.  Or perhaps use a third party that I trust.

Start time: 6502.50
End time: 6507.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, so BIND will have a,  has a DNS over HTTPS or DOH.  D-O-H, we say, doh.  But by the way,

Start time: 6509.38
End time: 6516.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they're not canonical either.  If they don't have the DNS record,  they're still gonna send it in the clear  to the canonical servers, aren't they?

Start time: 6517.14
End time: 6519.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they're working on that at the moment.  So they'll be in the other.

Start time: 6519.42
End time: 6520.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not HTTPS all the way.

Start time: 6522.40
End time: 6561.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's only between you and the DNS server.  Same problem.  Which is a start, right?  It's an iteration.  The DNS protocol was built in a day  when mass surveillance wasn't possible  and wasn't even imagined, right?  So the situation that we live in today is very different.  So, you know, baby steps, baby steps.  You know, if you wanna go back to,  you see, Microsoft never changed from where it was  to say, encourage people to change.  Whereas the ISOC, the Internet Society and Consortium,  and the people that run the internet backbone are saying,  we need to change DNS.  And there'll be another,  did I talk to you about the DNS flag day earlier this year?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's enough.  So there'll be another one next year.  There's another one next year  where certain things will happen.

Transcript:  Actually, you really want your blood pressure to go up.  Christina, don't listen to this.  You really want your blood pressure to go up.  Here's a proposal.  And again, it's from the Trump White House.  So you never know how much of this is sincere.  But to use stuff like your Fitbit data  to predict violent behavior.  Yes, we have a big problem.  There was yet another mass shooting last night.  And by the way, anytime you listen to this show,  that's probably gonna be true, sad to say, in this country.  I'm devastated to have to say that.  But there's a new proposal.  The Health Advanced Research Projects Agency, HARPA,  is a new agency, proposed agency, that'll be in HHS.  And they wanna adopt something  that's got a very long acronym called Safe Home,  stopping aberrant fatal events  by helping overcome mental extremes.  They presented it at the White House last week.  They wanna use volunteer data  to identify neurobehavioral signs  of someone headed toward a violent explosive act.  Everybody would be a volunteer.  And the data, well, it'd come from your Fitbit  or your other health device.  Everybody has to wear one,  because otherwise the bad guys could get away with it.  I don't think this is going anywhere, obviously.  Obviously not.  This violates so many civil liberties things.

Start time: 6655.14
End time: 6660.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, genuinely, this is like  ultimate violation of both headless authorities.

Start time: 6661.06
End time: 6695.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  According to the Washington Post,  this is being one of the proposals to supporters  is Bob Wright, the former NBC chair, Robert Wright.  So he's got some clout.  I'm just saying, you can easily see a future  where this kind of government surveillance  in all different areas becomes the norm.  And what always will happen is out of fear.  We gotta solve this problem, and it's a terrible problem.  And we are all terrified  that we can't walk down the street anymore  without getting shot.  So everybody's gotta wear a special Fitbit.

Start time: 6706.78
End time: 6717.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be wrong.  How can you do that?  What? This is perfect.  That would be wrong.  And you just need to track all the people.  No, we track your heart rate.  We can't track your visits to the gun store.  That would be wrong.  No, it's simple.

Transcript:  By the way, I love it that after the president  tweeted a surveillance image of Iran,  the folks at Reddit got together  to figure out where it was  and how it came from, came to be,  and the whole genesis of it.  Reddit's kind of amazing.  Whether this is real or not doesn't matter.  It's just incredible to read these Reddit threads.  Apparently it is.

Start time: 6748.54
End time: 6774.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So apparently they-  They really did it.  They tracked the angle  and it was tracked to a satellite, a spy satellite,  which was known to be in that orbit.  And then I watched a video from Scott Manley on YouTube  who actually unpacked it all.  And he was saying that the amazing thing about this  is even though this is a picture of a screen,  he says that it looks like somebody held a smartphone  up to his computer screen and took a photo of it.

Start time: 6774.94
End time: 6784.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

End time: 6830.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just amazing what they can calculate from a photo.  They can calculate the shadow so they know the angle.  And then they go-  He got the satellite.  Where the angle was from.  And then they go, yeah, that's a known spy satellite.  It would have been in that location at that time.  And just like, yeah, just amazing science  going on behind that to decode it.

Start time: 7184.16
End time: 7204.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the amusing thing here is that  A, Twitter is still open to SMS  because the fundamental attack vector here  was that they were able to,  the hackers were using the SMS vector  to actually send text messages from an SMS.  So what they actually must have done was-  By the way, without authentication,

Start time: 7205.10
End time: 7207.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the only authentication is it came from your phone number.

Start time: 7208.40
End time: 7212.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right, so they got Jack Dorsey's phone number.  They simjacked him.  Which is-

Start time: 7212.62
End time: 7220.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They simjacked him, but also Twitter's options.  I mean, it's amazing that,  because I have Twitter two-factor setup  and it's not through SMS.  I have to use it.

Start time: 7221.61
End time: 7235.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's a little tricky  because you have to turn on SMS  and then add something else and then turn off SMS,  but I use a Yuba key.  So nobody's going to hack my account.  Jack Dorsey doesn't have that?

Start time: 7236.66
End time: 7257.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why would he?  He never uses it.  It's not like he uses Twitter or anything.  He's spending most of his time meditating  and fasting or something, but whatever.  I think the interesting thing here is,  A, for me and my focus on business  and the land of corporates,  is that you can't trust your telcos.  They're not secure, they're not safe.  They're incompetent businesses.

Start time: 7257.88
End time: 7269.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't use SMS for two-factor.  And if you do-  I agree.  You can, with some telcos,  like T-Mobile texted me last year saying,  please put a pin on your account  so that you don't get simjacked, right?

Start time: 7269.70
End time: 7297.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But even if you do that, social engineering,  like AT&T, a number of people have talked about that.  Because I have those things on my account  and then I always worry,  okay, here's the one company I will call out  as I'm so angry with them about this because it's money.  And I've had to turn off two-factor,  which I don't want to do,  but I don't feel comfortable having it tied to SMS.  That's PayPal.  PayPal refuses to use OTP for two-factor.

Transcript:  PayPal is the first company I used a dongle with,  but the problem is they always have a fallback to SMS.  And whatever the weakest link is,  that's the one that the bad guys will use.

Start time: 7310.98
End time: 7317.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And even now they've changed from what I understand.  They don't even have a dongle system anymore.  No, it's SMS only.  Right, they got rid of it.  But you know what?

Transcript:  My bank does that.  Most banks still use SMS.  So terrible.  And you know the worst one, Verizon, of all people,  they use the secret question methodology,  which I don't mind if I can provide  completely random answers.  But no, the answers are in a dropdown.  So there is a limited set of questions  and a limited set of possible answers,  and it's in a freaking dropdown.

Start time: 7344.74
End time: 7395.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Give me a break.  So the fallback from here, Leo,  my extension of that is you can criticize the methodology,  but at the end of the day, you can't trust a telco.  You can't trust the people who give you your mobile phone  to keep that data secure.  You can't trust them to operate safe and secure businesses.  You can't trust them to run networks that are private  and to keep your data private.  You have to assume that they're incompetent  and you have to take steps to cut them out of the loop.  And that's something that we've been seen proven  over and over and over.  So my point would be is the hacking of Jack Dorsey's  Twitter account is partly a failure, him personally,  but we as experts need to take responsibility  for the incompetence of the people in our supply chain.  And in this case, it's Verizon, AT&T, whoever it is,  and they have proven consistently incompetent  at securing their services.  And we should take steps to get around that.

Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, he had a secret phone for a long time.  He was supposed to, he didn't like whatever phone  that they gave him and-  No, he's using some old Android 4 phone or something.  That's what I'm saying.  So yeah, I mean, I genuinely like, obviously-

Transcript:  Well, but also remember when the contractor blocked,  like deactivated his account?  Yeah.  So I would like to think there's a seven second delay  and then they have those other things in charge,  but since the contractor was able to disable his account.  Yeah, no, but if I'm also being honest,  as terrible as this sounds,  okay, so the president's Twitter is hacked.  What's the worst that can happen?  He's already basically declared war over tweets before.  He's already threatened nuclear weapons.  So honestly, who cares?  I hate to be in that.  The missiles are to be in that.

Transcript:  Couple of DMs from some people  that are just not worth reading.  It can be like that.  No, I think the takeaway here is the fact  that your telco is incompetent  and should not be trusted to handle SMS.  This system that lets you hijack a SIM or to emulate,  you can get into the SS7 signaling and spoof a message  and make it look it comes from your phone  has been vulnerable for 20 years  and they've done nothing about fixing it.  System seven, is it?

Transcript:  Yeah.  That's just a nightmare too.  There's another, there's SS7.  There's another nightmare.  Hey, I'm gonna end on a happy note.  We can't end on that note.  This is a happy note.  Microsoft has told the Linux developers,  we want you to build exFAT into the Linux kernel.  I love this so much.  This is exFAT, which is widely used on USB keys and stuff  because it's extended FAT.  It works with Macs, it works with Windows,  but it's always a problem on Linux.  Microsoft has the patent, it's Microsoft's file system.  They announced today  that they are supporting the addition of exFAT.  They published the specs and they said, come on.  And I think the Linux kernel developers say,  yeah, we're gonna put it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it'd be great, yeah.  I mean, honestly, more, look,  I think this was patent encumbered for a long time  when Microsoft donated patents to the OIN  last year, a lot of people wondered about this.  I think this is good.  Look, every file system could have improvements,  but yeah, Greg Crowe Hartman,  who's one of the kernel gods,  has already started working on a patch to get support in.  I mean, I think at the very least, if you do anything,  if you deal with Canon memory cards at all  or things with Sony memory cards at all.  Yeah, they're all exFAT.  Exactly, this is great for your interoperability with Linux.  I think this is awesome.

End time: 7686.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it is a sign that Microsoft is changing  and transitioning to a modern future  where it knows you don't spend $7 billion on GitHub  and then say you can't have the patent  for a file system that's 30 years old.

Rackets, exactly.  I would make lists of, hey, what shows do I think  are gonna last, which ones are good.  I would make my own schedule of, okay,  what am I gonna watch?

So yeah, no, I've been,  well, I was drinking gin for a little while  and I had to stop for a couple of months.
