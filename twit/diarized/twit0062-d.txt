Transcript:  This is TWiT This Week in Tech, episode 62 for July 16, 2006.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We are talking about it. The show has begun. John C. Dvorak.  You got somewhere to be in a minute or two. You're in a hurry.  You gotta cook. Oh, you gotta make dinner. Isn't that sweet?  What's for dinner tonight? Don't know. That's the problem.  He's gotta shop and then cook. Dvorak.org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Check for his great recipes online. Actually, you know, I used to do recipes for  Morgwatch magazine and the people we had once or another asking me if I'd start doing that again.  I wish I were. They're all kind of nerd oriented in terms of, you know,  lots of tales of why these things are the way they are.  But I'm not gonna dig up the old ones. I think I want to just bring them out of an archive  and drop them on a page. Put them on. Absolutely. I bet you're a good cook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, many people don't know you started as a writer, as a wine writer.  And I am a good cook. I bet you are. What's your speciality?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, actually, the thing that everyone moans about because I cook it too often is a  London broil made from a flank steak that's been marinated.  And it's like probably the most spectacular thing you've ever had.  If you don't know how to do great thing about flank steak, it's the tastiest meat in the world.  But if you don't know how to cook it, which is what 99 percent of the people,  well, they qualify, nobody knows how to cook it right.  But if you know how to cook it, it's a stunner. You're absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's always available. It's too tough and it will curl up.  But it's but it's a lean, healthy meat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And if you know how to cook it, it's not tough at all.  It's very tender. So it's like a trick.  I actually one of the recipes I think I did in Boardwatch describes the process to do it the easy way.  Do you grill it? Yeah, I do.  I mean, you can broil it.  I mean, that's what the original recipe was.  It was called London broil.  But I put it on a, you know, 800 degree grill.  Yeah, for sure. And it only takes about, you know, six, seven minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait a minute. You tell me London broil is flank steak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. One of the main recipes for London broil is flank steak.  It's also done with a Chateaubriand, but generally speaking, it's a flank steak.  I had no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am learning so many things from you, John.  David Prager is also here from revision three.  And we welcome you to the program once again.  You may hear him clicking as I delete files from the hard drive.  I ran out of recording space.  Also here. I thought you had a whole terabyte.  I do. And I don't know what happened.  Filled it up. It goes quick.  Podcasts do go quick.  That's the voice of ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Robert Heron from DLTV.  Hello, Robert. Hey, how are you guys?  You probably use up what actually this would be an interesting question.  How much hard drive space do you have locally, like on your on your local hard drive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, on my notebook, it's pretty limited, but everything in the room  I'm sitting in right now, I've pretty much lost track.  It's it's over a terabyte.  But I think now I just I keep buying hard drives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think people nowadays probably put  probably 500 megs gigs in every in every computer, don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One hundred and sixty, 200 gigs is plenty of room for most people.  I mean, that's I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everything I have now has 300 or more.  How about you, David? How much how much space do you have on your?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you don't want to. I live on notebook computers.  So I've got stuff.  I got stuff.  I have stuff stored on external hard drives that live in closets,  which is really sad.  But like, I've got this tiny little think pad  and it has a smaller form factor hard drive than the most of the notebook hard  drive, so it's 40 gigs and it drives me nuts.  And the main reason is like I subscribe to just say podcast.  And so every day I'm deleting stuff.  40 gigs is barely enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's not even get that.  That's a little dinky hard.  I think get 80 now in that little.  Are you sure? I looked about three months ago.  And once they came out, you start looking now the perpendicular drives.  I'm pretty sure there's an 80 out there for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not a that's not a standard laptop drive.  It's even smaller than a laptop. It's smaller. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's annoying.  I mean, it's got the same pin connections, but it's probably the two point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the standard laptops.  Yeah, so you're right. Maybe one point eight.  Small. That's small. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. How much hard drive space, John, if you had to estimate  there is sitting in about three terabytes, I'd say. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. Well, you know, maybe I mean, I got three machines in this room  and there's a terabyte drive sitting on the floor and a couple of half  terabyte drives sitting next to it.  You know, it's just about three. I'm guessing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got to get this to take a look at this in front thing.  I'm just we'll talk.  I'll talk about it some other time, but it's I'm really loving it as a backup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, our network guy rated that very highly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's a raid five.  I've got a terabyte for less than a thousand bucks,  and it does the backup in the background.  I don't have to.  There's no software running on my systems it because it's running Linux.  It's just I told it back up these folders, you know, daily, and it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's really pretty sure we picked something like that up  and we use it on our network.  I bet you get it with gigabit ethernet, whatever one supported gigabit.  Yes, now it's like with gigabit into that, that's as fast as I just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, you're hard drive.  I still have an issue with this backup philosophy.  My concern is that what happens if you have a fire?  No, I still have to do off site. You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You still have to do off.  Where do you what do you do with your offset?  Where does it go? Do you bring it home?  CDs, I burn DVDs or CDs and I bring it home.  I don't have I'll be honest.  I don't have off site for the podcast stuff, but that's all uploaded to servers.  You know, the stuff I need it.  The stuff I'm backing up is the stuff that I'm still working on editing.  And if you know what, if there are a catastrophic fire at the headquarters,  we'd lose podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wouldn't be the end of the world.  And by the way, my son sitting here, who you might as well introduce to.  But he mentions that because of the Twitter audience,  they probably have us all backed up many times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not worried about that. Exactly. Exactly.  It's only the stuff in progress.  JC is your son.  And I've known him since he was probably about 10.  Maybe you'd know even longer since he was about six. Wow.  And what's he doing these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's getting married.  Is he? Is he really?  No, scared the poor kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who? Who? Who am I married?  Top story of the week, I think the the TV network, CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox  had the lowest ratings, the least watched week in recorded history.  Last week.  The end of the line for broadcast networks, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As vacation time, come on.  Well, it is.  It's traditionally the blogs.  All the blogs go down in their numbers this month.  This is a terrible month for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's it's traditionally the lowest July.  And have you looked at what they have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you looked at the at the offerings on television?  But it's always crappy at this time of year.  No, it's always got vacation.  This is worse than ever.  The worst. I think it's the worst.  There's nothing on television to watch, nothing.  And there's no sports on.  I mean, it's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe you're right. Maybe it's just because, you know, World World Cup is over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we'll watch the Daily Show and then that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, the contrast, Nielsen came out with the Nielsen net ratings  announced on July 12th that six point six percent of the U.S.  adult online population or nine point two million web users have recently  downloaded an audio podcast and they're saying like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  That's what I'm thinking.  They're watching YouTube. They're listening to podcasts.  They're not watching television anymore.  I think you watch. I mean, this is this is yes, admittedly, this is a slow time.  And maybe there's no good TV on anyway.  But I think you're going to see slower and slower, lower and lower.  And that's been the trend for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That story you mentioned about, they also said that the podcast  now are more popular than blogs.  And I wonder about that.  Well, that's that's the story that came floating around  from that Nielsen net rating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Those guys, do you trust those guys as a numbers?  They seem like they're they would be the most accurate numbers out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do trust them. I think they got they've got a lot of good people.  I mean, they they cannot afford to be wrong.  I mean, they're not going to be dead on, but I mean, they're just closer

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  than anything else. Talking about data transferred because obviously  the multimedia is bigger.  Are they talking about actual people that access if they said six point

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  six million podcasts, that's a lot of podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They said it's actual people.  But the thing is, I'm wondering how they're you know, I think there's a problem.  Categorizing blogs.  I think I think there's two things that are wrong.  One, you have like Malik, for example, with his blog, which is pretty famous.  He refuses to call it a blog.  And he considers himself sort of like a little publication.  And I think a lot of people, when they when they get on certain people's blogs,  they really don't know what it is they're on.  They just think it's a cool website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your blog is more personal than that kind of stuff, I think.  That's journal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a problem with the way some people are using the term vlog.  Some people have video blogs and some people actually create like little shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The system is not a vlog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because it's not so it's not it's not a diary.  It's not an online diary, which is what a blog is.  And it's not an online video diary.  People have online videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not buying that online diary thing.  The original blog or weblog was somebody who would.  And I remember this back in the 90s when I was at CNET.  So there always be somebody in a company who is really good at finding websites  like say something like Robot Wisdom, for example.  And they would just say, hey, look at this site, look at that site.  Let's get them to do it.  It's later these diarists came online because the software made it so easy for them to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you're right. Originally, it was two kinds of blogs.  It was linking to other sites. You're right.  It was just a bunch of links, basically, with maybe a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a web blog.  It wasn't a web diary.  But now it is.  I think I kind of agree that people are assuming a real blog is somebody writing,  you know, just blathering on about themselves and what happened that the sandwich thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's just my that's my space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is not I don't know what my space is.  And we'll talk about my space just a little bit.  But you know what I'd like to see is compare the network television numbers  to the Nielsen ratings for websites.  And I bet you at some point we're going to see the lines cross, don't you think?  As networks go down and Internet goes down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know those are pretty big numbers.  Those networks have. That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They said that for the first time ever,  the lowest rated TV show got got fewer than 10 million viewers,  10 million viewers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Even if everything's on the Web, I mean, you know, the huge fan bases  of good productions or entertaining ones like, say, ABC's TV show Lost.  If they could, you know, maybe it's not going to be always on TV.  But if they create a good show and figure out what model to put it out online on,  because you can watch every single episode on their website right now on ABC's website.  I guess they're going to have to figure out how these models,  how they get if they're going to pay for it through the traditional advertising or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got an email from a producer  who's really excited.  Her name is Susan Norkin.  She recently produced a pilot that was bought by Sci-Fi Network  called The Amazing Screw On Head.  It's a it's a animated show.  It's got, you know, Paul Giamatti, David Hyde, Pierce, Molly Shannon.  Good voices in it.  And she's really happy because Sci-Fi Network decided the pilot is going to be aired.  The first show is going to be aired July 27th.  But Sci-Fi decided to put it online first before it airs.  You can watch the pilot now on the Web and for two weeks after it airs,  which I think is very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, we blocked that a couple of days ago.  My son again, you know, found that real quick.  But that's mainly because we're fans.  The whole family here is fans of this Brian Fuller guy, right?  Who did the Dead Like Me show, which is was always quite amusing with Manny Potemkin  and then or Patinkin and then Wonder Falls,  which was a killer, a very amusing sitcom, which Fox ran for like two shows  and then killed it and left the rest in the can, which came out on a DVD.  And I would recommend people go out there and, you know, this typical Fox  go out there and buy the DVD.  It's a really nice 13 episode.  It's amazing. I guess they aired four and then killed it because it was 94.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is putting that proving David's point and proving, frankly,  this this the smartness of sci-fi dot com.  Look at the buzz they've got already.  You know, there's a kind of a built in geek fan base who is going to spread the word.  They're going to tell blogs are going to blog about it.  They're going to mention it on their podcasts.  And it's a great way to build buzz.  Does it hurt the ratings of the show when it finally airs on TV?  No, not at all. I think it probably puts it through the roof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Smartness of sci-fi channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not a good way to man.  Sceeto. That's not who's that there.  Is that J.C.? J.C.  We've never had J.C. on before.  That's great. Good to talk to you, J.C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, but they did man. Sceeto.  What's man. Sceeto?  Is that a man and a mosquito?  They're a horrible movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sci-fi channel likes to put out these movies that are like C quality.  They had one that was like Hunter or something.  It had vampires that were out in the day.  It's a family of.  Man. Super. Cabre.  They're all. Oh, I remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember that. Yeah. Yeah.  Is that the same people who did the amazing screw on head?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no. OK.  Amazing screw on heads done by guys who got kicked off Fox.  Originally, I think screw on head was supposed to be a Fox cartoon.  Oh, I get it. But they wouldn't touch it because it was too crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because the head wasn't actually attached.  You had to screw it on.  And that's that's against the comic book broadcast standards.  They can't have. Have you seen this, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you seen it? Watch the pilot? No, I haven't on my.  Oh, you'll love it. It's hilarious.  Although I've noticed some people don't seem to think it's that funny.  It's the screw on head is a secret agent for Abraham Lincoln is the premise.  And so it goes back to the 1850s.  And it starts off the basic subtext premises that there is two versions of history.  There's the real history, which is what this story is about.  And then there's the history that everyone, you know, is told.  And in fact, if alien technology somehow involved back in 1860s, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like the Wild Wild West.  So let's talk about it.  Let's talk about my space.  Kind of an interesting brouhaha brewing there.  There was a my space page  called the Ted Stevens fan club.  And it was just some, you know, a guy named Andrew Raff, who's, you know,  wrote a little song and took Ted Stevens series of tubes,  description of the Internet and made a little song out of it.  Not a big deal. It's not a great song.  But. My space killed it.  They said it violated their terms of contract,  which it didn't be terms of service because it was he wrote it.  It was his own song.  Senators remarks are always public domain.  That's the nature of Senate remarks.  They took him down and there is a big fight, you know, big, big blogosphere  blow up over it.  My space eventually put it back saying, oh, it was a mistake,  but you got to think it was a little bit of Rupert.  Oh, you got it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, it's not something that you just dump something out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Keep playing and I'll just edit it in.  I'll just edit it in high quality once we get it.  It's a series of tubes. It's a series of tubes, baby.  I mean, it's all right. It's not the greatest song in the world.  But do you think Rupert Murdoch actually killed it  or do you think it was just an accident?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I mean, there's political.  There's a political angle to it, I'm sure that, you know, who knows?  I mean, it's somebody who knows never going to tell us.  And it's the things all over the place anyway.  So who cares? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And in the song, in fact, in a way, once again,  best way to publicize something like this is to do something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's amusing. You should definitely run it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will put it. We'll put it in.  We'll put it in and everybody can hear it.  So it is. Go ahead, Robert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The knee jerk reaction  by the MySpace folks, but you wonder, I mean,  they have the right to take anything off or on they want. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think knee jerk is a good way to describe it.  It probably was somebody said, oh, this is terrible.  Or maybe Senator Stevens will be upset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thinking the emphasis on the word under jerk part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We can take a really, hopefully, a careful look at it,  and which they did eventually, I guess, and eventually reinstated it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But yeah, maybe that was it.  I think the same thing happened, remember, when the Apple stores  pulled that biography of Steve Jobs, it's a neat.  It's the kind of thing you go, oh, and you pull it  and then regret it at your leisure, because, of course, it really  helps promote it, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like you said, if nothing else, the artist of this video now has even more  publicity and fame.  You can have it. So exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hanoi, that's why people sell banned books.  They say it's a banned book and everyone buys it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right. The guy just passed away who published the anarchists cookbook.  Really? Yeah. You remember that?  Oh, I bought that when I was a teenager.  No, you bought the anarchists cookbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. What?  It had a great modification for a rifle I had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't even know that there was an author.  I remember back in the BBS days, like, you know, there was a big, huge document  you can get that teaches you how to make underwater igniters and stuff like that.  Right. There was this.  I didn't I didn't know there was an author who was a publisher

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  called Paladin Press that's so that's who died.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was the guy who started the Paladin Press  passed away a couple of weeks ago.  And he said he he had already sold the book to another firm.  He said, you know, we didn't publish it for political reasons.  We didn't. And it was very controversial.  Had bomb making recipes,  ways to make, you know, hack phones and stuff.  He said we just published it because we needed the money.  But in fact, anarchists said this is a terrible,  this is a terrible look.  It's now public domain, by the way.  So you can't I think you're right, David, I think you can download it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I actually that'd be interesting to see.  I got to I got to look and see if I could find the original version.  I know there's all kinds of quote unquote controversial stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, the text floating around on the Internet, you can definitely download it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what did you make your machine?  You're going to machine gun, Robert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I was on that path.  He's Louise. I had no idea.  And I lived in the boonies.  There was nothing else to do.  I could safely blow up things.  It was, you know, I was a perfect kid environment  and I worked in a machine shop and it was like,  oh, I have everything at my hands.  It's like, what can I do today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm glad I'm glad that you did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I did know it sounds like an investigation.  Oh, please. You still have the gun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do. And it was never modified just for.  But it's an excellent rifle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You didn't succeed in finishing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, never did.  I think it's better the way it is stock than it is to convert it.  It was more for target practice than anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just wanted to blow something away, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's not even in this house.  It's like a couple of hundred miles away from you.  So the coolest stuff in there was the coolest stuff in there was analog

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  phone hacks, like a pile of them and then explosive.  How to make how to blow stuff up creatively.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you buy analog phones anymore?  I don't think you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. Yeah, of course you can.  Where? We're not radio shack.  We actually have a website we're going to find for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Analog phone dot com.  J.C. Get on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does he doubt the guts of it or analog anymore?  I mean, those are probably not made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Those old carbon carbon mics and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That and the the true mechanical spin.  I forget what they call that, the dialing wheel.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, actually, actually, Jay, growing up on those phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, J.C. had this idea, which I thought was a good one,  which was to have a cell phone with a dialing wheel.  That's a great idea.  A rotary phone on a dial on a cell phone.  I mean, you get you definitely get attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know who's done it already? Was was brings.  He has an old Western electric handset with a dial.  That's a cell phone.  And he carries it.  He carries it around with him and you can make calls.  I'm sure he bought it somewhere.  I don't know if he made it himself, but he may have made it himself.  He's crazy. He loves that kind of stuff.  He loves it. Just is a site gag to him.  Well, let me answer my cell lasers and cell phones.  Site gag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, this was this was one of one of the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Retro brick dot com.  You can get some old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Retro brick dot com.  Thank you, J.C. Hey, this guy's useful.  Can we make him a twit?  Yeah, sure. He could be our junior correspondent.  He's like the Jimmy Olsen of twit.  And actually, that's great because you're actually like the Perry White of twit.  And Robert, you're like the Superman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, and Leo.  Capo to capo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I was.  I thought you were going to say Lois Lane.  I thank you for not going there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I could have gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dateline, Hanoi, more than 20 desperate students in Vietnam  paid up to 50 million dong.  I didn't know that was their unit of currency.  It is. Yep.  It's about three thousand dollars to Don elaborately wired wigs and shirts  that allowed them to cheat on their college entrance exams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a good idea. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  During a week, I'm sure you blog this already, John.  During a weekend.  Yeah, you get to it. Get to it.  You're slow.  During a weekend raid, Hanoi police confiscated 50 mobile phones,  60 earphones, 150 SIM cards, eight shirts and five wigs.  I guess the idea was that they were going to  phone in the answers.  The reason they wore the wigs because their hair was too short to cover  the earphone and then they would wire up the shirts.  It's pretty competitive in Hanoi.  It says only 10 percent of the students who take the exams get in to the universities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I've been to Vietnam recently,  and that's a really amazing place because it's something  they have something like 98 percent literacy rate.  Wow. Everybody wants everybody's just enthusiastic about learning  as much as they can about everything they can learn.  So it's pretty astonishing.  Good place to visit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Little airports, a little harsh, but other than that, I'd love to go there.  I'd love to go there. And the food's incredible.  I hear it's really a beautiful place. Very nice people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they're not.  Cheating's never right, but just the fact that they're cheating on an entrance  exam to better their education.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't blame them for that, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It must be very competitive.  That's all I have to say if they go to these these lengths.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Three thousand dollars and a funny looking wig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's my bad electronic setup that might get you to pass.  We're going to have somebody feed you the information.  We'll get the test ahead of time.  And none of it looks good enough to pass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pass the master.  They don't say what the what the penalty is.  For these for these kids.  But, you know, I hope they don't throw the book at them.  You know who they did throw the book at.  And in fact, a judge just upheld the verdict.  A hacker.  Who, in fact, didn't succeed, got a nine year sentence  for for trying to hack federal appeals.  Judge upheld the prison term on Monday for a hacker who tried and failed  to steal customer credit card numbers from the Lowe's chain of home improvement stores.  Guys, 23 has been in custody since 2003 anyway.  An FBI stakeout caught him and a partner breaking into several Lowe's  networks over an unsecured Wi-Fi connection.  He's going to be in jail till 2011.  That's the first time he'll be eligible for parole.  That too long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the whole thing, I think, is ridiculous, since he didn't really do anything.  He wasn't. He was just war.  He wasn't attempted to.  I mean, this is like, you know, threatening.  Who the hell is his lawyer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What kind of crappy lawyer did he have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The kid was war driving in Southfield, Michigan,  found an unsecured wireless network and attempted and I don't imagine  attempted very effectively to hack into the network.  Maybe he had a theory or or or can enable on his system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you had a decent attorney, the attorney would simply point out is,  was that unsecured access point even touching the corporate network?  Well, it was. It was stored.  Well, it was. OK, then somebody in their IT department  that should be fired immediately. No kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The pair discovered that that does not happen.  They could jump from the Southfield, Michigan Lowe's to the company's  central data center in North Carolina and from there to the local  networks of stores around the country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They should be paying that guy for finding that hole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No kidding. Lowe's detected. Not prosecuted.  Lowe's detected the intrusion.  So apparently they didn't have some security on there.  They called the FBI.  The FBI stakes out the store parking lot.  They eventually spot the kids Pontiac Grand Prix bristling with antennas  that occupied by two young men.  This could have been Patrick Norton occupied by two young men  typing on laptops.  The agents watched him work for 20 minutes and trailed them  to a Little Caesars restaurant. Pizza, pizza.  You know, that's how we get advertising in here.  We could just do things like that, just throw that in like that.  Pizza, pizza. You could.  And and they arrested him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How do they prove the case?  Does anyone have a did anyone know anything about it?  Maybe somebody out there who listens to us is from North Carolina.  I think is where it was, right?  No, it was Michigan. Yeah. Yeah.  Maybe somebody out there knows the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The case was prosecuted in Charlotte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. North Carolina.  Because that's where it's that's where Lowe's FBI cyber

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  because it's home to an FBI cyber crime task force, according to the.  Yeah, I didn't want him to commute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the thing.  They actually did get six credit card numbers.  I don't know.  How long has he been in the can right now?  He's already been in the can three years.  He's going to get another nine years.  So that's that's a year and a half per credit card number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a little weird.  I mean, what is standard breaking and entering?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It shouldn't be any more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The sentence was largely based, as according to Wired News,  on the amount of harm that would have resulted had the plan succeeded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I guarantee anybody that had a credit card.  This is like a pre-crime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like a Tom Cruise movie.  It's a pre-crime.  Where are we getting all these pre-crime things going on?  And nobody's saying anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People are you know, this always happens when there's something new  and people are scared of it.  I would I'm surprised, though.  I think it's like the Kevin Mitton case where they kind of went overboard  because it was new to them.  Maybe this is maybe they're afraid of Wi-Fi hacking or something.  But here's the I mean, you probably shouldn't do this.  But if you compare it to other cases, for instance,  the case where one of the leaders of the shadow crew fraud ring was sentenced to  he'd use phishing and spamming techniques to steal credit card numbers,  actually stole the numbers, made online purchases.  He got 32 months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that doesn't sound harsh enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that guy should get nine years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a flip flop.  Yeah, no kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I mean, you can't really compare them to different judges,  different jurisdictions, different courts.  But I just it doesn't seem right.  Nine years for this poor kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It sounds like these people don't have good legal representation.  Yeah, it might be. It might be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But we shouldn't.  I mean, it's too bad you live in a country where you can't.  I mean, if you're rich, you get off.  Come on. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Should I start playing the socialist music?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  International.  Did you see the pictures of the Dell laptop exploding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I actually we blogged that too.  Isn't that too much to go or something, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a couple of weeks ago, but we're this the pictures just started  coming out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the Dell was investigating it.  Did they come up with anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dell says they're investigating it.  Maybe that's why it's now a story.  I just saw the pictures in the Inquirer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about it?  Wasn't that an apple blowing up to I mean, these these are machines made in China.  And I think there's some something some issues.  You know, there's a fact that I was going to do a column on this,  but I kind of swapped it out for something else.  But, you know, these counterfeit products that the Chinese do,  then they get into the main stream production lines here and there.  I suspect this is the culprit here.  I agree with you. It's lithium ion batteries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Those are those those they all explode if you overcharge them.  But and and, you know, well made ones all have circuitry  to prevent you from doing that.  Right. But if something goes wrong with the circuitry or  and I think you're right, John, a lot of this is that people buy  you know, so, you know, mislabeled counterfeit batteries  that don't have any protections.  And I think that's where a lot of this goes.  Although Apple was having big problems with swelling batteries in the MacBook.  I didn't have that, but apparently they were seeing pictures.  They're just like little fat batteries. They don't quite fit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I go back to having Americans make these products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's lithium ion.  I think that's part of it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's it's a dangerous technology.  And anything with lithium, of course, is a highly explosive.  And in fact, you if you bust open one of those cases,  you'll see that they're actually the design in such a way  that you could segment them out to be the size of a bunch of double  a batteries all lined up because there's an FAA regulation  that says you cannot make a lithium ions, a lithium  lithium ion cell bigger than a double A.  And you'll you'll see this characteristic every so often.  Any lithium battery has to have some sort of some way of being  segmented off as a double A battery.  Otherwise, it's against the law to put on an airplane.  But you mean not in less or little bitty ones, what you can't be any bigger

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  than this or inside, but like my laptop battery, that's that's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't have to take that.  I bet you if you're guessing that if it's a big battery,  unless it's just a small one, but if it's a big one, that's that's bigger  than double a size, if you cracked it open, I bet you find it looks

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  like a bunch of little double A's in there in case somebody asked me to take it apart.  How do they ship them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's some it's just a way of getting around the problem.  I don't know. How do they ship?  That's a good way. I guess I put them on a boat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's a dangerous technology.  That's the thing. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm afraid one of these things blows up in an airplane.  What are you going to do?  Well, exactly. You're talking about was a massive explosion.  Look at the pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll put the link in the show notes.  It's I mean, of course, you know, it's it's hard to tell.  It's very bright.  It could be just a bright doesn't look doesn't look right.  It doesn't look like something you'd want to be sitting next to.  And you certainly wouldn't want to have it happen in the cargo compartment  of an airplane midair on your lap.  Definitely not on your lap.  Microsoft is as a new operating system called Windows Fundamentals  for legacy PCs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's a stripped down version of XP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yeah, we have to mark, in fact, that this is the week  that Windows 95, 98 and ME are now out of cycle.  They're end of cycle.  Yay. Well, you say, yeah.  But what about all the people who use them?  They can't. They're no more support, no more fixes.  Well, nobody using that stuff, Leo.  Yeah, I bet there's 30 million computers running Windows 98.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, he's still on the software.  Hopefully that goes with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it hasn't crapped out by now. It's running fine.  What what kind of what kind of legacy support do you need  for an operating system that's this old?  Actually, I'm more concerned about security patches.  That's more of a security switch to see what hackers are going to go after that.  I mean, are you kidding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a that's that's gold for hackers.  They look for Windows 98 systems. Yeah.  Are you kidding? They love that.  So this is the idea. You have to be a business, unfortunately.  You can't. This is for really what it is, is for, you know, big businesses  have 30000 seats and 10000 of them are still Windows 98.  So they can get this basically turns it into a terminal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are you familiar with their software assurance program?  That's who it says it's for. Who can be a member of that business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you have to be. It's basically a license software assurance.  It's basically a license.  It's for people who have a lot of seats and they they buy, you know, a lot of windows.  And that's that makes sense.  I mean, these guys, it's very expensive for them to replace their 98 machines.  Their Windows 98 machines.  They just put this stuff on it and it turns into a terminal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So has anybody followed the story about the fires file swappers  identities protected by Dutch court? No.  Dutch appeals court thwarted attempts by the Dutch  anti-piracy organization, Brien, to get to the identity of file  shares. And so apparently they guess the government or some group there,  the courts are protecting, you know, file sharing in the Netherlands,  which I think is a positive thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think there are a number of countries now where they've said that.  In fact, in Canada, they said file sharing is legal.  They in Canada, a judge said about almost a year ago, eight months ago,  told the record companies were doing the same thing.  These John Doe lawsuits are they're asking for the names of the people.  They said, no, you can't. It's not illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wasn't there a case last week or two where some old ladies  had decided to fight the  RIAA in one of those John Doe lawsuits and they beat them and the court,  you know, reprimanded the RIAA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good. Go get them, lady.  You got our support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And apparently, the RIAA is in a number of instances, at least one that  I think we've blogged,  uh, indicted or tried to indict a dead person  for file sharing.  Did they get them? Interesting concept.  I think they got them dead to rights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure we could come up with more puns, but it's too damn hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I sense the energy is low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's hot. Well, there's a couple of things.  First of all, I don't know how we're going to get through the next two months,  because traditionally, these are the slowest news months.  And we're just there's not many stories, as you can see.  There's about 12 stories and it's hot.  It's new core duo, man.  OK, core duo. Oh, you know what?  We were supposed to get somebody on about that.  Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  That's thanks for reminding me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact, Robert, are they tested?  Did they have they have they've been benchmarking that stuff over a CD?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. You know what?  It's faster across the board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I mean across the board.  What I mean, faster across the board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Benchmarked, they throw it at it, except for, I believe, one obscure benchmark.  The new Intel parts are faster than AMD's current top of the line.  However, what I found kind of interesting was that for gaming in particular,  when you start gaming at high resolution, not that not the CPU intensive,  where you jack the resolution all the way down, turn off all the features.  So it becomes a pure test for that.  Of course, you're seeing like 2x improvement with the new Intel parts.  But for for high end gaming, where you're gaming at very high resolutions  with maximum detail, the numbers are showing that in most cases  you're seeing 10 percent or less.  And in some cases, a dead heat in terms of performance gains over over AMD's latest.  So it really depends on what you're using.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  According to PC World, according to PC World, they use the World Bench 5 test suite.  The Intel Core 2 Duo reference system that they built against an AMD Athlon  64 FX 62, the Intel Core 2 Duo outperformed by 17 percent.  I don't know the specifics of the World Bench 5 test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's I was just going.  I was mostly interested in the gaming benchmarks.  So that's what I kind of focused on.  And looking at that, I was I was honestly surprised.  It looks very impressive when you look at 640 by 480 at 16 bit or whatever.  But when you start cranking it up to full resolution, full detail,  it was pretty much neck and neck.  The other cool thing being that Intel kind of drew the line in the sense that,  you know what, we're not going to go above 65 watts of heat dissipation  for any of our new parts.  And if they can maintain that and continue the important performance improvements,  that to me means more than anything else, because, frankly,  it was getting ridiculous with the previous generation of the Prescott,  Pentium 4s and even before that.  But these that last round of Prescott's were among the hottest chips  I've ever had to deal with.  And in many cases, the stock cooler was totally insufficient for,  you know, I've been stable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been advocating a redesign of computers where you put those  actually put the microprocessors on top of the computer  and then you could put coffee pots on top of the chips themselves.  And then you'd have like a coffee warming system that would really  be dual function computers, I think would be very popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, you're not going to be able to upgrade to these systems either  without buying another new socket.  And so it's no, it's socket 775, which is the same as the  the Pentium 4 or Pentium D. Really?  But but why? More power support.  But you just I don't know.  This the same I'm reading the same PC world article.  It says you can't pop a core two duo chip into the existing Intel based PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And well, it's like AMD is bouncing back and forth between socket 939, 940  or 940, then 939 now and back to 940.  And it's not the same 940 as before.  And it's not for technical reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just so that you have to buy a motherboard.  And if you're going for a new chip for a nice will get a new motherboard.  Yeah, exactly. That's the cheapest part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It has. Has anybody gotten a response from AMD with their because they're going to  you know, I mean, obviously they claim they got some.  Well, let's see.  Have you read anything? I haven't seen anything yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have you been in BART lately?  I know a local transit system.  Every ad in the at least in the Market Street stations are all  the whole place is AMD ads for their Opteron server part.  And they're looking at that with the four by four setup  is their low cost, low power server solution.  So they're focusing more on enterprise.  Well, they've always been focusing on enterprise, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but they have such a good chip with the 64FX.  I would think that they would be looking at.  I mean, that's a dual core.  I would think they'd be looking at some way to kind of try to match Intel on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's cool. Or even if the price just comes down to be even,  you know, a ridiculous bargain.  Granted, that's another way to do it.  That doesn't help make money.  But I love my X2 system.  Yeah. And the and the half a dozen X or AMD based systems  I built recently in the last year or so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But even gamers now, I think, are looking at Conroe as a better choice.  Much better choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If I were building something today, I'd probably wait until those chips are out  and consider which one of them I wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what I'm waiting for?  I'm waiting for Vista.  I'm just going to and I think a lot of people probably will just wait  till you can get it. Not a Vista ready machine, but a machine with Vista installed.  A machine built for Vista and at Conroe will be great for that.  Or maybe Marum, maybe the laptop part.  When when's that going to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're the only guy I've ever heard say something like that, Leo.  What? That I'm waiting for Vista?  Most people, the word that you would use is dreading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, well, partly it's because I'm doing this Geek Cruise in February,  in which I've got like five seminars on moving to Vista, securing Vista, using Vista.  So I need to get Vista as soon as I can.  Who's giving the seminars?  Me. Oh, you are.  Yeah, that's why I need to learn about Vista.  Did you download the preview?  You know, the latest beta?  I didn't. And it's again, maybe that's a case of dreading Vista.  I don't really there's no machine that I'm willing to sacrifice to the beta,  although I played with it and I, you know, on other people's machines.  And it's very it seems very good, very robust.  And it works.  I guess I'll wait for the ready for, you know, the gold,  the ready to manufacture and then I'll do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm either going to get a bigger hard drive for my notebook  or get another less expensive notebook and load up Suse 10.1 on that.  Suse 10.1. That's a pretty good choice, I have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's pretty compelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd rather spend some time with that right now on something I can carry around with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, how many people are doing that?  What do you mean? Do you think Microsoft's in trouble come  January 2007 when Vista does come out?  I mean, is it going to be people going? I'm not going there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For the biggest numbers now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just going to be bundled with the new machines.  That's just what you get is how many people are going to upgrade.  That's the I mean, nobody I think is going to do that with their laptop  because apparently you have to have these new hard disks that have a bunch of  memory on them, you know, hard memory because they chew up the power for some reason.  Oh, interesting.  And I guess there's all kinds of issues about Vista and its disk accessing issues.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hmm. Maybe that maybe maybe people will won't be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, in a year from now, when Vista comes out, we'll find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, late 2007, we'll find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, the the fact that you have to get it to run, what is it?  Halo 2. That's that's how's J.C. feel about that?  Is he going to he's going to make you buy a Vista machine as soon as possible?  Does he doesn't want to play?  What was that word? What was the word in there?  Halo 2.  Oh, bye. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We box. Huh?  Let's find Xbox. I'm waiting for Halo 3 on Xbox 360.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That seems that isn't isn't one of the doesn't isn't  which one requires Vista, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it a little too does, but it hasn't come out for the for the computer yet.  You can play it on Xbox last year or older than that.  I don't remember when it came out.  So there's but the next one, Halo 3, which is coming out.  Oh, I don't know.  They keep changing the date.  The next one 360. That's what I'm looking for.  That'll be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's so right now you're playing the ship and pray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I just finished pray.  It's original and it definitely shows that it's done by three realms.  They're the guys who did Duke Nukem and yeah, promising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And when is Duke Nukem forever coming out?  Right around the time of this.  All right. That's J.C.  J.C. stands for junior correspondent from the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very odd names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But now you're named the same name as you as your dad.  Isn't your name the same as your dad's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it just got a Smith in there.  So I'm not a junior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you're not a junior. Oh, no.  All right.  Now I'm really confused.  So so so Mimi kept kept her name.  Are you hyphenated?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, just a work.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there's a Smith same cadences as his dad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He sound like his dad.  I'm just talking to him because he sounds like his dad.  Like John sound good.  That's a mean thing to say to a 20 year old guy.  You sound like your dad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You guys are making me sick.  So you're proud.  Come on, admit it.  Well, he knows more than that.  You know, he's one of the things that you get used to is when you have children  who are who are computer savvy, you can.  It really makes a big difference if you do what I do for a living,  which is right about the stuff you just asked them.  Yeah. Well, yeah.  I mean, there's certain trend lines that I simply couldn't possibly follow  because it's just like, you know, there's only so many hours in the day  and you can, you know, catch up with a lot of youth trends that, you know,  I mean, let's face it, you know, we could we're not as young as we used to be.  So that's what we got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Input Prager's are for our youth trend.  Am I the youngest one here?  I think you are my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you're like, what? 18, right?  He's the only guy under 30 on this panel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe. Yeah, it's true.  Going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you under 30?  I am indeed. Oh, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I don't I don't know what the genesis of this is,  but there was an article on Wired News.  Did you see that Wired News got bought by Wired?  It's about time.  I don't think people even knew  what it before Lycos has has owned it for like eight years.  I don't think people knew it because it was so I mean, you go to Wired.com  what do you get? Wired News with an ad big ad for Wired magazine.  But they weren't the same company at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they are now. They are. They're back.  That makes no sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Wired News has actually in many ways turned itself around.  They've got good columnists.  They got smart people.  I agree.  I think they've really become a pretty darn good site.  You know, you know what surprised what really surprises me  is how good ours Technica is.  Yeah, they're a long time site.  Weren't they just an enthusiast site for the longest time  and all of a sudden they just totally great.  And they do another site I like to go to a lot.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dvorak.org slash blog.  Just to see what we're doing, you know what I'm saying?  So how much is Wired News worth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How much did it sell for?  Oh, that's a good question. I don't know.  Let's guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anybody?  I'd say 20 million.  No, 8 million.  Oh, you're close. 25.  25 million?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's outrageous.  That's outrageous.  Holy mackerel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Boy, the writers are underpaid.  Writers for Wired News.  Ask for more money.  Cast off your whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Shackles.  Strike.  Chains.  All right, I got another.  As long as we're doing trivia.  It happened on this day, July 16th, 1969.  Any guesses?  July.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wasn't the moon landing, was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a moon launch.  Very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apollo 11 took off on this day.  Headed the first manned mission to land on the moon.  Are we sure of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are we absolutely positive this wasn't faked?  Absolutely.  They're bringing the shuttle back tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm glad we have a space program of some kind.  I mean, it's not the most inspiring space program.  Beat up old shuttle going up and down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they're saying, like, there's a lot of people saying,  like, we've got these shuttles up there,  and the main goal is to finish the space station.  Why don't they just send them up there unmanned?  Send the shuttles up there unmanned is what some people are saying.  And it makes sense, but I'll still stick with the, you know,  it makes it that much more, you know, human, et cetera.  Yeah, but this isn't inspiring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This isn't the kind of...  No, that's what I'm...  Well, you mean they can fly the shuttle by wire

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  all the way to the space station?  Oh, they don't have to put a power supply on that.  They don't need this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure, that kid who got nine years for the landing  could do it with a Wi-Fi adapter and a couple antennas on his Pontiac.  That's all it takes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They could easily, they could send the shuttle up,  dock it to the space station, have it basically,  they'd be dumping trash and unloading supplies  because apparently they got a big trash problem on that space station.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can't you just put it into the sun?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a good question. I don't know.  Seems like a big interesting idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you may remember that the publishers, the music publishers,  were going after the lyrics sites, shutting them down,  which never made any sense to me because, I mean,  if you're looking for a song and all you know is one line,  you want to buy the song, what do you do?  You type it into Google, you go to the lyrics site,  you find out what the song is, you buy it, right?  This is good for music.  I never understood why they're trying to shut it down.  Now I found out. Now I figured it out.  Grace Note, CDDB, just signed a big deal  with dozens of music publishers to what?  Publish lyrics on the Internet.  Good.  So well, it is good because it'll keep it alive,  but it's just, you know, it's typical.  Oh, you can't do it for free because we plan to monetize this sucker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can't you access the data though from Grace Note's site for free?  Right now you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For personal use?  Right now you can, sure.  I would hope that they would keep doing that.  If they do, that would be great because you could be listening  to iTunes and legitimately the lyrics could pop up in a window or whatever.  And I think actually that's something we probably need  because without liner notes, without album covers, you miss,  I mean, I used to like to listen to records and read the lyrics.  Totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's one of my favorite things to do on my TiVo.  I actually use a Java-based app on one of my network computers.  And when I'm playing music through my TiVo,  either streaming audio from web-based stations or listening to my own tracks,  it'll pull down the album art.  I'm not sure where it gets any of this,  but it's grabbing the album art and the song lyrics for everything it plays.  And it just shows it to you on the TV.  I love that.  Yeah, it's neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can almost guarantee they're getting that from Grace Note.  That's one of the biggest licensees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It says who they're getting it from.  I just can't recall right off the bat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think for a long time they're like Amazon.  You get the album art from Amazon.  And maybe Grace Note now officially can offer the lyrics.  I didn't know it was offering lyrics before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When I was over there visiting them, they're local here.  They had a scheme.  You know how they're the ones who start it off by if you put a CD in your player.  Well, wait a minute now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The CDDB was originally like IMDB, a user-driven effort.  And then all of a sudden along comes Grace Note  and buys the work of thousands of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's the way they started.  But anyway, the point is I was trying to make,  besides this I can see you have a grudge against them.  I do.  The point I was trying to make is that they're supposedly,  I don't know if they've implemented this or not,  but if you took and burned a CD of a mix that you did yourself,  of a very variety of songs,  they claim that by looking at the signatures,  they can recreate whatever song it is and actually give you a printout of,  in other words, they can do the same thing with your own mixes,  in other words, your own ripped discs.  That's cool.  I thought that would be cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The next step would then be to notify the Recording Industry Association of America.  And then they'll keep track of how many times you've burned those songs  and send you a bill after you burn them more than three times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think there's a product out there that's called MusicBrainz.org.  And I think what they do is make something that'll go through your iTunes database  for songs that you haven't labeled  and it tries to identify some of the stuff that John was talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and label it for you.  Okay.  Yeah. I think they use CDDB.  CDDB doesn't have to just be album-oriented.  If they have the length of the song,  I guess they would need more than the length, though, if it's not on an album.  I always thought, oh, they look up an album by some magic code  that's embedded in the album or in the CD.  But no, in fact, what they do is look at the number of tracks,  the length of the tracks, and they match it up that way.  So how would they do individual tracks?  So each song has a signature of some kind.  But what is the signature? A CRC?  It could be a lot of different things,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but it seems to me that everything is going to have its own look  insofar as the...  Well, yeah, but if you encode...  A oscilloscope signature, for example.  Well, maybe the waveform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe the waveform.  Waveforms.  It has to be the waveform, because if it's personally encoded,  that MP3 is going to look different depending on who encoded it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you've ever ripped a track on Stumbripper,  they'll even show you the waveform as it...  Say it takes a couple of seconds to rip a track,  so it can quickly make a snapshot of that waveform.  That's probably what it is.  Was that computerized musical ranking system  where they could take a new song, put it into this program,  and the program would, by the beat analysis or whatever it was,  it would determine how likely it was to become a popular hit  based on past popular hits and categories as well.  And I was wondering maybe if it was tied into some kind of technology  like that as well, but it might be a lot simpler  just using simple waveforms as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's got... They're not going to make it too complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you said they're local. Are they in the Bay Area?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they're over in Emoryville.  I believe they're someplace around here somewhere.  I vaguely remember where they are.  I just went over there and hung out. I think it's Emoryville.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You should get a tour. I'd like to see them so I can...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they've got all kinds of cool stuff.  What they have there is they've got all these players from all over the world  because they have to test them.  And it's just actually kind of interesting just from that perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I've run out of news.  Anybody else have another story they want to mention or bring up?  Anything in the blog this week that you thought was funny, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I went over to the... In Oakland they had a fire art show from the Crucible.  It was... I think it even runs tonight, Sunday.  And it just was like Burning Man in Oakland.  I put some videos up on the blog that show some of it, but...  It was kind of the most interesting thing that took place all week.  But it did give me an opportunity to call on my road this week,  which will be in PCMag.com, is that I realized that with the...  Using these little pocket cameras to take videos, especially 480x480...  That's what I've been doing.  Some of them have a pretty good little microphone in them,  and you send them to YouTube and then post them like they were snapshots.  It's astonishingly powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's perfect. It's just perfect for blogs.  I've been doing it a lot lately.  There are a number of sites besides YouTube that give you even more functionality.  I like... There's one called iSpot.  We did an interview with Amber and I did an interview for Inside the Net  that lets you mash them up so you can upload your videos,  mash them with other videos, music, transitions.  It's got little editing capabilities online, flash-based editing capabilities.  iSpot.com and then I like new... What is it called? VideoEgg.com also.  They give you some capabilities like you can trim it and so forth.  And they hosted too.  Yeah, they hosted. It becomes a flash video that you could then post on your blog,  hosted from their site.  Right, embedded.  Yeah, I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cool. Yeah, I think...  Yeah, no, it's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In a way, it's kind of a revolution.  It makes it so easy for individuals to put video up.  And you're right. I think digital still cameras...  I just bought the new Fuji E900.  It's a 9-megapixel camera.  Like 300 bucks.  And it's a really good still camera, but it's got great video.  It's 640x480 video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I actually used that camera for a while.  That's a nice camera.  I like it. I've been using it.  And it does take a good video.  I was using a Kodak and I thought the video part was actually better than the still part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How long before we see...  I mean, things like the Xacti from Sanyo and the Averio from JVC.  How long before we see solid-state video cameras that do a really good job?  All right, they're MPEG-4. You can upload them to the net.  I mean, I think that that's a...  They could do it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They should do it.  I mean, they've done cheap ones like the $200 one that holds...  Right, do some good ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, HD, how about that?  Xacti, the new Xacti is HD.  A pocket HD camera.  That's what they've got.  In fact, I remember JVC was showing an HD Averio.  I don't think they ever released it, but they were showing that a couple of years ago.  We didn't mention McAfee's little flaw.  Poor McAfee.  They had a big bug in the software that large organizations use to protect themselves.  And they didn't tell anybody until Friday.  Business and U.S. government.  McAfee Antivirus Corporate is really very popular in the big business environment.  In fact, Lumber Services use that as well.  And the engineers discovered the flaw, which allows attackers to seize control of computers  to steal sensitive data, delete files, or implant malicious programs.  But they updated it in February, but they described it only as new features.  So finally...  I wonder if it's an overflow exploit or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It probably is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Finally, McAfee...  So we talked a little bit about it, I think, when that happened.  But finally, Friday, I guess they acknowledged that, in fact, there was a problem  and urged all customers to take immediate steps to protect themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I find the problem...  I use Symantec Corporate for my work notebook.  And the only problem I run into is that the only time the script that does the updating is run  is when the notebook's rebooted.  And it's during the startup script for the domain login.  And I can't tell you how long I sometimes go between reboots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember that. ZD did that too. And it was. It's a pain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And unless you manually do it, or unless I manually reboot the notebook,  typically I just put the thing to sleep and then wake it right back up and just keep going again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why is it that the corporate versions of McAfee and Norton are so much better than the consumer versions?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. I did a foobar last weekend and installed two viruses in like 10 minutes  trying to find a safe utility.  And it turned out the first two I downloaded were total Trojan viruses  that were trying to collect information off my system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you hear from the IT department?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, I was doing this at home, thank goodness.  But I tried a couple of quick online tools.  And one found nothing and another found them both.  And I was really happy. It turned out it was at Trendmicro.com.  Oh, yeah, PC. Yeah, that's Housecall. Yeah.  Yeah, superb. Superb tool that detects spyware, grayware.  We've recommended that for a long time. Housecall.antivirus.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a really good product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, did a really good job. I was happy with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, there's one more thing I think we should mention.  What's that?  Actually, JC found this for me. It's a beta site called 9.yahoo.com.  Have you guys seen this?  No.  Okay, 9 is the number 9.yahoo.com.  And it's essentially, I think Metafilter called it Metafilter with breasts.  It's this girl who like comes on and she, and there's a,  but you have a laundry list of check, things you can check off on the right,  and she explains them to you. And they're all links to whatever.  And anyway, it's, you know, this is one of the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is like viral videos that she's talking about  or like what people are talking about right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's about an 8.  Oh, good luck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's cute. I think she's very cute. She's got a nice tan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But anyway, I think people should just check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She doesn't even have a name apparently though.  Oh yeah.  With Pepsi ads, it's just Pepsi.  Maria Sanson and the 9 team scour every inch of the worldwide web  and find the 9 best, weirdest, and funniest photo, sites, stories, and videos on the,  you know, that's actually smart because isn't that really what you do with your friends  is like, oh, did you see this video? Oh, look at this video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true to a point, except if you look at the top 9,  it's every other one is something.yahoo.com.  Oh yeah, that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the 9 best things on Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The 9 best things, you know, don't usually consist of 5 things from Yahoo as amongst the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what I like? I like the interface, the way you can click a number  and it jumps right to that part of the video. I think that's kind of neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is worth looking at. So people out there get something from this week's show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, I think they got a lot, including John C. Dvorak's recipe for flank steak a la Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it'll be coming up. I have to post it. I will get that site posted.  By this time next week, I'll have a bunch of recipes online. This week in cooking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twick. You know, there are a couple of things, there are a couple of new shows I would like to launch.  John and I have talked about relaunching triangulation,  and I think we're going to do that because it was very popular.  And then I would also like to do it. We've got to find a lawyer because I would really, I think,  somebody like Larry Lessig, he's obviously too busy to do it.  But don't you think there's enough kind of legal news to cover that weekly?  This week in law.  Twill.  Twill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know, maybe not. But it just seems like there's enough going on in the IP arena, IP law arena that.  It gets tedious.  It gets tedious.  It's kind of boring. That's why you need, it needs a good host.  It needs a, because you know, you don't want somebody pontificating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we can, you know, once a month it would be okay.  But you know, monthly it's going to be tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, I want to thank you all. I want to thank J.C., our junior correspondent, for showing up and turning us on.  He will talk a little bit after the after the theme song about his newest game, The Ship.  And we will see you all next week.  Oh, I didn't even mention the biggest story of the week.  The new Twitter website is here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you see it, John?  Yeah, I like it. I like it a lot.  I think it's very modern and advanced.  It looks like, you know, it looks like something new.  It doesn't look like a retro site.  It doesn't look like mine, which is like, looks like something from the 90s.  But I think it's hot.  And some people, I saw a couple of people complaining, but I think it's very, very.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's always somebody, you know, we have a poll on the site.  Do you like it?  And only 4% said bring back the old site.  81% said loved it.  So I think that I think it's been a hit.  It's, you know, I'm not so much concerned about how it looks as functionality,  because what we really had a problem with was you'd go to the site.  You wouldn't know what are the shows?  Where's the latest version?  What, you know, and this way it's very simple on the front page.  You can see the latest episode of each of the shows.  You can quickly go to a guide for all the shows.  Very easy.  And you can listen to the show right on the site, which is something we needed for a long time.  So thanks to Amber MacArthur, actually, and her team at Archetype who did the design.  I think her brother, Jeff, did the information architecture.  And I think that's really where it excels.  And then it is running on Drupal.  Ted Serbinski did a great job with that.  They're off to MTV Europe where they're working on a Drupal site for them.  And actually, they were very interested in how we survived.  You know, we were the number one dig story all day on Thursday when the site launched.  I mean, this is crazy.  I mean, I never beta tested the site.  We never had more than three people using it at the same time.  We just put it live all of a sudden.  And then all of a sudden it's the number one dig story.  We handled it beautifully.  I think I told you before, if it didn't launch in the middle of the night,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  because it hit the dig home page and went all the way down as new stories came up.  If it hit the dig home page during the middle of the day,  I think you would have had even more digs on that thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We were the top story, though.  We had something like two or three thousand.  We were the top story for the day anyway, 1500 maybe.  And got a lot of traffic.  I mean, our traffic was about triple what it normally is, but it scaled very nicely.  So I was encouraged.  So was so were the Lullabuck guys, because now they know that the MTV site will be able to handle the traffic to strong Drupal's very it's very robust.  It's got a good caching mechanism, which is one of the reasons it can handle the traffic.  So anyway, thanks to them.  And yeah, take a look at the new Twitter site.  No ads on it yet.  Basically, we're just, you know, except for ourselves, house ads, house ads.  It's all the ads are house ads.  You know, I could put a big Dvorak dot org banner on there.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, I'm all for it.  Dvorak dot org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anything you want to plug?  That was my limit.  I'm sorry.  It is your limit.  I'm hanging up on you right now.  David, David, go to revision three dot com.  And that's where you'll see system to control all chicken.  There is a cooking podcast with Alex Albrecht.  And that's pretty darn good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They just they just shot, oh, gosh, five or six new episodes.  They're in coast.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll look for those.  And of course, the screen, the closest thing to the screensavers anywhere is DL dot TV  with Patrick Norton and Robert Heron.  And I don't know where Patrick is.  Give him our regards.  What do you, Robert, when you see him next?  And we'll do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, I just did a good review of Samsung's new Blu-ray disc player.  Oh, you like it.  Juicy.  As a standalone player, it's awesome.  It's a great, great piece of hardware.  Great.  And I even get some insight into the formats.  And if you're lucky enough, though, one of those things, I put a cool Easter egg for  all the new titles that are out there to end up looking at some test patterns and stuff  to really get your TV dialed in there as well.  DL dot TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.  And I thank you all for joining us.  We'll see you next week.  Stay cool.  Another tweet is in the can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so my son, sir, he can do a review of Prey.  He's been playing.  Oh, that's great.  Bring him on.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That'd be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ship apparently is a fun game.  What's ship?  It's an online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're telling me it's an online death match type game that uses the Half Life 2 engine,  but it's done in kind of a cartoony cell shaded manner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you on a ship?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you're on a ship and you have to kill only one person and there's another person  who's trying to kill you, but you have to identify who the person is and also hopefully  not get killed by the person who's trying to identify you and kill you.  So there are other players on the ship?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  And they have their own missions to kill other people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, each person has one person to kill and one person that's going to kill them.  Is there friendly fire?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can they accidentally kill you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they can accidentally kill an innocent person who's not going to be killed by or  you're going to be killed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't figure out that the guy's after you because he's shooting at you because  it could just be some nitwit shooting at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and you kill him and you get punished for it because he's not the right one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So how do you find out the guy's after you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because when people start stalking another player, it's obvious because they start following  you everywhere and hoping that you're going to an empty room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why?  They can't kill you in front of other people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you have to do it without anyone else watching.  Oh.  Makes it kind of play out like Guess or Clue but with a cartoony vibe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It sounds like fun.  And so how do you lure somebody into a private space?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to watch them, follow them, and also there's a really interesting system that keeps  people from staying still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I was going to say because otherwise you'd just hang out with some other people  and you'd be safe.  Of course, you could never win but you'd never lose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It has a kind of the Sims needs system.  So every so often you get need for food.  Or you've got to pee.  Or drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've got to pee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got to pee!  The most stressful part?  You can't pee in front of other people so there you go.  You're vulnerable right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because all the stalls are full of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, so that would be a good place to get...  Probably people get murdered there a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not as much as when they have to go to sleep, which is the most stressful part of it.  Oh, you have to sleep?  Eventually sleep.  It takes 30 seconds and your screen's blacked out.  You can't do anything for 30 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're vulnerable for 30 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's just enough to make anybody go nuts there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like, crap, somebody's going to kill me.  So if you really want to win you just follow somebody until they have to go to sleep.  And hope you don't have to sleep first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and hope they don't realize that you're following them and then they turn around and kill you.  Because they can kill in self-defense but they can't kill ones that are just random people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is excellent. I want to play this ship, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The website is thisshiponline.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you have to buy it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's on Steam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's Steam, okay. Yeah, because it's Half-Life, right?  Yeah.  Oh, it just launched. It's a week old.  It's four days old. You are so with it, JC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I've been only playing it for four days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because that's how long you could.  So let me ask you this.  Do you want a career like your dad in journalism or what do you want to do when you head out into the world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm looking towards game design, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you're well prepared for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm imagining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just like his dad.  That sounds like fun. This devilish game challenges you to kill or be killed.  Finally, they're doing some innovative stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although...  Because it's the amateur game developers that are pulling out these weird ones.  This is a company that is garage...  That's excellent.  It's a valve. It's just somebody using this engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you buy the game online?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you can.  I don't know if it's in stores.  It probably isn't, right. 1995, it's cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, everybody, we're going to play the ship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll set up a local server. The closest one is in Dallas.  I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a great idea.  The Twitch.  The Twitch ship.  I'm going to Boston, but before I leave, I will leave the computer on running the ship.  And we'll call it... What do we call it? We'll call it Twitch Ship.  T-W-I-T-S-H-I-P. Is that a good name?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitch Ship.  I think I have enough bandwidth to make that worthwhile. I'll leave it on. We'll see what happens.  Can people hack me if I do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
