Transcript:  Amazon struggled with health haven't they for a while they had it looked like they were gonna get big  Maybe still looks like they're gonna get big into the health business. Maybe  regulatory  Snafus, but they go ahead you write about this in the book. I know

Start time: 401.36
End time: 435.15
Speaker: Jason Del Rey
Transcript:  Yeah, they they they're still going at it  I mean they just spent almost four billion for essentially a  Future looking doctor's chain, I mean one medical and  Walmart the same I mean the biggest issue at Walmart with their health care initiatives  Is that they can't keep a health leader more than like 18 months at the company?  Yeah, I think they've gone through like nine or ten and ten years, but they both want to be there. So  it's a space space I didn't know much about before reporting the book, but  Space I think they're both

Start time: 435.78
End time: 493.62
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Potentially could have profound impact in I think that the challenge really I've been thinking about this a little bit related to  medical  Specifically and I think that one of the problems is is that what Amazon does when it buys a company is usually  Drain out the goodness of it to to make it more efficient  You know  like let's take a little bit of the goodness out and then make it more efficient so that we can make more money at  It your margin is our is our opportunity and they squeeze that and you can feel that even when you go to Whole Foods  You go to Whole Foods and now you can't you know, you ever once a week you can actually get arugula  It's just something I put in my salads and there's some kind of supply chain thing there  And you know that they're just cutting corners somewhere like there's there that you know  And there's things that just run out and then some and then they're slowly turning Whole Foods into Trader Joe's, you know  They keep on adding 365  Brands and so on so forth and everything gets kind of dumbed down, you know  And and I think that that as a Trader Joe's lover will continue that conversation later  Anyway, so anyway, so I'm like if I want to go to Trader Joe's

Start time: 493.68
End time: 497.48
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Why do you hate what is what kind of evil person hates Trader Joe's?

Start time: 497.54
End time: 506.08
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I just want to pick I just what it's weird. It's a weird place. Anyway, so it's and it's it's like a weird layout  And it's all Trader Joe's stuff. What's wrong with you? Don't you like snacks with humorous names?

Start time: 506.24
End time: 507.12
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't like snacks actually

Start time: 507.36
End time: 562.96
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  No, I don't and and the thing is is that I have brands that I want and I have things that I want and I  Want to go and get the things that I the things that I want to have I want to have them  I don't want them all under one brand  And so I kind of feel like the Trader Joe's is like three blocks from Whole Foods in Novato  Feel like if I want to go to Trader Joe's I can go to Trader Joe's but I want to go to Whole Foods and buy  The the brands that and you just watch I'm just watching them slowly work those brands out and put their own own in and they  Make it harder to find the brands and as soon as it becomes hard to find the brand in Whole Foods  You know that there's gonna be a 365 brand that's gonna get added to where that one was, you know  Like the Nutella is gonna go away and they're gonna add their own version of Nutella and it's gonna be in there and so on  So or then and they just do this and so you just watch this thing  And I think the reason I bring this up is because I think people are more sensitive to that when it comes to medicine  So I think that that's why they have trouble with it as they

Start time: 564.46
End time: 567.88
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Pretzels would not be a bad product. I'm just saying I

Start time: 568.98
End time: 572.06
Speaker: Jason Del Rey
Transcript:  Think Trader Joe's would sell that not Whole Foods though. Exactly. Exactly

Start time: 573.20
End time: 634.36
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  So I think that I think that that's the challenge that they have with medicine is that people are a little bit more sensitive  You know a lot of people have  Anecdotally said that the some of the generic drugs are not as effective as the real drugs. They're like hey  I know that's not true saying but they're not it's not true. Is it?  No, it's now it's coming up in India. They have all kinds of problems with oh  They're identical, right they are supposed to be formulaically identical, but when they're made cheaply it turns out that they're not identical  It's so it's so the thing is baby laxative in my  Sawdust in there it's not as effective and so and I've I've had friends that have had you know  They've had all kinds of problems with those and so the thing is is that in the same sense though  I think that the problem is people get sensitive when they think that that it might affect their health or that might kill  Yeah, they're more sensitive you cutting quarters. And so I think that that's where health is  You know gets a little more complicated, you know for them, you know  You know, and I think that that's gonna be continue to be a challenge because they're so margin  formulaically  Pointed you know, wow

Start time: 634.70
End time: 643.70
Speaker: Denise Howell
Transcript:  That's the first I've heard of that and I am now concerned for the entire health insurance industry  That only covers generic drugs

Start time: 645.62
End time: 659.48
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I pretty much because I'm on Kaiser which is a health maintenance organization in HMO and the West Coast  Pretty much all I can get is generic  But it saves you a lot of money I hope I'm getting medicated

Transcript:  The last thing I had no idea. I really thought they were they were identical

Start time: 671.74
End time: 718.50
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  But they should be  It's just that there's I had India that we have a problem with right? I don't know  I mean, there's no margin in in generic drugs  There's no money in generic drugs  And so when there's no money in something you can expect the quality to be there to vary  You know, like I don't want to channel RFK jr. Or anything. I'm not I'm not that but I'm not trying to do that  I but I have I specifically have a that's not this you had a that's Joe  right a friend who had a mother who had a you know, also, you know, she was and she had drugs for that and sometimes they  Worked and sometimes they get some things are really effective and sometimes they weren't and as they started talking about it  they started realizing that oh, you know the  The you know the formula wasn't that it was damaging it was just that it wasn't  Some batches weren't effective. Yeah, you know and they were they were varying enough that it was a problem

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Tech news  There was a there was a lot happening this week and I was unfortunately out of pocket for three days  Jason Howell our producer said  Hey, Jason Dale Ray's coming on and there's nothing  It's Saturday and there's nothing to talk about I said don't worry I will be  retroactively going through the news  and in fact a lot of stuff happened, but I kind of wanted to put the Amazon and Walmart stuff up front because  Jason is an expert on  All of that Amazon. I think the big story for Amazon this week is the EU is  Is mad because they say Amazon Prime is using  Dark patterns actually, I'm sorry the US the US it's us  FTC  FTC robot and yeah, the iRobot's EU. I get them all confused. Okay, actually  This is Lena cons FTC suing Amazon over manipulative tactics  Used to enroll millions in prime according to the Wall Street Journal  Using dark patterns not so much to get you in but to make it hard to get out  Unfortunately the filing the FTC filing was heavily redacted  Did you look at it Jason? Oh, I I

Start time: 853.30
End time: 916.36
Speaker: Jason Del Rey
Transcript:  Attempted to yeah, there was more black than I don't know what but yes. Yeah, so  Definitely an issue. I mean they they are alleging, you know in some cases, especially  You know when someone thinks they're signing up for just prime video  They're got kind of getting pushed in the direction of the more extreme  Offering and a couple other tricks and  Other dark patterns using on the way in to get people signed up  But then they were also alleging that the  16 step cancellation process which Amazon has largely corrected  I think the FTC alleging not until April of this year. So  So yeah that that was not necessarily the FTC  So yeah that that was not necessarily the FTC  complaint that many people watching this dynamic were expecting but perhaps just the first of two with with  Something on the antitrust front coming eventually that we've been waiting. I'm curious because I

Start time: 918.18
End time: 925.72
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Think politically this might not be the first thing I would have filed as the FTC because I think people correct me if I'm wrong

Start time: 925.86
End time: 951.66
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I think they like Amazon Prime. I mean I didn't know people actually got the video service without the without the shipping service  I thought the video service just kind of came for free with the shipping service because I've had the shipping service  Like since it started me too, and then I got video and then I know I get video  But if they killed that if they killed the video part or separated it out, I wouldn't get it anymore  I'd be like, okay, whatever you get a lot you get Amazon Prime members get unlimited photo storage

Transcript:  Yeah, and we have we have one being built in our town, but we have many others  But in some parts of the country, I mean I had a piece on this last year  Today prime just sort of completely went away and the company's just not saying and it's not better than today  It's it's become worse and actually had a former Amazonian logistics and a data analyst  Volunteer to do a little test and study for me and  In some parts of Washington State and some other regions in the country just with the pandemic  I kind of just went away for good  But companies not I was never able to figure out exactly what's going on there. But for many people  Like Alex is saying it Alex is saying it it has gone faster. It's just it's kind of look of it's inconsistent

Start time: 1033.92
End time: 1053.66
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Living right and I definitely feels like it's it's it's a it's definitely a cost center for Amazon  Hmm, I don't know if they make money on  Prime and they certainly are trying to push you to for instance delivery day saying oh everything comes on Monday  It all comes on Monday. That'll save you gas and stuff

Start time: 1055.02

Start time: 1099.52
End time: 1118.56
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's so part like and I think that the lock-in for Amazon is on the other side too  Like you go to Whole Foods and you drop off your your stuff  You don't want and that at first I was like  How does this make them money because they asked you not to even put the box put them back in the box  You know, they're not going back on, you know, they say don't put them in the box. Just bring them over  Yeah, no, no, they don't throw them out I actually had a conversation with someone about this

Start time: 1119.16
End time: 1124.00
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 1124.83
End time: 1166.64
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  No, no  They they there's a box at at Whole Foods and they scan them and throw them in scan them throw them in scan them throw them  It'll never come out of that box. It goes to it goes to a bot  It goes somewhere and people get people who sell stuff on yeah eBay, right? They get told what's in it  Told what the condition is but they're told like hey  There's a whole bunch of stuff in here and then and this is the price of the box like you take it or leave it  You know, you know, and then they go and they buy it and it's it's a fraction. You know pennies on the dollar  That's a good way to recycle it. That's better than the Chinese kids burning it and causing cancer  Yeah, they know they're selling it back in it  They're injecting it back into eBay and they're letting people do whatever they're gonna do with it  But people get to see what's in it because they scanned it. It's a very efficient system  But I was still like they're losing a lot of money. They're not there's you know, that's or it felt like they're

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Or save money this is gonna cost you huge but what I realized is I am super resistant to buying anything  That's on Amazon anywhere else because if I buy it, right, I know that I can just take a thing whole foods  I'm gonna go pick up my Arula. Yeah, and I can I get and I can and I just drop it off and move on  And I'm like, oh, I'm gonna ask Jason

Start time: 1188.40
End time: 1205.08
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But my guess is Amazon does a lot of these things that seemed like a very good idea in the early stage of  Shitification when they were trying to build their customer base  But late stage Amazon these are cost centers that they would love to get rid of Jason. Am I right? Yeah, they've they've been they've been I mean they've

Start time: 1206.04
End time: 1261.37
Speaker: Jason Del Rey
Transcript:  They've given us this convenience, but you're right. It has become you know problematic as they scale  and so you see, you know, we do ups drop off for free in our town and  No packaging nothing. Although my wife actually will package stuff up just to get rid of  The cardboard all the cardboard that we have and I don't know if that's doing anything better for the environment  But she likes to think it is  But now they're experimenting with charging charging again a dollar for ups drop-offs or you know, we have we have a big delivery  If we bring it to Kohl's it's free  But if we bring it to ups now, it's gonna be seven bucks  And so they are you know, the return logistics is is super costly and I think they're still  They're still trying to sort it now as they cut costs in other areas. Yes, it's it's expensive  but but it's like like Alex was saying, I mean, it's such a lock-in just to  know  You can order 77

Transcript:  Dude same thing how hard it was to cancel  I'll read you that. Let me make it the dark pattern or the let me read you the complaint  A part of it the part that we can see underneath the black marker from the Wall Street Journal  The complaint alleged that Amazon used quote manipulative coercive or deceptive user interface designs known as dark patterns and  Quote to dupe users into automatically renewing prime subscriptions  Amazon leadership slowed or rejected changes that would have made it easier for users to cancel prime  Because those changes adversely affected Amazon's bottom line  They talk about  How many clicks to to get Amazon Prime which is a couple?  Compared to how many clicks at least until April to cancel Amazon Prime which was a four page six click  15 option  cancellation process Amazon internally  Called the Iliad flow  in a reference to Homer's endless Trojan War story  The  Agency said the quote labyrinthine  Procedure and quote was designed to make it cumbersome and confusing for customers to cancel prime  So go ahead Denise explain to us. What are what are dark patterns and why are they wrong?

Finally the FTC is cracking down on Amazon Prime  It was you know, it was the same problem with zero rating back in the day when  Telecom companies would not charge you bandwidth costs for certain streaming services  Which to a consumer is hey, that's great. What's wrong with that?  But if you're a competing streaming service that doesn't get that it's like see they're putting their thumb on the scale  very hard to tell consumers  This isn't good for you I've tried to explain zero why zero rating is bad for years and it's with little success  Here's the website deceptive dot design. I've referred to many times. This is I love it is a  hall of shame of dark patterns and  There are a lot of them  There are a lot of them. In fact 24 for Google 20 for Facebook 17 for Amazon 12 for Microsoft  The the Trump campaign has nine LinkedIn has eight Instagram has eight Apple seven and  That's just what's in the hall of shame. This is a great site if you're confused about why dark patterns are a bad thing  And apparently there are you know?  Federal laws against our parents in the US as in the EU  There are laws against deceptive practices, right? That's why this is called deceptive design not dark patterns. Yeah. Yeah. Yes

This is the problem with government regulation. I am NOT anti regulation by any means  but there's always this risk that the government will be slow and heavy-handed and  misunderstand the problem

Start time: 2027.82

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I don't think that the government is is capable of it trying to be honest and I think the problem isn't so much they don't  Care that they're wrong. It's just the to what Denise was kind of talking  I don't think the tools to do this  Well, like I don't think that they have and and when you when it has to go through that process  It's it may look like a scalpel when you started talking  But by the time you get you know by the time it becomes law  It's a dull broadsword that you're just swinging around and it you know  I think that that's the real the real problem with a lot of these things  I think that we have to think about what's safe for kids something obviously if you look at the data  Something obviously is going wrong like something is going horribly wrong and it starts at about 2013 and the and then that's you know  Depression starts spiking all you know all kinds of problems have happened because of online  Access we don't know exactly I don't think anybody knows there's other communities. I mean, there's a lot of discussion about that  No one really understands the math of what it is because it's not clear whether it's Facebook or it's Twitter  Just messages, you know, like like just going back and forth  But but there's something going wrong, but I don't know if the government is the has the the apparatus  You know to actually make any meaningful change, you know

I think you want to encourage innovation  Sometimes that means antitrust regulation so that new companies can sprout up  But sometimes it means you punish the innovators in a way that discourages other innovators.

Start time: 2143.00
End time: 2177.66
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Right. Well, and and I think I think sometimes we I think one thing we oftentimes mix  Miss with regulation is regulations very hard to manage  Tort is actually really effective  So companies being afraid of being sued actually often makes more change than companies  You know when you start suing companies for things that they're not doing  So sometimes I think that the government needs to think about not so much regulation but taking away protections like hey  We're not gonna protect you for doing the things that you're doing and we're gonna let people sue you for it  And I think that one of the things that and I I'm gonna I come from family lawyers

Transcript:  but when you you know like the the when you  You look at like the one that most people make fun of is the McDonald's suit about the hot coffee  Yeah hot coffee, but when you get into the details of it  It is a completely reasonable thing that the jury came up with which is I think it was one day of coffee  You know like the cost the the how much McDonald's makes on one day of coffee because they won't make they won't make the water  It's literally you know a little bit cooler because they think that because it'll last longer  You know so so that's so they've decided that that's just the way they're gonna do it  They had they had tons of things ahead of times  But what happens is is that people start lawsuits force people to start thinking about force companies to start thinking about it  So I think the real problem we get into is when we start limiting torts  You know and say you can't sue for a lot of money. You can't cause real pain for corporations  Then I think because I think that's a much more of a scalpel than  Government regulation which is that when someone's doing something stupid  You could it's gonna be get really expensive and when they have to write that big check  They have to make it you know someone goes back and says let's not do that again  You know and and that's the I think that that's one of the things I think you still need regulation  But I think sometimes in the finer details of things  You know because I know a lot of companies that spend a lot of time not doing things  Not because that there's a lot. It's just they don't want to get sued

Start time: 2261.80
End time: 2278.54
Speaker: Denise Howell
Transcript:  You know like you know Alex the problem with that is if you take that to its logical conclusion  You do away with section 230 of the Communications Decency Act because a lot of these companies are protected from  Tort actions by that law and that's right, you know

Start time: 2279.64
End time: 2310.72
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Again, I think it's a balance. I don't think it's I don't think it's an all-or-one  I think but when we look at some of these things because I am a huge  Proponent of 230 so I think that 230 should not be messed with I don't think it's perfect  I think it's broken, but I don't think we should touch it because  If we pull one little pin out of that we have no idea what's going to happen to what we're doing  So I completely agree with you there. I don't think that torts are the only answer  I just think that sometimes they come in and they start  Making things that they can handle things sometimes when we think about regulation  I think sometimes we have to think about that process as well

But that is a great story  I do want to wrap up the Lena Kahn report card because Axios Pro had a very interesting  Article this week about this on the negative the FTC which went after Metta's acquisition of within  Met the FTC gave up  and said alright fine  And we're gonna cover this but more recently if you've been watching the testimony in the Activision Blizzard  Administrative law case it has not been going well for I believe for the FTC's case. They're trying to block the acquisition  That will be interesting to watch that  And then Axios points out  Yeah, she's two years in but she may only have two more years because we've got a presidential election in 2024  so  This stuff takes a long time and she may not have enough time to

I don't mean young look at her schedule  When has she actually like in commerce? Yeah, she's an academic  She has no she you know and academics very rarely understand how companies run, you know  and so I think that she's getting a mixture of being heavy-handed in places that she doesn't understand and  Also losing because as soon as you start unwrapping this you realize how this is really complicated  You know and so and that's what an applicant what happened to an academic when they get into into actual production is like they open  It up and they're like, oh, this is this was so simple when I was writing a book

Speaker: Jason Del Rey
Transcript:  Mean there was there was a to me a compelling argument that the framework we've been using  To establish  Antitrust wrongs in the last few decades  Is not sufficient to kind of rein in some of some of what might be problematic with the companies today  You know just just back to the prime the prime case that that  lawsuit that they just filed, you know, what's interesting to me is and  Someone saw someone commenting publicly  I'm forgetting his name and this is gonna sound like a not nice way to describe his role  But basically he runs what's essentially a front front group for Amazon and Google  Policy, but he was saying why you know, she could have just said she's they've settled with all these other companies  Why didn't they just settle with Amazon on this and I did wonder if while prime is really beloved if  She went after this first related to Amazon because it's something more, you know  The average person can understand at least know that yeah, they at least know the name. Yeah. Yeah  but  Yeah, I think it's too early to grade her but I think I think there are fair concerns about  Some of the selections they've made so far  My big thing for me in my world is  Does she get the do they have the manpower to first of all really go?  Through with a suit with this and then a separate antitrust suit  And will she have enough time, right?

Transcript:  Companies who say well, we've got to stop that we need tort reform and we need to stop regulation  they want to take all the tools away, right and  and and I think  Maybe I don't have an opinion on Lena con but I do think it's about time we somebody  At least said big tech is running rampant unchecked. Maybe we should look at this. I mean look we're technology  Podcasts I've based my entire career  covering tech  I like tech. I think we get a lot of benefit from big tech  I don't think there's any company in the world except Apple that could have created the vision Pro  I mean, there's a certain value to size  but at the same time there's a huge value to innovation and competition and  I believe in that too. So that's why it's this is such a challenge, right?  It's it and government seems like not an ideal tool. I mean, I'm glad to see government involved  You know, they should say something if you see something say something but whether that'll be enough to be effective  I don't know at least it'll raise people's awareness, you know, if nothing else people now looking at well if I wanted to cancel prime  What would I have to do is?  Prime still most the problem with prime is nobody ever thinks about it. Like I'm yeah just every year. I'm gonna renew  I'm sure it's worth it

Transcript:  Well, and I and I think that there's some things just the government showing people what's going on  I think a lot of makes a lot of precisely  California makes a lot of bad laws  but one of the good laws that they do make is  You have to show the calories for everything that you're selling at a restaurant and I gotta tell you there's things that I look  At that I used to I used to think were healthy and I look at I go whoa  I'm not gonna eat that anymore, you know, they didn't have to go. You just feel bad though. No, no  It is definitely made significant changes of my behavior based on yeah on looking at food and just going that's  Yeah, if nothing else no like and that's the value right but I think that's that's very valuable and I think that that should be  Nation. I mean, I think that just doing those kinds of things where you really show people like what's actually happening there  I think makes is where the government can be very effective is research and publishing information information

Oh Leo told me to say to it. I saw it on Twitter  Denise howl Alex Lindsey Jason Del Rey since we're talking about  Lena con we should probably talk about the  Activision hearings of Microsoft Activision acquisition  testimony began this week and  Wow  Don't think it's going well for the FTC  Among other things revealed now. It's not a trial right? There's an administrative judge, so it's more like a hearing  But the judge will decide if if the action to block the acquisition goes forward  Here's this from the verge Tom Warren, I guess is in the courtroom. We're only minutes into the hearing  We've already had a bombshell revelation  Jim Ryan of PlayStation  says  Blocking the acquisition isn't about exclusives  According to Sony that's all it's about according to a newly unsealed email within internal email  Microsoft's lawyers reveal the exchange between  PlayStation chief Jim Ryan and Chris Dearing former CEO of Sony computer entertainment  Ryan said in the email quote. It's not an exclusivity play at all  They're thinking bigger than that and they have the cash to make moves like this  I've spent a fair amount of time with both Phil Spencer and Bobby Kotick over the past day  I'm pretty sure we'll continue to see Call of Duty on PlayStation for many years to come  Oh, I'm sure they'll be able to do that  PlayStation for many years to come. Oh no as  As my lawyer as my internet lawyer Denise, you probably would advise me not to put thoughts like that in writing

There was a cons about the console wars  But it was about the future of cloud gaming  Whose future I might as pretty cloudy after Google pulled out with stadia  Mike as Sony doesn't really have a strong play in cloud  I don't and it's not a big market for Microsoft either at this point  So the UK's kind of out and left field on this  Among other testimony at this at this hearing it's really kind of fascinating  Phil Spencer was pressed to kind of for a long time Microsoft said no, it's a three  player game there's  Xbox PlayStation and Nintendo switch a lot of people say the switch is not a console  Microsoft would like it to be a console because if it is then they're number three in the market at some point they got  they got Spencer to agree that  That Microsoft was losing the console wars  which is  FTC's lawyer asked Spencer has as Microsoft lost the console wars  Spencer paused for ten seconds again from Tom Warren in the verge to gather his thoughts and  Said I thought a very very  Judicious statement and the verge decided to put it right next to his picture as  The console wars is a social construct with the community. I would never want to count our community out  They're big fans  If you look at our market share in the console space over the last 20 plus years we're in third place  He didn't want to say we've lost but he didn't want to say we've won

I hope the judge it's up to this administrative judge  I hope the judge is hearing this and says yeah, no Sony no  This was just an anti-competitive measure  Even your own country Japan has approved the the acquisition let it go through. I mean, I don't have an opinion  I don't care whether Microsoft gets Activision or not, but  Just thought it was  It's kind of don't commit it to writing if you don't want it to show up in discovery.

I watch a lot of them mostly to go  In five seconds. I understand in five seconds. I understand what that product is  I understand what the solve is I understand what it does and it does it better than almost anything I've ever seen so from an education  Education  These are basically on Twitter or powerful  Yeah  they're super powerful and everyone who does education should watch these ads because I  Look at him and I go look at look at the edits are perfect, you know to show how this works

Yeah, so that behavior will kill that bookstore  And so the one place that is like which is I find the irony  Thick in the fact that Amazon started as a book a book thing  And it's the one thing if I'm at a bookstore  I'm like I'm going to buy this book from this from this reseller because I I like the fact like Denise was talking about  I like going into book a great bookstore like the best bookstore in California as far as I'm concerned as builders bookstore in Berkeley  It's all designer design and architecture and everything else and you know gardens and stuff like that  I love going in there because it's so well curated  And I think this is where companies have to figure out where they're gonna be in that area  Yeah, I have a relation. You know I know the owner. I've seen him for the last 25 years  I I buy one book when I come in like I know I'm gonna buy a book

Yeah, no it's it's a  Incredible if you're a designer that's an incredible store. There's there's a whole section on topography like just  Okay, but what I would say is that is that there's there what's interesting about that is that?  Is that I think that's where companies who are trying to be successful have to figure out  What's how can I have a niche that I just own?  Own you know not not how do I do how do I have every book out there?  That's not like tattered cover in Denver is not I don't I gotta show you I gotta take a break

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  It's it's some of it  I mean, I think that what what we were really, you know doing on our end was to build  Clickable items within a movie so that if you're watching a movie and you see something  You would get into the habit of I can just push a button down and I can select Brad Pitt shirt

Start time: 4881.32
End time: 4888.40
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, like like what is that?  First but then there's an opportunity to buy well and the idea is it's totally passive

Start time: 4889.02
End time: 4965.96
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  You don't it doesn't run into you  It just is you just get to a point where you know it and I think that Amazon is actually really close to this working  So they have x-ray inside of Amazon Prime where you can see all the actors  What they haven't added there is you'll show you all the actors in the scene  Well, it wouldn't take very much for them to add all the items in the scene, you know, like, you know  So these are these are all these are all the relevant items  Maybe that's the whole purpose  That might be what they're kind of getting towards is figuring that model out and it wouldn't take them very  It's a little bit of work  Yeah  but when you talk about product placing product placement gets really competitive when the idea is do I have a product that's in there but  Not only that I wanted to make sure that it's in Amazon  So that you can select it you can just hit and what will happen is the idea is is that it leaves it as a  Passive experience someone doesn't have to do anything and if it was successful enough  You'd end up with a situation where I never have to run ads because there's enough sales. There's enough CTR to  There's a high enough CTR to make that work, you know click-through rate where you have  Basically, you have all these hot these hot items and you know  You sell a thousand shirts because Brad Pitt was wearing it, you know  That's what we that's what we started working on 20 years ago and no one's done it yet  or partially because Apple got it out the quick time in the case of Chris Evans

Start time: 5151.90
End time: 5242.46
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Yeah, so the the story is is that for I and I'm not sure which platform but basically it is the  The sorting of where the stream starts sorts into that community. So in in China, so it's regional  It's a regional stream and so what they're doing is they want to be in the region where there's a lot of potential buyers  So they may not live there  With their phone there the way that the algorithm works is that it's trying to only show them in that region  So they go to the regions and they're like under a you know  There's somewhere under the highway  But in the region that they need to be in so that they can reach the the buyers for that specific  So they're trying to game basically game the gaming the system. Yeah  Yeah, they're attempting to yeah, absolutely  But the scale the scale of of yes the scale is  Kind of unbelievable in China. There must be a hundred other that's why everyone's interested  They can't figure out how to do it in the United States. Yep  And it may have to do I think with the reach the quality of the retail outlets in China are not as you know  There's not the same level. It's harder to find the things that you need necessarily of  That are specific verticals and so because of that there's more friction in being able to get them that the online  Streaming might make more sense  But it's it's a it's it's an like as a live streamer. We watch  live streaming in China all the time we watch the trends because we're everyone's trying to figure out how to crack that because that's  Like a very big golden egg

It was tik-tok  It was YouTube again this year and it's not you don't see mr. Beast there anymore, right? You don't see the established youtubers  You see the up-and-coming the hungry  streamers there  But there are long lines  You go into the conference.

One was  Some ghost hunters YouTube video. I don't remember what the other was the  The audience is filled with screaming fans  And I was watching the ghost hunters when they said well, we got our video  We're gonna put it up in a couple of days. You want to see it now and the fans are  But what's really clear is that these are all very narrow niches  That have this very strong fan base and there's probably hundreds of them  Yeah, it's a long tail lives. Yeah, it is. I mean we're the we're the long tail, right? I mean we don't  When we started there was nobody  Hardly doing podcasting so it was easy to get a big audience now. There's a lot more shows  And you know, we still have a large audience relative to 90% of the other podcasts out there  But it's it's definitely sliced up more but if you're one if you want a podcast about tech news, there's only a handful  So we're in you know, we're in that niche  It's just to me.

Transcript:  I think that's impressive  But I what I really think is impressive if we watch someone like mr. Beast where it's not that he has one big movie  It's that everything he puts out gets 30 million or more views is kind of a thing like it like that is a like he has  A model that that actually works over and over and over again

Transcript:  It's interesting, but but it's so see this no see you talk about succession, which is great writing great dramaturgy great acting  Direction everything so much energy and thought goes into even the smallest prop and you create a masterpiece  But the number of views of succession is  Infinitesimal compared to mr. Beast  You know  Getting a thousand deaf people to hear for the first time 89 million views or ages 1 to 100 fight for half a million dollars  143 million views more people saw that  Ten times more people saw that than saw succession and but but I don't know if I want media to become mr. Beast  Why would you make succession if you said well, why am I doing why am I working for peanuts here? I?  Paid a real assassin to try to kill me a hundred fifty seven million views

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Well, and again it but I mean if successions making money, then that's great  I think that the challenge really is is can we keep on making as much narrative?  Will the market support as much narrative as coming out a succession is not the problem  It's for all the little things below that that it's unclear whether those become viable. Yeah, I

Transcript:  was reading the  review of the new Indiana Jones movie I  Think was in the New Yorker and he quoted Pauline Cale's review of the original Indiana Jones  which was when  1981 something like that  It's called whipped which is by the way the SEO on this title is wow god  God awful and yet it is a brilliant title for a review of a movie about Indiana Jones, right?  But in it she says something that I think is very interesting. I've already told you this Alex on Macbreak weekly, but I'm gonna mention it again  This is the lead the marketing executives are the new high priests of the movie business  Her thesis is you can't make a movie  This is 1981 if you don't go first to the marketing people say can you market this and?  If they say no you don't make it  So she says right now the easier product a project looks to market the easier is to finance which means and this is in 1981  all you're gonna see is horror movies and  fantasy films and  It's the end she says for prestige pictures  You know that offer middle-class group therapy like ordinary people in the Four Seasons. Do you remember the Four Seasons?  No, you don't with Alan Alda. No, you don't but do you remember Indiana Jones in the Temple of Doom? Absolutely

Transcript:  But I would argue though  I mean  this is this is a little bit of Eric Hollywood arrogance for today because they all talk about this and  The fact that streaming now has has created a huge market for things that would traditionally fail and the movie theater and we can actually watch  It you know and because those that because it doesn't have to make money directly  So there there's a downside to not making money directly  Which is that this is why the writers are on strike is because they want to get paid  For how many views and how many people watch it and everything else?  But the upside is is that you can there is a it's a distributed risk across the media production pipeline  So you're the the the streamers are not losing, you know, unless they they mess up on everything  You know as long as they keep on as long as Disney keeps on putting out something like Mandalorian every eight weeks  All the other stuff that they're experimenting with  Is is all kind of like just kind of filling those those things in and making sure you have something new to watch  We're seeing more behind the scenes. I love behind the scenes  I didn't more behind the scenes now  Than we've ever seen before because Disney has decided that that's a product and so they're putting up that that because that just adds to  The value of your membership, you know, and so now we get all these back behind

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Don't think that that's I mean I think that again for feature films  You're you're 100% right. The problem is is that you know, so features are you know, the business because they're so expensive like the theater  The theater business is in all kinds of trouble like the house is on fire  you know and it's because the the they've kind of the only thing they have left is action films and  People are getting tired of those like if you look at what happened to flash like people aren't automatically going to  one of the you know the  MCU or whatever, you know, they're not doing that automatically anymore because they and DC Comics or DC Universe  But the they're not automatically going to these things because they're they're worn out. They're worn out of these of these effects effects heavy films  Whether they say their effects or not  There's a lot of effects in all these films and they're getting worn out of these high-pressure films  And so they're going to the movies, you know  They they you know did well after kovat because everyone missed it but it's not gonna keep going that way  You know and and so that because it you know, it's all it's a it's a mono  Mono supply, you know, there's not there's not any  All the other stuff is going to streaming like that's where you put things now if it if it's got heartstrings you put it in

Transcript:  Streaming, you know, and of course get a budget for it. The reason I'm very aware of this is because this this week  I was at VidCon and Disneyland  Which are app is it right VidCon's long tail?  niche  Disney's interested in how many toys can we make based on this property?  How many rides can we make and I'm and you go to Disney and it's and it's I mean  The kid may get a $250 lightsaber

Transcript:  $250 but but I think on the other side of that like the interest like for instance  I love this show called chef's table like it's just an incredible. Yes. I watched it because of you. Yeah, that's on Netflix  Yeah, it's a great show. It would never be made for TV. Like that would never have an audience  You know on TV and Netflix it makes sense for them to do it  The but also when you go to YouTube and you look at Veritasium or Tom Scott or Rick Beato or yeah  Yeah, you know  These are all verticals that that don't exist in the real you know  They don't exist in the broadcast world that are that bring a lot of value a lot of Mark Rober

Transcript:  I think it's gonna get harder and harder for Hollywood to make films that make a difference  I think that there's a I just don't want to see all mr. Beast all the time  No, I don't think I don't think that's what you're gonna see in YouTube because I mean  I most people I talked to he has all those followers most people I talked to in the real world don't know who he is  I know it's like that's how like so you know like you got to get like he has all these viewers and all this  Backing and most people don't know even know that that he's around you know  And so the thing is if I talk to my parents about it  Mr. Beast you know and so but that's how how vast that that group is now what I will say is that  It's gonna get harder and harder because I think that we're about to go into hyperinflation when it comes to  Content you know content is gonna become less and less valuable on its own the the community is more important than the content at this point  And you know and which is you know it's just it's a commodity that is now  The ability to produce it is going to you know with AI with all the tools becoming easy with everybody in the heavy making  podcasts like us  There's there the value of it is gonna be very challenging and you know it's it's a that's gonna be the biggest problem for Hollywood  Is is how do you keep?

Start time: 6604.52
End time: 6693.84
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I think somewhat of a problem. I mean the hard part for them is that they don't it's very hard to get a it's very hard to  Move your audience from one platform to another  So if you decide those platforms spend a lot of like if I post a youtube link in twitter  I know that i'm going to be penalized for the next week  Like my twitter the number of people who see my twitter and the for you page is going to want you to buy like 90  Percent you just get really penalized by it. And so  so I think that you know, so  Sending people off the you know off the system is very  you know complicated there and so and that happens in facebook that happens in and so and and the problem is like facebook is one of  the worst because you  You get a huge following and now you have to pay to even get a hold of the people that followed you and like that is  Just I mean and and they have you locked in there's no way to get a hold of them  There's no you know, and you can't even get to them all anymore  um, so it's a really dark hole for creators that are on facebook and instagram, I think but the  You know twitter is a little bit more fluid and I think youtube is probably the best for them because it doesn't make an attempt to  Contact most of their followers when it when they put out another video  But it's still that is a problem where they don't have a solid. I don't think that they actually need everybody's email  They don't think they want it with gdpr  I don't think that they actually I think they think they want it but managing that is going to be really complicated  So you want someone to hold on to that without you having access to it?  But what you do want to do is say I want to email everybody and know that it will go to everybody  And everyone will know and I think that's something that's missing right now

I think is the old monday night football team  So they so they really pulled um, so they brought not only do they bring a great announcer  They brought the production team that's going to make it actually work  Um, or maybe it's the sunday night football game. I think it's actually sunday night football team came to the thursday night football team  Um, you know to the production team, um, you know kind of took it over so  Uh, because monday night football has not really been a thing espn kind of  Like a little espn toy at this point  Um, but the sunday night football has been the big one like that's been the state of the art  This is as good as live video gets a lot of us watch that as the ultimate live experience

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Well, and that's the I mean and those that's kind of how those deals happen  You know, you don't they don't want to keep on negotiating them. So they're like five or ten years  It's kind of the the standard standard fare  but  What it does allow them to do by not doing any broadcast  It doesn't limit them to broadcast and and what I mean by that is the broadcast pipeline the I mean someone who does this a lot  the broadcast pipeline is so limited, you know by you know, the frame rates the  the um resolutions the all the all the production is really really limited when you go into into broadcast  Just because they don't have the money to upgrade as fast as you can do bits  And so you just you you can make the bits better all the time. And so we're seeing  If you have a 4k tv with you know  The stuff you're going to keep on seeing it get better and better and better off of your  You know device your apple tv or whatever you're going to watch it on is going to keep on getting better  Because they can evolve only the truck. They don't have to involve  They don't have to improve the entire pipeline to get to your tv  And that gives them a huge advantage and that's why apple like mls is going to make a ton of sense for apple  As the headset comes in is because they're going to be able to integrate it and they don't have to argue with any

Anyway advertising rates 20 higher than previous  Cbs was the previous and fox the previous broadcaster  But amazon will not allow  Advertising that encourages glamorizes or depicts excessive excessive consumption of alcohol.

Helps small brands be noticed and can improve the experience  But uh to some some sellers it just seems like an extra tax another amazon tax because they can  But yes, they are an abyss.

Transcript:  Listen I think um  This this feels like an inflection point at the company or at least has yes  You have the jesse transition you have the layoffs you have the cost cutting and investment areas like previous investment areas like alexa  um  I think it's I think it's unclear to me how far they'll go down this path  but but you know, I was talking talking about this recently with a former executive amazon executive and uh,  He was described, you know, he was saying people go people a lot of most people go to that site  They're in and out and uh the experience actually  For a lot of people is they're still finding exactly what they want because they're not browsing they're going in and out. Um,  but  Yeah, you look at that site today  and  It's not pleasant right and so so I think there's an argument to me bae that  That there's some stuff they're doing including the ad business because they can and um  You know we'll see I I you know  I'm very interested to see what the next year under andy jesse is like because he he's gone through this cost cutting exercise over  The past year and now he has a chance to show what what amazon under andy jesse looks like and uh beyond  Cost cutting if he doesn't want to just be remembered for that how much

Transcript:  Yeah, you know  It's very interesting because  There was there was an article in the wall street journal  Maybe six or nine months ago about jesse cutting costs and really examining overspending and lack of discipline  And there was an amazon board member quoted in the piece, you know saying like and this is you know  We're behind andy and it just felt very um stage managed  Yeah  Yes, and that perhaps  You know perhaps the easy man to blame, you know with the undisciplined spending and the over expansion of  of you know, the warehouse network, uh was  was the ceo is no longer in charge and uh,  You know doesn't seem like something like that could could  make bezos unhappy these days when he's off on a uh, 500 million dollar yacht and  And doing all the other things he's doing in his life. So  Um, I think jesse had  you know, he came in and some executives left because he went into the weeds on businesses where  uh  Bezos had long just let these lieutenants do what they want and um  So I I do believe this is this he is not, you know, this is not, you know, he's not a puppet  You know, this is this is his company now  And so we'll see how long that lasts  But uh, that's what it feels like to me right now and what best as I can tell that all that said like morale is  Not good inside the company really? Um, no, I mean  Layoffs are one thing but has it ever been?  Uh, I would or you know, I heard the stories about executives crying at their desks, but  That is sure. No, sure. Like it's a absolutely is a tough culture, but you you would talk to i've talked to  Tons of people over the years who do well there and they take the pros and the cons of the work culture  you know sort of in stride and and  I would say yeah during during years where um early years of  alexa or um  Early years of prime there were people really excited about their job every day. They try to avoid jeff bezos  and his question mark emails, but um  I'd say in in large swaths of the company  I don't know that morale has been worse and I think beyond the layoffs. I think it hasn't gotten any worse. There we go  I mean, I think the community the communication what I talk I talked to some people there and there are people who like  Working there and I talked to some folks when the layoffs happen and they said it's not even that we had layoffs like  We weren't going to grow forever unchecked  but  Just the terrible communication and lack of communication just the execution of it was  Just atrocious and just uh, so

That's no  Said never no one ever, you know, like they're like we got into amazon and we got ground into a little you know  Pulp, you know, and now they take amazon's got this thing where they they rotate your you know  I work with folks. They rotate your salespeople  All the time like they just so you never know who you're like you'll get  Embedded and someone understands how your business works and you're talking to them every week  And then like six months into it. They're like, oh there's a new salesperson and it's like some  I'm like what happened and and and it and it just and then I just stopped having meetings with them because I was like  I'm tired of that like I don't want to why talk to a salesperson if I if you're going to keep on changing  Like I'll just tell you when I need something, you know, it just yeah

Transcript:  Very big the right the right to a day in court. I don't know how you fix the book  I don't I don't know how you fix the problem  but I definitely think they have the right to  Figure it out like to hash it out with them  Um, i'd i'd rather see it done in court than necessarily than trying to have the fdc or the eu try to figure out how  To fix it. I think that um, I think that the chances of winning are pretty low  um, but I think that that it uh  It's interesting. I just don't know how to unwrap  The the media industry is so entwined  With the advert google advertising that I get that they don't like it and they they're frustrated by it  But if google stops linking to them  Like you know that facebook is what facebook and possibly google is talking about in canada  They'll die. Oh, like like that'll be the end like it's not you know, they say hey, we're not going to pay for this  We're just going to cut you off  They'll just they'll all you know the governments will have to come in and pay for everything because there won't be any more money  So so I think that it's it's complicated it's a really  Complicated thing. I will say that the ad that I don't know how to unwrap what's going on  but you know, i've been in a lot of meetings around advertising with google and facebook and  Understanding how their algorithm works is like looking into the sun like it is an incredible  Amount of power like it's just and the other complaint is that they own both sides of the equation, right?

They're also a seller  I mean, right it's it's as entwined and messed up as possible and I think anybody looks at it says yeah  This is not a competitive situation, but you're right. I don't know how you unwind it  um, you mentioned canada canada  Passed a link tax. This is this is one of jeff jarvis's  You know hated  Like chung jee correct or whatever. He calls it the link tax  Canada has passed c18  and as a result  Facebook is saying okay fine  You don't want you don't want news. We'll see you later  Uh, that's one that's one way to do it  uh  The the premise is in australia, too. Yeah, the premise is how it started. Oh geez meta. You're making money off of our content  Meta's I think quite reasonable response is well if that's how you feel about it  We don't have to send you any more traffic  And what in there inevitably happens is these news media suffer as a result, right?  So this is another one where I don't know what the answer is, but clearly c18 was not  uh the answer

I don't I don't know but they i'm told  Are among a hundred other performers calling for ban  A ban on face recognition at live events  Morello de la rocha and boots riley say we're not going to perform at venues  Rage against the machine is tom morello's band  And zach de la rocha boots riley speedy or teas  Uh say they will not perform  Uh at those venues which is gonna really I think  Limit their you know billy joles not leaving madison square garden. I'm just gonna say  But there are smaller independent concert venues  Who have pledged not to use face recognition?  And at the same time though, I feel like you know, that was a boon for taylor swift  so  I'm I have mixed feelings again about this one

They are very  Good I didn't that didn't bother me. I thought that's appropriate  That's appropriate. Uh  So this is why i'm torn on this. Hey if your band's name is rage against the machine  You probably should be against face recognition venues. I understand  But but i'm thinking, uh, if i'm taylor swift, I want that protection. I think that's a good thing

Start time: 8835.56

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  And I think that we also underestimate how much facial recognition someone says oh they're doing facial recognition at the event as as if  They're not doing facial recognition on all the streets that lead up to the event everywhere and all the other things that are happening  I mean like it's like not like they they found a lot when the when the  When the boston bombers, you know boston marathon bombing they knew who they were pretty quickly  Like, you know, like it was it was they they were able to suck that data out pretty pretty fast  So it's you know, this there's a lot there already.

Is that a feature? I don't know  I don't I use it as I will say that it is a little bit of a feature if i'm trying if i'm trying to order

I don't you know, I I think that uh, I used to  I mean I was the kind of guy that was like I would burn like colorado has this you have to give your thumb prints  And I would literally put my thumb thumbs on a hot plate before I went there and just burn them off just to be difficult  You know and um, so that's how much I was anti like do not follow me around  I don't want to give you any information that I have to  But at the same time and I would grow like a I would grow a beard and I would do all kinds of weird things  Because i'm just angry that they were asking for that  After you learn how deep it is you're kind of like you gave up  They're gonna go you're gonna go to a cabin and use cash or you're gonna kind of just know that that's the  That's the nature of it because it's really give up.

Transcript:  So just statistically so, you know  Uh, there are 11 states right now considering enacting their own biometric privacy laws like illinois has yeah  Illinois has one and many other states bundle biometric information including california is in this group  As a form of sensitive information under their privacy laws  so but it is all part of the patchwork that we  Live with every day and it doesn't you have to check in what state what law applies because we don't have a national standard  on these things

Start time: 9107.62
End time: 9128.34
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Let me uh, what will be the problem will be is when there's a terrorist act in one of those states  The law enforcement and the fbi will blame the fact that we can't use this this data  Like someone's gonna get thrown under the bus  that's why everyone's careful about it is because  It I mean it it is we can decide whether we want it to happen or not  But it is effective, you know not as effective as metadata, which is the most effective thing

Start time: 9129.12
End time: 9389.18
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But that's the problem. They've got all the metadata anyway, so  I think I think this really the answer to this is these are powerful useful technologies in the right hands  there needs to be limits and regulations on how they can be used and  Unfortunately, uh, I don't feel like we can really count on our government for  Doing any of that at least not in a timely fashion. Let me take a quick break  I want to talk about our sponsor miro. We've been using miro miro is so cool  We have a nas the tech guy board I don't the problem really in doing an ad for miro is I just don't know how  To describe it. I you know, I don't want to say it's a whiteboard. It's but so much more than that  Go to miro.com  Actually go to miro.com slash podcast so we get credit for it and then look at you'll see on the left here the miro verse  Because this is these are templates designed by actual miro users  To use miro. So what's the idea here? Well  Uh, if you've got a team, especially these days with teams that are distributed in different time zones different locations  You know, it's very complicated to keep that team on the same page  It's not just different places and time zones it's different tools you use a little bit of figma a little bit of  google's pages a little bit of zoom and pretty soon you've got all these tabs open you've got these and every time you context shift  Trust me, you're forgetting stuff. You're losing stuff. It's like when you go through a door and you can't remember why you entered that room  miro solves this as a collaborative visual platform  That brings all your great work together no matter where your team is no matter what tools your team uses  It's all in one place. So you have a single source of truth  You can zoom into the details if you want to know exactly how something works  Zoom out to the 30 000 foot level if you want to see an overview  miro is is is a great way to bring in the entire team get input from everyone  Democratize collaboration and still stay on the same page miro's infinite shared boards  Give product teams a perpetual space. You can just drag and drop insights in great for mood boards, but they have all sorts of tools like  Timers for your zoom meeting icebreakers  Nothing is lost. Nothing is forgotten  Miro is whatever you need it to be and that's why it's hard for me to describe it  The good news is if you go to miro.com  Your first three boards are free forever  So you can try it you can start playing with it use your with your team  You can build out your product vision on a miro board by brainstorming with sticky notes or comments you can have live reactions  There's a voting tool a timer if you've got time constraints  You can express yourself in creative ways bring the whole group together around one idea it integrates  With all the tools you're already using so it's very simple to move to miro and bring everything in you can  Use a wireframe draw with the pen tool put images and mock-ups. I mean I can go on and on  We use it with zappier to integrate a bunch of stuff in automatically  Miro users say they save get this 80 hours per user per year. That's like two weeks of extra time  Just by streamlining conversations and cutting down meetings  Miro miro gives your team the chance to always stay connected to real-time information  gives product managers and product leads a  A bird's eye view of the whole project to ensure nothing slips through the cracks  I mean, I guess it's not a surprise when I tell you more than a million users  1 million people use miro every month get your first three boards free start working better miro  miro.com podcast miro  Dot-com slash podcast best way to  Understand what it is is to try it and you'll be blown away and do check the miro verse for a lot of great ideas  On on how you can use miro for for pretty much anything  Let's see back to the show we go  Oh before I do that though, you know, I wasn't here for most of the week  And so they've made a little briefing book for me  I want to take it home with me and study it but for your benefit. We'll play it right now

So maybe  Maybe he did  He's a citizen of the uk was extradited from spain earlier this year  Uh, he'll serve probably a half of his sentence after spending more than two years in pretrial custody  It's been a while, right? He faced up to 77 years, however  So according to prosecutors, this is this is typical  The hacker used his sophisticated technical abilities for malicious purposes conducting a complex sim swap attack  To steal large amounts of cryptocurrency hacking twitter conducting computer intrusions to take over social media accounts  Even cyber stalking two victims including a minor victim  Maybe that's why he got seven years  I'm not gonna you know  Anyway, it was a dumb thing to do. Let's put it that way. I'm not sure he really deserves seven years  And twitter probably deserves a little pain for how weak and lax their security was  YouTube is testing an online games offering playables  We saw this at vidcon  Uh

You're right. YouTube seems a very better run than google itself  It's just it's  It's a big machine. It takes a lot longer for it to do things  You know, but it does them in this kind of methodical  Mechanical way of just slowly rolling things out and slowly putting things out. It's not a new feature  Is you know, it's adding these features and rare. I rarely see youtube back up, you know, like like they they're just they're you know  they'll they're just slowly making adjustments and  they're in a lot of interaction with their users and they're looking at a lot of data and trying to  You know and dealing with a lot of really complicated things  But I don't see you I see I agree with you that google is like, oh, you never know what's gonna happen  You know like anything that's been after they killed stadia and then killed google domains

The big problem was people wanted to see google  Hang on to something for two years before they jumped into it  And now when you talk to people you're not sure if they'll ever trust that they should go down that path  You know, and so that's the and that's really they they've gone from I have to see it for a while and with apple  that's why a lot of people jump on things pretty quickly with apple is because  You know that apple took a long time to think about it and whether it's a good idea or not a good idea  They're going to do it for the next five to ten years. They're not going to they're not going to bury  You know once they start going down the path  They're not going to change direction whether you like it or not is the question.

Transcript:  That's how he let people know he was in people at ufc who obviously have uh, would love to see this happen  At the octagon in vegas have said oh no, it's real  It is not real. Excuse me. Pardon me. There's no way these two billionaires are going to brutally  Beat on each other. There's just nothing to be gained but there was a good article that said this is all part of a larger  effort  by metas marketing  To position mark as a he-man  not as  Some sort of weird robotic leader  And that makes a lot of sense to me  That there has been an effort  We talked about this mark saying I just completed the murph's challenge or whatever it was which is running and and  Lifting and pull like a thousand pull-ups and all this stuff  Um, yeah, I think mark is in a lot better shape, but I also think this is part of a  concerted plan to polish  mark's  image and to make meta seem like something besides  Kind of a  Tech weenies attempt to get into your personal cheese or something.

Start time: 10210.50
End time: 10270.10
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Yeah, it's great. Um, there's a couple things about it. The just the overall quality of 5.2 is is much higher  There is an ability so  the zoom out is probably  That's part of what's interesting about 5.2  So what you can do is you can say I want to close up and then you can  Then you can have say build something that's got a wider shot to it  And then build it to a wider shot. So I mean what it's doing is reproducing that center part interestingly enough  Not always verbatim like it'll match up, but it's it's still redoing something but it looks almost identical  But zoomed out and so it'll you can do a zoom out you can do a lot of zoom out or a little bit of zoom out  Now one thing you'll notice is some of the shots  The ways mid-journey drew it was with a wide-angle lens and so it looks really fisheye sometimes when you pull back out again  um, but overall it is um, it's a it's a really cool feature, um that has been something that a lot of us  You know wanted for a while  Um is to be able to build bigger shots with that with that in it. Um, and so it's

Start time: 10276.04
End time: 10317.24
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Like it starts to hallucinate at a certain point because it doesn't know what to yeah, it doesn't know what to do there. I mean  Mid-journey hallucinates often. I mean that's kind of the nature of the business of what it's doing  So you get these things like you'll get three really normal things and then you'll be like, whoa what happened there?  You know, like it just you know flipped a bit and um, and so so the um,  But it also the other thing that's really interesting is the new uh variables so a variance  So when you when you do a variance where you say I want you to make I like this image  I want to make two I want to make it four more  You can do a lot or a little so you can say I just want to vary just a little bit  Or I want it to vary a lot and you can make those decisions as you start to hit that  um, you know as you go through that to make it and it's

Transcript:  It's really useful. You are quite the mid-journey master. Do you think this is better than anything else?  Well, oh, yeah, it's the best image image generator. It's quite amazing the uh, I mean they're  You know if you're worried about people mistaking ai generated images for real images. This is the place where you're going to see that happen

Transcript:  Um, oh I I make I'm my I we talked about on mac break. I make my lock screens all yeah, you know from uh,  From this and it looks so good  like just like they just look like photos that I graded about things that i'm interested in and um, yeah, so it's uh,  Um, and I use trippy man. This is really trippy. Wow  because the number one use that I have for it is making um,  funny images for my keynote documents when I do presentations like because the the the the the thing I ask for  Over a plain white background so I can remove the background and keynote  And and and so I have all these funny characters and then the other thing that's funny is go in the style of of pixar  So i'll go okay. I want I want a guy who look I want a geeky guy with glasses that looks confused  You know and I also want a a woman that has got glasses on looks confused an african-american woman that has you know  Like an anime and you know  And I can set up all these things and ask for all these things if I want a little crowd  That all looks confused and I say in the style of pixar  And then I get all these little cartoon characters over a plain white background and I can stack them all on top of each other  and there's a um,  uh, there is a  new  Thing that we just started we had a whole mid-journey thing on our office hours like on monday  And one of the things that came up was another mid-journey that now i'm gonna remember forget the name unless I look at it here  but  Um that basically builds vector files. Oh trace journey trace journey is the is the one that will build outlines  So it'll take your mid-journey image  And then make turn it into an svg image like it'll just and it looks a little posterized because it's you know  Now it's a vector but it um, but you can do that as well  So again, it's what 5.2 is a big jump. We'll definitely be talking more about this

So last saturday we were talking about languages. Well, what does it take to actually?  Take an event and do all the different languages that are required and all the technical things  But the other thing that's interesting is that it's not just that the show is talking about accessibility  It's actually you know, we have a we have a deaf panelist and we have  asl interpreters and the deaf panelist is interacting and talking to us and we have um, you know different different  Accessibility issues and we have panelists that are talking about those things from life experience, which is is really um, it's really cool  So so I think that we're really excited about the saturdays. These are saturdays that we're going to be talking about it all summer  And we're going to kind of cover the gamut of accessibility issues and each one of them has been a real  You know just really understanding what the needs are and us trying to figure out how do we solve those with what we're doing
