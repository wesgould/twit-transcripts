It's time to twit, ladies and gentlemen.  This week in tech is on the air, waiting for Patrick Norton, who's waiting for a baby he  may not show up today.  We don't know.  But he's got a new show.  We're going to give him a plug for the new show anyway.  Also with us, Patrick's former castmate from the screensavers and DL.TV.  He's abandoned you twice, Roger Chang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, that's so harsh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Roger is a good friend, of course.  I abandoned you too because you were on call for help and I left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, seems to be a common thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh man, that's cold.  You can come to Canada any time and be part of the lab with Leo.  You'd be welcome.  Thank you for the offer.  You'd be welcome.  Also here from security now, Steve Gibson, our security guru and a regular on twit.  It's been too long since you've been on, so we thought we'd get you back on.  Hey Leo, hello everybody.  Always good to have Steve on the show.  Glad to be here.  And we got a newbie.  Be nice, be kind.  Don Reisinger is a freelance technology journalist.  You've read him in all sorts of areas, but he does a lot of stuff for CNET.  He does the tech news blog.  In fact, it's a blog post that got his attention, got my attention and brought him on.  But he also writes for the digital home, does product reviews for a lot of ZD publications  as well as information week and processor.  Don, it's good to have you on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey Leo, thanks for having me.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're on the East Coast.  East Coast, yep.  Where's that?  New York.  New York, New York.  Oh, it's just there.  Were you at digital?  I'm upstate.  Upstate, yeah.  Did you go downstate for digital life?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I just got back about three hours ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You too, Roger?  Yeah, I was there Friday, Saturday and I just left this morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this the old PC Expo rebranded?  What is digital life?  Don, is it the same as PC Expo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  I've never been to PC Expo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that because PC Expo kind of disappeared and then digital life appeared.  I don't know if it's the same or not.  Yeah, I mean it was pretty good.  Roger, you've been before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's Ziff Davis' convention that, I mean their take is essentially a technology  convention that isn't skewed toward industry but rather consumers and it's open to the  public.  I like that.  But it wasn't huge.  It was, I mean I don't remember.  I wasn't at the first one but from what I understand it's gotten bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don, you said it was small, lackluster and boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you know I was there for about an hour.  Well, I got around in an hour.  Well, that's enough.  I look around.  I looked around and I see everyone at Guitar Hero and everyone flocking to the HDTVs and  I'm thinking to myself, what about everyone else that no one's paying attention to?  It was really interesting how that dynamic really worked out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you also have to take it from the standpoint, I mean you probably have experienced more  conventions than most of the average public will ever see and for those people to be actually  able to go in and you know, hey, touch, play, goof around with stuff that they normally  just read about, it's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess so.  What was the coolest thing you saw, Roger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hate to plug the Army but the America's Army had a really cool booth set up slash recruiting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  thing.  This is the game that the Army, they did this year, what, five years ago, the game 3D first  person shooter that they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  America's Army and what they had was essentially in a pitch black tent, they had these three  Humvees and they put three people inside and it was basically three large wide screens  in front of each Humvee playing the game and they would actually play in a multiplayer  setting with commander in each one telling them like, you know, drive over there, you  know, you got targets.  So it was a very coordinated kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was the Humvee steering wheel attached as a controller or did you have to sit there  with a joystick in your lap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For one to look like, they were actually driving and then the gunner actually had a gun, you  know, on top of the turret, he swung it around and it was mapped to the game controller.  That sounds really dangerous.  Well, it's not moving, they're all static but the idea is that you have these huge projection  screens that project the game onto it giving you the, you know, at least 160 degree frontal  arc of imaginary, you know, scenarios.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're missing the point.  That's not the idea, Roger.  The idea is the army.  What fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Roger, did you get a chance to get in the Formula One car?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I was actually somewhat sidetracked by the Angelina Jolie and Howard Stern look-alikes,  which I might add were quite impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who was hotter, Angelina or Howard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Angelina, no, you don't understand.  Angelina Jolie looked like Angelina Jolie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Amazing, amazing.  It's all collagen.  And was she at the, I wonder if she and Howard tried the Humvees.  Now that would have been interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they were over at the, what's this company?  OOVO, it's like a...  Uvo?  Uvo.  And...  What is Uvo Duvo?  It's kind of an IAMing service that allows you to send video to one another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there was Web 2.0 stuff there as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Web 2.0 stuff.  Of course, as Don mentioned, there was a lot of gaming.  In fact, there was a lot of gaming tournaments happening.  They had like a Guitar Hero tournament where people were facing off who could best play  the game as well as FPS, I think Counter-Strike, and a couple of 360 and PS3 games as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was your favorite thing there, Don?  Are you only there an hour, I understand.  So you're probably pretty much stuck by the Howard and Angelina's guys too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I talked to Uma there.  Uma was there?  Yeah.  Uma Thurman?  They were back in the corner.  Uma is the $500 VoIP device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that was pretty interesting, really.  I finally had a chance to talk to them and ask them about it.  They're sending me something this week and it looks somewhat promising.  It looked pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have a really clever, I think clever rollout, which is that you get a free one  as an Uma beta.  I don't know how they choose you.  Somehow, some lucky thing you get a free one.  I've heard from a number of people that got free ones.  But what they're doing by doing that is seeding this peer-to-peer voice over the internet  network because they need to have a lot of Umas out there before the thing works, I would  imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  And they also have E911 running on it.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that a requirement these days?  I thought the FCC said if you're going to do VoIP, you have to have E911.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It might be.  I don't know.  She was making a big deal about it when she told me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's an issue for people because they get VoIP and then what they don't understand  is they get rid of their landline and then you call 911 and then 911 has to say, well,  where the hell are you?  Right, yeah.  They can send an ambulance to North Carolina and you're in Virginia.  That's not going to help that much.  So Uma, you think Uma is for real, Don?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't tell you until I actually play with it, but from what I heard, it sounded somewhat  promising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The thing that's scary for people is the $500 outlay.  Yeah, sure, you get lifetime VoIP, but what does lifetime mean for a company like Uma?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who's lifetime?  The five years it's around, right?  Right.  I don't know.  I really want to try it out.  That's why when I saw it, I said this is something I might want to check out and see what happens.  But you never know.  You never really know.  How about you, Roger?  Did you play with Uma?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I was playing with Palm Centro.  Oh, the Centro.  It was announced at Digital Life.  I mean, if they can actually get it and after the 90-day exclusivity with Sprint and they  can get it out as a $100 smartphone, that would be awesome, like, you know, unlocked  and all that.  How different is it from a Tria?  From what I understand, and this is what they were telling me, it has all the same functionality  except that it is a different form factor and it's kind of skewered toward people who  would otherwise pick up like a Blackberry Pearl or another kind of slim and small smartphone  style device.  But it does have a real keyboard, a Trio-style keyboard.  It does.  It does have a true, it's smaller though.  It's not as wide.  It's a full QWERTY, but the keys are smaller in order to fit the form factor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the real point is it's 99 bucks.  Yes.  It was nice.  Yes.  Did you type on it, Don?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just a little bit, not too much.  I think they had it out on a little table there and I got to play with it for about  5-10 seconds after people were flocking to it, but it was nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was actually quite surprised because I'm so used to, I have a Blackberry Pearl and  I'm so used to typing the same key like three times to get like the letter I want.  And even though I've never actually used that QWERTY thumb board on the Central, I got pretty  good at it after a couple of minutes.  So I was able to do an IM to someone else without too much trouble.  Occasionally a stray letter or an errand space would come in, but not that bad.  And for 100 bucks, hey, I ditched my Pearl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's also a Palm-based device that you can put other Palm apps into?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If all the, from what I understand or from what they explained to me, any existing Trio  that installs on a Trio will install on the Central.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we know about screen resolution?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a lot smaller.  It can't be the same resolution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That I don't remember, but it wasn't too bad.  It is definitely smaller.  I mean, you are dealing with a smaller amount of estate to deal with.  But you know, if you're like one of those people that need a smartphone but don't necessarily  need a big bulky calculator size device, that's not a bad choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, especially at 100 bucks, it's kind of got a low barrier to entry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I think it's because Palm is getting their butts whooped.  Are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't, I thought the Trio was like the smartphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was the smartphone, but everyone else has been catching, I mean, you know, people laugh  at Microsoft's mobile OS, but you know, there's a lot of phones out there that use it.  You know, you get from a singular table.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who's going to, what cell phone company will offer the Central?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sprint for the first 90 days.  Oh, that's awesome.  And then after that, so.  But currently, they didn't have a GSM version.  They only had the CDMA.  So I'm not sure if they're going to release a GSM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think that Apple really has kind of offered an opening into the cell market for  companies by charging so much for its iPhone by requiring a two year sign up with AT&T?  Seems like this is an opportunity for companies like Palm to come up with a hundred dollar  phone that isn't just Sprint that does, you know, most of what the iPhone does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that was one of the things they were touting with the Central is that, you know,  the touch screen, while it isn't as intuitive as the Apple version, you can do, you can  drag like they had Google Maps on there, the mobile version, you could use your finger  and you could scroll and move the map across.  Yeah.  I mean, that's what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And third party apps.  You can add third party apps for crying out loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the screen is 320 by 320, which is the standard, you know, trio screen resolution.  So it's the same that way.  It's got, you know, camera, micro SD card, buttons all over it.  You know, I'm a major trio guy.  I mean, I've got mine with me wherever I am.  I just love it.  And he keeps it where the sun don't shine.  This looks very nice because, you know, we're talking about a much less expensive solution  and EVDO, the reason I move from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yes.  I was trying to use.  I was trying to use.  I have my BlackBerry as a Bluetooth modem for my MacBook.  So when I'm at the airport, I have to pay their like $14 fee to use their Wi-Fi.  And it's like SFO.  The connection was all right.  It was like 56K.  When I was over at the JFK, I was getting ridiculously low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that Verizon or Sprint?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's AT&T.  Oh, AT&T.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's the problem is that right now, the edge technology is just about a quarter  of the speed of what Sprint and Verizon can do with EVDO.  And so this, you know, it doesn't say that it's got Bluetooth.  I don't see that here.  But it's a one point only.  I think it does have Bluetooth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They mentioned Bluetooth.  You couldn't put it out of the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It didn't have Bluetooth these days, I would think.  Especially with Cal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As soon as I saw it, the first thing I thought was this is ideal for a young professional  just out of college.  And in a way, I think Apple almost missed the boat on it because at $99, I'm 22 years  old and getting out of school.  And I'm going into the business world.  This is perfect.  This is ideal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would be really interesting if AT&T starts selling this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'd say so.  I mean, they need to come out with a GSM.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, how hard is that to do?  I mean, there are GSM trios, aren't there?  Yeah, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think there's one, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a pretty phone.  I have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  $750, I think.  Yeah, it looks pretty.  Yeah, it is.  It's a nice phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And, you know, they hope...  Oh, I'm sorry.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And cheap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead, Roger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no.  Yeah.  One of the points they wanted to make was they wanted to go after the non-traditional  trail buyer, you know, the guys who don't want a big, again, a big bulky PDA slash cell  phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I talk to a lot of normal people, not business people, and there really is a move toward  the smartphone.  People want at least calendar and address book information in their phone.  I think that everybody kind of wants that functionality.  More and more people are using the phone to text and email.  And you know, unless you're, you know, 18, SMS via a standard phone keypad is just hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to use.  And it's kind of funny because in Japan, you know, whereas in North America and Europe,  the PC is kind of the main, you know, new medium gadget.  It's the cell phone in Japan, you know, because people set up parties, they set up invites.  They do everything through their cell phone.  And people are kind of wanting that here because instead of looking around a notebook, if you  just want to get, you know, directions or your email, why not just keep it on your phone,  which is, you know, you pop it in and out of your pocket.  You pop it open, you turn it on.  You find out where the best restaurant is in your immediate location, you know, movie  times, something that you don't have to pull out a notebook for, open up, wait for it to  boot, you know, find a Wi-Fi connection and start typing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So was Palm one of the few companies that made announcements at Digital Home?  That's not a kind of traditional place to make product announcements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not in my experience.  Of course, it's only, I think this is the third year Digital Life has been running.  So it's not like there's a huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not a CES.  But, you know, hey, here, what a great chance to see it.  Put this thing in front of real people in a real environment and good timing for launching  this phone as the iPhone stumbles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's kind of funny because Dvorak mentioned that earlier, just said that it  would be a boondoggle for Apple.  It would just be kind of a ball and sheen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dvorak might have been right.  We're going to get to that in just a second.  But before we do, I do want to talk about Don's blog post at cnet.com.  Why Microsoft must abandon Vista.  Don, is it a sinking ship?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you know, you know, it's funny.  I got an email from a few readers over the past couple of weeks and they said to me,  have you been using Vista?  This is awful.  So I went, I stopped using my Mac for a while and I said, I'm going to use Vista for the  next two weeks and just see what happens.  And after using it, I just think it's abysmal.  It's awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is wrong with Vista in that?  First off, the thing that really annoys me is the user access control.  Let's say I am installing a Microsoft certified update.  Why should I be asked if this is what I want to do or this is okay, this could hurt your  computer, everything else when it's from Microsoft?  Hold on just a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to add Patrick Norton.  I see he just popped on and I want him to be part of this.  Let's see how good Patrick's sound is.  Hello, Patrick.  Hey, man.  You sound pretty good.  You sound like you're on the phone.  It's a miracle.  Are you at the hospital, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not at the hospital yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that a secret?  Should I not mention this or do people know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  People know, but I tend not to talk about it too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We won't mention it.  It's a complete secret.  Patrick's got a hernia and he doesn't want anybody to know about it.  But we'll let you know.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's okay.  Patrick's life is just edged over to 38 weeks and he's looking forward to having a child.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got two more weeks before of marital bliss and then it's daddy this, daddy that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, I think it's more of a screaming bundle of needs.  The language comes later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Patrick, you're going to be such a great dad.  I can't wait to see you.  Patrick, let me tell you who's here.  You see Roger Chang, of course, your old cohort on DL.TV and Steve Gibson.  You may not have met Don Risinger.  He's a freelance journalist who's written a lot for CNET and ZD.  You might have run into him at ZD.  We're talking about his article on the CNET blogs this week.  Why Microsoft must abandon Vista to save itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not allowed to curse on this show, but I'd like to say brilliant delete expletive  column.  I actually stumbled across that in RRS feed.  I read the entire thing of it.  Yeah, Vista's a mess, a wreck, a pathetic joke.  And a waste of our time, almost, but not quite as maliciously configured as Windows  ME.  Actually, not at all.  Vista's just a miserable failure.  ME was a delete expletive money grab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, at least.  Microsoft spent five years building this.  Don had started, before we brought you in, describing why he thinks Vista is bad.  You said the user access control is part of the problem.  You were installing a Microsoft certified what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just an update.  Okay.  Then it goes through another five or four or five boxes, pops up saying this.  Did you want to do this?  Did you want to do that?  You know what it is?  It's just like pop-up fatigue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Don, don't we have to do this to protect users from themselves?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what I think?  On Mac, it happens on Mac and whatever else.  But at least on a Mac, I can put in my password so I actually know what I'm doing.  I actually know, okay, I actually can stop and think, okay, this is something I wanted  to do.  But on Vista, I just click away.  I'm just not going to stop clicking until it's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And on OS X, I think at the most it's what, two?  You get like if you download a disk image, it asks you that this could be hazards.  Do you want to do it?  Yes.  And if you install something, again, you just type in your password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should say for security, I run both Vista and OS X in limited user mode.  I don't run as administrator.  So it does ask me for my password on Vista.  It won't if you're an administrator, except for a few things.  And on OS X, it does ask me for my password.  You're right.  I don't know what it is, but for some reason, it's not as annoying on the Mac as it is on  Windows.  Go ahead, Don.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't find it that annoying.  But to get in the longest I've managed to run Vista before wiping the system and reinstalling  XP is about two weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know who we're not hearing from?  Steve Gibson.  He's a Windows guy.  Steve, and also a security guy, I should point out.  You and I have talked a lot about UAC and do believe UAC is a major security improvement.  But what about this issue of user fatigue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, UAC could be engineered to work much better than it does.  What's happening is that applications are not taking, essentially, they're not becoming  Vista aware.  And an application that is Vista aware can dramatically minimize all of these pop-ups.  I wrote Securable, my little piece of freeware, for the Vista environment.  And it notifies you upfront once that you need to get permission.  And then what it does is essentially it operates with Vista with the knowledge that it may  be running in Vista in order to minimize that.  And if an application doesn't do that, then essentially it's up to the operating system  to watch what the application does step by step.  And it may be popping up those dialogues all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, isn't that the problem in general with Vista, just that applications and hardware  aren't really yet Vista aware?  I mean, Don, it's not Microsoft's fault that manufacturers haven't made their stuff Vista  aware, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's the problem.  I mean, I think that Microsoft is, they're a victim of themselves in that they have so  many programs running on it.  It's not a closed environment.  As far as I don't like a closed environment, as you know, on an iPhone, but to some extent,  there's a point where you need to be somewhat closed and have some exercise, some control  over and right now, I mean, it's just, it's everywhere.  I mean, everything's coming from everywhere and it's so hard to control that, I mean,  it's just impossible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why do you hate Vista so much, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The driver problems, a bunch of the applications they use, regulate, weren't working on it.  My primary machine at home doesn't have a powerful enough graphics system to run Vista  without either turning off the eye candy or feeling a performance.  I mean, I always believe...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I think what's behind this for all of us is that it's really just a bunch of  eye candy.  It doesn't fundamentally do a lot more for us than XP did and we're paying a huge price  for what is essentially round cornered windows and, you know, a fancier UI.  I mean, that's all it really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You make that point, Don, with the many SKUs and the additional 160 bucks for Ultimate,  which is...  Go ahead, Roger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh no, I think that was the worst mistake they did.  That's crazy.  That's insane.  I mean, how many versions of OS X are there?  I mean, other than, you know...  I think there's seven or something.  But you, other than like, you know, a server, you just, the copy you get, there's no Ultimate,  there's no, you know, denuded media version, there's no like simple edition.  It's just one.  You buy it and it's the same one across the board and you update it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But, Don, what should Microsoft do?  Should they just say, oh, we made a mistake and pull it back?  Surely you don't expect them to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the thing.  It's impossible now because all they're doing right now is touting there's 60 million sold  and everything else.  But I mean, more than anything, they're controlled to some extent by the DELs and the HPs of  the world who are saying, let's go back to XP and let's see what we can do here.  Well, in fact, that's what happened this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Microsoft, which had planned to pull Vista from the shelves in January, said, nah, we're  going to keep selling it to June.  Is that a, that's an admission, isn't it, from Microsoft that it's not going well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, absolutely.  Absolutely.  I mean, if, if...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But haven't they said how well it's selling?  Is it not selling well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they're touting it as 60 million sold and everything else.  But more than anything, if you're, if the business, if the business world is saying  no, and you have, like I said, the DELs and HPs of the world telling you no, there's not  much they can do in terms of, you know, they really rely on those companies and they rely  on businesses to sell software.  And if they can't have those behind them, they're in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do people move to Ubuntu?  Do they move to Mac?  What do people do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, in my mind, if you're the average user, home user, you just move straight to  Mac.  And...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can send your emails to John.  No, you know what, Don?  I'm right.  But I have been saying this on the radio show for some time.  And really, my mantra has become Windows for business, Mac for home.  Absolutely.  It seems sensible.  I mean, there are certainly exceptions.  If you're a hardcore gamer, obviously you have to go with Windows.  But even a hardcore gamer, many of them don't like Vista so much.  There's all sorts of video issues with Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think that, I think most of those video issues should be worked out by next  year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But...  Well, wait a minute, though.  This is interesting.  This all came out a year ago.  We've had it for a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How long is it going to take?  Well, how long did it take for Windows 95 and Windows 98?  A year seems a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, if I'm a video card company, why can't it...  Why does it take me 12 months to figure out how to get...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but who else are you going to sell it to?  I mean, what other market are you going to be able to say, hey, why don't you buy this  new $600 amazing graphics card because you can get 10 frames more in your, you know,  Quake Wars?  I have to say, I'm running Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm playing Bioshock on Vista with a Crossfire system and it works.  I did have to update the drivers before it worked, but it works and it works well and  it looks good.  I'm not sure it works better than it would on XP.  Should people stay with XP?  It seems like that's the consensus here.  Steve Gibson, do you think people should stick with XP?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I really do.  I mean, it is the case, and we've talked about this on security now, that there are...  There's a substantial advancement in security, but it comes at a tremendous expense in terms  of user convenience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, especially if you have a lot of legacy stuff.  If you're starting from scratch, maybe it's not such a bad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, my question is this, and it's been happening for years now, but what drives Microsoft  and Apple, besides the profits or whatever, to just update these new operating systems  every five years or so?  Why can't we just stick with it?  Let's just say XP, right?  We have issues with XP, but at least it's a known quantity at this point.  We stick with the operating system, we update it, maybe we sell some upgrades every few  years, but why do we need all these constant updates and we have to deal with all these  driver issues?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Boo, boo, I know, I know, I know.  Patrick Norton, look at the revenue model.  Well, no, it's the maximized shareholder revenue.  It's not what's good for the customer, it's what's good for the stock price on Wall Street.  They do have a fiduciary...  That's the problem with every publicly held company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although if Dvorak were here, he would point out that Microsoft's stock has just been flat  for years now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, flat is a lot better than dropping.  Okay, good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Flat means at least it's not losing money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Flat and high, though.  Yeah, I guess relatively high.  If you had it, it depends how long you've had it.  It hasn't gone up if you bought it in the last couple of years, has it?  I don't think so.  Certainly not like Google stock or Apple stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google stock is a total anomaly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  It just keeps going up.  In fact, Apple stock went up a lot this week.  I think the market liked it when Apple slapped around iPhone users.  This is the scenario.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is what we like to see as a business protecting its ability to generate revenue  no matter what the customers have paid too much for the original release of the product  want to do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But isn't that what happens when you go public and you have to start looking quarter to quarter  at revenues?  Don't you start looking at, well, we're protecting our revenue, we're protecting our partnership  with AT&T.  Yeah, in the long run, customers may learn to hate us, but at least right now we're protecting  our revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, this is also the company that's, you know, let's not confuse ourselves.  Apple's been willing to write off all previous generations of hardware with a major operating  or system release every three years.  That actually is one of the secrets to their success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's one of the things Microsoft has not been able to do.  And one of the reasons why Vista is such a, you know, a kludge is because it's got all  this crap hanging off of it.  So let's talk about what happened with the iPhone.  Essentially the iPhone came out, no third party applications, locked into AT&T, didn't  take long for the user community to figure out how to put third party applications.  There's actually a pretty good variety now.  Nothing, nothing earth shattering, but some pretty good stuff.  Navazon, which is a global positioning system that uses cell towers instead of GPS chips,  claims they've had 80,000 downloads.  There's some gaming and, you know, Apple for some reason has never put a game on this.  It's a really great gaming platform.  So third party apps, that was the first step.  The second step was unlocking it.  And just the last three weeks, there have been three different ways to unlock it.  Finally, an open source free way to unlock it that worked quite well.  I have, I'm sitting in front of a T-Mobile based iPhone right now running a lot of cool  apps.  Apple announces last week says, guys, gotta warn you, those hacks could be a little, they  could be dangerous.  I can't promise you that any updates that come out won't hurt your phone.  Lo and behold on Friday, 1.1.1 comes out and removes all the third party apps, if that's  all you've done, removes the ability to add third party apps, if that's all you've done.  But if you've unlocked it, it turns it into a piece of paperweight, a paperweight, a brick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's funny you should bring this up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I happen to have a working hacked iPhone.  I want to point that out.  I did not apply the update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just bought DVD John's old iPhone.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's, now I would, did you get him to autograph it?  I'd frame that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I got to talk to him for like 20 minutes, half an hour.  More than enough reward.  Is that going to be on Tekzilla?  No, no, I just, it was, he put on his blog that he was selling it and I made an offer  and he accepted it.  And this is the one he used to write up the iPhone Independence Day thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If there is, if there is, if there is, if there is ever a Smithsonian for hackers, that  phone belongs in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, he belongs in it, but the, I was just laughing because like the day I picked it  up was like the day the 1.1.1 release came out.  I think I'm going to, you know, take iBrick and restore it to the 1.0.2 before I activate  this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You actually removed, you removed all the hacks and went back to the original and then  applied the update?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm actually in the process of doing that right now.  I downloaded everything and set it up and then found out none of the tools I needed  would run on OS X.  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have, I have one that's hacked and it's, you know, I love the third party apps.  I love the fact that.  They're awesome.  Yeah.  I mean, I think that it really opens up the platform.  Here's the question I have for the panel.  And I don't know, you know, by the way, as we record this, the iPhone dev team says they  found a way to roll it back, but pretty much it looks like Apple forced an update or pushed  an update.  They didn't force it.  You could turn it down, but pushed an update that intentionally turned the phone into a  paperweight.  My question is, was it technically necessary?  Is this punitive on Apple's part or is this something they just, they had no choice.  They warned you, look, we're going to update it.  It's probably going to break things.  You know, please don't apply it.  Is Apple a bad guy in other words?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think if it wasn't punitive, they wouldn't have, if it wasn't punitive, they wouldn't  have, you know, unleashed the warning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They did.  Yeah.  They didn't have to do this is what you're saying, but they did.  Anybody think that it wasn't punitive, that it was just an accident or not an accident?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I don't think it's an accident, but I think it was more of an issue.  It's like.  You think it was unavoidable.  It was like, we're going to do these updates and this is what we have in mind when we do  these updates and this is the hardware or firmware spec we're looking at.  If you somehow change that, you know, doing whatever, we can't guarantee you that nothing  bad is going to happen to your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would have to say from a technology standpoint, we couldn't be definitive about whether this  was deliberate on their part or it was an innocent side effect of them changing a bunch  of things.  You'd have to know how the hacks worked and how they were getting around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I could tell you how the hacks work and I could tell you where you might have  problems.  In order to unlock the phone, you have to put new firmware on the modem and then you  have to give some commands to the modem to say, okay, now you can run with any carrier.  So I know iPhone dev team, by the way, and these guys are entirely reasonable then that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that would get flushed away in a benign update, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, or benign update that didn't reflash the firmware with the correct version would  then cause a problem.  The iPhone dev team people think that it was intentional, that it was punitive, that Apple  was slapping around people who dared hack their phone.  If that's the case, I have to say Apple has way overstepped the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely.  No one can annoy me the most.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apple as a friend to consumers or Apple as a ongoing business that needs to have revenue?  That's two different Apples, I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's not, it's one single Apple.  When we can talk long term, is it bad for, you know, if you slap your consumers around  in the long term, I don't think that's such a good thing either.  It might defend your relationship with AT&T and contractually they probably had to.  Anyway, Don, you were saying you think this is this is punitive that Apple stepped overstep  the line?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I mean, at what point are, you know, I've been hearing this number, only  two percent of people hack their iPhones, only two percent of people unlock their iPhones.  But what, okay, if that's two percent and that's two percent of the people who act as  guru for the for families and say when someone comes to them, okay, which computer should  I buy?  If this pisses them off, they're not going to say Max anymore.  I mean, you know, I think they're in significant danger of ostracizing their core following.  And if that happens, boy, oh boy, I don't know.  I mean, you know, I think that really annoyed me the most though when it happened.  I got, I had AppTap and all that stuff on there.  And you guys ever played Tap Tap Revolution?  Yeah.  Oh God, when that was gone, I'm telling you, I don't know what to do with myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's my point.  This phone is a great platform for gaming.  Why Apple hasn't put games on it is beyond me.  But why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Steve Jobs doesn't like games.  I guess not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you know, the last electronics company that tried to put out a portable game,  you know, device and then went up against the 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Every smartphone has games on it though, Roger.  They may not be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's, well, it's interesting because Sony's done the same thing.  There's a huge underground homebrew community for the Sony PSP and every update Sony's tried  to stamp out, firmware update has tried to stamp out all the loopholes, all the back

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  doors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But have they bricked the PSP?  In one case early on, supposedly it would if you hacked it and it would turn your PSP  into a brick.  However, there was a workaround for some people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The hackers have always been able to reverse it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it was one of the things, I mean, like Patrick mentioned, I mean, they are a business.  They're in it to make money and, you know.  But make money.  I mean, as much as Don says that, you know, you're going to remove some of those critical  voices that support the company.  I mean, Apple is trying to transition away from just purely tech to a lifestyle company.  I mean, that's why they want, you know, famous faces with their products.  They want to be the next Sony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they want to be associated, you know, with a kind of lifestyle, you know.  Why do shows on VH1 and MTV that feature a lot of teenage kids all have, you know, a  designer coaster?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's my problem.  I think that people nowadays are smart enough, many people are smart enough and savvy enough  to want open platforms that they can modify.  And even if you put out a closed platform, like the PSP or the iPhone, people are going  to try to modify it.  And the problem is, once you do a deal like you've done, say, with AT&T, where you're  forced to slap these guys around, I think you go down this slippery slope where all  of a sudden you look like the evil empire.  And I think Patrick, isn't this in the long run bad for business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, here's a sixty four thousand dollar question, right?  You look at I mean, I remember talking to Dell ten years ago and they said, you know,  the vast minority of people who bought Dell machines and this is when most of the people  buying Dell were experts and enthusiasts and gamers and hackers never, ever opened up  the case and modified the system.  Right. So you don't you know, you don't unless you're a boutique or a niche  company, you're trying to target everyone or the largest swath of people out there.  And I don't think Apple's you know, Apple's been beating around its users for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's just I use an analogy in my blog.  I'd like you guys to punch a hole in this.  Here's my analogy. I go I you decide you want to sell a cow to me.  I want to buy your cow.  And you say, OK, you can buy this cow.  But I want you to know this cow is for making cheese.  And and if you use it for anything else, you know, that's a violation of our agreement.  Furthermore, I'm going to let you graze this cow on on this particular plot of land.  But you've got to make cheese with the cow.  So I buy the cow, I graze them on the plot of land.  OK, deal. I made that deal.  But a little later down the road, I say, you know what, I just want some milk.  I don't want no cheese.  And I stop making cheese.  You come over and you shoot the cow.  See, I think your recourse is, OK, you can't graze on my land anymore.  OK, I'm not going to do business with you.  You don't get to kill my cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no. I mean, that that's more along the lines of, well, you know, along with the cow,  you get a yearly vaccination.  And, you know, if you do anything with the cow that I told you not to do and I come over  to vaccinate and falls dead.  Oh, well, I told you.  OK, good. All right. That's a good extension.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you decided to put a little poison in the vaccine because I made milk.  Isn't that wrong?  Isn't that wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I'd like the noble attempt to bring the agrarian tragedy  of the Bovine.  The commons.  The Bovine element touches me deeply in my Midwestern soul.  But the truth of it is, is this is the 21st century.  We live in a country where the Digital Millennium Copyright Act was protected to protect  businesses from consumers.  We could say that Apple has been actually generous if they haven't, you know, sent the  generous and and no, no, no, no, no.  Hold on. Hold on.  I haven't.  Hold on. I haven't.  Look, you know, I have, you know, if you've ever seen Apple cease and desist  lawyers in action, they're impressive, maybe even scary.  Yeah, I might have made a mistake.  They were trying to declassify.  They were trying to make, you know, they tried in the state of California to shut down  the Apple secrets and, you know, the MacRimsy blogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true. They haven't they haven't sued the iPhone dev team or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, maybe because the iPhone dev team is overseas or they're, you know,  you know, they've they figured out a way to secret themselves away.  But quite frankly, Apple, if they want to play hardball, can play a particularly  talented version of hardball.  They, you know, it's major league.  It's you know, they're all closers and they're kind of scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're playing hardball with their customers here, though.  Pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, everybody plays hardball with their customers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know. But I think Brick in the phone is going a little far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, here's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they killed my cow and I don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they may have killed your cow, but it's not about your cow.  It's about the people who are always going to buy a cow to me.  To me, it's about my cow.  I know that. But but Leo, to them, they want to scare off anybody  that looks at a cow and think, you know, I could get cheese out of it.  You're right. You're right.  And now millions of Americans that may or may not buy an iPhone themselves.  If I if I milk that cow and make cheese, it's going to die.  And that's maybe the most important.  They may never do anything that bricks a phone again with an update,  but they now have a public perception, a cooling effect, if you will,  to borrow one of our favorite phrases from the EFF, the chilling effect.  Sorry, the that discourages people from modifying their hardware.  Don, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I think it's I think Patrick makes a good point in that  to some extent, it's a scare tactic that will probably work.  You know, if I update my iPhone and it doesn't work anymore,  what are the chances I'm going to put something on there again and try over?  You know, in terms of business, in terms of I don't care about my cut.  Well, I, you know, I care about my customers to some extent,  but I have to care about my my profits or my maximize.  What it looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks like profits over customers.  That's what it looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Which is good business.  I mean, there's no debating that short term.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's good business. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Short term in the long term.  I don't know if they keep playing the bully.  I don't think there's anything good coming out of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of bullies, AT&T has a new this from Boing Boing,  a new terms of service for its Internet service customers.  From now on, AT&T can terminate your connection for this is this  this just smacks of the same old thing for, quote,  conduct that tends to damage the name or reputation of AT&T  or its parents, affiliates and subsidiaries.  What the hell does that mean?  So it means if you do a blog on your own,  and that criticize AT&T, they can cut you off.  Cut off your Internet.  This is awesome because of AT&T controls that what's published

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  on their website, they go from being a networking communications  company to a publisher and become responsible for everything  on their network.  And then we can sue them into oblivion at the drop of the hat.  I like it.  We can make sure they don't have enough money to pay the lobbyists  to prevent any effective form of net neutrality.  You know what they could do?  This is brilliant.  I say we support AT&T.  If they want to hang themselves publicly, yes.  Sorry, I got to cut it.  Let's say we do a show that talks about AT&T allowing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  illegal NSA wiretapping and AT&T decides they're going to block  from now on any downloads from twit.tv because it's critical of them.  I mean, that's basically what they're saying, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The whole wording too is just like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The whole wording too is so vague.  Tends to damage the name?  Yeah, what is tends to damage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The name or reputation.  That sounds like a company that's a little scared, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You want to talk about a company that hates its customers?  We're talking about a company that hates its customers.  Yeah, you're right.  These are the people who put together technical economists,  which is one of the most frightening phrases you can ever bring out in public.  What is a technical economist?  It's so vague about how it was effectively.  Net neutrality is wrong and impossible and everybody has to be on business accounts  and upgrading the hardware isn't wrong.  By the way, that stuff we sold you isn't really what we're delivering you.  As long as you want it in like five, you can have your five megabits per second  as long as you keep it at like five kilobits, chunks or less.  You want to talk about a company that's living for its shareholders.  This is it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're bringing that great customer service AT&T has been known for  and long distance and cell phones right to the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think this is a perfect example of what happens when you really don't have  true competition in the market.  That's a monopoly talking.  Exactly.  I mean, if there were actually a choice and people could say, I'm not going to use AT&T,  I mean, even over this policy or in consequence of having their account dropped,  then AT&T would go, we would think a lot more before, you know,  driving people to somewhere else.  But if there's nowhere else to go, then I mean, you're really up the creek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the nice thing about AT&T being a DSL company and the copper for the phone  companies have come out of a monopoly is they are required to offer access  to that last mile of copper.  So there are some great third party alternatives or second party, whatever you want to call it.  At least I don't know about on the East Coast, but on the West Coast,  there are half a dozen great companies that do DSL that are not AT&T.  I think if you want an alternative, if the only decent broadband connection in your town  is cable and you want an alternative, if you don't have DSL option, then you're stuck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, that's really the argument in favor of some sort of prohibition of internet  discrimination is that we don't really have competition.  And people always say, well, the free market will solve this because there's competition  and you just go to an internet service provider that doesn't prioritize packets.  But there isn't for most people, there isn't that kind of choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That analogy works great on Capitol Hill when you're taking the $80,000.  The 80,000 foot view of your state.  But it doesn't work real well on the local level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, we talk about cutting off internet service.  And actually, I want to get a little serious here.  This isn't anywhere under the degree of what's going on in Myanmar or Myanmar.  Due to the rebellion in Myanmar, the internet's been cut off entirely.  For a while, we were able to watch what was going on in Myanmar.  The bloggers were posting and the government realized it and they just shut off the internet.  So boy, that really touches you, doesn't it?  Government was cracking down on protesters last week.  Information was getting out thanks to bloggers, a lot of bloggers.  I thought that was quite interesting.  Reporters without borders have been following this.  They say by cutting internet access, the regime is trying to operate behind closed doors.  And that's pretty much it.  No news gets out.  No one knows what's going on inside.  That's the kind of thing though.  Boy, you're not just cutting off outbound traffic.  You're cutting off really your country from the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that country's always been cut off.  I mean, even with traditional broadcast communications and stuff.  I mean, most of the images and information were fed into exile groups based in Europe  and North America that were resending them out to the major news outlets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, we're very lucky here.  We might talk about AT&T this and iPhone that, but we do at least have the basic freedoms  to talk about it.  And so far nobody's banned the show.  Click.  And if you're listening in and say, I just, I love you, love you guys.  You're beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, AT&T can buy all the ATF jerseys and all the other stuff that has the ATF logo  and scratch out the F and put the last T.  Oh, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just natural.  How long before AT&T does, you know, America's Phone Company video game where you go around  and you shoot people who hack your phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's kind of creepy because when Mobb Del got broken up, everyone was, oh, it's  finally done.  They're back, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sorry, have we completely forgotten the last round of recruiting tools for United  States Army?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, you came in late.  We're talking about it at Digital Life Expo.  Apparently the America's Army had a wonderful booth featuring Hummers.  Humvees.  Humvees.  The Humvee is a militarized Hummer.  No, it's the other way around.  I know, I'm just kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, Leo, Leo, I just, when you said that about the video game, the only first  thoughts came to my head is, is it going to, is the game going to crash in the middle of  the second, second level?  I mean, that's about AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's pretty much what it does.  Ouch.  Funny, but ouch.  This story from North of the Border for the Globe and Mail is the only place that's writing  about this.  The Internet has failed to extend a moratorium on Internet taxes.  There's a debate over whether the ban should be permanent or temporary.  Patrick, you and I have been covering this for some time.  I remember this was a story on the screensavers.  The Internet taxes are banned.  They're not banned.  They're banned.  They're not banned.  Yeah, what year is this again?  Yeah, I know.  So believe it or not, it runs out in October, end of October.  We've got about a month left and they're trying to decide whether to extend it for four more  years or indefinitely.  If they fail, plan on your Internet access going up by 17 to 20 percent as states start  charging tax on your Internet.  You mean your Internet purchases?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no.  Internet access.  Internet access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This isn't sales tax.  By the way, you are paying your California sales tax on all Internet purchases, Patrick,  aren't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Of course.  They've got a special box put in place for the California State Income Tax Foreign to  make it convenient for me as a resident of California to meet my legal obligations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm glad to hear it as am I and I'm sure every responsible Californian.  No, we're talking about the Internet service, the Internet service providers tax, tax on  Internet access.  And some states, let's see, that's complicated.  All right, that's enough of that.  I'll move on.  I'll move on.  It's too complicated for me.  I much prefer things like should Microsoft dump Vista?  That I can understand.  Francis Ford Coppola is in the news.  Did you see this?  His stuff got stolen.  His stuff got stolen and he has no backup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sounds like one of his movies.  Which stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently he's living, where is he living?  Switzerland?  Argentina.  Argentina.  There you go.  That's the Switzerland of South America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you know that?  Is that because that's where all the Germans fled to?  Yes, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We all talk like this in Argentina.  That's right.  You got it exactly right.  Apparently, five armed men broke into his house, stole all his computers.  He says 14 years worth of stuff, including his most recent script on there.  And I guess nobody explained to Francis about backing up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, let me ask you something.  Did Godfather 3 come out 15 years ago?  Oh, yeah.  I hope it did.  I hope that he lost it because am I the only one who thought it was awful?

You and Jessica and it's, it's kind of, I have to say it's got that screensavers feel,  the red brick wall, similar projects I see in the description that you plan to take calls  to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  That's awesome.  I love questions.  I love, you know, we did them on DLTV.  Roger still does them on DLTV.  It's just fun, man.  We're going to see how much we would want to see how much we can get the actual viewers  into the show.  What about live Patrick?  What about live?  We're actually working towards live.  Our studio is not going to be built out.  Studios being built at revision three and the switcher, we don't have a switcher yet  or the audio board.  So it's going to be about two months before all of the hardware infrastructure we need  is in place.  So you think at some point you'll be able to do it live?  That is one of the options we're looking at.  Something we'd like to be able to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Revision three dot com R E V I S I O N the number three dot com and Tekzilla is T E K  Z I L L A Tekzilla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

I know it's a great team actually.  I'm really glad to see you guys doing that.  Roger's still stuck in DLTV, but you never know.  Stuck.  I love that.  I just killed that.  Ouch.  Roger Chang and Robert Heron have taken over the helm.  DL.tv.  And you know, I'm just thrilled.  I think the variety and the quality of tech programming is on the net now.  It just shows you who needs tech TV.  Take your money, Mr. Allen.  Go somewhere else.  Build that submarine.  We don't need you anymore.  We got our own tech TV.  So DL.tv.  Roger, same schedule, twice a week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Once a week.  Ever since we lost Pat, we don't have enough bodies to put it nicely.  Oh man.  Don't you feel guilty, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sorry?  Don't you feel guilty?  Every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the flip side is that it actually gives us time for me to call more guests and stuff  and I'm trying to get more people in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And believe me, there's plenty of time to watch both and that's the beauty.  Steve Gibson is of course has not missed an episode of Security Now, now in 114 weeks  and running.  He is the Cal Ripken Jr. of netcasting.  And I love it, Steve.  It's so great to do the show with you.  We're next week going to do listener questions, I believe.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Hey, thanks for having me.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anytime.  You catch his stuff on the CNET blogs and digital home and just all over the place.  Information Week.  He says just Google Don Reisinger.  Yeah, just pick one you like.  R-E-I-S-I-N-G-E-R.  Don, isn't it great to have a name that nobody else has?  So when you Google it, it's you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's great, isn't it?  Life is good.  People are...  You know, I'm on the way.  Just real quick, Halo 3, did anyone play it?  Oh, what?  The big story of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, the 640p?  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  First thing I did was I had to finish Bioshock.  So I got...  Did you finish it?  Yeah, I got Halo 3 on Tuesday, of course.  But I had...  You know, I pre-ordered it and I got it.  I didn't get up at midnight, but I did...  But I got it the first thing in the morning.  But I couldn't let myself do it.  So I finished Bioshock, I think, on Thursday.  Halo 3 is awesome.  What do you think, Don?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You love it?  I haven't played it.  I'm dying to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it's great.  It's an FPS.  No, you know what, though, Roger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're right.  The single player, big deal.  No big deal.  It's aliens.  You're shooting them.  You're running around.  It's pretty.  It's HD.  It's nice.  But Halo 3...  Halo's always been about the online LAN party game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's always been big mainly because until recently, the consoles have never had a game  where you could do multiplayer in that fashion.  I mean, I think Valve's Orange Box is coming out and that has Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2,  or Half-Life Source.  That'll be fun.  Team Fortress 2.  Team PC.  Now, that'll be good.  That'll be exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That game looks awesome.  Yeah, that'll be very popular.  But I have to say, Halo...  Maybe it's just because of the fond memories I have of being on the screensaver set and  watching Joshua Brantano wax Patrick's behind with the rock and watch.  Patrick and I, we'd be playing.  You know, it'd be that we'd be in a commercial break.  We'd be playing.  And Brantano and Kevin Rose...  His ass was handed to us.  Yeah.  Kevin Rose and Brantano were just like, obviously way beyond anything we could do.  We just get blown out of the water.  They'd sneak up and they'd put a rocket in your head.  I mean, they were just mean.  But I still have fond memories of that.  Halo 3, in terms of cooperative play and then the online play is better than ever.  Really is fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'm in the mood to have a 13 year old taunt me and call me names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's exactly what happens.  They're too good.  Now, I got to warn you, you know, the deluxe set with the helmet, it doesn't fit your head.  So I bought it.  I was very disappointed.  It's really, it's a cat helmet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you see the MIT statue?  See the what?  I'm sorry, go ahead.  The guys, a bunch of students at MIT put a Master Chief helmet on one of the, a prank  on one of the statues on the campus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody told me the ending is very kind of disturbing.  But I don't know anything about it.  No spoilers.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No spoilers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I won't say anything about the ending of Bioshock either.  All I just want to say that morally I made the right choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's two endings.  And if you pop one of the girls, you know, if you go back to a previous...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I have to go back and kill a girl just to see what happens in the second ending.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's an interesting ending.  Like a crying game?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, no, I was, I say, well, I don't want to give any spoilers.  So I don't want to say anything.  But it, but I had, I actually really liked Bioshock.  I really enjoyed it.  But I, but Halo 3 is going to consume me.  My daughter was out last night at the Race for the Cure, which is an all night marathon.  And that didn't stop four of her friends from coming over to our house to play my Halo 3  on my Plasma TV.  She said, they came over, I said, oh, Abby's not here.  They said, that's okay.  We didn't really want to see Abby.  We just want to play Halo 3.  Wow.  Teenagers.  Patrick, I wish you all the best.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Patrick Norton is at revision3.com slash Tekzilla.  Roger Chang at dl.tv.  Steve Gibson at grc.com.  Google Don Risinger.  I'm Leo Laporte.  We thank you so much for joining us.
