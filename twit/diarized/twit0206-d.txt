Joining us right away, the soon-to-be-proud papa, Mr. Jason Calacanis.  Hello, Jason.  Yes, yes.  Congratulations.  Congratulations.  Now, this is unusual because I don't even, and I've known you for some time.  I don't know your wife's name.  I've never seen a picture of her.  You're very private about your personal life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am very public about my personal life.  I am very private about her personal life.  I get it.  Other people around me.  So, I like to live transparently and sort of put myself out there, but I always sort  of give my wife the ability to do it when she's ready and how she wants to.  Well, yeah, that's your choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It should be her choice too if she wants to do that or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  And she's just starting to get warmed up to Facebook and Twitter and stuff like that.  So, she'll probably decloak at some moment in time.  Certainly when the baby arrives on December 10th.  So when's the baby due?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  December 10th, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  December 10th with a little girl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And a girl.  Do you know a name yet?  I'm sure not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, my wife does the naming in the family.  She came up with the Bulldogs names, which are Taurus and Fondue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did a very good, well, Taurus is good.  Fondue is a little weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Fondue is definitely weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the Fondue.  Don't take your personal girl.  And it's funny because I know a lot more about your Bulldogs than I do about your wife.  I don't know what that means either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, they like to live in public, the Bulldogs.  The Bulldogs have Twitter accounts, twitter.com slash Taurus Calacanis and Fondue Calcans.  But she, my wife has a name and I'm warming up to it now.  She likes the name London, London Calacanis.  And I was like, what?  I hope you reserved the domain name.  I never heard.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Thanks for doing that on the air.  Oh, you haven't done that?  Oh gosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, where's my 40 second dump?  I can't delay it.  Oh, forget you heard that kids.  Stop, stop, stop.  And we have a wonderful bunch of people who would not dream of squatting on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'll be on Go Daddy in about 10 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, if you want, I'll give you five minutes to go get it.  No, no, no, it's totally okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can choose Peter and I'll get it.  But no.  Yeah.  So we're seeing maybe London Calacanis is it.  Maybe it's Sundance Calacanis.  Maybe it's something else.  I let her come up with the names and then I sort of-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like London.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like London.  It's definitely starting-  It's a little like Paris though.  Well that is the one thing in Brooklyn, right?  Because one of the, that soccer players kid is named after a city.  But you know, yeah, Beckham, Becks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Becks, call him Beckham.  Beckham Calacanis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Becks.  Oh my-  You're from Brooklyn?  You didn't call your kid Brooklyn.  Brooklyn's good.  London Calacanis is already taken.  Oh no.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There you go.  No.  Well I guess you better change the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well London's out.  Sorry baby.  Sorry, couldn't get the domain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I kind of feel sorry for who wasted like $8 on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, I think somebody got it before.  Don't you think?  I have Calacanis.com so I can do London.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think somebody got Calacanis between now and the time you mentioned it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can tell you right now who got it.  It was registered on July 31st.  Oh you sons of- wait a minute, that's three days ago.  That's three days ago.  Wait a second.  By somebody named John Humphrey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute, you told somebody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh you know what?  I did say it on my show that we're thinking London.  Oh look at this guy.  He's from lafn.org.  I wonder if he did this as a favor to me or if I'm going to have to go beat the living-  He's going to hold it hostage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what they do?  They do that and then when you complain they say, oh I did it as a favor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well this person will have done it as a favor.  He'll be run over by an orange electric car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also in the studio, another proud pop.  I'm really glad to have Peter Rojas in studio with us.  Thanks for having me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really good to be actually here in the studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it different somehow than you thought?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's everything I imagined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about the smell?  What do you think of that?  No, no, don't say that.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Peter's got a one year old?  I do.  He actually will be one next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, congratulations on that.  So there is something in the water.  Somebody on Twitter just the other day said, I think it was a Scobal.  All these people are having babies.  And there are a lot of babies in the Web 2.0 world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And in the 1.0 world also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really?  In the rest of the world.  Oh, the other world.  You mean with real people.  IRL.  Peter is the founder of a new site called gdgt.com.  He's been doing the GDGT podcast with Ryan Block for over a year now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually almost a year.  It's been about 11 months.  Oh, I didn't realize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  And of course with this fellow here was the founder of Engadget.  Yep.  This was Jason and at the beginning?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was something that we did together.  And before that I started Gizmodo also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, Jason, go to Londoncalicanus.com.  It says, congratulations, Jason.  This domain is a present for you and your wife.  This guy's a mensch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, domain noob.  What domain noob?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, this is the guy out of the chocolate covered grasshoppers.  Is it really?  No.  Oh, no, no, no.  He says like the guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's cool.  That's really nice.  I just emailed them.  That's kind of a cool thing.  Domainnoob.com.  John at domainnoob.com.  Thank you, John.  Oh, what a guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, that's sweet.  That's sweet.  You have a nice audience.  That was on Twists this week in startups?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was on this week in startups.  Yeah.  I did a live version of Twist at the Twist Up event in LA, which is some local event.  But the show's going great.  And of course, thank you again for letting me use this week in trademark.  Not that it's your trademark, but your whatever.  We all thank Mel Allen for that, actually.  You're doing This Week in Google.  Did I see that on Twitter with Jeff Jarbs?  Yep.  Just started that with Jeff and Gina Trapani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Those are two big heavy hitters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's a good show.  We just did our first show yesterday and I'm really excited.  I think it's going to be Google and the cloud.  But This Week in the Google and the Cloud was a little too much, so we shortened it.  It's a mouthful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's like This Week in Google and of course, anything related to Google, but  it's good because people can really drill down into AdSense, Gmail, whatever that minutiae  is, which you can't get into on This Week in Tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's perfect because Gina is a developer.  She started Lifehacker, so she's certainly a productivity expert, but she's also written  better Gmail.  She's written a lot of plugins for Google.  Tons of scripts.  She's fantastic.  Also, super knowledgeable.  And then Jeff wrote, What Would Google Do?  So, it's kind of a good panel.  And I'm really looking forward to it.  We'll always have a rotating fourth on there.  And I'm really looking forward to the people that we're going to be able to bring in like  Clay Shirky and so forth.  And of course, as many Google Mac cuts types as we can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they both have great networks, so that's going to be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Hey, you know me.  I'll use anybody's network.  What am I doing here?  I got Jason and Peter Rojas on.  I mean, let's talk about networking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you want to know where's This Week in Bing?  TWIB.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  TWIB.  Well, that's a good question.  Actually, Jason, it launches us into our first story.  Jason, you wrote a kind of scathing column on your blog, which I guess every once in  a while you'll blog if the occasion arises, saying that Yahoo just committed seppuku.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I sent it to my email newsletter.  And also, when I write a big one like that, that gets picked up, I put it on my blog because  too many people email me and say, Can you send that to me?  And it's just, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I subscribed to the list.  And anybody's allowed to do that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I have a tiny URL.com slash Jason's list with an S, Jason's List.  But yeah, it's like 16,000 people on it.  And probably about every three or four, I will post it to a blog just because I want  to get it out there.  And then, of course, my friends like Mike Arrington will post it without me giving permission  and not take it down if I asked them to.  So you might as well just post it.  Yeah.  It's sort of becoming a problem.  If I don't post it, everybody else is like, It's newsworthy and it's fair use to use your  content.  I'm like, OK, whatever.  But anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's technically legal, but I mean, it's not very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whatever.  You know, with friends like these.  Hey, you know, just do what I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Screw you, Arrington.  Just say that.  Screw you, Arrington dude.  Best moment in Twitter history.  Yeah, I'm living off that.  I'm getting t-shirts.  I'm getting hats.  Oh, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely.  But anyway, with the Yahoo deal, you know, for those of us who've been in the industry  for over 10 years, we remember that the first time any of us really used Google was at,  yahoo.com, right?  Yeah.  Yahoo gave up their search business and put Google in there.  And it was powered by Google.  The little logo was up on the right hand top, top of the right hand corner.  And that's how we learned what Google was.  And that's how the world learned about this incredible new search engine.  And of course, after a number of years of doing that, they switched over to the mothership  Google.com and the rest is history.  And it's my premise that search is the most important business, the first most important  business of the 21st century.  Sure, there'll be other businesses as we get through this century, but this is the biggest  one right now.  Highest profit margins, most upside, you know, and it's still very early.  It's a global race for search, etc.  And now you have Yahoo, which should have learned their lesson that the way you win in  search is by innovating, right?  Google innovated.  And instead of innovating, they just gave it to Microsoft.  Of course, it's more than happy to take the second place position and put hundreds of  millions of dollars, billions of dollars to work to innovate.  And if you look, Yahoo has really done very little innovative in the last couple of years  with search with the exception of Yahoo Boss, which is a very interesting project to sort  of open source search and make it a service.  But if you look at Microsoft...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What happens to Boss, by the way, now that it's been...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've actually been talking to my friends at Microsoft because I know the people who are  involved in the deal and they contacted me after I wrote my newsletter.  And I was like, listen, I'm very serious about Boss.  This is a really big win for you guys.  Keep it going. And they told me, you know, sort of off the record, you know, like we  understand it's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Boss is an API into what was the Yahoo search.  Yes. So they'd have to somehow import that over to Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, both searches will be consolidated.  So they're going to take the best of Yahoo search and Bing.  OK, so they don't just turn off the Yahoo spiders.  I don't believe so.  I think that they're going to look very deeply at what's the best of breed there for each one.  So there may be some features of each that they may want to keep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Explain to me why then that Yahoo gets the sales side of it.  Is that the best breed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Yahoo has a lot of salespeople and Yahoo wants to be able to sell both things.  They want to be able to sell display ads, which is going to be their big mission, and  also sell the search ads.  If you can only sell one of those things, you're going to be at a tremendous disadvantage  to Google because Google is going to be selling both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Yahoo keeps the content side, sells display ads into that.  And since they're already doing that, they can continue to sell the ads into the search.  Microsoft's gain out of this is they now are number two in search.  There's no number three, really.  And what does it give them? A 30 percent share, 20 percent share?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In the 20s, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I quote you and, you know, in fact, I quoted you yesterday on this week in Google saying,  you told me I think I'm right, a billion dollar per percentage point, roughly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And that's what people believe in terms of the market cap of each company.  And if you if you if you look at what Microsoft did, and we've been talking about it on this  week in tech for a couple of weeks now, a couple of years, it seems.  Well, just in just in just in with.  Yeah, exactly. With Bing and since the launch, they what did they do?  They bought a promising young startup, PowerSet.  They spent a couple of hundred million dollars or so on marketing.  And you said, by the way, Yahoo should have done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yahoo, Yahoo missed a bet there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And they innovated.  And so Microsoft proved very easily that if you put a little bit of resources  towards something, you can have a big impact.  And what does Yahoo do while they're negotiating with Microsoft?  They don't raise right to use the poker metaphor.  They just sort of sit there and watch Microsoft develop their hand and get stronger  and stronger and their position gets weaker and weaker.  You have to innovate in this industry.  That's the one thing we've learned over and over again, whether it's in consumer  electronics, which Peter covers, or more of the Web stuff, which I cover.  If you're not innovating, you're dying.  And Palm had that problem for a while and Microsoft had that problem for a while.  Oracle, Nintendo, you look at the other competitors, Apple to Microsoft.  Why are they beating them?  Why is Nintendo have more wheeze than Xbox?  Why does the iPhone crushing it and the MP3 player, the iPod crushing it?  And Oracle's database is doing so well.  It's because they innovate.  And Yahoo stopped.  It's just like the most basic lesson of our industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that what you tell startups and you tell entrepreneurs and businessmen who  come to you, continue to innovate or you die?  Is it like a shark?  You have to keep swimming?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely 100 percent.  You have to be scared to death.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really? All the time.  Paranoia.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wasn't that Andy Grove's book, Only the Paranoid Survives?  Only the Paranoid Survives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's true.  I mean, you really have to be constantly worried and never become complacent.  And I think it becomes very difficult at a big company because when you start off  and you're an entrepreneur, you start something and Jason and I both started a  few things now.  You're very hungry, very motivated and the stakes are very high for you.  Because you can know a failure for you is a very personal thing.  Once companies start to get really big and they start to have all these people  that weren't really there at the beginning and don't have a lot at stake,  you start screwing around, screwing around and they start to look at it as a job.  And I think it's difficult.  And I think one of the reasons why you look at Apple, for example,  being able to consistently innovate and drive the market is because Steve Jobs  doesn't need any more money.  It's a corporate culture that you...  It's partly a corporate culture and partly because you have to have one person  or a handful of people at the top who are relentless and who...  Jobs is relentless.  Jobs is relentless.  It's not about the money anymore.  It's just about being right.  It's about winning. It's about being right.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's interesting.  How do you create a corporate culture like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's all talent.  I mean, if you...  That's the skill.  Absolutely. I mean, I think if you look at Weblog Zinc,  the key thing I did right was getting Brian Alvey,  who was the tech side of the business, and Peter Ross,  who was the editorial side of the business, and Sean Gold,  who was our sales guy.  My job as a CEO was to find the most talented people  and get every obstacle possible out of their way to let them do  what they naturally do, which is be great.  And if you look at Yahoo, Josh from Delicious Left,  Katrina, Katerina...  Katerina Fake Left.  Yeah, she left from Flickr.  I mean, they couldn't keep any of the talent there.  And the stories I heard from folks in that sort of genre,  the entrepreneurship, were,  I have all these great ideas for Delicious 2.0.  I have all these great ideas for Flickr 2.0.  I don't want to say that these people said it.  It was other people, but it might have been them.  But I'm banging my head against the wall.  I cannot get any product released.  They couldn't release product at Yahoo.  And there was no person at the top saying,  these are the 10 most important things.  You remember the peanut butter manifesto, which was,  what the hell are we doing here?  We're doing like 5% better on 100 things.  What are the 10 things we really need to focus on?  And Yahoo had, I think, two of the most important assets  in the future of search.  One is Delicious, which is, by the way, human-powered search,  exactly what I'm trying to do at Mahalo.  And number two was Flickr,  which is image-based search and video-based search,  which could have been a really viable competitor  to YouTube in my mind,  if they didn't limit the video uploads and stuff like that.  And the search, image search on Flickr  is better than any other image search in the world,  I think, in terms of high-quality images.  And there's more Creative Commons images on there.  So they own image search,  and they could have owned video search  if they had executed better.  And when have you ever seen either of these products  promoted properly on the Yahoo homepage?  Never, never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they did this really half-hearted attempt  to integrate Delicious and Flickr into search,  and it wasn't done very well.  And there was no sense that anyone at Yahoo  really cared at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't some of this, though, Google doing some of this, too?  I mean, I think if Dodgeball and Jaiku  and quite a few properties that Google acquired  that have just died on the vine as well.  Yeah, I mean, that-  Is Google gonna prey to the same problem that Yahoo is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think if you look at the life cycle of any business,  that I think, you know, Clay Christensen talks about this  in the innovator's dilemma,  where it becomes very difficult on an institutional level  for any big company to really be able to identify  the thing that's gonna kill it, right?  It's like a dialectic.  You can't, it's like your blind spot.  You can't figure out the thing  which is gonna end up overtoppling you.  It's very difficult.  I mean, we see the same thing at Microsoft, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing that I think is interesting  about a Microsoft-Yahoo deal,  is it's really two dinosaurs mating.  Is there anything you could do to reinvent Yahoo  at this point to make it revitalize it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, one of the things that I thought  was really interesting is how much dominance Yahoo has  in financial stuff, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Mail.  Look at that New York Times article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was a great New York Times article.  I probably put it in our Delicious Things,  where they are, I'll give you an example, OMG.  You never hear of OMG?  This has twice the traffic of TMZ.  Yeah, absolutely.  I never even heard of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, OMG is their like graphical, you know,  celebrity gossip thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It looks like the National Enquirer.  It doesn't have an RSS feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Finance.yahoo.com is incredible.  Number one.  News, I think they're number one at.  Yahoo Mail is like three times

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the next biggest email system.  It's huge, and it's huge.  Well, that means they're a profitable,  that means they're a successful company, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, on some level, but I think it's funny  how AOL kind of figured out, I mean,  they need to take the strategy which AOL has adopted,  which is become a great content business,  and figure out how to create that content.  That's what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, AOL, not a good example at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but that's the strategy that AOL is adopting,  and I think Yahoo has a chance,  if they're gonna survive, I mean, they have to figure out.  If they're doing finance grade,  if they're doing the news and sports stuff great,  if they're doing mail great,  they need to figure out how to be great at those things  and better at those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is actually from GigaOM.  Jordan Golson went through,  Yahoo News, number one, 50 million uniques  compared to New York Times, 45.  Yahoo Finance, 20 million uniques.  AOL Money, 14.  Yahoo Sports, 25 million uniques.  ESPN, 21.  OMG, double the traffic of TMZ.  Yahoo Games in a tie with EA Online.  Yahoo Mail, two thirds of the total webmail market.  I mean, that's a company, boy, if you said to me,  without any names, would you like this company?  I'd say, yeah, baby, that's a stunning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the problem is the Google envy.  When you put yourself up against Google, which is-  Well, that's a mistake, isn't it?  Well, that was a mistake.  They were chasing Google, and when Peter  spent a little time at AOL,  I was the CEO at the time, we used to always say,  we're not at AOL, we're not trying to beat Google.  Yahoo has anchored themselves  because they're never gonna catch up to Google.  They don't have the same DNA,  they don't have the AdSense ad network,  and they're going to always be looked at  as sort of an also ran,  when they should have been just great  at what they're good at, which is communications,  content aggregation, and just double down on those things.  However, a little investment in integration of search,  and this could be a much different story.  And Yahoo had a ton of cash, a ton of equity,  in terms of a currency, they could have bought 20 companies  over the last two years, and if 18 of them don't work out,  but two of them turn into Flickr, or OMG, or Facebook,  then they're in the money.  You only need to get one out of 10 to hit.  And they didn't do any of that stuff,  it was a pure lack of leadership.  Is it too late?  Probably.  If you, I mean, it will still exist,  and it's still gonna make multiple billions of dollars a year.  Will it break out?  I don't know Carol Bart's enough to know.  Obviously she's a good deal maker,  which is why they brought her in,  is to get this deal finally done,  which you remember I predicted last year  when John Dvorak and I were arguing over it not getting done,  I said it has to get done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this isn't quite that same deal,  that was an acquisition deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but even this is essentially acquiring  the most important piece, so it is a hybrid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As Steve Ballmer said, nothing was sold here,  this isn't an acquisition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It is, you say it is.  Yeah, I mean, basically what they're saying is.  Colonization.  Yeah, it's Borg, it's Borg-esque.  Invasion.  They've colonized Yahoo.  Yeah, exactly, the Cylons have nuked the planet,  but it's not really an acquisition,  they basically took everything they wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ballmer says, quote, nothing got bought, nothing got sold,  but the partnership in and of itself creates economic value,  it creates an immediate opportunity for synergy,  I hate that word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was synergy and Microsoft stock going up  and Yahoo's going down.  Yeah, that's interesting, yeah.  I think they transferred exactly $2 billion.  Really?  Of market cap from one company to the other.  Isn't that interesting?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right there, there you go.  I guess that's the market saying who bought whom.

Transcript:  The market is generally right,  when people put big bets on things,  but I've met the investors who own single to double  to triple digits, I mean, it's one to like 5%, let's say,  of Yahoo, and I've talked to them over the years.  These are the big institutions that hold big positions  in these companies, and they were tired,  and they've been hearing the story that they're gonna,  they're gonna reinvent itself and do something,  Terry Semmel and then Jerry Yang and then this,  and if you look at the great companies,  Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, Larry and Sergey and Eric,  Steve Jobs, if I didn't mention him,  Jeff Bezos, probably the most underrated CEO of that group,  all of those guys are the founders who are still innovating  and going to work every day,  and when your founder is not there innovating,  and you lose the culture, you don't have the people,  and then it starts to end, and that's the death kneel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, we're gonna give Peter a chance now  to talk about gadgets, because there's a gadget story  also in here, and that's the Apple iPhone  rejecting Google Voice app.  There was a third party Google Voice application,  which Apple kicked out.  It had been in there, and then Google tried  to put its own application in there.  It had submitted it six weeks ago.  Apple the other day says, no, now the FCC says,  Google, Apple, AT&T, you got some splaining to do.  Their real question, I think, the fundamental question is,  how much did AT&T influence Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that it's a very hot topic right now,  a very big question, and it's a legitimate concern,  I think, that if it turns out that it's AT&T  dictating what sort of applications and devices  can be used on its network, that's kind of an issue.  I mean, the FCC is sort of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's verboten.  That's been an issue for the FCC.  They really wanna open up these phones.  They do wanna open up these things,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but I think the thing is we have to separate out  the issue between, I think Apple is,  if it's, I think Apple has the right to determine  what services and applications run on its device.  That's a separate issue than AT&T determining  what services and devices run on its network,  because the FCC, their job is to keep the networks open  and to make sure that there's a...  I mean, we don't have true network neutrality,  but there is, because these are public airwaves,  the FCC has a mandate to make sure  that there's fairness there.  But I think that's a different issue  than a handset maker being required to install  or disable certain features on a device.  And so I think that's what the FCC needs to investigate.  I think Apple is well within its rights  to determine whatever goes into the app store.  I think they're wrong to reject something,  because I think from a business standpoint,  I think it's wrong, and I think, again,  like openness beats...  We were talking before the show about our inherent bias,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and I completely agree with you, Peter,  that openness beats closed proprietary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, that's why I use an Android phone,  because I philosophically wanna support something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a hard one.  I have an Android phone, and I'd sure like to have...  If an Android...  Ah, I'd like to use an Android phone,  but the iPhone has so much...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're getting better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Using the iPhone is kind of like living in Mussolini's Italy.  The trains run on time.  There's some bad stuff going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you know what happened to Mussolini.  I know.  They hung him upside down in a square  and kicked him in the head.  That's gotta hurt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If this is true, that open wins,  and I agree with that to a certain extent,  but I think it's got that sort of  Cory Doctorow absoluteness to it,  that maybe isn't always gonna happen,  because if that was true,  why is iTunes still crushing it,  and there's no iPod competitor,  even though there are better devices than the iPod?  I don't think we're saying openness wins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think it always wins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think philosophically, that's what I prefer, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, openness frequently doesn't,  it's sad to say.  But in the same way that fascists often beat democracies,  it doesn't mean they're better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think, I mean, in this specific instance,  there's a lot of people who are angry at Apple,  and I mean, look, Mike Arrington was very public in saying,  I'm gonna stop using the iPhone  because I disagree with this policy.  I'm gonna vote with my pocketbook.  And I think that is the appropriate response.  I think if AT&T said you couldn't use an Android device  on their network because of Google Voice,  that would be a really serious problem.  I think that is something that FCC should step in  and take action on.  Currently you can.  You can buy a SIM. Absolutely.  You can buy an unlocked U1 and use it on AT&T.  I know people that do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why?  Well, I guess T-Mobile's kind of not the strongest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It depends on where you live, also,  what kind of service you get.  But I think if you don't like what Apple has the right,  I mean, there are lots of phones  that don't work with Google Voice at all, right?  Because they don't allow applications.  They're dumb phones.  So should the FCC mandate that all of those handset makers  are required to enable applications on their phones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was my one qualm about this.  I'm not sure I want the FCC to tell a business  how it can run its business.  On the other hand, AT&T is regulated by the FCC.  Well, as I'm saying, they're two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to separate out the Apple versus AT&T.  And that's what we need to get to the bottom of is,  was it AT&T mandating to Apple  that you cannot allow this application?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It seems pretty clear from the letters TechCrunch published  that the FCC's real interest was in AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They want to get to the bottom of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But there were two paragraphs at the end of the letter  that they sent to Apple saying,  that had nothing to do with AT&T, that said,  well, how many applications have you kicked out?  How many applications have you barred?  We want to know what the reasons are you barred them.  There is more going on.  I'm not sure that I want the government determining  what apps are available.  I mean, if you want a closed phone, look at the sidekick.  Nobody complained that the sidekick had-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly, you can't get Google Voice on the sidekick.  Yeah, and it's a smart phone.  Relatively.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's smarter than a razor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a question.  I have Skype on my iPhone now.  Well, there's an example.  And why is Skype allowed and not Google Voice?  Because I don't use Google Voice.  Is there some difference in the service  that one would be allowed and not the other?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I know that Google Voice,  at least on the Android version of the app,  I obviously didn't test the iPhone version.  It doesn't run over VoIP.  It's not an IP connection for the call.  You're actually using-  They call you.  They call you, basically, yeah,  they basically call you and use your cell phone minutes.  You're calling over the voice network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know, but my guess would be  that the issue that AT&T had was free SMS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That might have been part of it.  Because that's a big profit center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's true, there are.  And they're on the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why I have a feeling that it was a little bit AT&T  and a little bit Apple in this decision.  They both determined that Google was a strategic threat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because yeah, Skype works great with Wi-Fi on the iPhone.  You can't use it on 3G.  I'm sure that was AT&T's request.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because that would be then bypass,  using their data network to bypass their voice network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How does tethering play into this?  Because shouldn't tethering be my right or not?  It seems like it's a related issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a good question.  I know that the carrier solution has been  to discharge you an extra 15, $20 a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  AT&T says it will be doing that,  but hasn't yet done that on the iPhone.  Sprint does it, a lot of carriers do it.  T-Mobile, by the way, allows tethering,  says it's part of the deal.  You get bandwidth, so you can use it any way you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, generally speaking.  I mean, this is the sort of the thing that,  the thing that we're really not talking about,  but should be, is the wireless industry  competitive enough in this country?  We have only four major carriers,  and it's really just two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Four that act like four monopolies, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But when you think about it,  it's really AT&T and Verizon are the big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because it's CDMA versus GSM, or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's just that,  I don't, I mean, I'm not sure that that's part of it.  I think that what it is is that,  you know, it's just typical how industries go.  You get the, they have a snowball effect where.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Verizon and AT&T are dominant.  They're dominant, and Sprint and T-Mobile are smaller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're just tiny.  And there's probably not enough competition.  But I mean, even to me, like the bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the problem is not competition, it's collusion.  I think these guys know what the other guy does.  You know, Tafen Pogue, I talked to David earlier today.  He's in the, you know, got a campaign going on the Times to,  it's kind of a silly, trivial thing,  but it isn't that trivial when he explains it  to restore the beep.  His problem is that all four carriers  now have a 15 second announcement after you say,  hi, this is Leo, please leave me a message  that goes on and on.  And yeah, it's just 15 seconds,  but he estimates it could be as much as half a billion dollars  in revenue for Verizon because of the extra call time  involved.  And you're burning up minutes.  You're burning up minutes.  And only Sprint allows you to turn it off.  But the interesting thing is it started with Verizon.  I remember it bugged the heck out of me  because Verizon did this and nobody else did.  And all the other guys go, oh, look,  Verizon's making some money, let's all do it.  So there's this kind of implicit collusion  going on as well, right?  Well, absolutely.  If Verizon charges 20 cents for SMS, okay, we all do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's really no reason to charge very much at all  for SMS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, at 20 cents a message, it's $1,500 a megabyte.  It's the most expensive bandwidth available anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's almost impossible for them to even really assign  a dollar value to the usage of the network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because it's also the network is a fixed cost.  They have a fixed cost.  Once they build the network, it doesn't matter how much.  Yeah, so that's 100% profit on that $1,500,  whatever it is a megabyte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, in that case, it should be free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It should be free.  And I think that's worth it.  Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How much do you pay for email?  You know, like how much was the emails you sent today?  It was the same price you paid for your web browsing  and everything else you get, a flat rate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Though I remember when I had Prodigy about 20 years ago,  you got, I think, 25 free messages.  And then after that, it was 25 cents an email.  Genius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually would like to bring that back  due to some of the emails I'm getting.  For spammers only.  You know, there was no Prodigy spam problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  when it was 25 cents a message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They actually had it.  There was a company called Good Mail  who wanted to put economics on top of it.  You remember AOL.  It's very controversial.  Yeah, very controversial.  But it was like a fraction of a penny,  but I guess the nonprofits were like, wait a second,  we have a million people on this mailing list.  So looking at all these companies,  if we had to rank the most anti-competitive,  draconian, evil companies in the technology space,  is anybody even close to Apple at this point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you gotta throw in the cable companies.  You gotta throw in the wireless companies.  We have quite a large number  of predatory companies out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's put infrastructure on the side  because we know they're evil.  They're infrastructure companies.  Oh, is that true?  They have to be?  Well, if the AT&T are cable,  they're gonna be an Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If they dig a ditch, they have to be bad guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I've dug some ditches in my life.  I've buried some bodies,  like in the casino sense of the word.  But putting aside those evil people,  just technology companies.  Google, Microsoft, Oracle.  Is there anybody who is more anti-competitive and closed,  forgetting how good they are with their products  and how sexist they are?  Everybody would agree Apple's number one  in terms of sex appeal.  But in terms of just being closed and anti-competitive,  is anybody more anti-competitive than Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've said this for years.  I've said Apple has become the evil empire.  Maybe they've always been,  but as they get bigger and more powerful,  it becomes more evident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, isn't it funny how no one  is really scared of Microsoft anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they used to be the evil empire.  Everyone used to be terrified

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that Microsoft was gonna get into your market.  It's almost kind of like...  Nobody cares anymore.  I almost feel sorry.  I do, I totally feel sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's a business cycle.  I think that's a standard business cycle.  But it's just kind of funny how the rules reverse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think what Apple is doing is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When Apple was the underdog, they've always done this.  But when they were the underdog, no big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, when you attain this sort of position of power  or dominance in an industry,  and there are dominant in a handful of industries, let's say,  you can sort of see them abusing their power.  And again, you're right.  It's not a big deal when they're the underdog  and they're doing things.  Because you're like, well, yes, they're closed,  and yes, they're doing these things,  but they have to do these things  to fight against Microsoft or whatever.  But yeah, it's not encouraging.  And I think that...  It's not clear to me whether all the issues,  like the complaints of iPhone app developers  and the frustrations they're having  is gonna spill into a more general distaste  amongst consumers, more generally speaking.  But we sort of saw...  You sort of see how these things go, right?  Where you start to see the early adopters  and you start to see people being a little bit frustrated.  I think, again, Apple creates products  that people love so much that they can get away with a lot.  But I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They do get away with murder.  But if you think about...  If you think clearly about what the iTunes,  iPod Nexus is, it's absolutely monopolistic.  And the EU and others have complained about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not sure you break it up though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm on tip about it  because I have my new iPhone 3GS  and I have all these audio books,  wonderful audio books I might add from Audible.  And I have some on my home computer  and some my office computer.  And then I buy some on my iPhone.  How do you consolidate when you've purchased  on three different things?  I can't figure it out.  And now I'm like,  shouldn't these all be in one locker somewhere?  And I have to basically erase my phone at the office,  come home and put those audio books on.  I wanna erase it when I get to the office  if I wanna listen to those audio books.  It's making me insane.  I've looked up all this information.  There's no way to consolidate your libraries

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  without exactly solving it.  I don't know what it does with Audible,  but when you buy a song on your iPhone,  the first time you connect it to iTunes,  it says, may I transfer these files over to iTunes?  It becomes part of iTunes.  I'm not sure what happens to the audio books.  I don't think that happens.  But Audible works differently  because the authentication system is through Audible.  So you can copy those files.  I don't know how you'd get it off the iPhone.  Don't buy books on the iPhone, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, it's not just Audible,  but it's also when you buy songs.  If you're buying them on two different computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then you could transfer them, right?  You just copy them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, if they're not,  copy, if they don't have copyright protection on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I'm not to defend Apple here,  but you can log into up to five different computers  with that same iTunes account.  So you can play that song on five computers.  Fortunately, that's gone away for music,  not for video, not for TV shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People are saying it with the Kindle, right?  Where people are complaining about,  they've synced their Kindle books  to multiple different devices.  Maybe they have an iPhone and an iPod touch  and a Kindle one.  DRM has got to die.  This stuff sucks.  Yeah, it's.  Just sucks.  It's creating really negative consumer experiences.  And I think the thing, if you're Amazon, for example,  that the Kindle is so new, is so nascent as a platform,  that the last thing you want to do is to create  all these frustrations with people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But do they have a choice?  Isn't it the publishers that are insisting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the publishers are, but I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, look what happened when they put on the reading book.  The publishers complained that immediately Amazon  had to flip that switch.  Oh, the audio.  They can't do the text to speech.  I mean, I think just as Apple was kind of beholden  to the music companies when iTunes first started,  Amazon, well, maybe not,  because Amazon sells a lot of books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amazon has a lot of cloud.  But I think that the book publishers  are extremely conservative.  We know this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We know this.  So Jason, your point.  Yes, Apple is evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The most evil though.  I think we should make it very, I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did it two years ago.  I will have to find this, but two years ago, I warned.  I said, I went on the radio.  I said to millions of people,  Apple is about to switch places with Microsoft  as the evil empire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember.  I remember you saying it.  And I just think as an industry,  we have to put pressure on Apple and just,  you know, like I think Mike Arrington's step,  I mean, screw Mike Arrington, but I mean, his step to.  I already have, thank you.  Yeah, no, hey, oh, hey.  Hey.  Hey, oh.  Give me glass.  Give me glass.  You stay glassy, San Diego.  This weekend, blank.  So yeah, it just as an industry,  I think we have to start putting some pressure on them  to change their behavior.  And one thing I'm wondering, Steve, Peter,  since you know the people at Apple pretty well,  is this a Steve Jobs,  is his mind wired to close systems,  ease of use through the whole process?  And does the other guy, what's his name, Cook or whatever,  who's gonna take over?  Tim Cook, the CFO, yeah.  Yeah, you think when Steve retires,  that Tim Cook will maybe reevaluate  some of these positions on draconian,  heavily draconian positions on,  we have to lock this thing down and, you know,  you can't get an application on this  without get approval from the app store.  I mean, I'm a grownup.  I mean, I should be able to put anything I want on my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I think, well, I think as long as,  you knew Steve retires, he's still gonna be on the board.  And he's gonna have a lot of influence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I spent a weekend with Steve Jobs once.  It was a 4th of July weekend.  He was still at Next.  He hadn't yet been, you know,  he wasn't yet re-crowned king of Apple.  Yeah.  But, and it was very interesting.  The guy is brilliant.  And he knows that he's the smartest guy.  He's one of those guys like Bill Gates,  comes into a room, I'm the smartest guy in the room.  It's just a fact.  And he acts that way, which comes off fairly arrogant.  He's also very aggressive.  And I think that he has a killer instinct.  I think he hit the nail on the head in the first place.  This guy, it's not about money for him.  This guy doesn't wanna lose.  And I think that he's very smart,  smart enough to have figured out  of a really brilliant play with the iTunes store,  the iPod, the closed system.  You can put the layer of ease of use on top of it.  And I know he does.  I know that that's key.  You know, he said, well, it's easier that way,  just as the trains ran on time in Italy.  But ultimately, that's not what's going on for him.  He wants to win at business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he has a very singular vision  for how this stuff is supposed to be.  And he's a perfectionist.  We all know that.  But I think he also has a,  I mean, he's someone who has a really specific approach  to this stuff.  And he really values,  he's created a very strong culture of secrecy at Apple.  I know people who work at Apple,  and they tell me some pretty hilarious stories  about what it's like to work there,  about how when you're in a room with,  and you're working on something secret,  you have to flip like a flashing light,  so that people know not to look over your desk.  Do not look.  I've got the flashing light.  And he's really built, I mean,  it's almost kind of like a police state in a sense,  where you don't.  Oh yeah.  You know your phone is tapped.  Everything is very, it's very vertically oriented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've talked to people who say,  we don't look at Steve in the elevator.  We don't talk to Steve.  We don't want to attract his attention.  He's like the eye of a mortar.  He's like, don't let the, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, and I think that's why,  hoping that Tim Cook coming on as a CEO might change,  it might not.  But I think the thing is,  whatever Tim Cook might really think about things,  he has definitely not let any of us know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  And would it be as a successful company if Tim Cook says,  ah, let's go more open.  Let's be more relaxed.  Let's be more fuzzy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a tough question to answer.  I think that, I think one of those things that,  you know, we generally believe that open beats closed,  but I think that if you can offer closed  and a really great experience,  you can get away with things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hold on a second.  Hold on a second.  You're telling me the iPhone,  if it was available on any network,  would not be as successful as it is only on one?  That's an interesting question.  Well, that's a different question.  Or that the iPhone,  the second one though is,  or that the iPhone,  if you could install any application on it,  including porn and other stuff  that maybe Steve Jobs isn't so big on,  that wouldn't be more successful?  Of course it would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, except that, I mean, I think from,  if you talk, I'm not to defend it,  because I obviously think that  the iPhone should be completely open.  But I think what the Apple's perspective is  that if you open it up and it's a phone  and people suddenly install something  and they can't make phone calls on it,  they're gonna be really pissed off.  If your computer stops working,  usually you can live.  But when you can't make phone calls,  people get really unhappy really quickly.  And so that's generally been the carrier's perspective  about this stuff is we don't want the phones  to be something that people can screw up too easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love this one.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation  filed a request to the Copyright Office to legalize,  or at least to say it's legal to jailbreak a phone,  in particular the iPhone.  Apple filed comments with the agency  explaining that jailbreaking could allow hackers  to alter the phone's baseband processor software  and quote, a local or international hacker  could potentially initiate commands  such as a denial of service attack  that could crash the tower software,  rendering the tower entirely inoperable  to process calls or transmit data.  Jailbreaking is a terrorist act.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Can you, I mean, by the way, the very-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not to bomb us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The very next week, Charlie Miller demonstrates at DEF CON  that every iPhone in the world can be easily hacked  with a SMS message.  I mean, they're saying,  oh, you can't change the iPhone software  and make us insecure.  Maybe you should change the iPhone software.  Anyway, Apple did respond with a 3.01 update  that apparently fixed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The joke of all of this is like,  one, we have denial of services attacks on the internet  for what?  Constantly.  Going on 20 years.  Constantly, yeah.  And nobody is concerned about the internet.  Number two, did you see this story  about DEF CON air traffic control hacking?  That was scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, tell me about that.  This was at DEF CON this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Basically, they showed that you could  shut down information going into an air traffic control  tower, jam radar, submit fake aircraft flight plans.  I'm reading from the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What you do is you could actually get certified  as a student pilot and then get access  to some FCC flight plan website.  And then you could- Do it through the website?  And then you can flood that site with flight plans  because there's no limit.  First off, they don't do much to authenticate who you are.  And then there's no limit to how many flight plans  you can submit.  Oh boy.  It was pretty interesting.  It's an overflow, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, basically, every overflow.  I mean-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fred Von Lohmann of the EFF said,  Apple's claims are preposterous.  He says there are a million, as many as a million  jailbroken iPhones.  So far, no one's destroyed mobile towers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, also in a related story,  you can climb up a phone pole and cut the cables  and also disable the network.  So we're gonna have to get rid of phone flippers  and any scissor capable of cutting any gauge wire  above a certain strand.  It's the weakest defense I've ever heard.  Apple should be brought up on antitrust immediately  for not letting other MP3 players into iTunes.  It's the simplest, easiest thing they could do.  It's totally anti-competitive and terrible for the industry.  And I'm a total Ayn Rand, less government,  let people get rich guy, but they should stop Apple now  because it's getting out of control.  And before Apple gets any more market share in these things,  they should be made to open them up, period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple said, by the way, that jailbreaking  could also pave the way for drug dealers  to change the exclusive chip identification number,  which would enable calls to be made anonymously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did they mention what Al-Qaeda could do?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or buy a burner, which would be a lot easier, frankly.  Maybe the drug dealer really wants an iPhone  because he wants that cannabis app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, just buy a prepaid phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did they mention what Osama Bin Laden could do  with this jailbroken iPhone?  That's next.  I think that he could do something pretty bad with it.  Yeah. That's next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He could figure out how to use it in a cave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  He could be recruiting people with a jailbroken iPhone.  He could create an Al-Qaeda recruiting network application,  sneak it into the iPhone store,  and this could be huge for him, huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So are you saying, Mr. Anne Rand, open free market guy,  that the Department of Justice  should be shutting Apple down, should be suing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Shut it down.  Close the...  Shut it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chain up the doors.  Don't be so bad luck the doors.  Lock it up.  It's raw.  You know what, sell it to Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That'll shut it down even faster.  Just shut it down.  Let Carol Bartz run it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's an absolute hypocritical disaster  for them to be going after Google or Microsoft.  I mean, Microsoft putting a browser  in their operating system,  like it's some big deal or browsers are free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's crazy, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then going after Google  because they have some market share that they earned  in an industry where you can switch from providers  as easily as typing five characters,  and in Bing's case, four.  And you're gonna tell me Google's got some monopoly  when you can type in four fracking characters,  and then Apple releases a new update  to every device you own,  and you can't use it unless you take this device  and ram it up your butt,  and it's un-  Well, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, part of this is that this stuff moves so fast.  So Microsoft was a threat,  and it took a long time for the EU  to kind of go through this process.  They've been doing it for seven years.  Maybe they're not a threat anymore.  It's like, they grew out of the threat.  Apple wasn't a threat because they were these little guys.  They've grown into being a threat.  This stuff, the pace of change in the tech business  way outpaces the pace of government regulation.  Yeah, and I would say, again,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  if you really don't like it,  don't use an iPhone or don't use an iPod.  That's why I don't buy that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do, because I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there you go.  I want the trains to run on time.  But then it's not enough of an issue to bother you, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it bothers me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But not enough to not use the stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's getting to the tipping point, Peter.  I think you're a canary in the coal mine.  You see this stuff five years ago.  You want to make a point about it.  Mike Harrington sees it last week.  Leo and I will be there next week.  Next year.  Next year, whatever.  We'll be at some point on the countdown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a G1.  I really wanted to like the G1.  I had a Pre.  I really wanted to like the Pre.  I was ready to buy it, but they're just functionality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's true.  They're just not quite there yet, but they will be.  And the rest of the industry-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'm not willing to sacrifice for the political point,  because first of all, nobody knows what I use or cares.  I mean, I could be like Mike and make the big announcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Except on GDGT.  Oh yeah.  That's the point of the site.  Yeah, you can vote with your dollar

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and put it on your profile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's interesting.  You've created a new political tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, actually maybe everyone could start removing  some device in protest from their list  or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What about the battle between Palm, Pre, and Apple  over the iTunes syncing?  Who's going to win that one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is pursuant to what Jason's just talking about.  I mean, what Palm wants to be able to do  is they want people to be able to sync their music  and obviously not the copy protected stuff,  but their music and photos and stuff like that  from iTunes over to the Pre.  You can sync the Pre without iTunes.  Right, but it's convenient to be able to.  People manage their collections in iTunes.  It's an easy way to transition away,  transition to a Pre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it Apple's right to do that, to disable the Pre?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you're starting to get into a real gray area there  because it is their software.  And what Palm is doing is they're doing some tricks.  And remember, a lot of these guys who built the Pre  are ex-Apple guys.  And so they know how to do it.  They basically trick iTunes into recognizing  the Pre as an iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and what's interesting, initially they  identified as a Pre.  And as soon as Apple made that change to iTunes, they changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it has to do with the different layers  of identification in the USB protocol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The hub is still a Pre hub, but the device is no longer a Pre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they're doing this like cat and mouse thing.  There may be a point where they're able to sort of outsmart  the Pre, but on the other hand, they  might have to do something that they might have to actually  start to build some hardware encryption or authentication  into the iPods themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The equivalent of this, Leo, would be if,  because you're using Windows, you could only  use a Seagate drive.  No Western Digital.  That thumb drive, not approved.  You can only buy a Windows thumb drive to put your documents on.  I mean, that's what's happening.  And people just sit there like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but it's a different world.  The cell phone world has always been a little bit more  closed than the PC world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But just MP3 players.  I mean, it's a hard drive.  Shouldn't you be able to put your, sync your stuff to anything?  No, I'm with you. I'm with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What would be really nice is if Apple said, you know what,  we're just really happy that you're using iTunes,  even if you're not going to use an iPod.  So we'll let you use any USB mass storage device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think that's the point of iTunes, but it would be.  I don't think that's the point of iTunes.  But you would think, you would want, I guess, that the company

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  would sort of think we just want people like that.  One step to converting a customer long term is to get them  using your software or whatever.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not our decision to make, I guess, is the point, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's I mean, I don't run Apple or any hard work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. And should the government say what to say something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's tough because it's it's starting.  You're starting to get into a gray area.  And next thing you know, Apple started invoking some DMCA nonsense.  Just a matter of time.  They broke some encryption.  Just a matter of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like that, I can I can just prove what a hypocrite Steve Jobs is in like two seconds.  OK, remember, he did his first blog post or open letter  Thoughts on Music. Oh, yeah.  Copy protection. Yeah.  And he's like telling the music industry how they need to get off of DRM  and they need to be more open and they need to embrace new technology,  make it easy for consumers.  He is a hypocrite of hypocrites.  And he's full of he's just a good businessman.  No, but it's a it's hypocrisy to say you sit there and preach to the music industry  like you're some god.  He's so high on his own supply, Steve Jobs. I'm sick of him.  I mean, I really am to sit there and preach to the music industry,  get rid of DRM and then on the other hand say,  but you can only use my MP3 player.  You can't use anything else.  It's really it's just garbage, you know, and I'm just sick of him.  I don't care how good the products are.  But if anybody knows when the new MacBook era is coming out, I would

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And let's not forget that Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak got their start  selling blue boxes to hack the phone system.  Talk about irony.  All right, when we come back, it's going to be the annals of the crazy lawsuit.  But before before we do that, Hans Van Rock in our chat room needs a smoke.  And he wants me to go to a break right now.  So, Hans, you may smoke them if you got them.  I'm going to mention our good friends at Citrix, the folks who do Go To My PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for a very long time.  And as you guys know, the job of the audience right now is to do.  Jason, you really don't have to do this.  This is my new advertising format.  It's my new ad format, which you do this on twist.  I do it on twist. It's incredible.  It's a reason the sponsor sponsor now.  I want everybody out there who can hear my voice.  And it doesn't matter if you're listening to this in 2010 or 2012 or 2009,  just to say on their Twitter account, it cost you nothing to do this.  You don't pay for twit.  Peter Rojas is here. I'm here.  You know, it's free. It's Sunday. It's free. It's free.  What does it cost you to just say, you know what?  Thank you at GoToMeeting.  GoToMyPC, right? Yeah, I don't know what.  I don't know if they have an ad account.  What is their ad? Yeah, just what I mean, even if they don't just say,  thank you, go to my PC on your Twitter account. Just say it.  It will take you 10 seconds. Thank you for sponsoring twit.  Then whoever this marketing person is, you know that they're getting pitched  on social media like crazy.  And the old people are saying, give us a million dollars  to the social media project.  And you know what they say now?  Twitter is our social media project.  We get 1000 twits every we get 1000 tweets every time we're on Twitter.  That means something to that to that marketing manager.  And that means you are contributing to the show.  That's brilliant. I'm just saying.  I mean, it's not like you already.  We're not asking the audience for money.  Just tweet about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Except I don't want to.  I don't want them to fill up Twitter with spam either, though.  I mean, isn't that kind of spammy?  Oh, we lost him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's one. It's just one little tweet.  It's one. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One little tweet. It's one little tweet.  Just one hundred seventy five thousand people doing one little tweet.  Have you what do you think of the new Twitter front page, by the way?  You think that that's it was actually this is how far it's gone with Twitter.  This is actually a news story in mainstream media.  Twitter has new home page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, I don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How do you make that a news story anyway?  What don't you like about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just think that it's pretty sparse.  But I don't even mind the sparse.  I like minimal design stuff in general.  But I think that it's starting to emphasize  Twitter is more of a search engine.  Well, isn't that what it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is kind of. But I think that because on the front page, it has popular topics.  That's all you really see.  You say, share and discover what's happening right now anywhere in the world.  And then you have a search box and you have the popular topics,  the trending topics, and then a sign up now.  So you're right. It is, in fact, like a search engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not saying it shouldn't have search on the front page or search  shouldn't be a component to it.  But I think that what makes Twitter really valuable for me  and what I really like about it is the fact that it's conversational, right?  It's about people. And they say join the conversation.  But they're really saying like they're really trying to turn it.  I think some I can't remember who the point is.  I wish I could credit them saying Twitter's just turning us  into sort of like cogs in their giant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's what I mean. Twitter's the next evil empire.  Right. Make it all.  It's a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll tell you, this this this home page is is not intended for us  because obviously we don't see it when we log in.  We go to our replies for new users.  No, not for new users either.  Who is it for? This is for investors.  Oh, this is for whoever is going to take Twitter public, whoever is doing it.  They want the perception to be there a search engine. Why?  Because that's what's valuable.  There are a billion dollars per percentage point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you know that actually, Twitter is a search engine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter is absolutely this week and tag is a search engine, actually.  Anybody would like to do a search?  Yeah, I'm going to work that out.  Point zero zero zero zero zero zero one percent in the market.  I'll take it.  Peter and I will give you search results live on Twitter.  Ask us anything.  What do you want to know?  Just no adult topics, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's interesting. So that's really I think you're right.  I think you're exactly right, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're sending a signal. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think Jason's right.  And that's why I think that if you if you're someone that doesn't really know  what Twitter is and you hit this page for the front, this this this  that doesn't help for the first doesn't really help you understand what's going on.  And it doesn't really give you a sense of of the conversational nature of the site  and how it's really about connecting with other your friends and stuff like that.  Yeah. I mean, whatever.  I mean, at this point, maybe there are very few people left who  don't know what Twitter is.  It might have sort of there's sort of a sense that it may have reached  its sort of saturation in the mainstream.  Jason, you still bullish on Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, very much so. I mean, if you type in Jay-Z or Sarah Palin,  what you'll get in that search engine is going to be in, you know,  in some way as compelling as Google or stumble upon or delicious search.  And that's always been my premise with Mahalo and any human powered search engine  is you there's something cool about, you know, there's a difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I make a distinction between search and discover ability, though.  It's more about discovery, isn't it, than search?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, of course. And, you know, that's why it's not a Google replacement.  It's you know, there are multiple search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe. And I think Jeff Jarvis made this point on Twig yesterday.  Maybe discovery is the next search.  No. No. Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it is a nice thing to waste time with and to know it is.  It's a time wasting kind of thing.  It's like, but if you want to have an actually accomplish a goal,  which is what most people use search for, I'm looking to buy a car.  I'm like, you know, I'm doing research.  I'm trying to find a website. I'm still in search.  It's not good for that.  I mean, if you type in Toyota Prius or you type in iced tea,  you know, or, you know, salmon recipe, it's not going to be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it might be better.  But if you type Abraham Lincoln, it's not going to be useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, of course.  Give me an example of what I use Twitter for.  I mean, is it for last night?  I'm staying, you know, not too far from here.  And there are fireworks in the direction of Petaluma.  And so I just said, what's going on?  Obviously, Google is not the best place to find out what's going on.  Real time.  But real time, I just I just searched on Twitter for fireworks.  Did you find anything?  I actually found out a lot of fireworks going on in L.A.  It's not perfect.  It's not perfect yet.  But but I've used it before, actually.  It's funny, actually, is it  anytime I see fireworks and don't know what's going on,  which is actually happened a few times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you ever want to know when a celebrity is dead, Twitter is the greatest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's almost a little too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the fastest way to find out who's dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Fifty five thousand times like Michael Jackson's dead.  Really? Is he still dead?  Oh, wait, I need one hundred and ten thousand results for that.  OK, great. You know, like it's it's it is one hundred forty characters.  You're not going to get that much out of it.  Although I will say, I just typed in  Twitter into search and you should pull it up on your screen.  I saw it. Go to my PC is going to be pretty happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of a trending topic.  Thank you, everybody.  Except for the one guy who said, F, go to my PC.  I hate him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the dark side of social media.  There's always one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here's here's a story in the annals of law that I quite enjoy.  And I don't know if there's anything to say about this.  The story comes from the Chicago Sun-Times.  It's about a young woman, a a.  Woman named Amanda Bonin.  Who Twittered.  In May of this year,  she no longer has an account and this tweet is long gone, but she Twittered,  You should just come anyway.  Who said sleeping in a moldy apartment is bad for you?  Horizon Realty thinks it's OK.  Now, it turns out Horizon Realty is the apartment management firm  that owns the apartment she was staying in.  They saw the tweet and they have now sued her for libel  for fifty thousand dollars for a tweet.  That's it. That's all.  Furthermore, and this is the part I really like.  They said they I think Chicago sometimes interviewed the owner of the company,  he said, we're a Sue First Ask Questions Later Company.  I want a T-shirt that's a first ask questions later kind of guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's the Streisand effect, right?  I think Mike Masnick from TechDirt coined this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Streisand effect was that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the Streisand effect is something Barbara Streisand a few years ago  sued somebody for posting an aerial photo of her home  because she didn't want people to see where she lived in the process.  Getting every now, everyone knows what she lives,  what her house looks like from the air.  And so I think what this company has done is I think this woman had  maybe 20 people following her on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so, oh, well, so about 20 million people now know about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everybody knows.  Now I will guarantee you there are a lot of people who will not rent  from this place. And so I think legally, maybe are they in the right?  Who knows? I mean, if they can demonstrate that there is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it might legitimately be liable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it might be.  But I think you have to sort of have a sense of perspective  and proportion about this sort of thing.  And you might want to just let it slide because you're going to have this effect.  The Streisand effect where people,  a lot more people find out about the problem and the insult or the slander.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Horizon is trying to fix it.  They put out a press release saying the Sue first comment was tongue in cheek  that no mold was ever found in the apartment and she had sued it first.  Although that's legal filing doesn't mention a prior suit.  I think it's kind of it's out of control at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It would just let it go. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Would have been too difficult to just say to her, you know,  we understand that you are concerned about the mold in your apartment  because she didn't make up.  There's mold in our apartment and what are the chances of that? Right.  So you understand you think you might have a mold problem.  We'll put you in another apartment.  And by the way, we're going to send up some pastry.  You know, and say it on Twitter.  Yeah. I just say, oh, hey, are bad.  You know, mold happens.  I have mold in one of my bathrooms in my house. It happens.  We have to get the whole goddamn thing ripped out.  And that's a mold exists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In related. Wait a minute.  I'm going to write this down. Mold happens.  This is a word of wisdom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have three possible names for the show.  But Streisand effect from Wikipedia is defined as the effect is related  to John Gilmore's observation that in quotes, the net interprets  censorship as damage and routes around it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I like that. Wait a minute.  The net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Correct. That's been around for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a great line. It's a great line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's very tweetable.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and what's interesting is that some companies have done very well  in this in this kind of instance.  Comcast cares is a very good example by responding online, on Twitter publicly  in a very caring fashion and establish.  I mean, that's the way to handle this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think generally speaking, you have to be a lot more transparent about this stuff  and to recognize that.  I mean, at least in my experience, if somebody's unhappy about something,  it's best to just deal with them as a human being.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that iced tea? What is that you're drinking?  He's he's he's he's muted himself on mute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, sorry. But that was a little iced tea with a little mint in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It looks like your mint was muddled, my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My life muddled my mint, so to speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's nice of her to do that, especially considering she's pregnant.  Maybe you want to muddle her mint for a change.  Hey, oh, oh, oh.  God, you know, wait a minute, I got to get the bourbon out.  I'm sorry.  You're going to drink that.  You got a little bullet.  This is good. Have you ever had bullet bourbon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. Yeah. Are they a sponsor?  No, they're a sponsor.  I tell you, bourbon bullet bullet bourbon is the finest bourbon I've had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, Molly. Molly Wood brought this the last time she was in.  And she's apparently a brown liquor drinker.  And this is called Frontier Whiskey.  It's but it's good with lemonade.  Would you like some? I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You say brown? That much?  He says I don't drink that. Hardcore enough.  Drink brown liquor drinker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And, you know, Dane wrote because we used to do the wine, you know, on the show.  I have a disclaimer that Dane wrote for me.  And any time I pull out the booze, which I didn't drink kids  and I'm putting back in the drawer, it's really more a prop than anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. It's iced tea in there. It's iced tea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No. Yeah. He says, while we here in the studio may choose to drink alcoholic  beverages from time to time, this is in no way meant to be an endorsement  of drinking in general or an encouragement to anyone in our audience  who might be underage.  Each person on our panel is over 21. Are you over 21?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, very much so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He looks like he's like 18 and is fully aware of the responsibilities  that go along with drinking.  If you're underage, please do not drink.  And regardless, this is the best part.  Regardless of your age, never, ever drive drunk.  And if you've been drinking,  I think Dane had a fugue state here or something.  And if you've been drinking, even if you don't think you've had too much,  hand the keys over to someone else.  Call a taxi. Call a parent. Take a bus.  We want everyone in the community to live long and healthy lives.  Correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know why that's in my book.  That being said, you want to create an inducement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's been no inducement. No inducement here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you are drinking, we encourage you to tweet  to your Twitter account and update your Facebook status.  And by all by all means, turn on your stream.  Hey, is it really funnier than a drunk person drunk video stream?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you see a step on Marbury on your stream this week and Justin TV this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No. What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, my God. Somebody in the in the in the twit,  you know, control deck there pull up Stefan Marbury  crying on you stream or any of these Stefan Marbury live.  He basically live casted for like two or three days,  24 hours a day, eating Vaseline,  crying to gospel music and talking in tongues, essentially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this is this is Stefan Marbury of the Boston Celtics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stefan Marbury, formerly of the New York Knicks, product of Coney Island.  And now unsigned and probably going to remain that way based on his performances.  But he was the high.  It was like one of the top five highest players in the league players in the league last year.  This is not just some guy.  He was going crazy, literally.  And I'm looking at the guy.  You know what happened?  OK, here it is. You can see him.  I try to have these people hang me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is some people, you know, put away the video camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I already got the noose around my neck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't do that.  Jodeci.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So he knows he's on, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he was talking to everyone.  He's talking to people in the in the chat room.  He was basically going insane for three or four days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if I like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And people are speculating this person, it might be  medicated either with illegal or legal medication,  because the behavior was nonstop for a couple of days.  So people like this guy's on a coke binge or something for three days,  or he's on some kind of prescription medicine because he's not behaving normally.  Yeah.  And then I just the guy's a little bit out there.  I mean, there's been a lot of instances of him being people thinking he's actually crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're probably going to see more of this, aren't we?  I mean, anybody now can do this.  It's so easy to turn on a stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And how soon? Very poor judgment.  How soon? Poor judgment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we should have a disclaimer for using Ustream.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They might need to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Those of us in this room, we use streaming media because we're trained professionals  in over 21, but you shouldn't try this at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, what they should do is they should have a breathalyzer test on your on your PC  built in so you can't tweet or load Ustream unless you pass the breathalyzer test on your laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they have that anti-drunk dialing on Google Mail on their Gmail.  And I think I think Virgin Mobile had a phone that prevents you from drunk texting people.  What does it do? It makes you do math or something?  The Gmail Labs one makes you do math.  It makes you do math.  There's like a few different things out there to save you from yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. How soon before the first live streaming sex tape?  I mean, we've had a sex tape.  I'm shocked it hasn't happened yet.  Somebody's going to do a live streaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's happening. It's just not happening where we where we hang out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of a celebrity?  A celebrity like shouldn't Paris Hilton or Lindsay Lohan accidentally turn on her laptop?  Accidentally turned on her laptop.  It's just a matter of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I assume they would do it for cash, like sell tickets or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pay per live stream review.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I hate to focus on all that stuff, because of course, all this stuff is going to happen on the Internet.  Let's hope it's better.  You know, there's other better, more interesting stuff happening.  I would hope.  Not no, I mean, not none of the stories this week, but how about this one?  Our friend Tenenbaum.  Joel Tenenbaum, who admitted that he stole music, has been found guilty.  The judge even said the question wasn't an issue of whether he was guilty.  The only thing the jury had to do was figure out how much he owed.  They awarded twenty two thousand five hundred dollars per song to the RIAA.  Six hundred seventy five thousand dollars.  I don't think the graduate student is going to have that kind of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's what we've seen these cases a few times now, right?  And the RAA is obviously very aggressive in going after people for sharing stuff.  I think he actually was not just downloading.  I think he was actually sharing back up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and he admitted it. Now, he had a Harvard law professor.  He lied about it at first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, which I think is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's all a mess.  His his his lawyer took some interesting strategic turns as well.  The whole thing was kind of a mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe he can sue his lawyer for malpractice and win for six hundred  and seventy five thousand dollars. The whole thing's a mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And mold and mold.  Yeah, it's a mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think, well, the music industry is really, really screwed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought they stopped suing people.  Are they still suing people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And what's the deal? They're still going after a few people here.  I think they've mainly stopped.  But I think you just leftover.  You know, I don't know when this case started.  I assume it's been going on for a while.  I'm sure it has. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm dealing with this on a weekly basis right now with ASCAP, who has been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that must be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, my God, they are.  I don't even know if I should talk about it or not.  But I mean, yeah, no, no, no.  Twittering about it.  But there's a whole ASCAP thing going on.  People can search on the Internet for it.  But they're basically sending letters to a lot of site owners, including myself.  Where do you where do you do you have music on your site?  We have YouTube videos in our search engine and YouTube.  Apparently there are YouTube is paying for an ASCAP license, from what I understand.  However, if you syndicate a YouTube video, you're responsible.  That well, they're they're claiming you are.  I don't believe you are.  I don't believe you are.  Because when you get your in bed.  Yeah, exactly. And it's syndicating.  And it's basically a frame.  So what they're saying is, I think and I can't speak for them, but I think their premise is  because the URL is your site as opposed to the YouTube site, you're responsible.  Well, what it turns out is the ASCAP, I think and again, this is all speculation right now,  but I have some information that YouTube didn't want to pay for these syndicated videos.  Therefore, ASCAP is going after small site owners to put pressure on Google and YouTube,  which basically puts us in the middle, to which I told some people who I'm having  discussions with about this.  Well, we'll just load YouTube in a pop up window from now on, and you'll never be able  to talk to us about the issue again.  And also, by the way, you're in order to get a license, you're asking us how much money  we're making from these videos or from these plays and how much traffic they're getting.  We can't give you that because we don't host it and we don't make money off of it.  The people who do are YouTube.  So if in order to fill out this license, they want me to fill out a license and other site  owners to tell them how much traffic we have for music videos and how much money we're  making. And when the answer to it is we don't know and zero, we're not making any money.  YouTube is if they are, you know, have ads on the videos and we don't know how much  traffic it's getting.  That's YouTube's business and we don't have access to it.  So how can we even fill out the form you want us to fill out to determine the license?  And if we can't fill out the form and this other person can, does that not give you an  indication of who's responsible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, here's an interesting thing.  That's one way to handle it is to go and sue and send letters.  Another way it doesn't YouTube have some sort of mechanism.  I don't know what they call it, where if a video includes music that the rights holder  can then monetize it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you familiar with it?  Yeah, they did this with the and it's kind of a little bit sad to see Chris Brown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chris Brown is now in the top 10 on iTunes with his song forever because of this J.K.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  wedding video. So, yeah, it was in this wedding video, which I'm sure people have seen.  It was on like Good Morning America and all this stuff.  Today show. It's been all over.  And it's a little and instead of I guess they they gave YouTube gave him the option of  removing the song from the video or removing the video entirely or taking a cut of the  the sales of the music, the downloads it would drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, in fact, when you see this J.K.  wedding video now on, by the way, I've linked to it on my Tumblr log and so have many other  people. You get a pop up ad for Chris Brown's forever.  And that has been so successful that even though this is a year old song, he's back in  the top 10 on iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're basically helping a guy who beat up his girlfriend.  Well, thanks, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That wasn't my intent. I like the wedding video, the dancing.  It was good. Did you see the parody of it?  Yes, I did.  The divorce video.  I don't know who did that, but somebody spent a lot of money making that work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to say we process these memes so quickly now.  It's like, oh, yeah, this is only a week old.  This is like it breaks on a Monday.  It's on local. It's on local news that night because they have nothing to talk about on  local news. But whatever the top five videos are on YouTube, I don't know if anybody else  has noticed that trend. Oh, yeah, that's it.  But they're like, oh, and on the interwebs, there is a dance going on to a Chris Brown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't see this yourself, but we'll be glad to play it for you on our television  because you get we got nothing compelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to play something for seven seconds and half an hour and tease it seven  times, even though it was emailed to you 15 times today.  When we get back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there must be I mean, I guess the people still watching local news probably don't  have the Internet. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's your grandma or whatever.  But then like the next day or two days later, it becomes like the top story on  Mashable talking about blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And then by Friday, we have the, you know, parody and it's over next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if you should now post that video on your Tumblr log, you will just be reamed for  being completely out of date, out of touch.  That was so five days ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The half life without saying now, but if you go away for a week, you're going to miss  out on a whole week's worth of viral culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was in China. I heard Sarah Palin resigned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't know. Got to get back on the loop.  You're just really out of the loop.  I don't know if they care that much in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they didn't. They blocked it.  I think I know Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they were. They block.  Consider yourself lucky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I missed that whole story.  It's true, though. You feel like I've missed five days.  I've missed a lifetime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  It's like what happened when I was gone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A tow truck driver, a New York State tow truck driver who was texting on one cell phone  and talking on another.  That's it. Hit a car.  That was even a slice of pizza.  Drove into a swimming pool.  And now as a poster child for why people are post they're asking for a ban on texting while  driving. How do you feel about that?  You know, I mean, we saw a seven year old report from the National Transportation Highway  Transportation and Safety Administration saying there is no safe way to use a cell phone,  even hands free.  This was suppressed seven years ago by, you know, some say by a mobile industry that said,  well, we can't have that.  I think it was just by members of Congress who said, if you're asking us to pass a bill  against cell phones, you're going to you're going to lose that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, did you play that game that the New York Times?  No, it was a game basically to simulate trying to text while driving.  And then they would show you how your response time.  Just terrible. Of course, you're typing.  Yeah. So it's definitely I mean, it's definitely an issue.  And I think that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So should we ban cell phones?  Should we ban texting?  What about putting on your makeup in cars?  What about eating fried chicken in cars?  I mean, ban it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No radios, no talk radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know. I know you don't allow fried chicken in your Tesla, Jason, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no fried chicken.  In and out burgers. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, come on. Have you pulled up to it in and out in a Tesla?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, no comment.  I love that.  No, I almost got I was driving with my wife to a friend's house yesterday.  And I'm going through the hills in Bel Air.  And this woman is in my lane in the in the hills and she's coming right for us.  I slam on the brakes. I go up onto the sidewalk halfway up with the truck.  And she was texting and I'm like honking the horn.  And I felt like I was going to chase this woman down and absolutely murder her  because I got my pregnant five month pregnant wife here.  We're almost in a head on collision so that she can text her friend, OMG,  you know, get me a latte or whatever the F she was doing.  I mean, what is wrong with people?  You drive in L.A. and you look at people, they are doing their makeup.  They're texting anything but driving.  Enjoy the drive, people. It's OK.  Put on an audio book from somebody like Audible and listen to something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, that's completely legal and, you know, highly appropriate, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I would do. I would just listen to an audible, audible book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Audio book. Let me get the notebook out and just see what it says in here about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Audible. I'm just saying, if you were going to if you had a choice,  texting and dying or driving and getting to your destination while listening to  the scenery, a business book, maybe some fiction, maybe a bestseller  that you see when you go to the airport, you see in the New York Times,  you say, you know what? I wish I read more, but I don't.  Why don't I just put a couple of things on my iPod, my iPhone  or even a DRM free player and just listen, get educated,  get amused while not killing yourself and murdering other people and pregnant wives?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When why wouldn't you do that?  Why wouldn't you do it?  Virginia Tech's Transportation Institute did a study texting while driving  increased truck drivers risk of crash twenty three times.  Only twenty three times, only twenty three times.  Chuck Schumer has introduced legislation that will force states to ban texting  while operating a moving vehicle or face cuts in federal highway funds.  So, and you know, interestingly, I think it's it's at this point  even the cell carriers aren't going to fight this one.  It's just going to happen, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I don't think it ultimately really is going to hurt their business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute.  John Taylor Sprint Nextail's public affairs manager says,  the legislation is well intentioned, but it likely won't get to the root issue  of changing driver behavior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're starting to sound like the tobacco company.  They really are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it's texting doesn't kill.  Yeah, it won't kill people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And actually, if you're using a jailbroken iPhone,  your chances of getting an accident are 27 percent.  So times that's dangerous if you jailbreak your phone.  And what was wrong with these PR people?  Can somebody just drown them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, just you know, most of the other carriers said, yeah, you're right.  It's a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who was this guy's name again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The guy that John Taylor Sprint Nextail's public affairs manager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, John Taylor, can somebody please let this idiot know  that we're talking about him? Send him this clip.  Put it on YouTube. John Taylor, you freaking moron.  You are risking people's lives.  You're going to your stupid PR speak is going to result in people dying.  You idiot. Look deeply at the life you've chosen.  In his defense, look deeply at the life chosen.  You are you are supporting.  Everyone crash your car in his apartment.  No, no, no. Stop.  Now I know you're going to get me soon.  Find this person.  Somebody find this person and get them on Twit next week.  I want them on Twit next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Opinions of Twit panelists are those  are there's entirely are not in any way endorsed.  I'm not encouraging anyone that we don't have anything to do with them.  Who let these guys in the studio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm encouraging somebody who knows him to tell him what a donkey he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He did. He did say he did say that, you know, my experience  with law enforcement educators suggests the best way to tackle this problem  is through better driver education.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What you need is like a dog.  The guy dresses up like a dog that goes to the high school.  Yeah, McGruff, the text dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, don't text while take a bite out of texting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hi, I'm Tony, the truck driver.  I almost killed seven people and wound up in a swimming pool.  Don't be like Tony, the truck driver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, but I'm with him in one respect.  There are so many other things people are doing.  I mean, people bend over to tune the radio, then look up  and they've run into four pedestrians.  I mean, there's all sorts of things you could do that are stupid in a car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's what I want people to do.  I would like everybody on the Twitter audience to take out their flip cameras  when they're not driving, when they're in the passenger seat  and videotape people doing that's a good idea.  Let's make a website.  Yeah. Or something registered.  Dumb drivers must wake up dot com and put these videos.  That's a great idea.  And cops should they should have specific cops who go out  and just pull up alongside people in like a minivan with a video camera  set up on in the back of the video van, videotape them doing what they're doing,  pull them over and then show them the videotape  and then give them a five hundred dollar ticket for doing it.  Make it a five hundred dollar ticket for texting when driving.  Get the video. It's locked.  We'll balance the budget with all these idiots texting while driving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It has to stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And, you know, I'll confess, when I first got a BlackBerry,  I perfected the hands through the steering wheel,  thumbs on the BlackBerry typing technique, but I don't do that anymore.  I don't even know a car.  Good for you. That's the safest thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're on the subway, by all means, text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're a passenger, text Amazon's being sued, you know, that deletion.  We talked about it a couple of weeks ago of the Orwell, the 1984  story, a high school student is suing Amazon saying,  you ate my homework, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So was it that he had actually taken on these notes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He had electronics notes and he said when you deleted 1984 in Amazon.  But now and so it's a class action.  Justin D Goronsky, 17, a student at Eisenhower High School  in Shelby Township, Michigan,  his father class action against Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's going to be a pretty small class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he's got he's got one other guy,  Antoine Bruguier in Milpitas, California. He's an adult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I get anybody who didn't do their homework last week.  Get in on this. I'm telling you, this is your perfect excuse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Amazon ate my homework.  His notes are rendered useless.  They didn't take the notes. Well, this is the problem.  The notes are still there, but they no longer referenced  relevant parts of the book, of course.  So he still got the notes. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do your homework, kids.  Yeah. Yeah. Do your homework. Stop suing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. Let's do it.  Let's do an audible ad real quickly, because I just don't know.  I don't know who else we're going to libel here.  And I just want to make sure before the network goes off the air,  we're going to do it. We didn't do an audible ad yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no, that's right. Audible was just referenced a couple of times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just referenced. Well, they kind of got their time.  But I love audible. You love audible.  We all love audible audible dot com slash twit to it's the platinum account.  You get two books free.  Yes. What is the URL audible?  A U D I B L E dot com slash twit to the number two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  T.W.I.T. the number two.  Yeah. And the reason to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because it's two books free.  It's the platinum account.  You must have a platinum, Jason, because you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course I do. But I would like to maybe start another one  to get two books free. But, you know, you could have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know people have multiple platinum accounts, not to get the free books,  but just because they go through that many books

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a month. And look at look at the choices they have there for you.  Blade Runner, Snow Crash, these are books maybe you haven't read.  Look at this one. This is for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In-N-Out Burger, a behind the counter look at the fast food chain  that breaks all the rules and the Teslas that love them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Genius. I just I just actually at the poker table the other night,  I was listening because I play poker, you know, you do.  Listen to poker books while you're playing.  Well, not poker books.  I have listened to all the poker words, but I will listen to.  That's too hard to do, because if you listen to a poker book  while you're in a hand, they're describing the hand.  So it's like trying to listen to a chess.  Somebody describe a chess. That's confusing chess.  It's way too much.  But I was listening to The Road and I just finished The Road.  We had talked about it on a previous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cormac McCarthy. What a great book. Oh, my God.  And you're going to have a baby. This is good.  Of course, yours is a daughter.  But I think a daughter, you know, it's the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. For anybody who's a parent, this is blowing good.  Yeah. Father, son story. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mind blowing. And it's science fiction.  It's ego somehow.  It's brilliant. And it's honorable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about this unmasked?  The final years of Michael Jackson by Ian Halperin, the biographer. Right.  Yeah. Now, see, I think you have 23 times more chance  of running into the guy ahead of you if you're listening to Michael Jackson  on the authorized biography.  So just because you're so outraged.  Yeah. Just because you can't put it down.  It's like, what? He did what?  It happened. What?  There are no.  In fact, it's really true that when you're driving,  it's I know it may be a better driver because it calmed me down.  There's nothing worse than being stuck in traffic.  I had the worst, most miserable commute for years.  And audible saved my life because I could listen to books.  I was calm. I was happy.  I didn't mind being in traffic.  So I wasn't, you know, going, you get out of my way.  I was just worried on tilt. I wasn't on tilt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It saved your life.  And texting is taking other people's lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there you go. Don't text.  Subscribe to audible or you can if you're at home right now,  you can text audible audible dot com slash twit to two books  free with the platinum account.  Sixty thousand to choose from. It really is a wonderful library.  Do you ever listen to audiobooks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Occasionally, but mainly just podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really? Yeah. Yeah. You're a podcast guy.  One of the reasons I think it's a natural relationship  with between Twitter and audible is because, yeah, if you listen to podcasts,  you're kind of already conditioned to audio information.  And that's what I really like.  I can't listen to podcasts all the time.  So when I'm when I've had enough podcasts, although I love GDGT and Twist,  but sometimes I just want to listen to a book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sometimes you want to listen to a professional.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, instead, these readers are so good.  How about this one? The Little Red Book of Selling.  Twelve point five principles of sales greatness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the half principle?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, you got to listen to the book to find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't deserve a full point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. It's so good at only half a point.  Yeah, that's it. You know what?  That that's a good technique he just used there.  You see how he did that?  I mean, twelve point five.  I got to read that. I got to know what is he talking about?  This this guy knows what he's talking about.  The Little Red Book of Selling.  Anyway, there's a whole bunch of stuff fiction, nonfiction, science fiction,  history, even comedy performance, old radio shows.  Give it a try. Just just visit the website audible dot com.  So many good ones. I mean, it is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've talked about so many on the show.  Shadow Divers, we talked about that.  The road we talked about.  Do androids dream of electric sheep?  I mean, just book after book after book.  Good to great. One of the great business books.  I mean, you're going to have a hard time picking just two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. No, I'm with you.  I'm with you. But get the first two anyway.  Audible dot com slash to it.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.  The whole the whole shebang, the whole network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's amazing. It's a wonderful thing.  You can also thank them on Twitter right now.  If you if you if you didn't get the black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just out of curiosity, did go to my PC become a trending topic on Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's got to be close at this point.  I don't know what you need to get on page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People are gaming. Is it it's on the new front page?  Are people are really gaming the trending topics thing?  That's going to be a problem eventually.  They're going to have to do something about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, they have when they had the documents released, I think.  Oh, no, I think TechCrunch guessed their way into that administrative panel.  And you can go through the trending topics and you can  just check off like take this off, take it off.  So they have a little interface anytime anybody buys their way onto it.  Or like at one point, I think some people because it's a bunch of like hip hop  people on Twitter now doing like this trending topic stuff.  And they do some things like you're a ho if or you're.  Yeah, I've noticed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's just totally taken over Twitter. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's like I think it might be a hip hop radio station  that's doing it or something.  They're they're like, you know, you're broke if you're, you know, boom.  And everybody makes a joke.  It's fun. But some of them are vulgar.  And so they've been turning those off as they pop up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the thing I've noticed, I actually just noticed this last night  or yesterday was that someone some spammer is taking other people's tweets  that are responses to me like people.  Oh, yes. It's a porn spammer. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've seen that. Yeah. It's happened to me. It's crazy.  So I all of a sudden I saw something I wrote showing up again and again.  In fact, it was that I was talking about the AT&T overbill on my data plan.  And somebody in the response was something like AT&T really ought to be,  you know, dinged for this.  It showed up on about 50 sites.  I looked at the people's pages.  They're all girls in half dressed.  And you go back to their front, their profile.  It's like some adult. It's an adult site. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry. How do I find this? Great site.  Yeah. I mean, it went a little fast there.  I'm not complaining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly what you're talking about.  I noticed this. This is it.  I can never figure out how a spammer is going to make it work on Twitter.  I just don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's too easy to report them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and how many people are going to see the tweet  and then go to the profile?  But we did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I only because it was my tweet.  But it wasn't even my tweet.  It was somebody like I what I saw is I saw the same text over and over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right. I guess it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's weird that I'm getting the same comment from multiple people.  And I guess you're right.  It was like a scantily clad woman, which seemed very suspicious to me. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And then you clicked her profile.  And I clicked her profile and in the spirit of research, of course.  Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are a lot of porn stars on Twitter.  And I know this because I was following one of my employees.  And this is always a weird thing.  Like, I don't know if I should follow employees, ex employees,  if I should unfollow them when they leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, there's this etiquette that we just don't have any rules for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And like I unfollowed a couple of guys who left the company  because I was like, I don't know if I should still be following.  Maybe they find it creepy that I'm following them.  Or people who used to work for me if they should follow.  But anyway, so I'm one of the guys who works for me or watching it.  And he's replying and he's talking to all these people with XXX in their name.  Right. I'm like, what is this about?  And I realized one of my employees is replying to porn stars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I followed the porn stars briefly just because out of curiosity.  Like, well, what kind of you know, what am I going to see here?  What is it going to be like?  These are the most boring people in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they're like, yeah, go into Starbucks.  I mean, most celebrities, all the celebrities, all the celebrities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, if you followed to me more, I mean, I think like I'm following to me more.  This is exciting. No, it's not.  The most boring person in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, who's good to follow is this guy, Jesse Dylan.  He did the J.E.  I think, no, that's not his.  What's his handle? I don't know his handle.  It's basically Bob Dylan's son, but he's the guy who did the Will.I.M video.  Oh, wonderful. Jesse B.  Dylan, J.E.S.S.E.B.  Dylan. But he like I think he has nothing to do all day,  but read like really interesting stories.  So it's constantly. That's who you're looking for.  Cool stories. And it's like this guy is like an artist.  He does movies and whatever, music videos.  And he's releasing like all these interesting like he must read like a thousand magazines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's who you're looking for. You're looking for a filter.  Somebody who's passing along interesting stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis actually is a Jeff Jarvis is a great guy.  Jay Rosen also.  You know what I did with Jay Rosen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He tweeted something about his handpicked, hand called list of the 300 best journalist accounts.  So I just followed all of them.  Yeah. Oh, really?  Well, there was no automatic way to do it.  Maybe there is with social two or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, there will be. I know someone is working on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be great because all collections of people might be able to auto follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They give you to create a group of.  Well, I don't say too much about it because he hasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, don't say it. But I know what you're saying.  I get what you're saying.  And my philosophy on following is don't hesitate to follow somebody,  but just drop them the minute they're uninteresting. Right.  So I have right now, I'm like 1200 people only because I added that whole list.  Jay Rosen's old list. But they've been interesting.  Yeah. And that now what it does is it tilts my Twitter feed to a conversation about journalism  because they're all all of this. Excuse it. Excuse it. Yeah.  But then if I followed all of your friends, Peter, I would get, you know,  a lot of stuff about gadgets, perhaps a lot of tech. Yeah. Tech.  One billion downloads for Firefox.  Congratulations to Firefox. That's kind of amazing.  One billion downloads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know I've downloaded probably about 300. That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Doesn't say how many people just how many downloads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's still it's an impressive number.  And I think I mean, just to use GDGT as an example,  I think over 50 percent of our users are on Firefox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Mine is it's like 70 percent. Yeah. Because it's all techies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like 9 percent Chrome.  Really that high?  Which I thought was pretty interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me look at my Google Analytics, because I'm curious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's you know, that's what everybody's pulling up the Google Analytics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll really just check my analytics here.  See, my Google Analytics actually is running 54.2 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It fortunately shred me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is it under? What is it under?  Visitors, visitors, visitors,  network properties, browser, compatibilities, browsers, browsers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fire. Oh, let's see.  This is a percentage is raw numbers. I want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got a percentage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Firefox, then Safari, then IE, then Chrome, then Opera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You see, Mahalo is a general interest site.  I've got the opposite.  We had eight million, eight million uniques last month,  and we had 57 percent Internet Explorer,  29.5 percent Firefox, seven percent Safari  and only three percent Chrome, one percent Opera.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We had, I think, point oh oh four percent  PlayStation three browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have PlayStation Portable, actually.  I had five thousand visits in the last month from PlayStation Portable.  That is fascinating.  I want to fill up mine.  How many sea monkeys come to you?  Blackberry, eighty nine hundred seven hundred seventy two.  I think those are all me.  Wow. I didn't know it could tell you the exact model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It tells you the the the pretty Google analytics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Depends on what the browser what kind of browser string.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, my God. Have you guys seen Chartbeat yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's that? Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK. I asked actually Peter to put it on GDGT.  I'm actually full disclosure. I'm an investor in GDGT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And BetaWorks, which does Chartbeat, is also an investor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's also investor Chartbeat is Google Analytics.  In the last 60 seconds on your site.  Chartbeat.com, the last 60 seconds, right?  It shows you who's live on your site in real time.  It's real time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to put some cool put some code in my site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have to put one at the top of the page and one at the bottom.  So now we have Google Analytics, Chartbeat and Quantcast on our site,  which is a little bit of a pain in the ass for speed issues.  But it basically gives you a heads up display and says,  there, you know, like on Mahalo, there's like 1500 to 2500 people on  at any given point in time. And it shows me there's seven people on  how to buy gold. There's eight people on this.  And you could put it on Twitter and you know exactly where people are.  Then you Twitter something like if I Twitter a link,  we see 100, 200 people go to that page in real time.  So you see a VC right there.  That's, I guess, Fred Wilson's site.  They have a demo account of and you can actually watch it in real time.  I'm like I emailed John Boorthwick from BetaWorks.  I was like, can I invest in this company, please?  Immediately. This thing is insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does it have any real value, though?  I mean, you're not going to show advertising. It's just fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, because you actually see what people are doing  at different moments in time on your site.  So like right now, where are you getting traffic during Twitter  or, you know, during, you know, at on Saturdays when you're not broadcasting?  No, I'd like to know. You're right. You're right.  And you can actually see it.  And so then during the show, you can actually  if you were watching this during the show or we were watching it,  we could actually say,  everybody go to this page and you could have all the Twitter links there  or you have the friend feed once, you know, OK, look, there's two to one  on friend feed over this or everybody's on this story, whatever it is.  And you can say, wow, why is all of a sudden, you know, episode 57 of Twitter  peaking? Oh, it's because somebody tweeted it, you know, see sort of.  And it shows the referrers where they're coming from.  Oh, I'm getting this many people from Bing.  It's pretty cool. Yeah, it's pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The BetaWorks guys are trying to build.  I mean, they're also invested in a tweet deck and  Twitter.  So they're really all about this real time data.  Real time is everywhere in every respect.  This is just humans want real time, which became Twitter search.  So they made some money on that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they will. And when some of the Twitter,  they own a big piece of Twitter now. So I think that's more. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's quantcast, the one you recommend.  That's what I've been using. You like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have to use quantcast now because advertisers are using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so if you this is this is an this is, again, another analytics  piece of JavaScript you put on your site.  But quantcast is like NetNielsen, Nielsen, NetRatings or or Comscore.  But you think of the three, they're the one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they're not like that because those are sample based.  So those other sites are panel based.  They have like a certain number of people with toolbars.  And so that's no good. I want to I want the raw numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the thing about is the Nielsen stuff is really biased against.  It's really biased towards bigger, more mainstream sites,  because if you're going to allow you need a big sample company to  you to follow what you're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you need a sample, a huge sample size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And with Comscore, if you pay Comscore some money, your numbers get better.  I'm not saying there's anything going on exactly, but it seems like the small  sites who don't pay are underrepresented and the big sites who do pay are.  And I hate Comscore. I hope they die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they put out press releases, you know, they put out.  They say, look at the numbers.  And I always makes me a little nervous when I see a press release for a website.  How well it's doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Quantcast is going to crush Comscore.  There will be no more Comscore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like the demographic information I get from quantcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is the real numbers.  If you're quantified, it's the real number.  You put it on your site.  So it's better than compete.  It's much better than Alexa.  It's actually the real number.  And if somebody won't put quantcast on their site and they're not quantified,  then you're basically scared of actually sharing your numbers.  That's what it comes down to.  And it ends all arguments of whose site is bigger,  because it's like the real numbers.  And what's going to happen is Google Analytics already allows you to publish  certain data, but they haven't made a list of it yet.  So people are going to turn their Google Analytics open to the public  and Google will have a ranking of every site by Google Analytics.  Quantcast will have one from the web quantcast on it.  And you can actually see a list of the top 1000 sites.  And if you look at that top 1000 site list or top 100 site list, it's real.  It's a real number.  Well, it actually shows you which ones are quantified and which one aren't.  So they actually do the sample base as well.  And so you can look at it and say, well, you know what?  This site is number 200.  It's quantified.  The 201st site is not quantified.  It's probably got 300.  You're going to.  It's probably going to be 30 percent bigger.  Therefore, the person who has number 201 is incentivized to put quantcast on.  Right. That's basically what it comes down to.  And if you look at the Gawker network, it's incredible.  I mean, Gawker has 22 million people globally.  But it's interesting if you go to Gawker Media Network,  you can actually see the individual sites because they roll.  They will roll up your site.  So if you have 10 podcasts, you could actually go to the individual sites  and you could see that Gizmodo is three.  No site on Gawker individually is over three point six million  U.S. people or six million global people.  So you can actually get drilled down.  If you click on the Gawker Media Network up there on the top left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're looking at it right now. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Then you.  But where it says Gawker Media Network, then you hit sites.  You can actually see the individual sites. Wow.  And so it's really cool, like competitive intelligence, whatever.  It just makes it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was curious, you know, I've been wondering, because, you know, in radio,  you've got Arbitron and television, you got Nielsen.  And I was just wondering who's going to win this one in the web.  And it sounds like Quantcast is the one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because I think like what Jason was saying earlier about  panel based surveys for the stuff is just not going to be accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, because in fact, that's the problem with Arbitron and Nielsen's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, they have the same issue.  Same issue. If you can measure something in real time and measure real data,  you're always going to have something that's more accurate than survey data.  And I actually I worked in radio  and I ran a radio station when I was in college.  And we had to deal with Arbitron all the time.  Oh, it's a nightmare. It was a nightmare.  And I mean, people don't realize that the way that they do things,  that they actually call people up and say,  did you listen to the radio on your way to work? Right.  What do you remember them saying anything?  Like that was how that was their survey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very primitive.  Or you get a diary which you got to remember to write down.  And somebody's saying, now, this is interesting.  And the chat room saying, please don't put those site analytics on your site  because it's a privacy concern.  They say the problem is that these sites can

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know, use the Internet, turn off cookies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Put on private browsing, go through Tor.  If you're a knucklehead like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, actually, if you don't know, there is a response.  If you don't like it, turn off JavaScript, because all of these use JavaScript.  So use the NoScript plugin.  It will tell you what scripts are running.  You could selectively turn off the quantcast scripts if you don't want to.  And that's fine with me. If it bugs you, if there's a if you're concerned  about privacy and you see you come to my site and you see quantcast  and analytics running, which which are you could selectively  turn those scripts off and still use the site fully.  And I think that that's fine with me.  Yeah, I mean, because that's a minority of people are going to.  I don't think it's that big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, again, if you're really worried about being tracked,  you should just not use the Internet entirely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, probably not a good idea to be on the Internet if you're concerned about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because you really don't have that much privacy.  You're kidding. Man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, it's really great to have you guys on.  I you know, I just I think the world of both of you, Peter Rojas, of course,  at GDGT.com, that's the site which is finally launched and is great  is a social network for Gadgeteers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I should note we are having our big launch event in San Francisco  on August 4th on Tuesday at seven o'clock at DNA Lounge.  It's completely open to the public, all ages.  Everyone is invited.  We'd love to have you there.  And it'll be the chance to see a lot of new gadgets for the first time.  I think the Zune HD will be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Veronica Belmont will be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Veronica Belmont is hosting.  We managed to convince her to host the event.  That's a little arm twisting, but that DNA Lounge Tuesday in San Francisco.  Jason, you coming up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm probably going to come up for the day.  Yeah, you're kidding.  It's the only problem.  I have to go. He's on the board.  You got to come.  You got to represent the board.  Now I have to come.  I realize that. I have to be there.  But now that you've announced it on this thing,  you realize there's going to be a thousand people in line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have the space.  We can fit a thousand people there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Email, where should they...  If you're going to go, let Peter know that you're coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you can come to the site and RSVP or there's a Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So he'll know how much of a rope line to build.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, people should really just sign up for GDGT.  It's GDGT.com.  And what's cool about the site, the reason I invested in it  and the reason I'm on the board is because it's great to get tech news.  But what this does is you pick, it's sort of like Flickster or Goodreads.  You pick all your gadgets and then it consolidates all the news about your gadgets.  So I have my cradle point in there.  I've got my iPhone in 3GS in there.  I've got my BlackBerry in there.  I've got all these different things that I have.  And it also lets you put in what you want.  And then it consolidates all the information about that.  So if somebody's having a discussion, like I started a discussion about the 3GS and YouTube  been putting up the full Reds videos as opposed to the compressed ones.  And you got all these wonky gadget nutcases who will answer your questions and basically  participate with you.  So it's sort of like a customized version of Engadget, which is what we always wanted  to do with Engadget.  We never really got there.  We just never got there, yeah.  It's a social network of what's going on with your gadgets.  So if you've got that, like, I don't know what the camera that you're obsessed with,  the 5D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this is the one that I'm obsessed with right now, this EP1.  And so I want to join this.  You know, I don't have it yet.  Actually, I just ordered it, but I'm going to put it on my want list.  And so now I can learn more about it and talk about lenses and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, this is that's going to be 15 people there who have been using it for a year.  And you can basically you can draft off of them and you can add them as friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And the other thing I think is really cool is like it's a completely open product  database.  So if there's something that's missing, you can actually just stand for it.  Yeah.  Oh, neat.  And you can actually go and edit that page.  That's like Mahalo.  If the specs are missing or if there's some information that is inaccurate or whatever,  you can go and correct that.  It's neat.  It's an open, you know, we have a little bit of Wiki, a little bit of social  network, all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You built the CMS yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We built it entirely ourselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's just nuts.  I know.  But we we know how Ryan is.  Yeah.  And you wanted it to be you wanted to work about what we needed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's why it took so long.  Yeah.  Frank.  And we still have a lot to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we wanted to make sure that we had something that we knew that we built  ourselves so we could do all the things we needed to do with it, because we have a  lot we have.  We actually one of the reasons I was in San Francisco this week was to actually  build the product roadmap for the next nine months to a year.  Oh, man, you're planning to have stuff we're going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm going to start building what I have and what I don't have on here so I  can see you guys.  He's your username, Leo Laporte.  What else would it be?  Peter's got 34 gadgets and Ryan has 32 gadgets.  I want to see if I can beat him.  I'm sure you can.  I bet I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's part of the fun.  That's part of the fun too, is like you get to see what's it.  You know, it's like on a gadget, Peter and Ryan had this thing.  What's in your gadget bag or what gadgets you're carrying kind of a thing.  And it's basically like that.  So you can look and be like, oh, this person has that camera.  You like what else do they have?  What lenses do they have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know what I told him before the show began?  You know, you need a hook like that that keeps people not only keeps people  coming back, but gets them involved and engaged.  Twitter, for example, just putting the followers count on the front page was  brilliant because everybody started to become engaged in how many followers they  had. So you need something like that.  And it's nice to have a simple numeric metric that you could say, well, how many  gadgets do you have on here?  And that forces people to engage.  I think it's a really good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The other thing I love about it is being able to see if someone has similar  taste in gadgets, you they have the same camera as you.  Maybe they might have a laptop or maybe they want to date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, are there any girls on this at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are a few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I'm telling you, down the road, when you get more people, this could be a  good matchmaking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We actually are thinking about that.  We want to do a matchmaking service.  Not to get a harmony.  Antic thing.  E-gadget.  E-gadget.  Yeah.  Romantic gadget.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Our gadget.  Our gadget.  We'll make it happen.  Our gadget together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mm.  GDGT.com.  Come to the party, DNA Lounge.  Now, now that I know that Jason's going to be there, I'm going to come to him.  Okay, awesome.  Veronica wasn't enough, but I had, but Jason put me over the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Most people that's, you know, their decision making process.  It's like beautiful, brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's getting really incestuous.  I can't have anybody on anymore that doesn't know and have some business  relationship with everybody else.  We're all just kind of, we got to, what's going on here?  We're all too awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're all just.  No conflict.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No interest.  Oh, I like it.  Nope.  That was a famous Michael Moritz, the VC from Sequoia.  No conflict, no interest.  I I'm so conflicted.  I can't do anything.  I'm writing that down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's another title for the show.  We've got way too many titles.  No incest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  well, it's all, it's all who you know.  It's all friends, buddies, people, people you love, people who you know are smart.  You know, you want to work with.  And I think that that makes sense.  The people that I want to work with on this show are people who want to work  with each other.  I mean, it just makes sense.  Jason Callahan, it's always great to have you on.  It's Mahalo, M-A-H-A-L-O dot com.  Uh, and Jason's Twist podcast.  How do I, how do I find out about that?  Do I go to your website?

Transcript:  It's very simple.  You just go to this, this week in startups dot com and it's right there.  And, uh, every Friday, every Friday, one o'clock, if I'm around, sometimes I'm  traveling and, uh, just tiny plug.  I'm looking for writers, how to writers.  So if you go to Mahalo dot com slash tasks, T-A-S-K-S, we're trying to make a  thousand how to articles a week.  So we need some writers.  If you know people looking to make a little extra cash.  Okay.  Is that something new for you that the how to Mahalo tasks, yeah, Mahalo dot  com slash tasks is basically like our little version of Amazon Turk.  So we'll put in there, like, write a how to article for $7.  And then you also get half of the Google adsense going forward.  So like, you'll make like seven bucks now, and then you might make another  hundred or 200 or some of these make a thousand, 2000 a year going forward.  So we're trying to find writers who want to build it up with us.  If you know any, it's a great model.
