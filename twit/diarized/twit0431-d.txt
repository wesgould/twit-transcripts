End time: 161.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh wow. So that's after you sold the channel and now you're living high. Are you living in the shard?  Yeah, no.  What is it with London? Every building has a nickname.

Start time: 162.56
End time: 174.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well they've all got nicknames because they all have to be a little bit different because they all have to sort of out prestige one another.  Right.  So it has to be, you know, you've got the gherkin, then you've got the shard, then you've got, you know, the next one will be something else.

Start time: 175.02
End time: 193.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's so nutty. Also with us Harper Reed, it's great to have you back. Harper was our guest on Triangulation.  Yes.  And at the time he was the guy responsible or to a great degree responsible for the Obama campaign's 2008 digital strategy.  That's true.  And since then what have you been up to?

Start time: 194.56
End time: 197.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The ACA website, let's get this straight, is not your fault?

Start time: 204.00
End time: 224.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It might be because I was laying on my floor. Those may be related. Well actually no, no it is not my fault.  And it's actually a pretty interesting kind of situation. One where if I was involved I think that the cronyism would be very active and we don't want that.  But the procurement system is very bad.

Start time: 224.98
End time: 243.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So can you explain a little bit about how these kinds of things happen? I mean it took three years to build and ten minutes to break.  I mean look I covered the Valley and tech startups but I'm curious how and sometimes they break and sometimes they don't. But how do you think this kind of happened?

Start time: 246.37
End time: 317.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the first thing is that it's an unprecedented size of a consumer app for the government.  And I think that's the first thing is that it's just a very large app. I mean normally an application that you build doesn't have automatically 300 million users that are able to log in and participate.  The next thing is that the procurement system of the government is just brutal.  Where it's when you're trying to do technology and the organizations are working with the smartest guys in the rooms are the lawyers and so the tech folks I think that's when we have a problem.  And so for the most part you have these great organizations that are doing great work but they're maximizing their abilities on lawyering and procurement contract not on technology.  And so there's this meme that if we just added some Silicon Valley style technologists to the mix that things would be better. And this kind of started with the idea of tech surge and all that stuff.  But the problem is until we get rid of or make more efficient the procurement laws and make it so that people like us could actually participate in a real way then it doesn't matter or you're still going to get crap product.

Start time: 321.41
End time: 322.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So how are they going to fix it?

Start time: 324.56
End time: 388.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's been a lot of talk from the White House about fixing and really making the procurement process easier for great small contracting firms to kind of get involved.  And I think that's the first step is from the White House kind of pushing down some policies etc. some ideas. Todd Park the CTO of the White House has done a really good job of kind of starting this process being very public about it.  I think that's the first thing. The second thing is there were a lot of people who there was a couple days on Twitter where everyone was saying suggesting that I step in and help which would not have solved anything.  But because of that a lot of people emailed and so I just say hey why don't you quit your job and help out. And no one's willing to do that.  So I think there's a lot of talk and I think that's but I think that if you have a better opportunity to get people into the door of the White House to help out into these great organizations etc. then I think more people will participate.  But until then it's easy for us to sit in our armchairs and talk about how we would have done it differently.

Transcript:  Look at Leo sitting in his fancy armchair.

Start time: 391.98
End time: 400.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got it. I'm looking at Healthcare Sherpa. It seems to work. A couple of guys at Silicon Valley designed this and they're free time. Of course it doesn't connect to anything.

Start time: 401.96
End time: 405.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the other thing about this is you know the healthcare.gov is it connects to I have no idea how many.

Start time: 408.34
End time: 410.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  50 state databases and then I mean it's crazy.

Start time: 412.10
End time: 431.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I connected to like three databases on the campaign and I sometimes wished I was dead.  You know it's you have all of these different companies who have no interest in working together and then you have this kind of glue that's supposed to wrap it all together and it barely works.  And from a technology standpoint I think they probably did a pretty good try. It's just it's hard.

Start time: 432.74
End time: 446.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We all know that. Absolutely. The real issue though is I think they knew even months before certainly days before the launch that it wasn't going to work.  This is the real issue.  They were legally remanded by Congress to launch it regardless on October 1.

Start time: 447.64
End time: 467.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well and I think the other problem is when it comes to politics in Washington you have two parties and one is waiting for the slightest.  I mean that thing could have worked and there could have been like one button that was pink instead of blue and the Republicans.  But let's be fair Nick. It really didn't work. It really didn't work.  I mean it wasn't like it really kind of broken. Yes.

Start time: 469.84
End time: 473.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't remember the numbers was like 1600 people were able to sign up the first day. It was just it really did.

Start time: 476.86
End time: 498.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's one of those things that was just a total no win situation for the people involved because if it you know if it didn't work it's a total disaster and government can't do anything.  And if it did work and you know millions of people signed up them you know we're bankrupting the country and you know it's the biggest threat to America since you know communism or whatever everything else like.  It's literally like a no win situation whether it's great or not.

Start time: 499.64
End time: 537.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it would be better safe is to avoid the partisan political discussion because admittedly there are people out with the long knives for this no matter what.  But to really say is there a technical issue. I think part of the issue is that government moves at a completely different speed and has a completely different system of working together than technology.  Government works by consensus by committee by compromise technology is the antithesis of that.  There's no compromise it either works or it doesn't work.  In fact you must have faced this a little bit Harper trying to bring technology into.  I know you talked about this a little bit on our interview when you moved into the White House ready to become the most transparent administration of all time.

Start time: 538.64
End time: 543.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You had to face Windows XP and started laying down on the floor and haven't gotten up since.

Start time: 544.22
End time: 554.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's pretty much it. But one of the other things to keep in mind here is this is probably the biggest consumer application the government has ever made.  There's nothing else that is even close to this size.

Start time: 555.78
End time: 557.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well I mean not counting the NSA of course.

Start time: 560.12
End time: 577.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's but that that how many users does this proposed NSA app have like 50 maybe 100.  How many use I mean I think this is this is something I keep hearing when I travel.  People say well you know there's so many bugs in the health care dot gov app.  Why aren't there any bugs in the NSA app.  And it's like well I bet there were. Yes.

Start time: 578.70
End time: 579.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And lots of apps too.

Start time: 582.78
End time: 584.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's it's it's it's it's interesting.

Start time: 586.72
End time: 615.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But there's a reason governments designed to be inefficient the founding fathers wanted to be inefficient because they were afraid of an efficient government.  They have three. They have the three branches each designed to slow the other down.  This is how it's supposed to be.  The problem is that doesn't work so well on a Web site.  You know it's not a great way to do development.  And that's what's happening.  I gather I mean you're you're Harper did anybody call you and say Harper you know get in here.  Is there a red phone like a red iPhone you have.

Start time: 616.80
End time: 670.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean I every time that comes up I kind of I kind of try and hide those phones and I hang up a lot.  The real sorry I can't hear you.  Exactly exactly. It's breaking up breaking up.  But the real issue is we don't want a world where the government could reach out and call me.  Right. Because that's aggressively cronyism.  We want a government where they can reach out and hire the best contractors for the job which may honestly be someone in Silicon Valley.  And you know if they would have called me I probably would have said no because I think it probably would have sucked a lot and I don't want to do that.  And so with that said you know I want to create I would love to help create and I think I'll Clay Johnson and I wrote a New York Times op ed specifically talking about how can we fix the procurement system because that's where the problem is.  Yeah it's not I mean it's a tech problem now but it's because the procurement system sucked.  Yeah. No it was a good it was a good piece.

Start time: 671.64
End time: 685.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I have so I have something funny that happened today on the way here.  Nick Belton what funny what happened to you.  I was like oh I'm on with Will Smith and he doesn't look like the person that I would have googled.  If you just Google Will Harris.

Transcript:  If you Google Will Harris with two L's this is who I thought was coming.

I got some calculations for you.  You don't know. You could try to sell it online or you could go to gazelle.com.  Sell it to them. For top dollar.  Gazelle is the fast and easy way to rid yourself of old gadgets.  Believe me I just went through you know a move and I have a I have a.  I literally have a box chat I'm bringing to work.  And we're going to bring again an intern to gazelle everything.  I'm going to be a millionaire.  Tablets you got an old Microsoft Surface.  Yeah they'll actually buy a Surface tablet.  I mean I just got a curiosity.  What is the 64 gig Surface RT worth?  It's in good condition.  I've got all the power supply and the touch type cover.  180 make bucks. That's good.  I'll take it. If you get an old iPhone or a Samsung.  They'll even buy old Blackberries.  That can't be worth anything.  That's too depressing.  You really want to know. Can't be worth anything.  Which Blackberry do you have?

Start time: 827.64
End time: 838.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

End time: 844.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yours probably looks like it's never been used.  It's worth eighty seven dollars.  Ethically you can't sell it either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can only give it to someone who won't take it.  Who would want it.  The bodybuilder.

Start time: 851.64
End time: 852.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He wants that Z.

Start time: 856.03
End time: 942.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.  The iPhone. The iPad. The iPod.  They'll buy Apple computers. They'll buy old tablets.  They'll give you cash or a PayPal credit.  Or best thing to do get the Amazon gift card.  A million gadgets have been traded at gazelle.com.  For over actually 700,000 customers.  More than a hundred million dollars.  They even pay the postage on anything worth more than a buck.  The offer that you get is good for thirty days.  And we know it's out in November. We don't know when.  But you should get the quote now.  Because it's going to be worth more now than it's ever going to be worth again.  That's true of any gadget.  Two hundred fifty five bucks for it.  That gets you like halfway there to the next one.  But get that quote now.  Lock it in for thirty days.  Gives you time to get the new iPad.  Get your data transferred off. All of that stuff.  Gazelle.com.  Get rid of that stuff in your drawer.  I swear to God if the box is this big I cannot wait to find out what it's worth.  But here's a good question. How much are you worth?  Now do you accept the premise Nick?  You just wrote the book Hatching Twitter.  Great book. Everybody must read it.  Do you want to read some of the reviews out loud?  A little later. We'll have a dramatic reading.  Twitter. Were you surprised first of all that Twitter they asked for twenty seven bucks in their initial public offering.

Start time: 945.68
End time: 959.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think I was totally shocked.  I mean I knew that it was undervalued.  I think that they you know that I've spoken to a lot of the people involved and they've all said they didn't want to make the mistake Facebook made.  And they were going to go out.  I mean they knew that they were valued at around sixteen to twenty billion.

Start time: 960.68
End time: 968.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is tricky because if you if you start at too high a price.  You can blow it. But if it's too low you miss out on the amount of cash you could have gotten.

Start time: 969.64
End time: 992.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well but you also not only that I think that the thing that people aren't realizing is there was an incredible amount of excitement on the day of the IPO because they popped.  But there's a ceiling there. Right. And they had to go down. Now it's down. What's it down now?  I think forty one bucks. So it's dropped fast.  It just looks red. It doesn't look good. It's like these ugly red numbers. Seven point two four percent is down.  So you know I think that it's got to stabilize and I think the company is worth around twenty billion and not twenty five.

Start time: 992.84
End time: 996.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it was valued at twenty seven bucks I think at eighteen and a half billion. Right. Something like that.

Start time: 997.70
End time: 1010.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you know here's what was crazy. Right. So I I was doing back to back interviews for my book.  The day of the IPO. And in the morning I mean I think I literally did eight TV shows during the day.

Start time: 1011.64
End time: 1022.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Your timing is so good. It was crazy. Did you have inside information. How could you know when that.  You knew. You must have known. I mean if you're going to do a book on Twitter what's the best time to come out.

Start time: 1023.64
End time: 1064.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Two days before the Twitter IPO. Well that's so it was actually a day before because you blew it.  You blew it. One whole day. No but so here's what's really funny.  So I was I was doing these interviews and I think I started the morning with the Today show.  Canada whatever they call that. I don't know what it's called. And they were like so what are these guys worth.  And you know you have today. So they're like what are these guys worth.  And I explaining like what their valuations are. So Evan Williams was in the morning worth one point one billion and Jack Dorsey was worth five hundred million.  By the end of the day I did a Bloomberg special. Evan Williams was had doubled.  You have to fight your numbers up. And Jack was worth one point two billion.  I mean literally in a day that it just it was it was wild to see that.

Start time: 1065.64
End time: 1067.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's on paper. I mean they can't really capitalize on that.

Start time: 1068.64
End time: 1079.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean Jack sold I think point six percent of what of what he owned I think of something like that.  And ever sold money before he's already sold hundreds of millions of his stock before.  But some of the other guys I think most of them haven't sold much.

Start time: 1080.92
End time: 1091.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ironically Evan has started a new business medium which we wrote about today.  Yeah good article. But the point kind of is interesting that in both cases he's making money on other people's work.

Start time: 1093.66
End time: 1137.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well actually so in the book I think the one thing that I found really fascinating writing the story about these guys was that Evan Williams from day one has always been about it's never been about the money.  The money had just came to him in every instance.  He's always been about about creating a place for everyone to have a voice.  And there's a great anecdote in the beginning when they're running blogger and Jason Goldman and all these other guys are in the room.  And there were times that Evan blogger they had no money they had no lawyers or anything and there were these people that were threatening to sue them and saying you got to take this blog down you got to do that.  And I've had this philosophy of push button publishing for the people and he was adamant about it.  And it was always always about about giving people a voice and I still think that's the case.

That's 245.  All right you can change that.  But anyway.  OK.  Roughly we'll be concerned we're going to use conservative numbers here.  OK.  So it's going to be at least this much.  Yep.  Half a billion tweets a day.  Twitter says we deliver deliver more than 200 billion tweets a day to our users.  That means an average of 400 people see each tweet.  Twenty four and a half billion dollar value.  Now it's gone down a little bit divided by 200 billion tweet deliveries.  That's twelve point four or five cents per daily eyeball.  That's the number we're going to use here.  OK.  All right.  Now all right Harper Reed you're at Harper Reed right.  I'm just at Harper at Hart.  Early early adopter the first Harper the first.

I thought you know there's always an interesting a phenomenon a great phenomenon with tech  companies or companies like I thought IPO where people use them and people who could  buy shares in them actually use them every day.  It was one of the reasons people said the sort of the Facebook thing was massively over  priced no subscribed because people understand it and they sort of understand you know like  I use it every day it's really great I really enjoy Facebook so I'm going to buy it and  I think the same is probably true with Twitter but I think you know people have talked we  talked a little bit about the fact that you know is Twitter really worth that amount of  money how are they making money etc. and can they do it without completely ruining the  user experience and I think a lot of people said about Facebook you know even a year ago  or 18 months ago can Facebook make money from mobile without completely ruining the mobile  user experience and I think if you look at their performance over the last few months  they're clearly making a ton of money from mobile now well I haven't really seen a drop  off in terms of people actually using the mobile platform right.

End time: 2248.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know the horse ebooks account yeah this is the it's a spam account.  That's funny.

This is one of those days when I wake up and I go to Twitter and I missed some really  important piece of information I have no idea what's happening but all of my friends were  just devastated that horse ebooks wasn't real and I just did no idea what they were talking  about so they're just saying like I can't believe it's not real and I'm just like what  are we talking about?

Transcript:  Susan Orlean horse ebooks is human after all.  So sad right?  Oh well I just assumed because if you look at it every once in a while there's a link  in there to buy something and I just assumed this was a spam account right?  The idea is somehow and I've never really understood how Twitter spam works anyway right?  Because maybe you can explain this Nick.  How it works?  Yeah I mean it's estimated widely estimated that the number of phony accounts on Twitter  is at least half right?

Transcript:  Oh it's well it's maybe as much as three quarters.  Well so they actually did a big cleanup before the S1 and they had to because otherwise they  would have gotten in trouble with the Securities and Exchange Commission but they actually  eliminated tens of millions of accounts in that cleanup but the thing that's really interesting  if you go to like fiverr.com you can purchase 7,000 followers for five bucks and they're  bots.

Start time: 2356.64
End time: 2371.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right but okay so I understand follower count because if you're a Hollywood celebrity in  fact we know it improves your value to Hollywood.

Start time: 2371.84

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was number one but they were all real when I was in my day they were real people.  They were real people.  They were real.  32,000 of them.  But I still don't understand, I can understand follower counts so I understand why fiverr  works because they're going to create phony accounts so that you can inflate your follower  count but spam has existed on Twitter for a long time and I don't quite understand how  that's supposed to work because you're not going to follow a spammer.

Start time: 2408.08
End time: 2416.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No but are you asking why they do it or how they do it?  Yeah I understand how they do it.  Why do they do it?  Well they do it because they want you to click on the picture.  But I don't see it because I don't follow it.

Transcript:  Because they have pictures of really pretty girls as their avatars.  Exactly.  They use pretty girls as their avatar.  So there's a great theory which I heard somewhere, listening to on the radio the other day, maybe  on NPR, which was why is it that Nigerian spam emails are still so really obviously  Nigerian spam emails?  Like there's no attempt to discover them.  Yeah right.  They're still Nigerian princes.  And what you want to be able to do is to trick the most gullible of people.  And if people are a little bit gullible, right, then they will see the Nigerian spam email  and go, oh it's a Nigerian spam email.  You want the people who see the Nigerian spam email and go, oh my word there is a prince  in Nigeria that really needs my help.  Those are the people that you want because those are the people that you want.  They're really dumb.  So you have Twitter and you put a picture of a pretty girl in a bikini and she says  Hey I really like your tweet, follow me back or whatever.  And you go, oh my god this really hot girl likes my tweets, I better do what she asks me.

Start time: 2477.64
End time: 2499.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Plus a lot of people don't have a lot of followers and if someone follows them and they're a pretty girl  They'll follow back.  Or they look like Harper, they'll follow back.  A good looking man.  Somebody said before that you look like Jesse Pinkman in the chat room.  The late Jesse Pinkman, not the early Jesse Pinkman.  So and then the other spam is, the other spam, the way they do it, is they use the API.

And they're like, oh my god, check this out, and because they use APIs and all those fun things  and you're like, I have to check it out and you click and next thing you know you have,  I don't know where they take you, but...

Should I go there and check it out?  No, I think it's down now.  Down for everyone?  I think in fact when I went there I got a Google warning, this is a fraudulent site.  But I get a lot of, in my direct messages from people I know who have obviously been hacked,  that kind of spammy sites are more likely malware sites.  Yeah.  So that's another fine mess you've gotten us into, Twitter.  Did you ever ask them why they, I remember I talked to Ev early on,  and I said, Ev, you were running ODO, you must have heard of the podcast, Twitter,  and known that we had the name Twitter and the trademark Twitter.  Did you ever consider that?  And he said, yeah, he literally told me, no, because when we named it Twitter,  we didn't think either of us was going anywhere.

Transcript:  And that was Noah Glass that came up with it.  That was Noah Glass.  You tell the story, I've only read the excerpt, not the whole book,  because I just got the book thanks to you.  But in the excerpt you tell the story of him actually paging through a dictionary.

Start time: 2670.66
End time: 2745.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He was paging through a dictionary for like three days, everyone said he was paging through a dictionary.  Trying to name it.  And he had this moment.  First they proposed friendstalker.com.  There was friendstalker, which was Ev's idea, then there was, Biz Stone wanted to call it SMSY.  That sounds like dangerous.  That's not in the book.  That's SME.  And then there were some other names.  There were other projects that they were thinking of melding together.  One was called Ketchup.  So it could have been called Ketchup.  And then there was another one that was similar to friendstalker.  And then Jack wanted to call it Status, and there were all these different things.  And there was Jitter, somebody actually in the chat room just mentioned that.  Very good.  That was Noah Glass's first attempt.  So what happened was, Noah was sitting at his, he went home because he couldn't concentrate, he's sitting at his desk.  And he's going through this dictionary.  And his phone keeps going ding ding ding.  And he gets really annoyed and he goes over and he reaches over and he turns it off and it vibrates.  And he looks up the word vibrate.  And then he's like, oh this could be really it.  And he's like, vibrate doesn't sound very good.  And he looks up the word similar to it and he ends up with the word Twitch.  And then four or five words later there was Twitter.  And it all made sense.  And then he thought to himself, wait doesn't Leo Lepore have a Twitter account?  Doesn't Leo Lepore have a show that he's doing?

He used to take postage, you know, as envelopes and packages to the post office.  He used, he said out of date scales.  He'd purchased an office supply store.  So it would say a price and then he'd have to add four cents or whatever.  He said it was a hassle and a waste of time.  He loves the convenience of stamps.com.  He always gets exactly the right postage.  He doesn't overpay just to make sure you don't get postage too.  And he never runs out of postage when he needs it for the business.

But the thing that's exciting is it's this incredibly valuable experience.  It's the most exciting and valuable thing I've ever done.  Valuable is the wrong word.  Rewarding, maybe is a better word.  Rewarding experience, but at the same time, you wake up and you just kind of dread going in  because you never know what's going to happen.  You don't know what the news cycle is going to bring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, usually, I don't know.  I found it similar.  However, it's so high pressure.  Startups are high pressure as well, but at a startup, if the four of us were doing a startup  and after the show was our launch, we could all go on a vacation for a week.  You don't have that opportunity.  And then also, you're also working for this hope that you make some money,  and there's not that opportunity either, and no one does it for the money.  So you can't really compare those.

This is my chance to participate in a very small way to really save the world.  Make a difference.  And you cannot find anything else that's like that.  And it's actually interesting because right now we're starting this company,  and we've been going for a few months now.  What is the company?  It's called Lunar Technology, and we're in the middle of a rebranding,  so we'll have more later.  But we're very quiet specifically just because we just don't have a product to show yet.

Sometimes you're there until 6.30, and the first couple days you kind of feel guilty,  because at the campaign we worked so late, and we worked so hard.  And I'll come home and I'll forget to check email for a few hours.  And once again, I have this guilt because for two years,  my constant companion was my phone with my email,  and was interacting and trying to negotiate various things in the middle of the night.  And there's no off.  Whereas even my friends who are involved with very successful, very high-pressure startups,  they have some opportunities for off.  And that's, I think, one of the big differences.  There's just no chance for off.  But that was part of the deal, right?

And I think the president had just finished speaking,  and we got – I'm kind of watching my email.  And it turns out that YouTube's algorithms had marked the stream as spam or had it –  Really?  I don't think it was spam.  I think that they had some licensed music.  So it just turned off the stream.  Yeah, they do that to us all the time.  And I'm just like – and of course, I'm just like, what the f***?  What do we do?  And so, of course, I get on the phone with them.

So you reach out to those guys, and then they reach out.  And it was fun because it was just – you start out with some – the person that's up.  And eventually, you're on this thread with everyone in the world where they're just like, we have to fix this.  And I'm on the phone with them, and I'm just like, I don't care if it's automated.  Just un-automated. Make it so it goes.  And that type of thing happened all the time.  We spent a lot of time, I mean just so much time, making sure that there weren't surprises.  Because that's really the worst thing that can happen in this world where your number one enemy is the message and deviating from that message.  So I have a question.

You're driving me crazy.  He's like, I'm going on Twitter.  So I did go on Twitter right after.  I asked some friends, I said, I need to go somewhere I don't know anyone.  And a good friend of mine was like, why don't you go to San Diego?  And I was like, oh, okay.  Don't know anyone there.  Yeah, exactly.  So I went to San Diego for a week and just hung out at some weird resort that was totally off season.  No one was there.  It was me and the hotel bartender.  And then I read a bunch of books and I didn't bring a phone.  What did you read?  Can you tell us some of the books?  Yeah, I actually read I think the best one.

It just made me so mad.  In retrospect, I think back on it and I think about my experience.  Why did it make you mad?  Oh, the character.  Oh my gosh.  I mean, I'm sitting there by myself.  I don't want to talk to you.  I'm in a hotel bar.  I'm talking to the bartender.  San Diego.  In San Diego, the only time he read any books was when he read The Jungle by Upton St. Clair or whatever.  In prison.  That seems like he's like, I don't read much books.  I didn't read The Jungle once.  In prison.  The bartender?  Yeah.  He was really nice.  He's in prison and he's reading the expose of the meatpacking industry from the 20s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's two clouds, the public internet, the Google cloud.  And in between the two, there is this thing called a GFE, a Google Front End Server.  And what it points out, and in fact, I think these are the replication servers for Google all over the globe.  Of course, Google has to have multiple servers all over the globe.  In order for the Google mail and everything else to appear to everybody, you have to replicate.  And in the replication, at least at this time, it was unencrypted.  In fact, there's a little smiley face where it says, this is weird.  I just think of some spy drawing this little happy face here.  SSL added and removed here.  And then they're pointing to the Google Front End Server.  When showed this, Eric Schmidt said, outrageous.  But the two Google engineers, Brandon Downey, the first, basically responded with profanity.  I guess since we've already used the F-bomb on this show, you're already going to be bleeping.  He said, F these guys.  I spent the last 10 years of my life trying to keep Google's users safe and secure from the many diverse threats Google faces.  He says, I've seen armies of machines DDoSing Google.  I've seen worms.  I've seen spyware.  I've even seen the press of governments use state-sponsored hacking to target dissidents.  But even though we suspected this was happening, it still makes me terribly sad.  It makes me sad because I believe in America.  But after spending all that time helping in my tiny way to protect Google, it's just a little like coming home from the war with Sauron, destroying—  get this, this is a geek metaphor if ever there was one—destroying the One Ring, only to discover the NSA is on the front porch of the Shire chopping down the party tree and outsourcing all the harbored farmers with half orcs and whips.  The US has to be better than this.  But I guess in the interim, that security job is looking a lot more like the Sisyphus thing than ever.  Wow.  And yeah, I mean, very upset.  And two Google engineers wrote about this and both using the same profane expression.

End time: 3744.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I think they make it pretty clear in the post, like, this is not the opinion of my employer.  Here's the Mike Kern post.  I think likewise, if Google didn't feel like this was a legitimate way of approaching this, I think they would be straight on to them to say, you know, you need to take this down.  I think what was interesting there about particularly about the first post from Mike Kern, because he was like, we suspected that they were doing this, but it's good to find out anything.  Well, isn't that the case? We all did suspect this.  We suspected they were doing it.  Well, of course, Steve Gibson suspected this from day one.  He was like, they've got to tap on the actual fiber cables.  And this is what he said back in the day.

Start time: 3744.82
End time: 3759.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And what Google's response has been is, of course, to encrypt now that all the traffic between those replicating servers.  And I think that's I mean, they're really actively trying to defeat this kind of spying.  Mike Kern's a Brit.  And he says the GHCQ is even worse.

Start time: 3760.82
End time: 3826.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it's interesting because we've had a.  So GCHQ in the UK is sort of like the sort of UK equivalent, I guess, of the NSA in some ways.  And because of the I guess the sort of Irish troubles and things in the 80s, it's sort of being common knowledge that in the UK, if you use, you know, the regular telephone system, GCHQ does keyword monitoring just across the board.  And so we've had sort of not quite the same expectation of privacy, certainly for phone calls, right, in the UK, because we've sort of had that history of domestic terrorism, I guess.  But certainly, I think everybody expected the Internet to be a different scenario.  And it turns out that, of course, it's not.  And that in many cases, because Britain has slightly easier laws in terms of getting around public speech because of that history, you know, the NSA has been working on projects with GCHQ to get the data.  And it's not that GCHQ to get things done over here that it couldn't get done in the US, which seems to be a subversion of sort of, you know, the point of it, even if not the legality of it.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Question for the audience or the attendees or whatever these people are, the people here.  This live studio audience.  So here's my question.  There's if we could go back in time and and have this kind of system that existed and hypothetically stop something like 911 from happening, would you are you I would be personally willing to give up my freedom, if you will, on the Internet or whatever these devices are that we use to avoid a catastrophe like that.

Start time: 3870.48
End time: 3883.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's a it's a false dichotomy.  There's no so there's no proof that that a would ever happen.  Absolutely.  Theoretically, do I want to save thousands of lives?  This is a legitimate question, though, I think.

Start time: 3884.54
End time: 3962.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And something that doesn't often get asked is and I think that in fact we gave them permission and encouraged them to Dan gear, who's a security expert, gave a great talk, which he's published on his gear.tinho.net website, in which he basically says, as soon as you say, as we did in 2001, never again.  Then you have to have the kind of surveillance that we're talking about here.  In effect, by saying this may not happen again, you have to say, well, then we have to have total information awareness.  There's no logical alternative to that.  And what is your viewpoint on it?  Well, I mean, Ben Franklin said quite famously, you know, those who would trade, what do you say, those who would trade privacy for security deserve neither in effect.  There are more get neither.  And and so there seems it seems to me there has to be a balance.  Well, I agree.  There is a very real, real question of how much terrorism has been stopped by this kind of surveillance.  But I don't think you can blame the NSA because I think the NSA feels rightly they were instructed to do this, that they in effect were said they people's George W.  Bush went to the NSA said this may not happen again.  Do what it takes.  And in the NSA's opinion, and I think they're probably right.  If you want total safety, you have to have total information.

Start time: 3962.84
End time: 3969.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I think there's a you know, an interesting point, which is, you know, in that circumstance, does what they're doing have to be legal?  Well, yes.

Start time: 3970.54
End time: 3972.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I think I mean, and that's the point.

Start time: 3972.34
End time: 3994.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But no, I would say it is legal.  That's why we passed the Patriot Act.  That's why we have the Fisk rules, the FISA court.  It is legal, whether it's right, whether it's even constitutional has never been decided by a court.  But it is legal.  It's this is all unconstitutional is illegal, right?  Because if you're breaking it's not but it's not been ruled unconstitutional yet.  It's not been it's not been challenged in court.  Right.

Start time: 3995.24
End time: 4000.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 4000.58

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I think that what Will's talking about is that the rules are definitely very different in the UK.  Right.

Start time: 4006.61
End time: 4042.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, for sure.  But I think there is an aspect I think it's interesting because there is an expectation that if you are, you know, if you're in that kind of service, you still have to you have to be able to do that.  You still have to you have to play by the rules of legality.  Otherwise, you know, you could literally just do anything.  But there is a I think there's a really genuine good question, which you point out, Leo, which is, you know, no one has yet ruled this unconstitutional.  Also in the absence of that, it sort of is by default presumed to be.  But I think what this is doing is to your point, Nick, opening a real conversation as which nobody's had in the last ten years.  Yeah.

Start time: 4043.32
End time: 4072.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's that's exactly why I ask that question.  I'm not saying one thing or the other works or doesn't.  But I but I grew up. OK, so I grew up in England up north in Leeds and during the IRA.  And I remember being in Manchester when there was bombings.  I remember my sister being there.  I remember going to being at the embassy one day in London and there was a bomb outside and they had to shut the whole place down.  And it was as a kid. It was scary.  And and we haven't had that in America yet.  But do we just want to say, well, let's just hope that doesn't happen.  Don't we want to be somewhat proactive?

Start time: 4072.98
End time: 4162.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there's there's something else that we're not I don't think we're really addressing, which is that legislation and technology are not hand in hand.  And so this there's a great book called Exploding the Phone talking about big phone companies and hackers and whatnot.  And part of it is the history of how the phone technology was always so far ahead of legislation when it comes to surveillance that oftentimes various you know,  whether it was about drugs or whether it was about organized crime, they oftentimes were very innovative on how they tap the phone.  But the laws and the warrants and all that stuff didn't catch up to much later.  And so I think we're really seeing this again, which is that the technology is so far ahead of any of our legislation, whether it's about Patriot Act or not,  that what what the Patriot Act says is why don't you just do all these things to stop all these terrible things from happening?  And how that's interpreted with technology is much different than I think we thought it would be because technology goes much faster than any of us think.  And the courts are just not able to to keep up.  Now, with that said, my biggest fear is that is that there will be a knee jerk reaction to these leaks that where we start legislating data privacy.  And then we're in a position like Germany, where startups cannot exist there because the laws do not allow them to do the cool stuff that we can do here with data.  And so I do a lot of speaking and I've talked in Germany a bunch.  And oftentimes people say, you know, we have all these really strict laws, but our startups are leaving to go to countries that are more permissive.

Start time: 4162.30
End time: 4177.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I had to talk to someone in Germany that said that they had to because of something that was built into their their startup, they had to actually have a privacy person that was an employee.

Transcript:  Well, and the case of Max Mosley is fascinating. So Max Mosley, who is the son of Oswald Mosley, a famous British Nazi.  Right, well, and who is he's the former head of Formula One and very worried about his father's association.  Pictures were shown of him in a British news of the world, the now defunct Murdoch, you know, trashy newspaper of him and an orgy.  And News of the World said it was a Nazi orgy. Mosley sued Mosley sued and won.  But the problem is the pictures keep showing up in a Google search.

Start time: 4220.29
End time: 4230.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this week, Paris is Tribunal de Grand Instance.  I don't know what that is. Supreme Court, I guess, ruled in Mosley's favor.  He sued Google in France to filter the images automatically and delete any links to them, not to go after the websites publishing the images, but to go after Google search.  Now, they only ordered him.  They only ordered Google to pay one euro in damages.  But and Google says it's going to appeal.  It raises a really interesting specter.  Is it Google's responsibility for what's in their search index?  I could see how you could go after a website that publishes those pictures.

Start time: 4278.38
End time: 4295.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Google, whenever I hear these stories, I always go back a little bit and I think that we should have, especially since cameras are everywhere, we should have camera training because he shouldn't have never.  He should have never filmed this Nazi orgy in the first place.  He filmed it.

Start time: 4315.36
End time: 4343.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's unfortunate.  But Google already built his copyrighted results, right?  So Google will filter out torrent websites if you, you know, fame.  It does.  But I think it's a slippery slope.  So shouldn't it try and filter out things which are illegal and particularly so it's particular to France because France has got a lot of really strict rules about glorifying war and glorifying Nazi Germany and all these kind of things.  And part of the thinking, I think, in that decision was that it was it relates to that.

Start time: 4344.20
End time: 4349.14

Start time: 4350.81
End time: 4380.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  But I think it's more about if you're going to operate in a country like if you're going to operate in China, you've got to play by the rules of China.  So Google did have a lot of technology companies have completely different presences in China to comply with local Chinese laws.  The problem is that you do start to get to a stage where if you want to be in a country, you've got to play by their local laws.  And that starts to get really complicated when you're a massive multinational like Google.  On the other hand, they could choose not to do it and not be there.

Start time: 4380.26
End time: 4406.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. It must be tempting for Google just to say, OK, France, you don't want Google.  You don't get Google. There must be tempted.  Google says we have removed hundreds of pages for Mr.  Mosley and stand ready to remove others he identifies.  I guess that would be on Blogspot or some Google properties.  But the law does not support Mr.  Mosley's demand for the construction of an unprecedented new Internet censorship tool.  But Google removes child pornography.  This is a problem. Once you start censoring.

Start time: 4407.26

End time: 4425.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Exactly. But that's where I think you can have services that do and services that don't.  And there has to be some sort of awareness to let the people know what is happening.  I mean, Facebook censors.

Transcript:  Yeah. Which by the way is insane.  But you know Google makes a lot of effort not to really specifically and this is might be a nifty segue and makes a makes a lot of effort not to start to filter YouTube.  So there's no manual filtering of YouTube whatsoever.  It's all about.

Start time: 4450.24

And so we are allowed as a new show in the coverage of news to show copyrighted material in that context.  Yeah. Fair use.  Nevertheless, we're always we get DMC requests on almost every video we show.  Often the videos are taken down and then we appeal the process.  So what we've discovered because it's automated, it's just, you know, there's a machine running and sometimes it's like Brazilian television says you can't show that cat video.  It's like what?  So what we do is we what do you do, Chad?  You put it in a window. Right.  So I so yeah, like that same thing.  It's like a cat watching your cat watching a cat watching the news.  Oh, yeah.

Keep going.  Genuinely, because he's one of these people who is massively into his social media.  So the YouTube channel grew out of the fact, you know, he's got five million followers  on Twitter, as you well know, Nick.  And it was all about how can I do more things to give the audience on Twitter, like more  of a, sort of more experience, right?  How can they get more Ricky other than just, you know, stupid photos that he takes in his  bathtub or whatever?  And so that's kind of what it grew out of.

Start time: 5083.84
End time: 5129.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In the last scene.  So, I'm not giving anything away by saying this, but I...  So, one of the greatest things...  I'm honestly not giving you anything away.  One of the greatest things about Breaking Bad was the fact that you got the...  After the show ended, you went on Reddit and Twitter and all these places to find all the  little secrets and all the things that were hidden.  Right.  Was there a lot of hidden stuff?  Oh, there was so much amazing stuff.  Oh, I gotta do that.  I mean, go look.  There's some Reddit forums where people found all the playbacks.  You're gonna ruin it for everyone if you do that now.  Well, I won't show it.  Okay.  But it was amazing.  And all of the scenes in the end, there are flashbacks to the beginning.  And I can't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's awesome.  Actually, we actually owe a real debt of gratitude to Mr. Nick Bilton, who in the New York Times,  in your Bits blog, continually ragged on the airlines, and most importantly on the FAA,  for not allowing you, Nick Bilton...  No, for not allowing you, Leo Dupour...

Start time: 5196.56
End time: 5199.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 5199.42
End time: 5207.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There was no reason the rule existed.  And you did the research.  You went out, you went to labs, you tested, you said there's no interference at all from  a Kindle.

Start time: 5208.36
End time: 5217.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  None at all!  We went down to...  So, I did the first story in 2011, and I've never had a response.  Has it been that long?  Wow.  Yeah, I never had a response to a column like that.

Start time: 5218.04
End time: 5219.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was it a personal vendetta, though?  I mean, it really...

Start time: 5220.46
End time: 5264.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it was just logic.  I was sitting on a plane, I downloaded a book to my Kindle, and then the flight attendant  said, you've got to turn that off.  And I said, what are you talking about?  This is a calculator.  You can't crash a plane with a calculator.  And I got really frustrated, and I wrote a column, and I didn't really think anything  of it.  And it was viewed millions of times, it had 600, 700 comments, it was shared on Twitter  10,000 times, and I realized that it wasn't just me that was pissed off.  It was everyone.  My legs said they were pissed off?  Yes.  You just can't say f***.  Okay, got it.  No f***, but pissed is okay.  So then I called the FAA, and I did this piece, whatever, and then they said the rules that  existed were from 1964.  What?  They hadn't changed the rules since then.  And the rules just said that you're allowed to use a hearing aid, a heart monitor, a tape  recorder, and an electric shaver.

Start time: 5264.96
End time: 5267.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What did people have in 1964 that would be dangerous?

Start time: 5267.74
End time: 5272.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Transcript:  A breaker breaker one nine, I'm up here at 40,000 feet.

Start time: 5277.72
End time: 5301.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So then we went down to this testing facility in Palo Alto, and we took a Kindle and a shaver  and all these things, and we tested them all, and it turned out that a Kindle put off, it  was, so a plane has to be able to withstand from Boeing and FAA's rules, 200 volts per  meter of electromagnetic energy, and a Kindle puts off zero point, and then there's like  25 zeros, six microvolts.

Start time: 5301.24
End time: 5304.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because it doesn't actually do anything until it's turning a page.

Start time: 5304.24
End time: 5339.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Even if it's turning a page, it doesn't do anything.  It's like the devices, because they're trying to reduce the amount of power using when they  build these things.  So then what happens, so if you do the math, to hit the one percent mark of the rules,  you would need 66,666 Kindles in a one square meter area.  So you can't physically, and that's just one percent.  So you filled a whole, so anyway, so after a couple years of just relentlessly attacking  the FAA for the stupidity of these rules, and then everyone else doing it too, and then  everyone tweeting it and so on, the rules finally got changed last week.

Start time: 5340.04
End time: 5346.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  You pay 500 bucks for an iPad, and you want to just read a magazine, and everyone said,  oh, it's five minutes.  No, it's 31 minutes during takeoff and landing.  That's the average.  You measured, apparently.  Yeah, of course.  I'm going crazy here.  It's 31 minutes.  So people bought these devices, and they wanted to be able to read on them.

Start time: 5364.62
End time: 5375.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I actually buy, you've actually now killed the magazine industry, because that's the  only reason people bought magazines at airports.  Of course.  For those 10 minutes at either end that you couldn't read.

Start time: 5375.42
End time: 5377.64

Start time: 5421.42
End time: 5440.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think United now can do it.  Virgin America still cannot, which I think is ridiculous, because they were the ones  that spoke to me the most for all these stories.  You'd think so, because they're the hippest airline.  And you should ask Virgin America to hurry up their testing.  They also have the newest planes.  I know, they have new planes.  They have those cool purple lights and the cool music.  It's like a disco in that plane.  It's awesome.

Transcript:  Well, so okay.  So I interviewed the people on the committee from the FAA testing committee and asked them,  well, what happens if I forget to put my phone in airplane mode?  And they said that what happened is the planes were originally built.  They didn't have a lot of installation as far as electronics, right?  So you had these radio waves and these radar waves and all these things that were going  through.  So they had to actually, about 40 years ago, they had to start making the planes so that  they couldn't have interference from the outside.  As a result, by accident, they made it so that they couldn't have interference from  the inside too.  So these devices, even if they're in airplane mode or they're not, it's not going to do  anything.  Doesn't matter.

Transcript:  And I have that, it's quoted in one of my columns.  The FCC, not the FAA, regulates cell phone use.  That's a different issue because I'm told the handoffs at 600 miles an hour at seven  miles up could be a real problem for cell towers.

Start time: 5588.80
End time: 5604.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  So it's not a dangerous problem.  It is.  It makes it difficult for the cell towers to be able to hand off that signal.  And so I put my phone in airplane mode just to make it easier for those little cell towers.  But other than that, you know.

Because guys have this issue which is I want the phone to be small enough to fit comfortably  in my pocket, right?  And not in my back pocket because I'm going to sit on it.  It's got to fit in your thumb.  You put it in your breast pocket, but all of these do.  No, not your breast pocket because then it's going to fall out and you're going to break  it repeatedly.  It's got to fit in your front jeans pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right.  I happen to like big phones.  I cannot lie.  Those other brothers can deny.  When a phone walks in with an itty-bitty...  Never mind.  I can't go any farther.  Actually, you guys should feel terrible because...  Did you read the Cam Simpson article in the Bloomberg Business Week?  Yeah.  Very depressing.  And I have to say, it's not the iPhone only.  It's every phone.  It's every consumer electronic device.  Even the Moto X, which is assembled in the US, still goes down this supply chain to Malaysia  and other places.  And the story is depressing about how...  Well, it talks about Apple and how they ramped up to build the camera in the iPhone 5 and  how labor is basically brought into Malaysia from Nepal and other places by brokers that  the labor is essentially...  This is essentially serfdom.  They are required to pay the brokers.  They often take out loans.  They talk about one worker who took out $1,000 in loans to go to the Flextronics plant near  Kuala Lumpur.  The plant was shut down because the cameras they were producing were not good enough for  Apple.  The worker was stranded there for months.  At some point, they stopped feeding them.  They held their passport so they couldn't leave.  He got back home eventually, owes money to what is effectively a loan shark in Nepal,  and will have to go out and do it again just to get enough money to pay this back.  I mean, it is a tragic story.  And my sense is from this that it's universal at Flextronics, which makes a lot of the electronics  we use today.  It kind of takes a little bit of the fun out of owning and arguing over which is bigger,  which is smaller.  Absolutely.

End time: 6094.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thanks for ruining this.  Appreciate that.  Yeah.  Thanks.  I'm going to throw them out now.  What do we do?  I mean...  Well, no, it's difficult because there was a...  When the Times did that big series on Apple and the supply chains, and it was not just  Apple, it was everyone.  It was Samsung and Microsoft.  Everybody makes...

Start time: 6094.12

End time: 6107.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have no idea who wrote it.  I can't remember.  But it was a great op-ed that said, well, what do you do in this situation?  Do you just not have a phone?  Or, you know, and I think that...  Well, maybe you don't throw it out as soon.

Start time: 6107.12
End time: 6109.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 6110.12
End time: 6135.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So people only have to be slightly in servitude rather than totally in servitude.  They have to wake a new phone every three years rather than every two years.  Oh, shucks.  Surely, the answer is...  Well, what happened with the New York Times series with Apple in the first place was that  it started Apple doing a crackdown on its suppliers.  And surely, the right thing to do is A, for Apple to insist and actively monitor and actively prevent those things.

Start time: 6135.60
End time: 6161.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And as this article points out, there are laws saying, for instance,  you cannot, as a broker, ask for more than a month's worth of pay.  These people, by the way, make very little money.  This guy, Dong is his name, was earning $3 a day for a 12-hour shift.  He earns less than $90 a month.  He owes $300 in interest alone every year.  So, I mean, we're talking just devastating.

Start time: 6162.36
End time: 6171.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I also think the other thing that they can do, which Apple is clearly doing,  is start making stuff in places where the labor laws are better.  So bring the manufacturing to the US.

Start time: 6172.12
End time: 6181.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, but when that happens, it's not going to be people that are making it then.  It's going to be robots.  And that's going to be the big change then.  But is that better or worse?

Start time: 6182.18
End time: 6187.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's not the Apple plant for the Mac Pro.  I mean, it's primarily robots making that thing.  Yeah.

Start time: 6188.57
End time: 6207.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's in Texas.  John Markoff wrote a great piece about this,  about how when manufacturing does come back to the US,  it doesn't mean it's going to come back with jobs.  It means it's coming back and it's going to be robotics that are building it.  But this is effectively slave labor.  Yeah, and I agree.  But I do think it's unfair just to call out Apple for this  because every single company is doing it.

Start time: 6208.50
End time: 6232.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I prefaced it with that.  Every one of these phones is made exactly that.  And even if this phone like the Moto X is assembled in Texas,  it doesn't matter because every part that they use,  from the camera to the rare earth materials,  it's mined in horrible ways in China.  It's made by slave labor in Malaysia.  I mean, we're all a little bit culpable, frankly,  and I don't know what the answer is.

Start time: 6308.16
End time: 6355.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's a very interesting phone.  Well, let's all be aware of it as geeks.  We like our gadgets, but there is a human price to pay.  By the way, the reason Dong took out this $1,000 loan to go there  is the reason brokers can charge people.  These are hotly contested jobs.  People want these jobs.  So it's not that the job itself is menial,  although we might as Americans look at the job and say $3 a day  for gluing sneakers.  They want these jobs desperately.  That's why they're paying so much money to get them,  but once they get there, they're effectively slaves.  Gee, I hardly want to talk about anything else now.  Yeah, thanks for that.

But the thing that was dramatic about this story,  and I had no idea going into it, this would be the case.  But the thing I found utterly dramatic was Noah got pushed out.  Then Jack Dorsey got pushed out.  Then Jack organized a coup to push Evan Williams out.  Then there was a point when Dick Costolo got fired for a brief moment.  It's just the chaos. But the chaos is also what led it to be the company it is today.

Transcript:  Yes, Oprah wanted, Oprah originally, there was the contest between Ashton Kutcher and CNN  to see who would get to the first million users.  And Oprah, I guess, is friends with Ashton Kutcher somehow.  I guess they hang out, maybe.  They're all celebrities.  You know, they all know each other.  They just hang out.  So Oprah said, well, let's talk about this Twitter thing.  And next thing you know, it ended up becoming Evan Williams going on the show as a guest.  And the funny thing was when Oprah sent her first tweet, it was in all caps.  And she's not very good with computers.  So they actually set up a computer. It was a PC.  They set it up on her table.  And for live television, 7 million people watching.  And the plan was Oprah would tweet and all of her celebrity friends like Ashton Kutcher  and whoever the heck else would respond and say, hey, welcome to Twitter, Oprah.  I remember that.  And she didn't know how to actually hit refresh on a browser.  So they set up like the F7 key with a yellow piece of tape that would refresh the browser.  So she typed her tweet.  And rather than hitting return to send the tweet, she actually hit F7.  So the tweet was deleted.  So there was no tweet for anyone to respond to.  And as soon as they cut to commercial break, Evan Williams body checked her and wrote the first tweet.  Out of my way, Oprah.  And hit send and it was all saved.

The story is Jack Dorsey invented Twitter.  Well, that's and that's not the case.  And that's what the book tells the story of is is that there were 12 people in the room that were there when this thing was hatched.  They weren't out on the swing set in South Park.  The swing set is like one part, but that's like saying that that one moment of the show is the entire show.  You know, there there there are there were 12 people that get credit for.  Well, there's 12 people that are involved in it.  And the real genesis, the real moment was a moment in a car with Noah Glass and Jack Dorsey.  And it was it was two in the morning.  It was February 27th, 2006.  They'd been out drinking and they were having this conversation about the status idea that people weren't really interested in.  It wasn't very compelling.  But Noah was going through a divorce and he felt incredibly alone and he had this epiphany.  And he said, what if you could take this status thing and integrate it with your friends and you could actually feel less alone?  And that was like the aha moment.  Very cool.

The entire database recently published online for gigabytes.  And it turned out, no, in fact, not even thirty eight million, but one hundred fifty million records of Adobe customers.

And eventually, just by picking up your phone and the temperature,  the sensors that will be in there and all these things, that will be your password.  And it will essentially just...

Cashmere Hill writing for Forbes.  What's the title of it?  Does this $17 million Bitcoin wallet belong to alleged Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht?  They start with an identity called Altoid.  And Altoid apparently put forum posts up.  Maybe this isn't the story either.  It's a really good story.  Maybe this links back to a BBC story.  Yeah, this is it.  What is it?  BBC story, how the FBI closed in on suspect Ross Ulbricht.  See, ever the reporter.  So you're going to steal this story and write it up on the Bits blog and then that way?  No, no, you wouldn't do that.  I'm going to tweet it.  That's a lot easier.  In a post titled Anonymous Market Online?  A user nicknamed Altoid started publicizing the site.  This is back in 2011.  The post contained a link to a site hosted by on WordPress that provided a link to Silk  Road's location on the dark web because of course you had to be running tour to get to  Silk Road.  But then Altoid appeared in another place, a discussion site about virtual currency,  BitcoinTalk.org.  And then he appeared again months later in October in a post asking to find an IT expert  with knowledge of Bitcoin.  He asked people to email Ross Ulbricht at Gmail.com.  Could have been a giveaway.  That's smart.

Transcript:  Looking like Adam Curry is not a great recommendation.  Like a young, attractive Adam Curry.  Before he sold out.  So, no, I think there are a few things.  So, number one is the video game footage, which is what this guy does a lot of,  is just insanely popular on YouTube.  And that is partly the machinima effect.  Machinima is the biggest YouTube content network.  So, what he has managed to do is combine some of the most popular things on YouTube.  He's combined comedy with the Justin Bieber effect of being a cute teenage guy.  Combined with being an amazing, not amazing, but an entertaining video gamer.  And so he sort of created this sort of unholy trio of appealing to teenage boys,  through being all about video games, through being cute.  You've got to appeal to kids.

Start time: 8015.24

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And there is also a, and he also, you know, there is a law on YouTube,  which is a kind of, it's the sort of rolling stone law, which is sort of,  once you get to getting to a million subscribers on YouTube is really, really hard.  Getting to two million is then quite easy.  And then getting from two to ten is just a matter of time.  Because the YouTube algorithm rewards popularity and surfaces stuff to people,  you know, if other people think it's popular.  And so, whilst it's really hard to get a certain level,  then once you get to sort of a million subs, it just snowballs.

Transcript:  We're going to wrap it up. I just want a little mention of the Internet Archive.  We interviewed Brewster Kale on Triangulation before.  They're great. They do really great work.  And they had a massive fire that destroyed $600,000 worth of digitizing and scanning equipment.  They really are an important part of, I think, of the Internet.  And if you can help, we invite you to do so at Archive.org.  They're trying to raise money to help pay for it.  Terrible.  Terrible.  Yeah.  If anything should not have burned, it's this, you know, nonprofit, really a great boon to the world effort.  And it is a nonprofit, so your donation is tax deductible.
