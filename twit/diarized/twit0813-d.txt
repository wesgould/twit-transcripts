Transcript:  Yeah, actually we might as well this you know what Alex Lindsay last week said I have to get on to it  Because I read this  Ridiculous press release from Stanford about zoom fatigue and why we get it and I have to debunk it and then what's funny  Is I we put it in the rundown? It's not a high up  It's kind of low down on the rundown, but will just spontaneously as he signed in said I've got to talk about zoom  And then Lisa said yeah, I just wrote an article about zoom fatigue so we have three experts on  Zoom fatigue let me tell you what Stanford said then then you guys can can weigh in  Stanford this is the headline from Stanford press release  Stanford edu  Stanford researchers identify four causes for zoom fatigue, and then they offer simple fixes  It's not just  Already Lisa's laughing it's not just zoom popular video chat platforms have designed flaws that exhaust the human mind and body  But there are easy ways to mitigate the effects here the four reasons too much close-up eye contact  It's it's overly intimate  because the size of the face on the screens is  Abnormally large and on zoom calls everyone's looking at everyone all the time  There's just too much eye contact so they're quoting in this report a  Journal technology mind and behavior. It's the first peer reviewed article that systematically  deconstructs zoom fatigue by Professor Jeremy  Balenson and  Balenson says the fix for this is  Take zoom off the full screen option reduce the size of the zoom window. I always watch it in a grid mode  I don't know what's wrong with that relative to the monitor minimize face size and use an external keyboard  To an allow an increase in the personal space bubble. I'm gonna move back. Let me increase the space bubble  Between myself and the grid number two seeing yourself during video chats  Constantly in real time is fatiguing and of course the fix for that is just hide your own view  Third video chats dramatically reduce our usual mobility  That's true when I'm on the phone a lot of times I will walk around I find myself so much  I look up and suddenly I'm outdoors. I don't know how that happened  So I don't know what the fix is except to move the camera farther away so that you can move around  maybe he says pace and doodle and  Finally the cognitive load is much higher in video chats  During long stretch of medians give yourself an audio only break turn off your camera  So you don't have to you you don't have to be non verbally active that is true  I've seen I saw a tick-tock where a woman was on a zoom meeting a very lively and so as soon as she closed  It was like oh

Transcript:  What's wrong with this Alex

Start time: 508.98
End time: 537.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I mean I think that fundamentally and and to be fair to to the researcher is that he does say in there that this is  Theoretical like he doesn't this isn't like they did a bunch of research  Do the right research at a full level most of this isn't peer-reviewed this is a bunch of ideas  He calls the Zeph scale the zoom exhaustion and fatigue scale right well and they and and you look at when you want to  Talk about bias confirmation. This is like a textbook of bias confirmation. How much do you hate your zoom meetings?

Start time: 543.16
End time: 596.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the the problem the problem really is is that so we saw my background is that we've done  In the last decade written over 2,000 events, you know over a thousand of them for Google doing hangouts in the early days  Almost all video right all video. No, no all we've done  I mean, I've done a lot of other things we streamed, you know, I oh and Facebook F8 and stuff like that  but but we but the the  A  Lot of the vast majority of the work that I work on is only using online tools whether it's Skype or zoom or  Hangouts before that and all these other things is using these tools to allow people to build these meetings that occur all over the world  They're global what we call centerless events. They don't have any there's nobody anywhere, you know  The speakers are somewhere in the world. I think that's part of the world is this kind of well  Did D cut decoupled from the earth feeling well, I I we we look at it as not being constrained by time and space

Start time: 606.74
End time: 616.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, but I mean the the you know as someone who's worked on virtual events and physical events for the last two decades  Physical events are really exhausting

Start time: 616.92
End time: 622.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For the events, yeah, I mean just ask do a questionnaire after CES what talk about yeah tea exactly

Start time: 623.86
End time: 756.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's exhausting and and and the thing is is that what so we've we've prepped over 6,000 participants  And I mean that that means that those are people that are actually talking interacting with each other  And so a lot of the stuff that he's that they're talking about here is kind of absurd  And so the from someone who actually does it not someone who has a bunch of good ideas based on things that they thought  and  And so you know they have a great sorry dr. Bailenson. I'm sorry. They have a strong. I know they have a pretty  diploma, but but the thing is is that there's actual feel that you know field work that's actually useful and so  So the from the field work the real the biggest thing is is solving a bunch of there are etiquette issues of how you manage  A room and so on so forth, but the primary things that change the comfort of zoom  The zoom experience is your technical setup, so if you if people in the in the room  Improve their audio first just don't sound bad don't sound echoey don't sound far away  And that's like a $30 fix. There's like $30 mics  It's like 80% of it will just get fixed  Then internet like Wi-Fi is the devil like for this kind of thing why I was not built for this  So as you know the first thing you do when you get somebody on it's like let's get him off a Wi-Fi  Do you have an ethernet and we when we're prepping people we're like hey, how far away is your router and they're like?  Oh, it's 75 feet. We're like okay. We'll send you a cable  You know and and and so because Wi-Fi Wi-Fi affects it then then after that lighting and then video and then their environment  And when you start to fix those things and most of those are not particularly complex fixes  They can be only my fix is complex  But the for the small kits that we send out the the thing we send out probably 50 to 60 kits of a week  I'm sorry month 50 60 kits a month  They're relatively small fixes and what happens is suddenly people you know they look good  People get tired of looking at themselves because it's like their worst self  It's looking it's down below them looking up their nose with bad lighting of course you don't want to look at that all day  but when you're well lit like I  Probably look two or three times better on zoom than I do in real life  you know so so I don't you know like when you're when you're set up that way you you know you don't necessarily want to  Give that up you know so so I think that that's the you know

Start time: 761.60
End time: 771.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, but again what happens is is that that you get a lot more comfortable with it you get you know you have good  Audio you have good video, and and you actually have better audio and video the fatigue

Start time: 771.64

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 774.66
End time: 793.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean I'm gonna say there is I'm gonna say that there is that but I think there is a  There's a there's an element of zoom fatigue that the article is really kind of missed in its you know  It's looking at  You know it's great to look at the quality and I agree with everything Alex said like my life improved drastically when I got a  Camera that I could look straight into rather than a web camera that was you know

Start time: 793.78
End time: 806.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which by the way is exactly what they tell you not to do you don't want to have  the  Thousands of dollars on making sure that you can do that yeah, yeah

Start time: 806.94
End time: 897.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so I think the the problem that I found with with zoom fatigue which this article completely misses  Which is again  To Alex's point the danger of doing things theoretically rather than practically is that in a world where?  Video is kind of your only form of communication  Then every problem is fixed with a video meeting and the problem is that we have become  completely  Subservient to this idea that every single  Interaction we need to have ends up being a zoom meeting and if you wouldn't you know I know from you know from working in  an office  When you get to talk to your co-workers  You know you have an interaction that is walking past each other in the corridor and you have an interaction  That's like overhearing somebody and then yelling at them across the room and asking what something what there's variety  There's this huge variety, but when you're all you've got is like a zoom call then suddenly everything that you do becomes a zoom  Call and so you completely lack any variety and so I will find that you know in an average day in the office  I might have a chat with someone sat next to me a yell with someone across the room  Stand and work something out over by the coffee machine  You know and lunch with somebody whereas when I'm sat you know in pandemic times with zoom fatigue  It's like I've got a 30-minute meeting with this person on zoom followed by a 20-minute meeting with this person on zoom followed by a  One hour meeting with this person on zoom and it's like every you know  Is a hammer everything looks like a nail and I think that for me is definitely being the real kind of zoom fatigue issue

Start time: 899.76
End time: 1011.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Think will brings up a good point  however inadvertently because when you start talking about zoom there's a cognitive load that goes along with  Having to schedule all of your interactions or having to set up the zoom meeting and then go through the kabuki ritual of  Is your camera on are you mute? Are you not you whereas when you have?  Spontaneous interactions with a co-worker in an office. You don't have to do that amount of work just have a conversation with them  of course and for me  Yeah, good  That's part of it too is when you're in an office like you said there's a lot more shouting across  When somebody's working you're not working. It's a little bit more interstitial. You don't have the work associated with  Having the you don't have the work associated with we've now gotten to point to having a conversation and then there's more paid  to that conversation to  Microsoft research  released some  preliminary findings last summer  This is in their research lab where they found out that people's attention span in  Microsoft Teams meetings tended to flag at about the 35 minute mark and  They had done brain scans and other things to figure out why this is the case and they said it's cognitive overload because  Even when you have people on grids you're still habituated to looking for signals like eye contact or who's talking and  The research has been foundation to some of the ways they've just up the team's experience since but I thought a whole lot about  how over the past six months Microsoft's been paying a lot of attention to the cognitive load that goes along with video meetings and  What are the tech steps to change that?  versus some of the things I found when I interviewed people who are like the answer is to make your meeting shorter and then to get  Up and and move around and do things between those meetings so that you don't feel as if you're just a pair of eyes staring  At a screen for ten hours a day every day speaking is somebody who's been doing this for 15 years

Start time: 1023.80
End time: 1032.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Number one is that I prefer everyone to schedule stuff  If you don't know me like if you check you call my call my phone  It basically tells you you need to email or text me or I want I'm gonna pick up the phone

Start time: 1033.52
End time: 1042.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like I don't wanna Alex I don't want that you and I are pretty naturally suited for this environment  Yeah, it's as if we were born with zoom gills. Yeah

Start time: 1043.22
End time: 1104.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But but but the thing is is that so for instance  There's a lot of but we did a bunch of I eye tracking research and this is did you wow?  Yeah, this is this is a decade ago  so we were looking at training and when people start paying attention and these are in these very early Webex and so on so forth and  One of the things that we found is that if you stalks if you talk straight for six and a half minutes about it's about  Six and a half minutes people stop paying attention. Yeah, that's about right. Yeah, they don't leave they just start looking around  Yeah, they was they zone out you start sounding like  If you put up a slide it's 60 to 90 seconds yikes stop paying attention and so  So we learned very quickly to get rid of the slides because they were just destroying people's view time  And you're getting put into passive mode almost immediately  The the thing is is that one of the things is it's a matter of how people are engaged  So one of the things that we you know, we I have a meeting every morning  seven days a week

Start time: 1105.18
End time: 1111.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That lasts anywhere from two to five hours. Is this office hours or is this another meeting? No, it's office office hours

Start time: 1112.60
End time: 1150.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's two to three hundred people that show up for at least two hours. I mean our average view time is 82 minutes  the  The energy at the end of the meeting is generally as high or higher than the beginning of the meeting after  You know two hours the official meeting and then there's two hours before that. That's the unofficial meeting and one hour after that  That's another official meeting where people keep talking  And so, you know, so I when I hear the whole 35 minute thing, it's cute  But it's like like we do this for a long period of time and we do it every single day and people are engaged  You know your experience today. We did eight hours eight hours straight. You're just not in it breaks

Start time: 1150.60
End time: 1168.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but you're  you're just nuts, but your experience is a little different too because  From your point of view you're doing a show aren't you don't you feel like you're doing a show like you're hosting  Like I'm doing a show right now, right?  Right, but but it's a discussion experience, but that's a completely different experience than sitting in a zoom meeting

Start time: 1169.16
End time: 1196.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which is absolutely draining. Well, it's but it's how you it's how you how you structure that zoom meeting, you know  So one of the things we do is we do almost no  There's almost no lecturing. There's no long talking. There's no presentations  we deliver that ahead of time like, you know, you just you get that ahead of time and then you  And then you you know, then we discuss it so everything's about discussion, right, you know, and so and that's what I think it's

Start time: 1196.92

Transcript:  Mean it is as you know as single people during the pandemic  You're a looking for anybody to talk to you that isn't a co-worker or a member of your family  But the you know, it definitely gets weird when you're you know  The zoom fatigue gets really weird when you're when you are trying to you know, the whole thing that you know  Like make eye contact look at the other person  But then you look like an absolute creeper zoid if you're just doing that the whole time on zoom

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  On the other side of it on the other side of it, you know  One of the things that makes our our discussion so interesting though  Is that you know, we have basically we represent five or six continents every day  it is  It's 25 people basically talking with you know, or in front of 200 or 300 people and  It's a meeting that could not happen in the physical world like it's impossible like to have it and that's what's and that's what's coming  It's not that physical is gonna go away  It's just that giving people telling people to do things like turn off your camera  Look, we can decide whether that's good or bad, but it's kind of when you turn off your camera in the middle of a meeting  It's kind of a slap in the face for everybody else and and so and and and whether you mean it that way or not  That's how it occurs, you know  And and so the thing is is that telling people to do things that of course is better for their personal space and all that  But you do have to pay attention to how  There's a culture that you're that you're going to that you're telling people to go against that isn't going to change like that culture is  Not going to adjust itself. It's not gonna be okay

Transcript:  If this is a generational thing because I've noticed just from a lot of firsthand observation that the  young people  Children and teenagers have a very different relationship to zoom and physical representation and avatars and  I would argue that schoolwork is the same as going to an office for us at some place where they're expected to be and to turn  In a high level of performance every day  But these social expectations and the conventions seem to be very different and it's been really interesting seeing how few of them will  Pop on camera unless they're absolutely required to what grade is your daughter in?

This is our way of life, and so it's a very different experience  I think there are a lot of people who say  Well of course now I have to say I'm looking at dr. Balenson's survey  And the questions are things like how much do you dread having to do things after video conferencing?  Do you feel like doing nothing?

Do you have put on makeup?  No, no well for for the high-end kits that we send out we send out mattify.

It was a very successful  Pandemic for zoom they were probably the single company that did the best. I'm curious why you guys think that zoom I mean  You write about Microsoft Lisa.

Start time: 1840.18
End time: 1889.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I mean, it's kind of baffling that Google did not immediately scale up their stuff to appear especially to appeal to the educational districts  Because if you look at how fast zoom managed to get itself  embedded right in  Virtually every school system in the United States and they managed to do so in a matter of weeks and  This is it was an amazing market opportunity for them  and the thing is is that Google already had tremendous incursions in US education between the Chromebooks that are cheap and accessible and  And something that you can out out fit an entire school district with or Google classroom  which is what a lot of school districts use anyway to  To do assignments and collaborate with so it's a little baffling to me  But zoom just happened to be in the right place at the right time  It's easy to get started and what a lot of people needed last March was something where all they had to do was click and go

Start time: 1895.10
End time: 2026.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The irony of course is that the the the reason Google is so far behind  Is because they wanted to make it easier to get started so they they basically so, you know zoom  I mean hangouts was very basic in 2011  Then got built up and you know, and they kept on adding more features  They had an API and we built tools that actually tied into it  So we had tools that took over the hangout and turned it into entirely different thing much like zoom has with things like zoom OSC  but the  Then what happened was Google decided they made a shift after they closed g-plus. They basically just gutted  Hangouts, you know, they just they just ripped everything out of it. Oh, yeah, it's insanely bad  It's insanely bad but you know five or six years ago  but but they were so far ahead and they were they they had and they had you know spent  incredible amounts of money going down that path and  All they had to do is keep going that direction. There was a lot of us that were you know had  we're doing a lot of hangouts, you know, like, you know, three to five a week for different companies and  And we were just like this is what you need to do. You need to build this you need to build this  This is how you do it  You can take over the world and and they just completely went the other direction and and gutted it  So when it happened the real issue is is that they didn't have things like the grid view and they didn't have all the back-end  Tools that they had had in the past  But but the thing about zoom is that it's really really easy to get started  but it is deep like if you go into the when you go as an as a  Administrator of zoom when you go into them the the settings you have so much control and  And you can turn intricate control of what people can do and what they can't and how they do it and whether it's you know  What's being recorded and what's not being recorded and how it's being put together  So on this what they've done really well is they have this the situation on the surface  That's like I can just turn it on and go and I can send someone a link and they can just go and everything just  Happens really easily but when you want to turn up all the quality knobs turn up all the other bits and pieces you can  And that's what you can't do in teams. You can't do in in  In  Hangouts or meet you can't those are the only ones that really matter right the rest of them are just they missed the boat  I mean like go to meeting in Webex and  chime

That's gonna be cool  Our show today brought to you by extra hop  First there was solar winds the Sunburst attack a real wake-up call to a changing threat landscape  Then on Tuesday Microsoft announced  For zero days  attacking exchange server in fact Microsoft  Is now admitting that about 30,000 organizations were hacked by according to Brian Krebs a particularly aggressive  Chinese espionage agency  but the worst thing you can imagine and  And unfortunately you this may be the circumstance you're in is an advanced threat actor who's already inside  The network and has been sitting there for a long time  When criminals get past your defenses businesses need a plan for detection and response that old model of  Protection and prevention alone is no longer enough. They're inside the house  Fortunately, there's extra hop reveal X  It's the only solution that shows you not just where intruders are going but where they've been  So you can investigate incidents and prevent them from turning into full-blown?  Breaches when cyber attacks make the news the first question security teams need to answer is  Have we been compromised right now?  there are a lot of people running exchange servers who are dying to know and  Actually, I think it Krebs said the chances are if you were running an exchange server  And you didn't get patched on Tuesday you are compromised now you need extra hop reveal X  It makes it super simple to find out if you've been compromised 90 days of record  Look back and complete network visibility across the data center  But also through the cloud and all the way to the device edge  Which lets your security team get to real answers fast in a post-compromise world your greatest chance at stopping advanced threats is  With extra hop network detection and response and DR extra hop is an amazing tool  I want you to go to the website. There's an interactive demo then you can see what extra hop looks like  you know part of the reason it looks so good is because  You'll be able to respond faster if you can grok the information faster, and that's exactly what extra hop does extra hop.com  Slash twit stop advanced threats take a look at the amazing  Interactive demo and find out how extra hop stops breaches 84% faster and helps you figure out who's inside  the house extra hop comm slash to it we thank extra hop so much for  supporting  This week in tech we thank you for supporting it by going to that site extra hop comm  Slash twit we should talk about this Microsoft  Zero day what terrible news I'm sure Lisa your day was kind of busy on Tuesday  covering this

You don't need any special knowledge  You just show up and say I would like to break in and read all their email. That's all there is  to it  Microsoft says it's a Chinese espionage group that's been dubbed hafnium  And their  Krebs says very aggressive

Start time: 2620.02
End time: 2638.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean initially they went for high-value targets as they call them, you know government governments or financial institutions  And then the hack widened considerably  Wow, and it just appears at this point  It's a matter of we can get in so we will and we'll get the data and we'll see if it's useful later

It's not the it's not the hack where you're trying to you know  Cyber warfare hack the nation state might try to bring down a grid. It really looks like kind of  kind of dog food  Espionage like just getting in, you know, let's find out what's going on and maybe we can use it that kind of thing

Start time: 2665.28
End time: 2696.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, there's there's two ways in which this hack is super useful. And the first is yes  It's an info. It was an information gathering expedition. It was it was a great way to figure out  What works and how and what the scale and scope is so they now know a whole lot more  About the US about the global digital landscape than they did before they successfully hacked it  And the second way it's useful is it's wearing down the resources and the energy and the attention  That people who fight hacking are gonna have because we've had so many major briefs

Start time: 2696.90
End time: 2729.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So many major figure out of solar winds hit you now all of a sudden your exchange  Here's a here's a Krebs quote quotes one source  It's police departments hospitals tons of city and state governments and credit unions  Just this is the quote that scares the hell out of me just about everyone who's running self-hosted Outlook web access  Yeah, and didn't get patched on Tuesday has been hit with a zero day attack  And the chances are what they do is they put a little web server on your system and the chances are  It's there. Yeah

Start time: 2731.28
End time: 2799.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you can't just you can't just run the patch the thing is is you're gonna have to lay through your compromised  Well, not just that but even if you were to patch it now  you're gonna have to go through and rebuild your system from from the ground up because you just don't know what got injected you don't know what's  logging what and  you don't know what other vulnerabilities you have and  The thing that honestly scares me a little bit more is they've automated the attacks  This is not just a bank of people who are you know looking cool and cackling and ha ha I'm into the system  like they've written bots that can now just  That can now perpetuate these these huge attacks on a scale that we haven't seen before and  again  This is if you're on if you're on this I were like, oh, this is interesting  It's a great way to wear down someone's defenses over time because even if you find and block or find and stop  These bugs it's like the velociraptors in Jurassic Park. They're just testing the fence for weakness and sooner or later  they're gonna find a spot that that  Well, it's the fence. Oh, you know the fence little holds for so long, right?

Start time: 2799.54
End time: 2867.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean also the being able to build the interconnections for spearfishing is really useful  So if you have all that data, you now know how people are interrelated to that's a good point  and so when you  so now it's why like when people at school send me like  Send me emails to all the parents without buying, you know without a blind CC you get this email back for me like hey  That wouldn't be a good idea that we should avoid that. Oh my god. Yeah, that is  Because that connection now is made so now someone can go hey  This is Judy from the school and you know, so now they're you know, because all almost all hacking is really  Yeah, it's all social hacking. You know, it's  It's all organic  Organic firewall failure and  So the  so that you know  you knowing how people are interrelated and knowing what they think is okay and what they and  Coming to them from something that seems familiar is a big piece of how this gets  You know prop how you get into a company later and you may not know what that is  But 30,000, you know millions of people and knowing how they're really interrelated  Is a treasure trove, you know  Yeah, Wow

Start time: 2868.56
End time: 2897.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The other thing I'd like to point out with this is Microsoft's messaging upfront was  They've had a couple good points not a couple good points, but what's in that seems like an editorializing  I'm not trying to editorialize here. They've had a couple  They've tried to stick with it just the facts that just a facts approach which is refreshing because they're not obfuscating  Too much on it. But one of the things I do think is notable is they're very much in the oh, by the way  If you have any of our cloud-based services, you're absolutely not affected

Transcript:  but one of the things this does point out that I don't think a lot of people in the US really think about is a  Lot of our infrastructure everything from transit to utilities to hospitals to you know  Like you said local governments to schools districts all of those places have tiny IT budgets comparatively speaking and  They don't have a whole lot of money to be perpetually upgraded to the latest or greatest things  And so a lot of our country is running on systems that are not updated as often as vendors would recommend and do not  Enjoy the level of technical support that would seem prudent  You know, we're looking at a real infrastructure tech infrastructure issue here in terms of funding and deployment. So  You know for all this is a Microsoft bug. This is also

That's one of the complaints people have about almost all of these  Apps they immediately ask for access to your contact list  We just want to let you know when somebody you know is on Clubhouse or is joining Clubhouse  We just want to it's for you.

Oh  How about this Grimes made five point million dollars in under 20 minutes selling crypto based artwork  We've been talking a lot about NFTs. In fact  My friend Trey Ratcliffe the photographer is gonna join this week in Google on Wednesday because he's selling some of his works  via NFTs he even gave me one and  And I thought I'd have him explain  What's going on with this? We also covered it. And of course even Thursday even better is

Transcript:  Clearly the people are spending this money. They're not getting anything  You can print a copy of Jack Dorsey's tweet anybody can or of the neon cat or even of Grimes artwork  It's digital. So it's perfectly copyable. You can have a copy of it. That's not what they're getting  They're getting a certificate signed by the original author that says we were sort of saying that you own that thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you might do you might hang it on what you might put even when you tweet and say like I own this tweet  You know and sure I can print it a bunch of times  But I can literally prove that I own it and it's this really interesting shift  In a way, it's it's kind of like the inverse of what we've seen across the rest of media  Which is you know when you subscribe to Spotify or when you subscribe to Apple music or even if you buy  Tracks from Apple, right? You never actually get to own those tracks  You only ever have you know, it's like that thing of what happens to my iTunes account when I die  You know, nobody can inherit my music in the way that they can inherit my CDs  So in a way what they're actually what people are doing now with NFTs is flipping that on its head and saying yeah  Okay, the thing might be infinitely copyable because it's digital  But actually you can own the actual thing  And pass it on and I think that links into you know  I think the NFT piece from from Jack Dorsey at Twitter links really neatly into the fact that square  Square this week announced it was buying tidal right the jay-z  Music yeah music which looks really which looks like a really really really weird thing for a payments processor to do  Until you think okay  Well, however artists gonna make money in the future when touring is restricted and streaming roles either minor

You know any art any any band in the world can sell  You know the copy of a track or the copy, you know  You can sell your actual music and so I think  you know, I think that the whole square title thing is a is a whole play for an extension of  Music beyond what we think of music being right now.

Yeah  And I think that I think that the the other thing is is there's limited editions  It doesn't have to be you know, you could theoretically not have it be the only one that you're selling that's for five million or whatever  but what if you're able to  You know sell a limited edition album, you know for title where people have the limited edition  It might be a collector's item. There's only 1500 printed or a thousand printed quote unquote digitally printed  I mean if you you know, and and I'm not a collector so it's not really something that sinks into me  I barely keep the stuff I should keep let alone  That doesn't have any I don't think these people are

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I think what we're seeing is in the digital age is like, okay  We're starting to experiment with what does real digital ownership look like  Like as Alex says you can buy as many posters of Mona Lisa as you want  There's value in having the actual one. Well, what if you know, I can listen to as many  Grimes songs as I want but I own the original master, you know, but you don't you don't own

End time: 3688.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not what's being sold. It's not the master. It's it's it's  It's it's it's this kind of intangible thing that I own the NFT  It's not it's very odd and I think it's purely speculative Seth Godin makes a very good point in his blog  He says NFTs are a dangerous trap like most traps  They're mysterious then appealing and then it's too late and his argument is not that it's silly or it's foolish  But because it's based on blockchain  It is a horrendous and really kind of at this point given climate change  untenable use of energy for  Absolutely nothing

Transcript:  No, the art was made the arts independent of the NFT  He says the rest of us are gonna pay for NFTs for a very long time  They use an astonishing amount. This is the NFT not the artwork an astonishing amount of electricity to create and to trade  Together they're already using more than is consumed by some states in the United States  Imagine building a giant new power plant just to make Christie's or the Basel Art Fair  Function and the amount of power wasted will go up commensurate with their popularity and value because that's how it's designed  The short version is that for the foreseeable future the method that's used to verify the blockchain and to create new digital coins is  Deliberately energy intensive and inefficient. It's on purpose  The energy use will go up and not down and that's I have to say he's got a very good point  Societally, I don't know if you know, this is such a great idea

Transcript:  But then you make a good point against blockchain, right? You might as well. Yeah, it is  Crypto and yeah, it's equally dumb completely unethical.

But I but I  Like I just like it's it's a it feels absurd at the moment  I know that we're gonna come back to this episode a year from now and be like I can't believe we said that but  You know like this was of course the future but I can't see it because I don't but I don't  I would never buy a feels like the early days of Bitcoin

Oh, yeah, of course  That's gonna mean something  But we just can't quite see it yet

Transcript:  I think it's people are definitely grappling with how do we  You know, we are moving towards a society that is going to buy less things better buy less physical things  So while we're talking about the energy impact of NFT or all these other things, we are going to buy less things  we're buying more things for we're spending more of our  Flexible income on things that are on our phones that are that are media that are you know  All that money is going to things that are intangible. And so I think that there is a you know, that's that's already kind of  happening  the  The interesting thing is is that then you have artists and people making things got to figure out how you get into that market  How do I become part of that market if I you know and to some degree the fine art market has always been a little bit

Transcript:  I agree and I think a lot of people and I think back to the you know, the generational thing a lot of younger people  Are used to buying stuff that is completely intangible, you know, they've grown up it, you know, one of the things that  The  Seth Godden actually notes in his in his in his blog is that you know, it's as pointless as Pokemon cards and it's like  Oh, sorry, we all grew up  Some of us grew up  And they're still worth

Thank you zip recruiter for supporting this week in tech. Thank you for supporting us dear listener by using that special URL  By the way, we're gonna be selling NFTs for all my ad reads at the end of the show. So line up  Doesn't it don't you feel like gosh? I wish I could figure out a way to capitalize  On this I mean  It just seems hit or miss it seems weird. I don't get it  one thing  You won't be buying will is your is a 27 inch iMac, right?  Or at least the pro one right Mac iMac Pro. Yeah, I have one on my desk  Apple has confirmed  It's been discontinued when supplies run out. They're gonna stop selling it now. There are two ways to look at that one is  In fact, they're pointing people to the latest 27 inch iMac that the the non pro iMacs are so good  You don't need an iMac Pro. I choose  to interpret it that  Apple's gonna do a  M1 or M something version of the iMac Pro sooner than later you think Alex  Yeah  Thank you

Transcript:  The the  The M series chips and the entire infrastructure is so advanced that there is not any reason for them  I think that they just need to I mean that they're obviously gonna have to decide as they how they're turning all these things down  In that in that process, but they're no longer trying to kind of clump together  This kind of hodgepodge of hardware that that you know to make it as good as they can it's I don't I  Think that there's going to be something that has a screen probably another next iMac will most likely just be way more powerful than the  iMac Pro whenever that comes out whether it's I think that's part of the problem

Start time: 4328.36

Start time: 4343.12
End time: 4359.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm starting to think an all-in-one is not a good idea  Because one of the problems I have with my iMac Pro is then I'm stuck with that screen, which is fine  It was fine in 2017. It's a very good screen, but there are other form factors. I'd like to look at  I like to look at a 59 inch curved wide screen perhaps

Start time: 4359.82
End time: 4392.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's that's why we invest in those in the Mac minis is because you have so much  Capability in them and we can put any kind of monitors and or any sets of you know at least two monitors easily  six of you get really creative  but but you  That it makes it really really easy that said I really do like the fact that I can just pick up a whole computer  And set it somewhere or hang it somewhere, and it's just the whole thing is all there  And I don't have to figure out how I'm gonna wire it all together  So I think there's an advantage to having a screen that has that has a computer in it as well  Not if it's a long-term hold for you yes, definitely

Start time: 4393.58
End time: 4478.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there's definitely  Something you know the all-in-one form factor that Apple is now pioneered for for years since the original original iMac Wow is  You know is clearly incredibly convenient, but it's it's definitely got a  usage  Cap right so one of the things I notice  I  particularly where I where I work where we're in a shared working space where everybody's a startup  Not a single right there's not a single desktop computer like in the in the building because  everybody has a  27 inch monitor for you know 4k monitor on their desk and  An Apple laptop. I mean also nobody has windows laptops, but you know you have a you have a  MacBook Air or a MacBook Pro and a and a monitor  And a keyboard and you pick it up and take it between wherever you want and  That is sort of the ultimate all-in-one form factor and what I'm you know  I think what a lot of pros are looking for is not an iMac Pro with a with an m1  It's the it's the mega MacBook Pro with an m1. You know a nice. I've got the 16 inch  MacBook Pro at the moment, and it's it's such a beautiful and fantastic machine, but with an m1  And it would just be like unstoppable, so that's what I'm holding out hope for I'm hoping this year  Alex am I gonna get one this year?

I wouldn't be surprised  I don't have any you know I mean I the the  The interesting thing will be to see where they take the chips is it gonna be a m1x or m2 or you know that those  types of things and because some of the rumors are the  The bigger chips are have a lot of cores

I mean they don't need the money, but they like the IMAX sales  They like it. I mean the thing is what I mean at this point  They're spending most of their money giving it back to investors, you know, and so so the  So the thing is is that they the IMAX sales are such a small part of their I mean  It's just a tiny little sliver of income that they can afford to just do it as a  from a point of view of we don't want people to be upset that they bought something that  You know, I think it does signal to us that they think the next IMAX will be considerably faster than the IMAX Pro is today  Yeah, yeah  I think that's I mean  I think that's a pretty good signal that they don't want you to  Keep buying that thinking it's a pro and spending a ton of money when one's gonna come out for  $3,000 that is screaming like ten times faster or five times faster or whatever.

Transcript:  well that links really interestingly as well to the you can call this good news or bad news depending on your point of view the fact that  My my home gaff in the UK has just opened up an antitrust probe into the facts  Right. The app store is a completely closed walled garden and you can't do anything with it. Yeah  Which is a which is going to be a big thing over here the UK has now announced antitrust probes into  Competition for both Google and Apple in the last six months now, so  Definitely definitely locks to examine  You know, there's an interesting two different ways of looking at it. So as a percentage of all devices sold  I think iPhones were what 16% of all mobile devices sold last year  So it's really easy to walk to a competition regulator and say well actually we're not  There's no competition problem. Yeah, we're  15% there's hey you want an open app store  There's 84% of all the devices in the world you can go and have an open app store on but of course they are  the app store for 100% of Apple  Right, so that's like a bit of a monopoly

Transcript:  Yeah, I think that that's gonna be the in the United States  It doesn't have a chance but in the it like it will never go anywhere  But in the UK and the EU it might you know and because they have a much different set of rules that are you know  The United States if you don't  Separating the iPhone from phones is going to be very hard in the United States, you know  they look the same they may largely operate the same it's gonna be hard to get a  Octarian to think that that's they're two different things  And so so I think that there's that's gonna be the real challenge in the US  But I do think that that Apple and I do think Apple's  Biggest market risk for the next decade is antitrust because they're pulling away like they're just pulling away in a stunning fashion  I mean if you look at the M1 if you look at the the I while the store is a minority of the  and this is where people will start pushing back is that the store is a is a  Very small minority of all the sales  But it's a huge majority of all the purchases like all the money spent is in the store  And so so it's it's it has a different, you know impact there  But in all in all areas, you know Apple seems to be running, you know at all cylinders, you know  And they have the they're they're moving  Ahead like you would as a startup  But they have the size of one of the largest companies in the world and that's eventually that's gonna catch up with them  You know, like it's gonna be a cool. She got to look at it

Start time: 4908.30
End time: 4956.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you got to look at the fact that it was  There is a as well as the UK antitrust probe which which kicked off this week  There is an existing EU antitrust probe which which kicked off last year and you've got to look back at the history of you know  You you know, you've got a look at micro the Microsoft precedent and say look  How hard was it to say?  You know you you can explore you can install any internet browser on a on a Microsoft computer  But the web browser is inextricably linked to the Microsoft experience  Well, the EU didn't mind sort of ripping that out whenever that was 20 years ago  So you've got to wonder if the you know  And that led the lever the door open for everybody else to come in  So you've got to wonder if if we're gonna be beating itself.

He's actually advocated the breakup of both Google and Facebook  so I think if I'm in the headquarters at  Google or Facebook or Amazon, I'd be a little bit nervous about this move  Go ahead

Transcript:  Lisa yeah, this this has been coming for years though because you've they  The last 18 months in Congress you've had these CEOs repeatedly called up before Congress to explain  everything from how they collect data to  What kind of speech they allow on their platforms to are they or are they not concerned that?  Are you concerned that you're too big for the market which you know, no CEO in the right mind is gonna say yeah  I really do think about that a lot  and  There has been a narrative developing in Washington that  Has been you know aided and abetted by books like Tim Wu's which is a good book. I've read the book  And the narrative  That is being shaped is along the lines of we'd love the tech companies because they've been the engine of the the engines for the US  stock markets people get rich off the tech companies, but  What is what have the trade-offs been and are these tech companies actually making people's lives worse in?  Ways that translate to their bottom line to their paycheck and the there are begin that there  There is a growing body of evidence. This is yes. These these tech companies do act in ways that can  Significantly affect how people make money and you're gonna have enough Congress people who are like, yes, this is a populist cause

Transcript:  Let's go for it. It's I think that for Facebook and Google it's more challenging. I think that  It's more challenging for Facebook and Google for Apple  I think the problem is is that Apple now is essentially pushing money back to its shareholders and those shareholders are not just  You know Warren Buffett there. I mean, you know that these are a lot of members of Congress probably well  It's well, it's it's an awful lot of my my my uncle-in-law has like I don't know how many shares of Apple  He bought in the late 90s, right? You know, and so everybody's for  Right. Yeah, and so and therefore one case and all their and all the Apple employees that that that are in the in the you know  Distribution and there's so there's millions and millions of people that are affected by that and you know  If things start to become something more tense, I mean because Apple is literally putting it's not that it's not that oh  You're riding that stock Apple is actively  But giving out dividends and I mean huge I mean hundreds of billions of dollars back to their shareholders  So they really rep more than probably any company in the history of the world  represent their stock or  Like that they're pushing money out away because they don't they already have enough cash, you know  And so and so that's an and you know a big reason that a company does that is is employee retention  You've got to keep your stock increase the value of your stock

Transcript:  System that has to be broken down exactly right Lisa. You're exactly right because the the reason Facebook  Looks like the easiest sacrificial lamb is because it's literally the easiest to break up  Like if you look at Apple you go  Well, what am I gonna take am I gonna stop them selling?  iPhones and computers or am I gonna stop them selling apps on the phone if you look at Google you go, okay  Well, maybe I can try and make chrome not the default thing  But actually if you stop chrome if you stop Google search being the default you kill Firefox and then you know that kills competition  And in that market, whereas actually if you look at Facebook you just go. Oh Facebook is Facebook Instagram and WhatsApp  Oh, let's just make they were three companies. Let's just make them three companies again  Yeah, and it looks like a really easy way to break up something enormous. Yeah

Oh, yeah, which  He wants a do-over now and and maybe they weren't they shouldn't have been so  Welcoming of these mergers. I do feel with you at least that Amazon is is  Perhaps the one you most want to break up, but I think it's a lot harder because so many of us are  Fans right we use it non-stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really interesting argument around Amazon's this I mean, there's a couple of really interesting arguments around Amazon one is  Amazon could be the only company that increased in market value if you split it up  So if you took AWS out of Amazon as a business, it would be one of the top ten  NASDAQ companies on its own and you go actually  That could be a situation where like one plus one actually equals three  Because I've suddenly got two mega growth businesses rather than one that's kind of being hidden within another and then I think if you look at  The case for Amazon antitrust in general  You know, you've got two different ways of back to the back to the framing question. We came back to earlier  I which is it so Amazon has about 40% of e-commerce  Which obviously looks enormous but about 10% of retail compared to Walmart Costco any other retailer in Britain  You know globally so as a case of like well, which is it?  Is it a 40% player or is it a 10% player?  And then you go well actually it owns something like 85% of book sales you go  Well, do I stop Amazon selling books but let it sell everything else like fashion where it's got, you know  Almost no foothold whatsoever  So, you know where you would you know, Amazon can clearly be split into a retail and non retail business  but how you  regulate the retail part of the business looks really interesting given  The way that you frame it it can be either enormous or tiny and  We depending on what sector you're looking at. It's got completely different shares across all these different things  well

Start time: 5484.09
End time: 5540.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and and also  you know  we have to also acknowledge that some of the efficiencies that we have and some of the what we  Have here is because of the size because of the efficiencies that are there in these large companies  They are gonna get to a point where we need to do something about it  And so that we're trying to figure that out  But we also have to get that part of what makes this work is that that there aren't a thousand players doing it a thousand different ways  you know when we  You know like the the breakup of the bait of the bells didn't really help us  It seemed like it would it just created chaos at a certain time and now it's just AT&T and Verizon all the baby bells are  back into two big companies that are actually bigger as a group than they were before and  their success in that area has  Basically slowed down retarded the entire growth of  broadband and and wireless and everything else has was actually you know  Damaged in a lot of ways that it's unclear that it would have happened in the same way had they been kind of a big oh

She is now senior editor at IT Pro today. Great to have you Lisa  Will Harris his new company is entail. It's a new podcast player with a very clever hook at  Entale calm and of course from office hours and oh nine oh media  Alex  Lindsay  It's it's interesting that at least two of the four sponsors in the show today are security companies  I want to talk a little bit about it, barracuda  That's a name everybody knows for enterprise security  hackers are always looking we were just talking about this for the weakest link in your security configuration and  Often that turns out to be your email security, you know, it's funny  I've been talking about this for months then all of a sudden here's this zero day in  in Outlook web access  Here's the thing if you can find those vulnerabilities you can defend against cyberattacks  That's why barracuda has created a new tool. They call the threat analyzer tool  From traditional malware to the latest spear phishing account takeover and conversation  Hijacking barracuda has identified 13 types of email threats  And and and by the way any one of them can take you down  It takes several different layers of security working together to protect you effectively against all  13 threat types  And if you if there's even one gap  The crooks are gonna find out where you're vulnerable  It's it's literally what they spend their entire day on and some of them nights too when they find that gap in your security  They just need to choose the right type of threat  Customize it get it into your system and cost you millions of dollars your reputation in the market  Here's where it gets hard with hundreds of highly targeted personalized threat variants emerging daily  Including those zero days we saw this week and many different kinds of on-prem and cloud-based email systems  It can be really challenging to identify your specific gaps or vulnerabilities  You know don't just look over the over there and say oh those exchange guys Wow glad they didn't happen to me  You're next that's why you need the barracuda threat analyzer  It's incredibly simple and fast to use if you go to barracuda B a rra  Cuda barracuda comm slash twit answer a few simple multi-choice questions about your email security setup  It only take a couple of minutes barracuda threat analyzer tool will provide a custom report telling you what threat types you're most vulnerable to and I guarantee  You it's been updated in the last couple of days  You'll get custom recommendations on how to strengthen your defenses against those attacks. It's free. It's easy to use. I  Think you really want to check this out  Turns out and this is from December's  barracuda spear phishing report 12% of all spear phishing attacks are business email compromise and that's going up  Dramatically that's that's almost doubled since 2019 that shows you these attacks work. That's why they're being  More and more happening according to the FBI's most recent Internet crime report business email compromise  Led to over three point five billion dollars in losses last year as an example government of Puerto Rico lost two point six million in a  Single attack you might remember  shark tanks Barbara Corcoran  This is this is a really common attack her employees fell for an impersonation attack  They got a fake invoice and paid it wiring a  $400,000 out to the bad guys. They realized what they'd done in time. They got the money back  I wish I could say the same for a school district district in Texas  Which made fraudulent payments over a period of weeks losing two point three million dollars before the attack was discovered money  They'll never get back  Don't let this happen to you if your email security is not protecting you you're vulnerable and I bet you there are areas  You're vulnerable. You need this try it barracuda threat analyzer get a full report.

I think the public saw and  I think the reaction of the public to this  weird burning man  was  Huh?  Is this really what did Microsoft make a mistake here?  This is this is literally how they ended such an Adele the CEO began this keynote Alex Kipman the inventor of HoloLens  invented connect before it or developed connect before it  Showing what the future of Microsoft mesh was HoloLens getting together in virtual world if you get a headache from zoom  Wait, will you wait? Will you go there with no arms and no legs?  Dancing around a digital fire. I don't know. Maybe it's just so I feel like the demo is dumb

Transcript:  Because you'd have like improv which is what this demo clearly needs  but the thing that's great the thing that I find really interesting about HoloLens is it's really going to enhance edge computing and  it's gonna get Microsoft into places where desktop computing and networks don't necessarily go and  The reason I think this is a dumb demo is because you could do something so much cooler  Like have somebody at the bottom of a lake being given instructions on how to  Disassemble something that's down there simply by by using that and to be fair

I  Just think there are just so many better ways of doing  Virtual environments, you know if the point is to show that you know during this, you know, we can all be remotely connected  You know, I have a pretty regular pop-up golf VR  Saturday with to your real my friend and that is you know, we hang out and we  When we play a little bit of golf in in Oculus and it's like a lot less  Weird than whatever that was and I'm pretty sure that technology is a lot cooler  So it seems like they just made the worst of all worlds there purely from a consumer point of view  Lisa I'm sure it has some very good stuff behind it

Transcript:  the problem is is that is that I  Like one of the problems with the state we just the talk of the Stanford article  For a second to tie it back into that they were talking about they're referring back to old studies that they've done  Where they said, okay  well  we put avatars and people looked at the avatars and as soon as they said that I stopped reading like that part because I was  Like avatars don't mean anything because the reason is is that there is so much going on if you if you look at  If you want to kind of get an idea of how far away we are with all the money  We have when you look at the digital doubles inside of you know  some of the Star Wars  sequels where they have the the general or the even even Princess Leia  There is so they are so close and still it's like, oh, that's weird. There's still like any valley there really well  But but and the thing is is that but that is with  Incredible amounts of resources and all the time in the world to render and getting to look at it over and over again doing  That live, you know, we'll see I mean and and again it's it is like the unreal work that's being done right now with  Metahumans is is amazing  but I don't want to have an avatar of me trying to be like that because I know that  sub millimeter movement in my eyes makes a difference to the person on the other side and  And that's why a lot of these kind of second life things don't work as well as just video for the time being  Because it's just every little thing that we do with our face  We're we spend our entire life looking at other people's faces and making decisions by  little things they did with their eyebrows and the way that they did it and again how often they blinked and just  When I squeeze my eyes just a little bit that means something and and so that when we dumb that down  Yeah, it's a dehumanizing experience, you know  And it's going to be until we until we crush it and we we are not gonna crush it for another decade at least  You know like like we're not gonna get to that point where it they'll be outliers that go. Okay, this is really cool  I'm sure people that people are still using second life and there's there's a coolness to it use and but it's there is but  I agree, but it's it's it's gonna be hard to overcome authentic communication  Yes to people that we can see so I think that you know, especially like what we see in in our  In office hours was that there's a big jump when we went to 1080p  You see everybody interest, you know, really and so yeah, so there was so there was a difference in energy  Just be based on the fact that now the people at the far end of the webinar are not looking at you know  640 by 360, you know, and so so I think that there is  We're going to get there I'm not saying that we're not because we absolutely are you know  But we knew that we were gonna get the video to in the 50s  The Jetsons and you know, we knew that this eventually would happen  It just took us a long time to you know, our imagination takes a little while to fulfill

Transcript:  I mean everybody wants to be cool like Apple so much that they just want to put on a great demo and they like how do we  Create that imagination and Apple's pretty conservative about how they do it  And they you know, they they do it inside of a little a little box that that keeps that that's pretty safe and  The problem is that the unfortunate thing is is that Microsoft HoloLens is is just an amazing technology  But it's really in the kind of enterprise world and it should stay there until it's really ready to come out and it was not  It's not ready  And there's nothing wrong with Microsoft being an enterprise focused company

Start time: 6546.96
End time: 6653.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I feel like the thing you should actually pay attention to with Microsoft's keynotes is  They are uncommonly transparent in laying out what their product roadmap is going to be and where they're going to be pushing their customers  And like Nadella always just like lays it right out there  And then all you have to do is watch the company execute like over the next one or two years after every keynote and  You'll see that he basically says okay in in 2015  He said we're mobile first were cloud first  That's it and you can basically pinpoint that moment to when the company put the pedal to the metal on Azure and  Although they rolled out Windows 10 that year  It was also effectively the end of Microsoft as a desktop computing operating system company because they went to continuous operating system updates as opposed to  Really big events and they also started moving away from the computer as the hub of your work  Experience and towards the idea that your cloud of data at how you manipulate it is your computing experience  And then they double down that with digital transformation, and then they're doing it again this year with  The big statements they make about ubiquitous decentralized computing like this is them saying we're gonna own the edge and they're gonna do it  With a lot of the technology aimed at first-line workers. They're gonna do with HoloLens  This also goes into their plan to capitalize on the cloud  This also goes into their plan to capitalize on ambient intelligence  and I just really love how  Nadella finished his comments by taking direct aim at like both Amazon and Facebook without saying a word either  Like if the company would just be like this is what we do. We don't need to be cool  We wouldn't have the need to just cringe with secondhand embarrassment when Burning Man meets second life in the desert

Transcript:  Well, he said okay, so I'm next time we do this  I want you to join us because I watched these Nadella things and it's find it hard to to grab anything concrete  But I did there were three words he used that I thought  Were interesting he mentioned privacy and obviously I think privacy is  Increasingly on everybody's mind. So that's some sensible. He talked about sovereignty  and now  Tell me what he means in about in that in this context about sovereignty does he mean

Start time: 6684.38
End time: 6720.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Respecting national borders so that it's it's compliance. It's basically compliance. Yeah, it's it's basically them saying that  Although they're gonna lead with privacy saying listen our data tools don't expose you and whatever data analysis  We do is anonymized and so on and so forth  What he's also saying when he talks about data sovereignty is he's saying if you store your data in this specific region of the  country world actually  Then we're going to argue that it's only subject to the laws in that region and not to the laws

Start time: 6720.18
End time: 6732.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're trying to enforce in another part of the world. It almost seems like sovereignty and privacy are in conflict because well certainly in the US or China  If if you are adhering to the laws of those countries, you're not gonna have much privacy

Transcript:  On  Microsoft's been battling the US on this for years because the US kept trying to download data that was in an Irish data center  And Microsoft kept saying no the data lives in Ireland  Therefore it's Irish data just because we're an American country company doesn't mean that it's that that we can straw the data to be American

Start time: 6751.64
End time: 6784.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then the third word he used which I thought it was very important and maybe a challenge for Microsoft  But is clearly what Microsoft needs to do is trust  They really yeah, they need to establish  That people can trust them now. I'm not just talking about security flaws, although that's certainly part of it  But but Apple's doing something similar. I don't think they have the sovereignty piece  Yeah, but they talk about privacy and they talk about trust and and and I think that if you're gonna compete against Amazon Google and Facebook  Those are that's a pretty good place to compete from

Start time: 6785.08
End time: 6850.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Privacy and trust right the quote because what he the the context is when he brought up his big trust by design  Point as he said fundamentally a technology provider should succeed only when it helps the world around it succeed  No customer wants to be dependent on a vendor who sells some technology on one end and competes with them on the other  So I thought that his use of the word trust was also a pretty  Interesting signal into the way the company's positioning itself as we're not just a tech company  We recognize that we're part of a larger global society and we're aware that our actions have an impact in the society  So you can trust that when we roll out our products, of course  We're thinking about that whether or not this is true is a completely different issue than how they're positioning it  But I think it's been interesting that saw in Adela has  Consistently talked about how he sees a tech company rising or falling based on  How well they place themselves into the context of a global society and what a global society needs

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It seems do you think is interesting Lisa?  Do you think because when I think about the you know the trust issue and particularly when it comes to Microsoft and  Visa V, you know, as you say Leo, you know, let's compare it to how far do we think about trust compared to Google or Facebook?  I find I find it really interesting that of the four big CEOs  So send up each eye at Google Zuckerberg at Facebook and such a Microsoft and Tim Cook at Apple  Satya is the only one that's written a book  And the only one that's actually put on paper  Anything like a manifesto as to kind of what he thinks and what he stands for and there's something really interesting in that idea of  The fact that in a sense he's he's being you know, and I'm sure you've read his book  It's an absolutely fantastic read whether you're working a big company or trying to I mean it's absolutely  For a Microsoft book, you know transformed how I think about startups  But it's fascinating that he's the only person that's been that transparent and is the one person that's harping on about  Trust in a world where you don't really know anything about you know, Zuckerberg or Sundar or  You know a little bit about Tim Cook, but there's not even there's not even a biography really of Tim Cook

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and Brant's and Brad Smith who's Microsoft's chief legal counsel  Has also written a pretty good book about what he perceives the upcoming legal and technological challenges in the next few years is  To address the point what makes Nadella stand apart from the other CEOs  Part of me wonders how much of it  Because I don't know. I don't know how much of it is character  You know simply this is who he is and how much of it is. This is a really smart market positioning strategy  Because you don't have a lot of other big enterprise companies  I sit through a lot of keynotes from a lot of big vendor conferences and big tech conferences every year and  Although you know you can practically set up the bingo card with transform the world change the world for the better  There's like all of these phrases where the pot that it's always technology is the solution to the problem. We see this  But what I find really interesting is how Nadella consistently comes back to themes like we need to make sure that there's  economic there there's economic opportunity for all that tech doesn't just continue to concentrate wealth in some areas in some countries and he  Comes back to that over and over again, and then he talks about how  He wants to see tech as something that empowers people as a tool in greater social transformation  And so part of me is like is this just a really canny CEO who sees which way the the the  Winds are blowing with regards to how governments all around the world are looking at tech companies and going  Maybe we should start taking a look at how well our laws are serving us regarding the way these guys do business and how it impacts the rest  The rest of our markets you could almost say the same thing about Tim Cook

Transcript:  Yeah, where you look at it you go this looks like a man of integrity and honesty  It could just be a marketing stance, but but I think there's a there's a lot of similarity between the two  Because they also had the unenviable task of trying to keep a company

Transcript:  Yeah, we're trajectory after following behind the founder. Yeah, yeah, and although people say well there was Steve Ballmer Ballmer  Was like Ballmer was basically one of the Bill Gates apparatus right?  Nadella is is the first one to arguably come in and he's done a great job as to cook actually exactly. Yeah, and I  Think for all of these companies their their public persona is going to become more and more important and probably for every every company

Start time: 7077.52
End time: 7185.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know your public persona how your how you're seen by your users by the government's whether you're making a positive impact on the world  I think that there was a belief a decade ago that all you have to do is make good products like your products  Serve the world that Steve jobs point of view. Yeah. Yeah and and Oracle, you know, Ellison was kind of is it  You know as purported that as well and that you know, that's that's their job  And I think that now a lot of companies are gonna have to figure out ways to do more and that might be  How what they do as far as a as a public citizen what they support Apple spent is spending a hundred million dollars on  Diversity they could spend more and and they probably will and so but moving the world  Forward and I think that they need to do a lot more of that  Because that will if they do it in a way that at least feels authentic  Even inauthentic will do will help them. But like I mean you look at like  It's different in the like in the United States. Coca-Cola is not that big of a deal. I mean it is it's a big deal  In the United States Coca-Cola is not that big of a deal  I mean it is it's a big company, but it's not like a brand that you wear on a sweatshirt  You know like that you were you know, like most people wouldn't wear like a nice fleece with a coca-cola  But coca-cola seen that way in in Africa when I'm in Africa  Yeah, coca-cola provides water and they provide signs and they provide they do all the stuff that is part of the community and  And people like I asked someone like they had a really nice fleece and pretty wealthy person in Zimbabwe and he you know  And I said, so do you work for coca-cola and he like no  But he has a nice nice sweater and it's nice  Yeah, but but he had they did but but we don't but their brand doesn't feel that way anymore  I think that more and more brands have to think about how do I how do we get to that point because

Transcript:  Well, and I think that I think that also in an age where advertising is gonna be less and less effective  you know, so so advertising is good so they have to figure out a way and I think that the move that we're talking about of  A community based marketing community based sales is gonna be more and more and more important  You have to get people into a community and and have them part of of what you're doing and you have to figure out  How you serve that community effectively?  to you know to  To get to the next step and I think that people are starting to talk about that a little bit more than they used to  And I think that we'll see a lot more in that area as George Burns said

Transcript:  We're so excited about power automate so it lets you automate a lot of business processes  So you can run you can have people who run reports and they're either not dependent on  Getting developers to build them the tools to do it or having somebody whose job is just to figure out how to run the reports  so in a way this flattens out and democratizes the ability to  analyze data and to  Come up with new ways new ways to mine insights and then act on them and that's great  I still think the biggest thing to get out of this is that it  It will have the same effect on the market for coding jobs that WYSIWYG HTML editors had on the market for  Web editors and web developers because you remember for a while there was like a period of maybe three years  where if you were really good at HTML and  Style sheets you could hand code beautiful websites and beautiful web templates and so on and so forth and then everybody developed  Decent WYSIWYG editors and all of a sudden you didn't have to have somebody who knew how to use  Headings tags you could you could just do it yourself in Dreamweaver or whatever  So and I think we're about to see that happen with coding because it's getting to the point since all coding is based  On a really strict grammar in all in any artificial computer language and the functions that you can enact that grammar  it's not gonna be that hard to

I think you know, is it wrong that the name just makes me is it wrong that the name just makes  Me think of Microsoft Power Tools for like Windows 95  No, no, I saw this headline and I was like what can I automate like the changing of my screensaver is this you could actually

Start time: 7813.47
End time: 7912.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that the thing is is that there there's such a  Strong demand for coders and such a lack of supply  Right that it's gonna take a long time to kind of to get that going and from what I understand  I mean, I don't understand the power out of me as well. But I mean it looks a lot like  You know Salesforce automation that you're dragging dropping. Yeah, you know like it's you know, so it's it's it's for processing data  Sure for actually building the tools. I'm not you know, like to put an app out somewhere  I can't go to no, you know, but but I think that but I think that like for instance Apple  I think is missing a huge opportunity between  The kind of the basic automation that you get with the I can't think of the tool right now on a major or no  Automator but but but the one that's on  They bought no shortcuts. Yeah. Yeah, we're you sort of cuts  So so you have shortcuts on one side then you have Swift on the other and what's missing right in the middle?  Yeah, isn't notal is a notal coding platform, you know that you can sit there and just say now  Does it do everything that the code does? No, you would still need to write it. But what you we did this with  Compositing app where you could build these things. That's very much like code  It's it's how I'm gonna handle all the process all these images  But you could open up a node and just put code in you just drop code in I don't have to write all the rest  Of this I only have to write this one piece  That I that there's no node for and so if I think that of Apple did that or other people did more of that  That kind of programming interface you'd end up with a lot more people developing it. I think this is good  I mean when I look at it of what it is from the surface, I think it looks good  It's not but I don't think it'll replace many coders  It'll just it'll make it easier to do a lot more with the data, which is incredibly powerful

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Coding that you have to do. Yeah, we do everything we do everything in a house  Obviously we write the the iOS app in in script in script in Swift  Everything runs on on AWS in the back end. I have to say  Back to our earlier point, but you know for me the thing about power automate  It kind of feels a little bit analogous to me is like when you first got the ability to do really interesting  Macros in Excel. Yeah, and suddenly you can automate  Really stuff that was really complex and required insane, you know  Levels of coding is like I can write a macro that just builds a pivot table that does that now  And it feels like it kind of exploding that up to a bigger  Actually  And so that's not taking a that's not so much taking a coders job so much as making it easier for  somebody who already has a job to do something like way quicker or to  Suddenly suddenly increase, you know 10x the amount that you can do

Oh, yeah, it's a broader scope  I mean, it's a broader trend there and they're they're habituating people to the idea that hey, I too can I  Too can write the logical process and I know how to categorize this data.

Transcript:  Let's see  There's a lot of little stories here I'm a fan of the brave browser  It's an interesting a take on taking Google's Chrome browser taking out the privacy invasion  Material but using the chromium engine and they're making a privacy first browser. They're taking another bite out of the Google Apple  They just bought a search engine  I don't know how good it will be but their goal is to create a note tracking no profiling perhaps even  Paid for no ad version of a search engine to run in the brave browser  They bought it from clicks CLI QZ  Which was another privacy focused browser shut down last year  You mentioned this at the beginning of the show. I did want to get to it  I don't know exactly what it means, but Google has announced that they're going to make third-party cookies obsolete  You mentioned this will

Start time: 8077.46
End time: 8182.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, this is fascinating  We all know the kind of the cookies that follow us  You know you shop for one thing online and suddenly that follows you around the web  So there are an awful lot of third-party advertisers that rely on  effectively buying your data out of out of Google and  retargeting you  and what  Google has announced basically is that they're gonna stop people doing that and stop other people sort of effectively doing this market of  Trading personal information where you know one advertising company does deal with another advertising company  You link up their cookies and those cookies then all track you and you get these sort of you know massive advertising networks  Google is is playing this really cleverly because they're playing it as a  As a nod to privacy and saying that actually what we're doing is stopping  You know stopping so much of this tracking that happens around the web and of course Apple already does that with its mobile browsers for Safari  for example already stops third-party cookies, but of course the incidental and  completely coincidental side effect of  enforcing this kind of new privacy focused rule is that it puts an awful lot of emphasis on first-party cookies ie  Spending money with the people who actually have your data ie  So suddenly I don't need to buy somebody's you know Google search history and then retarget them using a third-party advertiser  If I want to do that, I've got to go directly to Google because that's privacy. Yeah  but it also looks an awful lot more like  Like Google reining in other people on its customers very good point

Start time: 8189.00
End time: 8270.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of the interesting side effects is that of course Google, you know has been accused of killing the media industry in many many ways  But if first-party cookies are one of the only types of cookies that are going to be allowed  So you can only be tracked by the site that you're on and not have that tracking for you elsewhere that makes  destination places  Extremely valuable. So suddenly news sites where you where you know media sites where you turn up regularly  Those cookies get an awful lot more valuable. So for example, we know I know from historical experience  We'd have people that wanted advertisers that wanted to buy  campaigns with with  with with magazines that I've worked out in the past and they buy a small portion of that audience and  Then use that to drop a cookie that they could then retarget on one of the cheaper advertising networks  And so you could buy a high-quality customer and then target them all the sites sucks all across the web  so of course what that means now is that that data won't be accessible and that they'll have to only buy with with the quality  publication that they're after or  Google so as much as Google is is, you know be accused lots of killing the the media industry  This might end up being a bit of a win for media companies that run their own operations interesting
