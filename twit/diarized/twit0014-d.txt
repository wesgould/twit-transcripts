Transcript:  This is TWIT, This Week in Tech, Episode 14 for July 17th, 2005.  Well, ladies and gentlemen, TWIT number 14 is ready to roll and we are kind of in a kind  of a hybrid state right now.  David Prager, Patrick Norton and I are in the same room.  Yeah, that was David that clonked his microphone there.  Can you try to keep your head up off the table, David?  Via Skype, we've got Robert Heron.  Hello, Robert.  Hello.  And Kevin Rose.  Hello, guys.  Still in La La Land, but coming up soon.  Very soon.  And kind of half Skype, half phone.  It's John C. Dvorak.  Hey, John.  Hello.  Hey, look at that.  He sounds like he's on the phone and yet he's listening to us on Skype.  It's kind of a miracle.  Every time John talks on Skype, it dies, but only in the output.  It's very strange.  Very strange.  So and you're Robert Heron, you got your gonads nuked.  I may have.  John says they're going to shrivel up and fall off.  What happened?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hello?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Robert, are you there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There goes your Skype connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my God.  He's gone.  I'm back.  Sorry about that.  I have a mute button that's way too easy to press.  That's good.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He muted himself.  For those of us who are mildly clueless and wondering where the how quickly we're going  to destroy the G rating in this episode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gonads is not porno.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gonads is fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's a that's a medical term, isn't it?  I think that's a lot.  The fortune or whatever you want to call it of being in one of the dozen or so airports  that now have those ion track tracing devices where they basically sniff you for explosives  right now is what they're climbing.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, I've been in one of those.  They use them in the CN tower in Canada before you go in.  They blow stuff.  Is it kind of like it's like a wind tunnel, right?  It's like it looks like a long phone or a tall phone booth and a reinforced metal box  pretty much that you're standing in.  And there's jets lying up and down the left and right sides.  Yeah, they puff air on you.  Yeah.  And then it spends a couple of seconds analyzing whatever it smells.  They have those in the CN tower.  They sniff you.  I thought you were in one of those where they could see through your clothes and see your  nipples.  That would be pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What if you have tremendous B.O.?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Machine goes, who?  They should have a sign that says you need a bath.  It's a trap door into a jacuzzi.  But it's true.  Doesn't isn't B.O. chemically similar to explosive fumes?  No, maybe not.  I thought so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is some relationship.  Is it just explosives or are they looking for drugs as well?  Or what do they all sniff for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they use the devices for in schools, I guess, from about the last year now, at  least for smelling drugs as people enter and exit facility, enter and exit the building  as well.  Interesting.  But at the airport, they're just claiming it's explosive testing or analysis right now.  So that the potential is there.  Definitely.  It's really wouldn't surprise me if they are doing that as well.  It's relatively uninvasive.  I mean, it doesn't.  It wasn't a big deal.  I'll be honest.  It's really nice because Vegas was getting up.  We were about 110 degrees.  It was about 110 degrees that day.  And that was just a nice treat right before you get on the plane.  Just get totally shot down with cool bursts.  They could do a little aroma therapy while you're doing that.  It'd be nice.  It'd be nice.  Misty mint blowing.  So I was on an airplane to and from Copenhagen on Scandinavia Airways.  Wi-Fi the whole way, both ways.  It's awesome.  And it was good.  The quality was surprisingly good.  So it was high speed.  There were a couple of times it dropped out.  It's kind of like DirecTV on those when he's turning.  When the plane's banking, it loses a signal, but then it comes back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  When you mean high speed, you're not talking.  I mean, there's some latency there.  We're not talking like you could play games over this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I didn't try playing any games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, I've got an...  These guys I met with the other day, Michael Robertson's got a new company called Gizmo,  which is a Skype clone.  Yes.  In fact, I was thinking of using that today.  They say they've been flying on these flights that you're talking about, and they carry  the Gizmo code on a USB key, and they just shove it in their laptop.  And they said they were talking on the thing that the speed was good enough that they could  do real time conversations across the entire Atlantic.  I was downloading files.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I felt like I was online.  I was kind of surprised.  30 bucks for the full flight, $9.95 for half an hour or something like that.  I paid the full 30 bucks.  I used it.  It was great.  And every seat had a plug socket.  Even in a car.  You know, that will get cheaper, but for just being able to have that right now, I think  I'd pay the 30 bucks too.  It's well worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So would I.  What about on the cruise?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What kind of internet did you get?  They have marine satellite.  It's terrible.  Talk about bad latency.  It feels worse than dial-up.  The Inmarsat 6 stuff?  It's like Inmarsat.  It's not Inmarsat, but it's very similar to that.  And it's just awful.  I mean, it's unusable.  I wasn't going to buy it again.  And then somebody gave me a free card, so I used it.  But thank goodness too, because I had to get online and do SSH to the terminal, to the  server to upload Twitter and everything.  So thank goodness I was able to get online.  It was no fun.  Another neat thing about Scandinavian Airlines, they have little chefs on the plane.  Guys in chef outfits.  I'm not kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've seen dishwashers in chef outfits.  What were they doing in their chef outfits?  They were going down the aisles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It wasn't a muppet, was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looked like it was, you know, it was cool though.  I mean, you know, it was an Airbus, like one of the big Airbus, like the 330.  And they configured it for only 230 seats.  So it's pretty spacious.  I've never been in such a big airplane bathroom.  It's about as big as my office.  In fact, I was tempted to kind of start doing a radio show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Virgin Atlantic's got the walkout bar and the inflight masseuse.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just had a sandwich bar, open face sandwich bar.  So maybe we should get to the news.  Patrick, what's our time story?  I was on a flight one time where the chef was actually carving up dinners for everyone.  What airlines that?  You know, it was a domestic carrier.  It was the seventies.  No, no, no.  I'm talking about last year or so.  That's when stewardesses used to wear hot pants.  Remember that?  I was going cross country.  I'm not even American.  John and I are the only people who remember when stewardesses, remember the PSA stewardesses,  John, they wore hot pants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You actually have a blog post on this right now.  You go to the Spork.org blog.  I have a whole essay on these on these hot pants girls on PSA.  What a disaster that was when that airline went out of business.  We're taken over by US Air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was the original Hooters flight.  And they had those little hats.  Remember that little weird page boy hats and haircuts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually they used to wear the hot skirts and they had, they always hired these leggy  women and they were callipedias by the way.  And they were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know what that means.  Is that like steata pitches or is that a separate kind of pitches?  No, calla, calla pitches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Super calla pitches.  It's spelled callipicus.  I know what it means.  It means you could, it means they can hold your drink for you with that.  No, no, that's not what it means.  It doesn't?  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll have to look it up.  The drink would slide off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When I thought it was more like a shelf, wasn't it?  Isn't that the idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look, see if it's in Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be pleasantly surprised if it's in Wikipedia.  The, except that's the word I used to use to test dictionaries.  Calla pitches?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, okay.  What do we want to talk about first?  The assault against the incredible political upset over Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, which  and we should point out that it's not pictures of sexual activities.  It's actual activity.  It's actual activity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Robert, you must have done the hot coffee mod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's, it's not a simple mod to set up.  It's not like you can just, you know, do three thumb clicks in your end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, and they have a little excite-o-meter and the, and the better the job you do, the  higher the excite-o-meter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've got that one.  The other thing we have is we have a new cyber security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's stick, let's stick with the, let's stick with the hot coffee mod.  Has anybody, anybody here played the hot coffee mod yet?  Yeah, I have.  Dvorak, tell us all about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There is no genitals being shown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, a good thing too, cause these aren't the best renderings you've ever seen in your  life anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it's just kind of a goof, if you ask me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's ironic that Hillary Clinton's up, all in upper over this, when in fact, this is  the most, the violence in the game is appalling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly, that's the point.  The violence is ridiculous.  It's disgusting.  Heads are chopped off and blood is spurting all over the place and then there's this idiotic

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but keep in mind that it's always the player that controls or says he wants that  to happen.  He or her wants that to happen.  But you get a reward for it.  Not necessarily.  Well, I mean, in the game, if you  Depends who you kill.  If you kill someone in public, you get a star, a wanted star, and the more wanted stars you  have, the more he comes falling down on you.  Well, I've watched my kid play this game.  They try to get as many stars as they can.  In fact, I finally stopped him from playing it.  He said, look at this.  He comes up to a guy sitting on a bench, chops his head off, blood spurts in the air and  then he kicks the head down the street.  And I said, that's it, you're not playing the game anymore.  What game was this?  Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas.  I didn't think you could cut people's heads off.  Yeah, and the blood spurts.  Not that I'm against it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but OK, here's the gold bond question for the parents on the podcast right now.  Do you really expect Henry to not know the difference between what he can do in GTA and  what he can do in real life?  Well, let me ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John's a parent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you think, John?  Oh, sorry, John.  I have mixed feelings about it.  I think, you know, I've always said one of my comments when I give talks is that, you  know, these are simulations and you can actually learn things from simulations as anyone who's  ever flown in a simulator would know.  My comment is that my kids may play Grand Theft Auto, but that doesn't mean they're  going to go out and steal cars.  But if they ever did become car thieves, they'd be damn good at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you could say the same thing for CSI or, you know, I mean, the guy who did all  the Ed McBain novels for you, the guy who basically invented the police procedural novel,  the idea that you would, you know, figure out exactly the way cops do it and retell  it in the novel and the story.  It was basically the genesis for CSI and all that other stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, those novels are as close to pornographic as you can get, in my opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, but the point is, it's, you know, video games are just another outlet  for something that's been around in various media forms for decades.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why is Hillary all upset about this, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's good PR for her.  I think she's trying to get on that, you know, the bandwagon, the conservative family values  bandwagon is all there is to it.  She wants to be seen as a conservative family values type of woman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And how many people are going to say, oh, I'm not voting for her.  She's against sex in Grand Theft Auto.  None.  I mean, it's a no lose, right?  I mean, it's going to be it's not even going to I mean, even gamers don't get upset about  that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nobody really cares.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, because it's a joke.  At its core, it's a joke.  You haven't basically a sandbox of a game that you can do anything in.  Right.  The very freedom that game offers you.  And yeah, you know what?  You can do anything and take even Half Life 2.  There's a mod called Gary's Mod.  And you can do anything with that game engine, including posing characters in any way, shape  or form.  Rockstar says, well, actually, Rockstar is kind of cagey about this.  They they kind of imply that this content wasn't really in the game, but they don't  go so far as to actually deny it.  They kind of imply that this mod is a mod when in fact, the programmer says it's not  a mod.  It's a hack that opens up content that was already there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, this has got to be the biggest does it have new content or does it rearrange existing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  content much like it opens up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's open to new content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the content that's been buried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the point is that this is a big publicity stunt that's getting them additional sales  on a dying product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's a good point.  As usual, they're helping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My kids don't play it anymore.  They play they playing the new Sims game.  And there's a whole bunch of cute little new games for the those those Game Boy machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So tell me this, though.  I mean, it seems to me is when you have pornography and something like this, there should be some  type of regulation on it because kids can go down to the video game store and rent this  Yeah, but it's watch porno.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I mean, John, correct me if I'm wrong, but this is the the the mod actually is kind  of a pain to install.  And the other thing, I mean, to address what you were saying, Kevin, is is actually one  of the first politicians to speak out on this was Leland Yee, who's an assemblyman from  California.  And he was like, this is another situation where games ratings, the ESRB has completely  failed us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they're they're launching an investigation saying we should have known about this would  have been A.O. had we known the content was there.  Should it be A.O. if you can't unlock the content, unless there's a hack?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, if the content is not obviously there, my kids, I think if it were rated for the  movies, it would be PG-13.  You're right.  It's not that dirty.  And if there is something there, it's either blurred or blocked or so digitized.  Well, no, no, you should look at it.  It's not blurred or blocked.  It's there.  But it's not.  I mean, it's these renderings aren't very good.  And they look like, you know, australopithecine women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so they might be Calipages, but they're not the men.  They might look the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They'd never make it in PSA.  That's PSA stews.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I mean, this was I mean, this was basically blocked in the in the version of the game  that shipped.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I think what I think probably it was in there and Rockstar at the last moment  said we better not release this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it more graphic than the sex scene in the God of War game?  I haven't seen that.  It's kind of guy walks into the room and then all of a sudden, you know, the stuff starts  happening and the attention of the of the view that you see shifts over to a bottle  that's on the bedside table and the bottle keeps shaking.  It's more graphic than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  For Rockstar in this game in particular, it's such it seems like a big so what to me because  it had an M rating.  Hey, if you could sell postal to you should be able to sell this.  And if it were just adults buying this title,  you know, a big deal.  I got a little extra content that you have to totally you have to dig to find this.  It isn't just I think right there on the surface moving on.  I thought you had a conspiracy theory, though, John, didn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, yeah, I do.  I wanted to talk about I don't know if it got listed on the news items that Pat's put  together, but I've I've come to the conclusion and this just showed up on my blog about 10  minutes ago.  The John Doar and Kleiner Perkins hiring Colin Powell and Powell is a as far as I can tell.  It's a move to to to turn Powell into a Democrat and run him for president because  don't door has been a kind of a political jock sniffer now for the last couple of years.  And he's been looking for a winner so he can get a White House appointment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And he's a Democrat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, former Republican turned Democrat, just like Colin Powell.  Well, that's why they think they're going to be able to turn or flip Powell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How does making a Democrat is making Colin Powell a venture capitalist,  help him in any way run for office?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the idea is they're not going to make him a pure venture capitalist, but he's going  to be kind of an entrepreneur, advisor, kind of somebody that they just want to get.  This is like George Bush owning the Texas Rangers.  It's just a phony title window dressing, make him look like he's, you know, pro business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Carl Rove should be fired.  Should he stay on?  It says nothing to do with tech, but I just want to know what you think.  I think he should be fired.  You think he did it.  He leaked the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I think it's just the dirty White House dirty trick that caught up to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's been doing dirty tricks since day one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's kind of a protege of Donald Segradian during the Nixon administration.  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who was the Dick Tuck was the Democratic guy who arranged for posters.  Remember that when Dick Nixon got off the train and where it was in Southern California,  a bunch of black pregnant black women with signs that said Nixon's the one.  Remember that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And a bunch of a used to use strippers and all kinds of people.  There is what there's no Dick Tuck equivalent anymore on the Democratic side,  which is killing them because they're so politically correct.  Right.  Democrats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where's the shame?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That they can't do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I say Hillary Clinton versus Carl Rove for 2008.  That's my in mud wrestling tag team.  So there's this tech element to the show too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Moving on.  Oh boy, Longhorn to require a monitor based digital rights management.  Something's been floating around for a long time.  And the idea that, I mean, first of all, maybe we should just address the whole idea that  Longhorn is kind of becoming a bigger joke than Windows ME.  Windows ME was a money grab for Microsoft before they released Windows XP.  Longhorn is supposed to be the next generation after XP.  And they keep stripping everything that makes Longhorn interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the exact opposite of ME.  It's something that was supposed to be a big deal and ended up being nothing.  You know, in theory, it was supposed to be something and it was nothing to begin with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they might close some security holes in Longhorn, but the latest, the latest,  you know, thing that's been going around the web is Longhorn is going to require you.  If you want to have the best quality, you know, digital media experience to buy a secure monitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Every computer company.  You don't think so?  Every computer company is going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Never going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you want to play nice with Hollywood, you better include that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who gives a shit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, does it mean you're not going to be able to run your Hollywood,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  your pirated Hollywood DVD on your monitor?  Is that the idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you can run your pirated DVD anywhere you want.  That's the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Once you strip out the copy protection, none of this matters.  Well, Robert, aren't all the TVs, the new TVs coming with,  with HDMI coming with copy protection?  Is that the whole point of moving to digital in their faces?  Well, HDCP, the high bandwidth content protection standard.  And that is a must nowadays.  If you're buying a new TV, then you plan to have a digital,  anything digital connected to it legitimately.  It now requires HDCP.  That includes upscaling DVD players to satellite boxes, set-top cable boxes,  anything you could possibly do a digital video input for.  So John, you're saying that the computer is different than the TV that you don't, who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I don't think that anyone that's using a computer to watch these things,  for one thing, you're not going to have that.  The only time that this HDCP is going to pay off,  and where you're going to need it in the monitors,  is when you're going to have a big giant image.  I don't think anybody cares about getting those extra pixels on a computer screen,  to the point where they're going to pay extra for a screen  that could be blocking all kinds of weird things.  You don't want these crazy devices on the monitor side of a pure computer system.  And home entertainment is a different story.  That's going to be the way it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does this mean we're going to have to buy a whole other HDTV monitor in two years,  if the computer takes over as a delivery system for content?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a broadcast flag is what it is.  It's ironic because they don't have to do it.  But if you want Hollywood to give you any content, you've got to do it anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These things may never come to pass.  The broadcast flag may just never be used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think it will.  That's my gut feeling on the whole thing.  That's what Michael Powell told me.  Michael Powell, when they passed, when FCC passed the broadcast flag,  Michael Powell said, don't worry, it'll never last.  He knew that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it seems like an artificial construct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was an accommodation to a motion picture industry  that was demanding they do something.  And they said, okay, sure, we'll do this.  Knowing full well it was doomed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think consumers demanded something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, good.  Let's demand something.  What shall we demand?  Better movies.  People won't put up with yet another protected format for displays  that will end up in people's living rooms that they're going to be using today.  HDCP right now is enough.  Won't anything be cracked?  Won't anything that you do be cracked?  Isn't it hopeless?  I think so.  There's no such thing as copy protection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there is such a thing as copy protection.  It's just more of a speed bump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The only people it slows down is honest people.  That's the irony of it.  If you're a crook, you crack it in minutes.  It's the honest people that it stops, right?  The people are too stupid to figure out where to go online to get a crack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or the people who refuse to crack it.  Who needs to watch these movies more than once?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought, now I know you guys talked about where are the worlds last week,  but I thought that was pretty good.  I like that.  Okay.  I guess that's it.  Silence.  I guess I'm the only one.  How about that Finding Neverland?  Pretty good, huh?  Item three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually going to lay this one right out for Robert Heron.  So Battlefield 2, is it done yet?  Do we deserve patches that don't crash servers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Someone left my game out in the rain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Battlefield, yeah.  It's like EA following the Microsoft model.  Release a product, fix it over the next three years.  Are you okay, Liam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that is exactly what happened.  I'll never have that recipe again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it turns out that 1.0, they released a what?  The first patch that came out about a week ago,  ended up causing massive server memory leaks or massive memory leaks on servers,  which caused all sorts of fun mayhem.  In addition to it kind of fixed some things, but it didn't others.  And then they said the very, what was it?  Two days later, less than 48 hours, they said,  we recommend you reinstall the game and not update with the patch we put out a couple days ago.  Oh man, it sounds like Microsoft.  And then Friday night, Saturday morning, they went ahead and released the,  quote unquote, fix hotfix for the patch,  but hadn't yet updated any of the numbers within the updater itself.  So if you weren't really paying attention to be looking at it, going,  waiting, this says version one, one and not version one, two.  And I applied the new patch that came out the other day, just so you know,  to be up to speed with everything.  Shall I put that in the show notes?  It's just Robert applied the patch.  I did.  And we ain't talking the nicotine patch either folks.  We need to put it out.  Software can, they can ship garbage folks.  They do.  They can and do.  You can ship garbage and stay that way.  Is it their fault though?  Isn't, isn't software hasn't it gotten so complex?  And I can't call the whole entire program a piece of garbage either.  Now I'm having a lot of fun with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cause you're playing it like 18 hours a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You want to ship something within a couple of years,  you're going to have to live with that.  Isn't that the case?  It's too complex.  Or some of the basic lessons learned in big game releases.  If you put a demo out, use that demo to collect information about  potential bugs and fixes you'll need to implement,  you know, if you've got two weeks before the big release happens,  at least you can have a patch ready to go and use some of the information.  It's like, I guess you're just putting the demo out just to generate more hype.  I think there's an illusion people have about software and software development.  That it's somehow a rational process and it's a clean room and there are people  and they're finding bugs and the codes all nice and neat.  This stuff is like sausage behind the scenes.  And I don't care what game you're talking about or what program it is a mess.  It's amazing.  Any of this stuff works without a doubt though,  it is very, very complex environment with a brand new game engine.  And with the amount of different things that go into the game,  be it the artwork, be it the sound, be it the AI engine or the physics engine  and having that all meshed together and create an experience that's worth the money.  Still, there is no doubt that it is a complex beast, but you know,  if you're why the game developers, I mean,  Steam and Valve, they did it right in the sense that before Half-Life 2 shipped,  they had a preview everyone can play.  Every crash was logged and was you were asked to at least submit that information anonymously.  And that was all used to better the game.  And how late was Half-Life 2?  Oh yeah, a couple of years.  Hey, speaking of software flaws, is the shuttle ever going to get off the ground?  John C. Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh gosh, and let's hope so.  I mean, this poor guy, I was just over at NASA.  The other day visiting pre-launch and that, you know, these guys are hurting over there.  They must be depressed.  They're funding.  Oh, they got to be totally.  You know, this thing is at the end of its life cycle anyway, this shuttle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't even know what's wrong, do they?  I mean, there's some glitch they can't fix now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a glitch on the sensor for the external fuel tank, one of the sensors for it.  And now they're saying they're going to miss the July window.  Well, they're also saying they might decide that they want to go ahead even without just  figuring out exactly what is wrong with that sensor.  No, sorry.  As far as I'm concerned though, it seems like they're actually back to normal.  It sounds kind of strange, but like they put the thing out there, then they get deal with  the normal Cape Canaveral weather.  And then every single time they launched a shuttle before any accident, you know, they  would always, they would never, never, ever, ever launch it on time.  They'd always like have one month, one month window, then they delay it and they'd find  their other window and then they put it up.  And that's just seems to me, that's the status quo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are they saying at NASA, John?  I mean, what, what, what is the feeling there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not to mention, I wonder if they get overtime for all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They should be pretty chipper in that case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was nothing specific about it.  I didn't go there after they canceled the launch.  So I don't know what they said.  All right.  That was there before.  What were you there?  They were showing, they were showing the new IMAX movie.  This is talking about your Tom Cruise plug earlier.  They were showing, they got this new IMAX movie on the international space station.  That's going to roll out and they showed a preview of it.  And Tom Cruise is the narrator.  And so as soon as it said narrated by Tom Cruise, this huge auditorium moaned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, he did the first one.  I mean, that's the one they show right now.  Kennedy space center tour.  They like Tom Cruise.  What can they say?  I don't know.  I think the new director of the new director of NASA is a Scientologist, isn't he?  No, I better not say that we don't have a limited liability yet.  It's just hearsay and I really disavow any knowledge of the aforesaid  Dianetics, diatribe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want to lose my truck.  Everyone see page 33.  IBM post-funeral notice for OS 2.  2006, OS 2 finally dies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John C. Dvorak was the last holdout on OS 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That wasn't the last holdout.  I gave up on that thing about six, seven years ago.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you sad to see it go?  You know what they're saying now?  Get Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, the problem with OS that to this day,  OS 2 is still a great multitasking operating system that Windows can't even come close to.  See, was I right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's still used, isn't it?  In financial institutions all over the place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's used here and there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder if they're going to give up on it or

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a friend of mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You see, there's no better way to run Windows 3.1 though.  I'll grant you that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  Anybody catch the Blu-ray story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, tell us about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the Blu-ray Association.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Danny, tell us the Blu-ray story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Blu-ray Association has released an informed study that says Blu-ray is better than HDTVD.  Well, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I believe it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's funny because people are like, I saw an email thread.  Robert and I are on an email thread that has some pretty hardcore geeks on it.  And there's this kind of moment where somebody's like, oh, you know, I guess I'm going with Blu-ray.  And we're all like, so yeah.  It's better, you know.  It's better because the Blu-ray Association says it's better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't it better in one respect?  It holds more data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what's the capacity?  I can't remember the capacity between Blu-ray and HD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you triple layer HDVD, you can pull 45 gigs onto that.  Whereas the single layer with Blu-ray gives you 50 gigs.  So there you go.  Wow.  I rest my case.  It is better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there's another aspect to it.  Blu-ray was designed from the get-go to be read-write technology.  That's right.  They do have a post-Evan DVD, which was well off to the pack.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They do now have HD DVD rewritables, though, don't they?  They were able to do that.  They just announced that recently.  I mean, like in the last week or so.  And apparently this November we'll actually see set top players and about 70 first-run titles in stores.  So all the Disney titles on Blu-ray, all the Universal titles on HD DVD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there's like all the major studios are split between the two formats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sony and Disney on Blu-ray and the rest on HD DVD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So can hardware manufacturers make devices that support both simultaneously?  Can they?  They've already developed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they were telling us at CES this year, Pioneer had their multi-pickup laser as well as,  I think, Philips had the other ones.  It's got to be more expensive.  It's got more parts in the damn thing.  Well, designing it for two or three different formats, sure.  But once it's made, it can be miniaturized and optimized.  It's just that initial design that's the big expense.  We talked about this in Twit 12 or whatever.  So we're rehashing old ground.  I'll be the keeper of the twit.  Did you know that we are now number three on the,  well, of course, by the time this comes out, we'll be number two on iTunes.  Seven.  It's kind of hard to tell.  I don't think you go down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you go down?  I think you only go up.  No, we've gone down and up.  What Leo's talking about, folks, is our rating on the iTunes podcast page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, this is what's sad about that is that's all anybody's going to pay  attention to from now on.  That's all that matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's hope not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, what I'm hoping and I pray is that both Google and Yahoo are working their  little fingers to the bone right now trying to come up with a better podcast solution.  Because there's some problems with iTunes.  For instance, it doesn't support BitTorrent.  If you're not in a country where you can get an iTunes account,  you can't submit your podcast to iTunes.  And Apple's apparently completely,  idiosyncratically controls who gets promoted on the front page.  And if you're not promoted, I don't think people are going to find you.  We're lucky to be up there.  I'm really curious to see what audio does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you guys messed around with audio at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we're on audio.  We're number six on audio.  But if you look at it, there aren't many subscribers.  We're number six with like 146 subscribers on audio.  So it's not yet.  I mean, it just came out.  This is Evan Williams, the guy who invented Blogger's new project with Noah.  What's his name?  I don't know.  You know, I have I put audio bugs and iTunes bugs and pod Nova bugs on our site  because, you know, it's going to make it easier to subscribe.  Somebody's need needs if podcasting is going to succeed,  somebody needs to do a good directory system  that doesn't have the inherent biases of the Apple system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think there's one coming.  Google or Yahoo?  Neither one.  It's really saw it supposed to be announced in the next week or two.  It's kind of a very strange thing,  but it's going to be interesting.  But I can't talk about it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But isn't Apple the 800 pound gorilla?  I mean, it's pretty hard to beat them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This kind of goes.  This is kind of interesting because it uses kind of like  it's kind of like I can't explain it.  In fact, I'm not even sure how it works, but somehow it's like steals Apple.  Good.  It redirects people who are going to the iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I mean.  It's a man in the middle attack against the iTunes music store.  That's just really the echelon on a music.  And I don't want to go on and on about it,  but I spent the last I probably spent 40 hours in the last 10 days  trying to get our RSS feed compliant and Apple's own documentation is inconsistent.  They do their own tags, which are duplicates in some cases of the existing RSS text.  It's just bizarre.  I mean, it's obvious when you start to really look at it  that Apple jumped on this bandwagon.  At first, Steve Jobs, remember, he called it the Wayne's world of radio.  But then all of a sudden they said, hmm,  this thing's got some traction.  And I think probably cobbled this together in just a matter of months.  And it's and it shows it and I'm sure it'll get better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you would think with 5.0, they would release some type of management tool  where we could log in and say, okay,  this is what's actually going to be in the episode without having to worry about these tags.  You hope that it would provide hosting at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm hand coding our RSS right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you really?  Yeah.  So you don't use feed.  Feed Warner has that built in though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you can just add all the only if you have an RSS feed that has your podcast  as an enclosure embedded in the feed, which we don't do currently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it'll create an enclosure for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you have an RSS feed already with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you don't have to have the enclosure tag.  It'll see that there's an impetus.  That's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have what we have is a true RSS podcast RSS.  What they want is a blog RSS that happens to have a file attached to it.  And then they'll turn it into a podcast RSS.  But I'm not doing that.  I'm doing a real podcast RSS.  So a little bit of a hack.  Yeah.  I mean, they did it right.  And you used it for, I know for a Dignation and it worked immediately.  Right.  So yeah.  Believe me.  I wish I had been.  It was, it was like pulling teeth and they still, there's still weird things.  Like they have three entries for my KFI podcasts for reasons I don't understand.  There's only one feed.  I don't know what they're picking up.  I think I literally think there's some guy in Cupertino is going to, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Put this right there.  Anyway, can you do some more of that?  I think I might have to.  10 more seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Got very quiet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's going to go straight under the Leo Laporte soundboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll be interesting though to see if somebody can track accurately or better at least the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the new free audio and video that's in there.  The NSA can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they should.  Echelon baby echelon.  They should give us good statistics.  Somebody must know how many downloads we have.  Certainly we don't.  They can do it without compromising privacy.  Well, every, I know, I know how many downloads we get through feed burner.  That's one of the nice things about feed burner is that I could tell how many people get it  that way, but that's only one way people get the show.  There's lots of other ways.  I think that alone, the P2P clients, I think with the, I think conservative,  I know we have at least a quarter of a million downloads through feed burner a week.  And, and I, that has to be close to the top.  I can't imagine there's many people with more.  I don't know who, maybe Al Franken.  I don't know.  Not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anybody see the new XP service pack two flaw that's been bouncing around this Friday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they just didn't.  Yeah, they just found it.  Huh?  Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess the guy, it's another case where.  It's a remote desktop.  Yeah.  Hacker finds a, hacker finds a hole.  Let's Microsoft knows about it.  It feels the progress isn't moving quickly enough.  And then they tell the world.  They tell the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not, it doesn't sound like too big a threat.  I mean, it, it sounds a little bit tricky to implement and not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think security calls it a moderately critical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Moderately.  Moderately.  It's just another hole.  What are you going to do?  I use remote desktop quite a bit though.  Do you, what do you use it for?  For PCs that I'll set up, I'll actually put a really strong password as the admin.  And usually take the admin account for myself.  And then so if anything does go wrong with fit down the road and they're.  Yeah, I use it from 50 miles away.  Yeah.  I just log into that box and it's like, I'm sitting there.  I use VNC for my mom though.  I don't use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go to my PC is actually quite nice for getting around those files.  It's pretty good.  Isn't it?  Yeah.  I like it.  It's pricey, but it's good.  It works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm doing a next.  This is a weird thing.  Next, you know, they're go to my PC and go to meeting sponsor, the radio show.  And I'm going to do a go to meeting.  Meeting like public meeting after the radio show next week.  And we're going to, you know, we're just telling people sign up.  Actually, I wish maybe I could get John to write my, it's supposed to be the top five  technologies for 2005 guys.  What do you think?  Tell me what are they quick?  Cause I got to write this thing.  You heard it here first, a preview.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You gotta have VoIP in there.  You gotta have IPTV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't, you know, I didn't put IP media, but I probably should.  I'd put VoIP wireless and mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Wireless for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I put plastics plastics.  Yes.  One word plastics.  I put let's see, you know, location based technologies I think are very interesting.  You, I mean,  Hey, hey, hey, who's that?  Who's snoring?  No, RFID and GPS.  I think is very exciting.  And look what people are doing now with Google with an SDK on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you seen, I mean, there's some, did you see the Google Map?  And we were talking about that's something else we've talked about a bunch recently.  The Google Maps SDK is pretty cool.  It's so cool.  Well, the best one we saw was like Craigslist, which is the local service.  You can actually look by, by neighborhood at what listings they have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I've been using that like crazy.  It's great.  It is amazing.  You can click on the little button there, the little like pin and it'll show you pictures  from Craigslist.  It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there's a bag man over here that uses it to rob.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think though that what this shows you is the difference between a company that holds on tight  to proprietary stuff.  It says it's ours and a company like Google that's that's culture is openness.  And boy, do they get a lot of benefit out of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google's also entire stock valuation is based on people's opinion of it, of, of, of it's  continued growth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whatever.  Yeah.  Okay.  But, but that's the point is that it is possible to do very well and still be open, you know,  not I, and I think in the long run, going to do better by being an open company, giving  it out an SDK, telling people, you know, here's the, here's the opposite Nikon, which not only  has started encrypting parts of its raw format so that people can't write software to open  its raw files, but they also don't give you an SDK to control the camera.  On the other hand, Canon does these act opposite.  They tell you how you can control the camera, how, what's in their raw format.  And I know photographers who have hundreds of Nikon lenses who are selling them on eBay  or saying, I'm moving to Canon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, a Nikon, I think didn't they just bite the bullet and make an adapter so they  can use a Nikon lens on a, on a Canon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's, that's nice.  But I mean, that's, that's, you know, and that's the least of it.  You can't, if, if, if the minute they say, we're not going to let you into the, and  Microsoft does the same thing.  We're not going to let you into our file format.  To me, that's the kiss of death nowadays.  And that's where Google is the exact opposite.  They say, not only we're going to let you into it, we'll let you write cool applications  that use our, our stuff.  And, you know, of course Google's business model is different.  That's the sign of a cool company.  But that's why people love them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, everybody's doing that though, nowadays.  I mean, it seems like APIs are just, I mean, delicious flicker.  America's in the world.  Everybody is.  Are you going to do a dig API?  Is there a way?  Yeah, we're it's halfway done right now.  And what will people be able to do?  Anything they want.  So you there's going to be your information with, yeah, they can manipulate it any way  they want.  See how they get smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's just Google earth.  There's Google earth hacks.com isn't, isn't, I know you talked about this last time, but  isn't that Google earth amazing?  Yeah, boy, I love that.  Oh, it's just, it's fun.  Now you Patrick, I know you showed us the keyhole stuff on the screensavers, but this  seems to me faster and better, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think you're talking about, I think if you, if you, you know, in no disrespect  to keyhole, but got a lot of bright campers focused, you know, pretty, you know, and I  love the resources.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love being able to go down and look at an angle.  That's so cool.  Of course, there's no information, so everything's still flat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But let's say it's kind of perspective shift.  Well, you look at like the local searches for Google and there's a, it's 3d though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looks like it's 3d, but if you look like, okay, okay.  So we're talking about this earth.google.com, the new satellite software that lets you go  anywhere on the earth.  So go to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  You look at the top of the White House, right?  You change the angle.  You're still looking at the top of the White House.  The trees in the foreground are bigger.  Yes.  But you don't see the side of the White House.  You still are looking from the top down.  True.  It is the same image.  It's a perspective trick.  All it is is making it.  But as far as geometry of the landscape, that is there.  Well, you know, like hills are bumpy, you mean?  Totally.  Oh, make sure you have it checked.  The 3d part.  Oh, I have to check that.  It's actually a checkbox for that.  So you can go up and down hill.  Oh, that's totally.  Or if you look at the Grand Canyon, you can tell us, oh my goodness, here's this huge scar  throughout the going across two states.  But you can't go down into it.  Yeah, you can.  You know, to a degree, I don't know how close you want to get before the resolution.  I'm not blaming them.  I mean, there's no data.  They don't have satellite pictures to do that.  One funny one that highlights what you just mentioned that that perspective distortion  is looking at Lake Mead and the dam.  What is that?  Hoover, right there.  And Hoover has this perfect curve to it.  And if you start shifting the angle at all, you'll suddenly see it just distort.  And it looks very weird.  And you immediately pick up on it.  It almost gets like a McDonald's or an art shape, that double art shape.  As you go lower on the horizon.  Right.  Right.  You guys worried about blogs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm scared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm shaking.  There's been a lot of talk about lately about people telling too much personal information

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  in their blogs and regretting it because they never did that on web pages.  Or drunk after a day at the office.  That's the problem is that they then publish them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kiss of death.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can always come back and take it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can.  But who was it that was looking for work and they type her name in there?  And that's exactly what she says.  Here I am drunk at work again.  Not a good resume.  Combine Google with blogs and you've got powerful dynamite, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's also just, some people just, they don't understand.  No discretion.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, you sit there and it's like, somebody's like, you know, blogging and talking  trash about the place they work at.  And then they get upset when the company gets upset.  Yeah.  Oh, I wasn't thinking of you, but I still have my letter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have my reprimand here somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should frame it.  I was going to say you should frame that.  But I mean, it's just like, at some point you got to look at somebody and go,  what were you thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I wasn't, I was drunk.  If you do that more than once or twice in your lifetime, maybe, maybe you should start taking.  I guess you're right.  Yeah.  If you, yeah, I, I don't, yeah, I learned my lesson.  I think I've done that once and it was like, oh, okay.  I'll never.  I even turned off the automatic send and receive on my email at work.  Justin, you know what?  Can you back off that?  Oh, I was, uh, it wasn't, it wasn't a big deal.  I was, um, it was in my message boards.  I kind of bad mouthed the management at tech TV.  You know, I, I thought I did it in a clever way, but I probably remember this.  I shouldn't have done it while I was employed by tech.  That's the thing.  I love the best is the farewell note.  I, somebody's got to write a book.  In fact, tech TV alone, you could probably do a couple of chapters of the, of the flame  out, the fair now fair flame out, farewell note.  I wrote a, do you remember Russ pits?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  That's exactly what we're all thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John, did you ever even work for anybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you've written some, uh, some farewell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wrote a farewell note that tech TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And it was very well written because it had anyone you could, cause you could read between  the lines, but it was so inoffensive that they wouldn't take it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I see you're smarter than the average bear.  That's why you know how to cat, you know, cagey, uh, yeah, I'd love to see it.  We'll put it on the, we'll put it in the show notes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this infamous Russ, the last line on his farewell email says, one of the last lines  now is you are all probably aware.  I couldn't care less of the entire building spontaneously filled with Eagle semen.  That was the, that was the famous line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's, I mean, there's, there's a strange person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's also a, there's a, he was a producer of the screen savers, Russ pits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See the downside of that email going out the way and it was, we all laugh and all was great,  but he sent it to the entire building, which means it also went to the HR department and  management, which means all of his exit interviews where he made some excellent cases for massive  problems that we were having in the organizational structure were completely wiped out by that  email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't really matter.  You know what I mean?  So it was, it was the, uh, the web guy, Josh, uh, was it green?  Great, great farewell note.  One of the best ever.  Anyway, they're tech TV has more than its share of, uh, of flame out farewell notes.  I think that's probably a new corporate trend.  Don't you think with corporate email and everything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, also, I mean, in some cases I've, it's interesting to hear from people where  it's almost impossible to CC all the way the directories are set up that only certain  people in the company actually have the ability to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At one point we were told, stop CCing all because it goes to Paul Allen.  Yeah.  Remember that?  I remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, like he was reading it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just find it kind of rude to if you just, oh, it's just, that's so much extra email

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  applied to all large company.  I'm looking for somebody who's had experience with trying to download.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would it be funny if you got a response from Paul Allen though?  You know?  I know how to do that.  I mean, the IT departments go to such lengths to break everything up.  East coast, west coast, different apartments.  What's Paul Allen up to?  Do you know anything, John?  What's he, what's he doing these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Still, you know, I still pretending to be a guitar player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He fired Bill Savoy, his business manager and his sister's running the empire now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's gotta be a step up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't Tom Cruise do the same thing?  He has a, he did.  He did.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He fired his PR person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And his sister's doing PR.  PR person and his sister's a Scientologist.  And his sister's in law maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So anyway, I got a Bill Zip story while you're talking about that email thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bill Zip, he used to, one of his secretaries told me this story once.  He said, Bill Zip, when they have a new sales guy, he always give them a big pep talk and say,  hey, you know, whatever you do, make sure to CC me on all your things.  I want to keep up because I mean, I think you're going to go big, you know, go,  go a long way in this company.  And so he says, with it, invariably within two weeks,  Zip is grousing about the guy telling you, asking the secretary, why is this idiot sending me all  this email?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's pretty common where you, you see, CEO says things, you shouldn't probably do it.  Somebody was telling me that Steve Jobs, he was a friend of his, he's worked at Apple and he gets  in the elevator with Steve Jobs.  Everybody's terrified of Steve Jobs at Apple.  The best thing to do is just stay away from Steve because you don't know, depends on his mood.  Gets in the elevator, Jobs looks at him and says, what do you do for me?  And the guy says, oh, I work in such and such department.  He says, I hate that department.  You guys suck.  I haven't seen a good pro, you're fired.  And he gets out of the elevator and Jobs has this woman that follows him around who says to the guy,  don't worry about it.  He says, it's just Steve.  You're still, you still have a job.  And they, everywhere he goes.  Oh, I believe it too.  Cause Steve has somewhat of a temper.  That's a nightmare.  And by the way, I've just checked.  We're now number 43 on the podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right at the bottom there.  It was fun while it lasted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'll be off next week.  We're gone.  We're history.  I said the, I said the S word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you think Steve Jobs has ever, I was, I was watching back during the beginning of CS  and Bill Gates was doing his intro speech.  And of course he needs a little, he's not as personal, I guess.  So he needed the help of Conan O'Brien.  So they did it.  Conan O'Brien interviews Bill Gates.  And as things just started to go wrong and you could see like his lips just perched and,  and you're thinking in your head, how many people are going to get fired right now?  Because of what just happened to blue screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then two, one of those, one of the Xbox one on windows.  That's such to have on the Xbox.  I have, yeah.  How hard is it to crash an Xbox for crying out loud?  At least it was a beta game, I guess.  I've never seen an Xbox crash.  And mine's hacked to hell.  I mean, nobody's ever seen one crash.  That's why we were all excited.  It was incredible.  Bill, you've done something nobody's ever been able to do before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are they really, really going to release that Xbox 360 before the end of the year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're saying November 4th.  I heard last.  I don't know.  Anybody know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People pre-ordering them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there's no confirmation, but they, they, they better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not like it's an operating system or something where they can slide for a couple years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you feel like Microsoft's got a little bit of a flop sweat going?  There's a little panic going up there in Redmond, maybe just a little bit of worry.  Longhorn not going too well.  This spyware, this virus stuff not looking too good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sometimes you got to think they got to be looking at the ginormous bank account.  The fact that they basically own half of the talented research scientists in,  in the computing industry and the, you know, and the 80% market share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why doesn't Bill just lay everybody off, give them each a million bucks and go home?  So we're done.  Well, the shareholders should be.  It's been gross.  I think that's a great idea.  Just, you know, we're done.  He could give the shareholders of their value, give them pay off their stock,  give them 50% on their stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the company's dead in the water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think it looks good.  I just don't see any progress anymore over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now is that John Dvorak, the betting man speaking, or is that John Dvorak,  the columnist that likes to incite riots?  I got it.  I'm not that I'm the, I agree with John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree with John.  I, I've never seen it for the last year has not been a good time for Microsoft.  And I don't see any movement.  They're just not coming.  You know, everything they do turns to stone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Xbox is the only saving grace they've got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we'll see.  We'll see.  You think, you know, who knows?  I mean, I look at it.  They were able to convince IBM to give them the one thing Steve Jobs couldn't get out of them,  which is a three gigahertz Pentium power PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it hasn't shipped yet, has it?  And it's also a different ship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm sure Steve would have loved, you know, a three core G five.  Isn't that what it is at three, three gigahertz plus.  Gosh, I would have loved that.  I have to say though, for Windows, PC gaming wouldn't be what it is today without it.  Unified a lot of hardware standards and be that video or audio as well as control.  I agree.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a lot of stuff.  Yeah.  Would that be direct that direct X alone, never having to create another DOS boot disk.  I agree.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there was something to be said though, for back in the DOS days of running a single  application as fast as the system.  I think it's time for Microsoft to say, you know, we've done a great job.  We feel we've really produced some great products.  Thanks so long and thanks for all the fish and see you later.  Just wrap it up.  Is it as a company ever done that just said, you know, we're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're all rich enough, not a publicly held company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Processer technology kind of did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They said it's over.  You know, we've kind of shot our wad.  Thank you.  See you later.  We're all going to go, you know, sail our boats.  What would Steve do?  I mean, not Steve, Bill do.  I mean, here's a guy with a something something's under his

Transcript:  He's got a full-time job giving money away now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  His dad is, has got this new thing.  He's in town today.  Bill Gates, senior is promoting a world peace or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  World peace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Peace world world peace.  It's a new vegetable treat.  It's exciting from Microsoft.  Creamy cream.  I think we better wrap this up.  We had so many voices.  We didn't really have time for listener questions.  Actually, I'll be honest with you.  I couldn't figure out how to get them up on my board, but we're using the new board.  This is exciting.  We're almost ready to take this thing on the road.  We've got a great Mackie mixer with a Firewire IO.  I'm recording now onto the hard drive.  We're actually pretty much spending all the money people have given us.  We've got a new box coming to record onto.  And I think that probably once Kevin, once you get up here,  in September, I think we should do this show before a live audience.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think we should shoot it too.  And you know, then we can release it through iTunes as a video people could download as well.  It'd be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we're looking for a restaurateur, a bar owner, a cafe owner, someone in the Bay area.  It would be nice to be San Francisco or Marin where we could get together on a Sunday afternoon.  You know, eight or so of us record.  We'd probably like to have a live audience.  You'd probably get, you know, a few people in the restaurant or the cafe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's always good to have those first couple of trial shows in front of an audience.  I agree.  Sweat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I talk about flop sweat.  So if there's anybody interested, please, you know, send me an email, drop us a line.  Leo at thisweekintech.com.  Because I'd sure love to do that.  I think this is what this is what's next for us.  I think that's what we got to do to make this work.  And we've certainly we've got the equipment now.  I think we're pretty much set on that.  So I'd like to.  Would you join us, John, if we did this live somewhere in the Bay area?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't gone in like six years, John.  It's big.  It's expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And John, you go to Burning Man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I went to the first one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was what the one on the beach at Ocean Beach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I drove by a bonfire.  That was it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was there.  There were four people dancing around a bonfire at Ocean Beach.  That was the burning man.  They probably have, they sell action figures.  They have concessions.  It's got to be commercial now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's a classic like you should have been here in the summer of 68.  That's when San Francisco was real.  I mean, it is huge.  I think they expect some 35,000, 40,000 people this year at Burning Man.  Oh, that's the last place I want to be.  In the sense of an autonomous community coming together over a matter of weeks  and disappearing over a matter of weeks, it's still pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's go hang out in the desert with 45,000 crazy people on Ecstasy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, there's a lot less of that than you'd think.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm not saying there's not a fair amount of it, but it's...  Yeah, there's too many naked men.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Naked Burning Men.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My wife described Burning Man as naked men on bicycles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  Eeeeee!  You know, as somebody...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not quite that bad.  Or at least it wasn't last time I was there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was six years ago.  That's true.  Odds can happen in six years.  Scary thought.  Robert Heron, you can catch his work of course PCMag.com, right?  Yeah, that and FromTheShadows.tv.  We just put out box four.  And I've got to say, I'm very proud of this episode.  We covered a lot of cool stuff and even had a good...  I don't know, almost like a anxious segment at the end dealing with someone who developed a  piece of technology that lets you go through red lights.  Oh, geez.  So, did you get arrested?  No.  Did you get stopped?  No, it was...  Pretty crazy, I will say that, but an interesting view.  And Mr. David Prager...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Someday, someday there'll be a davidprager.com.  It exists, I have it, and I will put something there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what?  Prager, at least plug where you work now, man.  And...  I'm sorry?  He says plug where you work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At least plug where you work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because he works for you.  There's a new...  Well, I think we should plug it when we've got...  We want to win the next episode.  It's coming out pretty soon.  It's going to be cool.  We did.  We did.  The site just got updated, revision3.com.  Oh, you have a revision3.com site?  Yeah, and we got the forums up now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so it's not system.org, it's revision3?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  System.org forwards now.  We have...  We're trying to create...  Put all the brands underneath one site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Geez, this guy.  Okay, I'm taking votes.  How many months before Kevin Rose breaks a million dollars?  It...  You know, before 2005 is over, I think.  Mr. Entrepreneur.  Yeah, he's the...  He's the Mark Cuban of the Twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Only if he sells at the right time and pockets the cash and buys a basketball.  I think he's going to be smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think he's going to do it.  I'm the Captain Crunch of the Twits.  John Draper.  My teeth are falling out of his speech.  People follow you around with HD cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, God, he used to come on the screensavers and we had to go give him a ride and find  where he was and get him into the studio.  Get him out of jail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  I remember hanging out with Captain Crunch in San Jose in the early 80s, I think it was.  He always wanted to wrestle.  That was his thing.  He wanted to take you in the back room and wrestle you.  I understand he wrestled.  He and Woz and Jobs liked to wrestle.  Or rassle, I think is what he calls it.  Rassling.  Rassling?  Rassle.  So you like gladiator movies?  I never...  I never wrestled with Captain Crunch.  Probably a wise choice.  I think you'd have to towel off afterwards.  I do believe there was toweling involved, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Any of us explain who Captain Crunch is for the vast multitude?  Who's...  Captain Crunch is one of the original phone freaks named for detecting that the whistle  in Captain Crunch's serial would pull up the long distance dial code back in the early  AT&T freaking phone freaking, which is basically hacking phone systems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the frequency was?  That's right.  Kilohertz.  Or hertz.  Was it...  I think it was 2600 hertz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  2600 hertz tones AT&T used to facilitate long distance calling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Brilliant guy.  What else for the day?  It's a little out there, but a brilliant guy.  For more about Captain Crunch, visit your local library.  Or Wikipedia.
