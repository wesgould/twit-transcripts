Transcript:  Did anything happen with Apple this week? Maybe here and there we'll see we'll talk a little bit about that  But we've got we got lots of stuff and joining me one of my favorite guests on a podcast I used to do called  Download and I'm glad to have him here on Twitter I asked for him personally it is Devendra Devendra Hardwar  I always it's been too long I'm out of practice now it's Devendra Hardwar from Engadget in the flesh in a TV screen for me  Hello hello thank you for having me I'm looking forward to chatting with all you folks  Yeah and we've got we've got some entertainment related things too and I know that you in your spare time you also do some  Entertainment podcasting so we're gonna the tech world the entertainment world they're all jamming together now it's a mess  You get your peanut butter and your chocolate your chocolate and your peanut butter it happens  It's awesome Happy Halloween  But let's start not about tech and not about or not about Apple and not about tech and streaming colliding  Let's start about the smart home smart home some news this week that I think it's worth talking about  Google bought Fitbit I mean that's the short version of it Google wrote a big check bought Fitbit  Interesting background here the Apple watch came out and everybody said smart watches are going to be big  The Apple watch has done pretty well Android wear not so much Samsung is doing its thing  But you know who's been doing really well with wearables on your wrist all along it's Fitbit  I know a lot of people who say I don't even have an Apple watch I have a Fitbit and I love it and it's done really well  Well here we are well well well Google is buying Fitbit and I linked to a story on the verge that was pretty good about this  Which is basically like well is it going to be like HTC's phone division or is it going to be like Nest poor Nest  Nest just keeps getting brought up and Dieter Bohn at the verge brought it up as a  Or Motorola we all forget that  It's Motorola  I guess there's good ways to get swallowed by Google and there are bad ways  It seems like mostly bad  So yeah Devendra let's start with you how do you feel about this news I mean should people who like Fitbit be excited that they've got the backing of Google behind them this huge company or should they be worried that it's all going to get ruined  I feel like Fitbit users have a right to be concerned just because Google has not proven itself to be the best steward of older platforms  And I think Fitbit was really good at doing like it's one thing right fitness tracking building the really interesting activity sensors  On the smartwatch side of things you know we reviewed all their recent ones they're fine but they could never be as good as the Apple watch so Fitbit needed a push  Certainly Google needed a big push because I feel like even Google forgot Android Wear exists  So it seems like this is pretty symbiotic but I don't I have this running theory that Google is just terrible at hardware and they bring in all these companies to try to help them out and maybe it'll work out this time  It's just I don't yeah I wouldn't bet on it  I think there's a real question about whether they're bringing them in to make a new direction because the reason Fitbit you mentioned it the reason they've done so well in part is because they have stuck to their knitting to a certain degree  And said we're about fitness we're not going to try to be everything to everybody and Apple sort of learned that lesson too  Dan you sat next to me at that Apple event where they announced the Apple watch and they sort of were all over the place and they have refined their message a lot in the last few years  And I just I wonder is Apple or is Google buying a refined message here with Fitbit and saying no no no it really is primarily about fitness

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's a big part of it I mean obviously like you said Apple tried a whole bunch of stuff they kind of threw everything at the wall and eventually settled on fitness whereas Fitbit has been doing fitness all along  So like they kind of clearly have their mission mapped out for them there  Google obviously they can get a big leg up in this department I think that's one major advantage here is like Devinder said like with Android Wear kind of being like a thing they seem to have largely shrugged about  It seems like maybe Fitbit gives them an established brand to hook into they have a lot of very loyal users and hey if it doesn't work out then you know it breaks in a year they can just buy another company because that's what everybody would ever have had a Fitbit in the process  So you know I think that it seems like a good combination but I agree that Google's had sort of a bad history when it comes to acquiring hardware brands  They either seem to sort of peter out or they just seem like they lose something essential about themselves and I feel like this to me this feels a little bit like when Yahoo bought Flickr right like everyone was like Flickr very specific focus like it's great  Yahoo's going to throw some money into this and at the end of the day Yahoo really could not figure out what to do with Flickr and I worry that Google will have the same approach to Fitbit

Transcript:  I'm going to push back a bit I think Fitbit was beloved and people who had them really loved them but I don't think they were particularly successful and I think that was part of the reason they sold  It's just really hard to be an independent hardware company and they ended up going for not even two times their valuation which is not a very good number for them and we saw that with Eero and Amazon and we've seen that with a bunch of companies that tried to make it on their own  And I agree with Davinda completely they're just Google has not really proven themselves with hardware they have a super successful software operating system with Android but they've never managed to make it work with tablets not with smartwatches  They folded their pixel slate division pixels have tremendous algorithms but the hardware has always been pretty commodity and it's never sold particularly well and my guess is that the thing that people love about Fitbit is Fitbit itself and just moving that hardware over to Google and having them make some hybrid of Wear OS and Fitbit which you know is just going to plug all that data into Google and I think that's actually what they bought I think they see the potential for health and they see just how much health they have  data you can accumulate and they don't have a successful harvesting tool for that and I think they're hoping that if they can plug everything about Fitbit into Google's complex they'll be able to get all that health care data which is also why I don't think they're particularly nervous about people like the offered you can delete your data from Fitbit if you don't trust us I think they're looking forward to all the data they can collect going forward  And Renee you're absolutely right I don't think Fitbit would have survived on its own for like another year or two like that's a company it is so tough to be a tiny hardware company and it's hard to compete with whatever Apple's doing like at this point the Apple Watch can save lives you know because of the fault detection and the heart rate monitor they're going to have to do to make sure that they're not going to get a heart attack and that's something that we're still going to see in the future.

Transcript:  And the Silicon is so hard like we've seen Qualcomm Qualcomm has to make money on every chipset they make and they can do that in phones because there's so many but there's just no platform for selling watch Silicon and they're not going to be able to do that and they're not going to be able to do that in the future.

Start time: 584.06
End time: 614.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there's just no platform for selling watch Silicon so their first chip was a rehashed old phone chip second one was that chip rehashed with a coprocessor and trying to do another one and meanwhile Apple is sticking systems and packages in our ears and that's going to be a hard thing to compete with.  There's something in your ear right now too.  It seems like Google has the cash injection that they might need for that right like in a perfect world Google shovels them a bunch of money and that allows them to sort of build out a lot of the processes they couldn't do as a small hardware company but at the same time they're going to be able to do that.

Transcript:  Personally, I think that Fitbit was such a good steward of Pebble that they deserve whatever they get.

Start time: 657.36
End time: 739.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I mean talk about independent hardware companies having a hard time Pebble was the first one I thought of and of course Fitbit ended up buying out Pebble.  I think there is a really interesting distinction between being a successful business and gaining traction with an audience and I feel like the reason that I mentioned Fitbit positively is not necessarily because they weren't burning money and seeking an exit but because I see a lot of those products being used and I talk to people who love them and I think it's interesting because when everybody in the industry started running in the same direction which is the direction of the Apple watch that's where Android wear went that's where Samsung took its wearable.  You know, it's watches and stuff too.  Fitbit didn't and maybe they didn't because they couldn't but they didn't.  They said look we're going to be first and foremost a device for activity tracking and fitness and then we'll add some other features on top of it and when I talk to people who love Fitbit that's why they like it is the simplicity of it and it does make me wonder, you know, whether that was secret sauce or whether it just was happenstance.  Does Google look at that and say okay maybe this is the lesson to learn here is that we were trying to attack this and be all things to all people and that the success you've got with a product like this is that it's not going to be everything.  We're not going to compete with Apple directly.  We're going to compete with them kind of at an angle with Fitbit.  I don't know.  Well, don't forget the Fitbit.

Transcript:  Fitbit survived this first wave of activity trackers and there were a ton of companies doing it, right?  We forget about Jawbone.  Jawbone had a lot of funding.  Jawbone also was the pioneer of wireless speakers and they were kicking butt for so long.  I honestly love the Jawbone Up.  That was great hardware.  When it worked, their software was great, but they kind of flamed out.  And now it's really Fitbit and Garmin.  Microsoft Band.  Yeah.  And Microsoft Band.  A lot of things flamed out.  Fitbit was the last independent company left standing.  And now, yeah, maybe Google can have them continue to focus.  I feel like Google has not done much of a health device push on its own, too.  So I'd expect something more interesting than just another activity tracker from them.

Transcript:  It seems like the big advantage there would potentially be integration, right?  Which is what Apple has going for it with the Apple Watch, right?  It's so tightly tied into iOS.  All your notifications, all the interactions you can do with it.  The fact that you can unlock your Mac.  You can authorize stuff on your Mac now.  That's all a huge advantage.  And that plays straight into Apple's strengths, which are these integrations of hardware, software, and services.  Google has the services and the software, like you've said before, the hardware has always been sort of a weak spot for them.  So is this an opportunity for them to build something that does compete at that level that can offer the same kind of integration that the Apple Watch offers for iOS users, but instead for Android users?  In theory, it seems like that's what Android Wear should have been.  But it doesn't seem like a handout that way.

Transcript:  I was just going to approve Dan's joke earlier and say maybe Google just had they had Android Wear clipped to their belt and they thought it was there and then it looked and it was gone.  And they're like, I guess we got to buy another Fitbit.  Well, the third party is right away.  Like that was the thing, right?  So all the support died.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do want to talk about Apple here just because there was another report today and this was from Bloomberg or this week about Apple revamping its smart home efforts.  We had already heard earlier this year that they had brought in somebody new to run their smart home business.  And then this new Bloomberg story, you know, it's going to tell a narrative about Apple falling behind in the number of HomeKit products that are out there.  The idea here is that perhaps Apple is going to be considering entering some smart home product areas that they either abandon or not currently and really stepping up their game here.  Renee, I know you watch this stuff closely.  What do you think about this report?  Is Apple in the midst of rethinking how it approaches the smart home market?

Start time: 918.04
End time: 973.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.  First, let me just get meta for a second, because I love business publications.  When Google buys Fitbit, it's like Google buys Fitbit to take on Apple.  When Apple buys or brings in somebody, it's like struggling failing Apple tries to rejuvenate their efforts.  It's always like the narratives are so interesting to me.  But I think I think that's true.  I mean, it's it's a market that Apple brought a really good speaker to us to a commodity smart speaker market, and they haven't done particularly well with it.  And they haven't done a lot of other products.  And those products that did exist have been bought and sealed away.  You know, Amazon bought Ring and is buying bought Echo.  They've got an investment in Echo B. Google has all these products.  Samsung has their own routers.  Google has their own routers.  Apple got rid of their routers.  And I think that they they don't own the key components that are necessary to be competitive in the home.  And the components that were really, really good have all been bought.  And a lot of them mysteriously have not delivered on the home get functionality they promised before they were bought.  And I think that ends up being a big problem at the end of the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I think it's an opportunity for Apple to lead by example in the home kid arena where they can actually produce stuff first party potentially and say, like,  Look at all the cool stuff you can do with home kit and like you kind of show off all the features because there's stuff there that's differentiators they have.  They've hammered on, but it's not stuff yet that has really made its way into the grand scheme of things.  So, for example, the privacy stuff, the stuff they talked about last year at WBC when they talked about the home kit router support and being able to say store your security cam footage in your iCloud, which has more privacy and security restrictions than some other third party provider.  I think the ability for them to sort of say, like, all right, let's put it together ourselves, which again plays to their strengths of integration.  It always struck me as strange that they decided to launch this sort of protocol.  Home kit was very slow to get off the ground.  It got much better once they started doing things like not requiring everyone to build in hardware authentication chips.  But it's also one of those things where I think in order to show off all the things it's really great at, it would really help Apple to sort of create a template and be like, here,  here is an example of a fantastic home kit, smart home technology, here are all the benefits it has, and here's why you should choose it over another smart home ecosystem.

Start time: 1048.56
End time: 1159.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I feel like the big reason Apple has not really hit this out of the park is also because nobody has.  You know, I feel like going to CS over the last five years, honestly, since like frickin since 2010, since I started going like everyone's talking about the smart home, there are all these competing standards.  There's a lot of stuff going on, but it's a lot of talk.  And I think the functional, you know, the functional benefits to a lot of consumers is not quite there.  It's there for a couple of products. It's there for like the Nest thermostat.  It's there for the Hue light bulbs.  But that's kind of it. And beyond that, it's like a lot of little things that people, you know, may or may not like security cameras and things like that.  But this also feels like a market where Apple has this tendency to sit back a little and watch how everybody else plays out while they, you know, dog food their stuff internally to try to get the best out of it.  To try to offer a better option. And right now nobody has even done anything that's super successful.  So Apple has had to kind of to me, that's why HomeKit took so long to even get going is kind of maybe they were waiting to see what everybody else was doing.  And even that was slow to get going.  Apple does have this dichotomy between wanting to control everything and also wanting to get other companies to build things so that they don't have to.  And, you know, you saw it with HomeKit, as Dan mentioned, that they were like, you need a hardware authentication chip.  And then nobody did it. They said, OK, how about some software? We could do it that way.  And they backed off of it. And I do wonder if Apple came out with a product in a class, whatever it would be, a lock or a camera or whatever, maybe a Wi-Fi base station.  What would that message would they send?  I mean, I fear that the message would be don't get in this market because we're Apple and we're going to own it.  So like being a partner of Apple, it's a challenge, right?  Like they have to find a way to make it a welcoming environment.  People want to be in HomeKit and take advantage of Apple's ecosystem without getting stomped on by Apple.

Start time: 1160.22
End time: 1212.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a weird self-contradictory message there, too, because, like, for example, I would love Apple to get back in the router market.  And I think all the stuff they talked about at WWC in terms of integrating HomeKit stuff into the router makes a lot of sense.  And they can sort of skate by there because they can point out we were in the router market.  We certainly didn't dominate that market by any means.  So there is still an opportunity for third parties there.  But it always struck me as strange. They decided to get out of that market right around the time it kind of felt like we could really use them in that market,  especially as things like privacy and security are getting to be much, much bigger concerns for consumers, especially related to smart home devices.  Right. Like there's one story after another about malware that's starting to infect smart home devices.  And it feels like if Apple gets to be the one to push the narrative of, hey, we can secure this and lock it down so that you don't have to worry that your light bulbs are going to compromise your computer.  That feels like a big win for me.

Start time: 1213.42
End time: 1243.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's also interesting that the whole Apple thing with the HomeKit by itself is a framework.  And that's the name they went to market with. It's not Apple Home or anything much more consumer friendly.  It's like marketing the iPhone is like UI kit. It's just or the Mac is app kit.  They don't do that normally. And it doesn't feel as friendly as approachable.  It doesn't have anywhere nearly the partner support. And Samsung, again, they have all their own stuff.  And Amazon has all their own stuff. And Google has all their own stuff. And Apple doesn't.  And I think that's increasingly a competitive cause of concern for them.

Transcript:  Yeah, for sure. I look at the HomePod as like a prime example to you of like how I guess it's a smart home device to as a smart speaker, but it's not compatible with Bluetooth.  You really you really need Apple Music to use that thing like it's locked down in so many ways.  It's inconvenient to anybody who's not a part of the Apple ecosystem. So not a huge surprise.  It wasn't a major success. But the other thing, too, is like the practical ways of using HomeKit.  How do you how do you get a HomeKit hub? Well, I Googled it.  And if you have an Apple TV, if you have an iPad, if you have a HomePod, you could set that up as a hub.  But the practical ways of like using HomeKit products is also kind of tough.  It's hard. They haven't really sold the benefits and they haven't really sold a way to like make your life easier with any of these things.

Start time: 1288.14
End time: 1310.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. There's a messaging issue that needs to be working out there.  I think that's a big part of it is like if you if you already know if you're already in the tech sphere and you're kind of like savvy about smart home stuff,  you can kind of figure out how to make it work. I've got a great HomeKit set up here.  But like it's not a thing that I would ever recommend necessarily to my average non techie friend to be like, oh, yeah, you definitely need to set up all your light bulbs on the Internet because it's really, really a huge success there.

Transcript:  Well, it is early days. There's no doubt about it.  Whether there's an advantage that's going to bear out or whether it's, you know, all to play for or whether it never ends up being quite as big a deal as everybody wants to be remains to be seen.  We have so much more to talk about on Twitter.  The new Apple AirPods Pro came out, the streaming wars.  We found out more about HBO Max and what that's going to be.  And of course, Apple TV plus finally launched after two years of talking about it.  New things in social media.  And I want to talk about I lost power for three days.  Some interesting tech angles to the California fires and blackouts.  Lots to talk about.  But first, I need to take a break because Leo, who is currently on assignment, I think he's floating in a cloud somewhere.  But before he left, he had some special messages and he's going to deliver one to you right now.

Transcript:  Having a great time this week on Twitter.  I'm stepping back in just for a moment to tell you about LastPass because I'm the resident expert here at Twitter.  I've been using LastPass for 10 years.  Love LastPass.  It was a few years ago that we had a little kind of an identity crisis here at Twitter.  One of our employees put all of his passwords, including like important stuff like website and so forth on the web, on a public website, because he can remember his passwords.  That's when Russell said, you know, I put my clients on LastPass.  Maybe you should too.  Thank you, Russell.  We love LastPass.  It wasn't hard.  I've been using LastPass forever.  LastPass personal.  Actually, it's called premium.  That's the one I was using.  Then, of course, when I got married, Lisa and I started using LastPass families.  We could easily share passwords with one another.  She's also my designated emergency access.  If anything should happen to me, I think that's really important.  One of my favorite features.  You know, it's great about LastPass.  They're always adding new features, new ideas like this for LastPass enterprise.  Over 43,000 organizations use LastPass in their business like us.  And honestly, this is a big deal.  You're probably accessing different password protected accounts all over the place, whether smartphone apps on your watch.  On the web, your laptop.  The LastPass mobile app.  Ah, yes, the LastPass mobile app lets you continue to have the safety and security of logging in anytime, anywhere.  One master password LastPass remembers the rest.  And the mobile app works everywhere you are.  Your LastPass account is backed up and synced across all your devices.  But it's only decrypted ever, only decrypted on your device.  And it locks itself if the device locks itself.  So I never worry.  In fact, I trust LastPass so much.  As I travel, I'm on vacation.  I put my passport, my Social Security numbers, my driver's license, everything.  I put it in LastPass.  That's the most secure place I've got for storing my most important documents.

Transcript:  Thank you, Leo.  Sometimes I come on this show and there's very exciting new hardware that's been announced.  New computers, new phones.  Leo often has a brand new phone that is the latest in his weekly purchases of smartphones.  I think he's got a subscription plan.  Just every smartphone comes to Leo's house.  It's very nice.  This week, not that much in the realm of new hardware, but Apple did with no fanfare really beyond sort of a press release, release new AirPods.  And AirPods, obviously very, very well liked the original AirPods.  I've got mine here.  And this time we got AirPods Pro.  How do you make professional pro, whatever that means, headphones?  Well, let me show you what's going on here.  So these are new.  They're noise canceling.  They're in ear.  They've got silicone tips.  Let me show for people watching the video.  These are the old kind, you know, familiar.  They've got the buds with the long stems.  This new case, it's wide.  It's much wider than the old one.  And inside are buds that are larger because they've got the silicone tips and they've got smaller stems.  And they've got a new feature, which is instead of kind of whacking the side of your head in order to go to the next track or the previous track, you actually squeeze a little area on the stem itself.  And that's the thing that will advance you forward or back.  There's actually a little force sensitive area and you squeeze it.  And if you squeeze and hold, you can turn on something called transparency mode, which is a pass through mode or full on noise cancellation as much as any earbuds can be noise canceling because they're not completely covering your ears.  So I know that two members of my panel join me in having a pair of these AirPods Pro.  Dan, let's start with you.  What are you thinking?  You're not wearing them right now.  You got the over ears on right now.  How are you feeling about AirPods Pro a few days in?  I do have them here.

Transcript:  I'm struggling a little bit, and that's mainly because I'm not a person who likes earbuds or in ear headphones that much.  I usually prefer over ear headphones.  And some of it is struggling with just the fit for me.  For whatever reason, my ears don't work great with in ear headphones.  I will say in my experience in the last few days wearing them, they are the best in ear headphones I have ever worn in terms of comfort.  And, you know, in terms of all the other features they offer, especially integration with iOS stuff.  But fundamentally, what they fell down for me is still just being silicone tipped in ear headphones that I just I have trouble getting a good seal in one of my ears.  I've tried the whole like switching the different tips which they allow.  But I just I always feel like I'm worried one of them is going to fall out or I don't have like a really good sound in one ear.  And so that's the biggest problem.  I really want to love them because all the features that I use, I really kind of are delightful.  So, for example, you know, the fact that it pauses when you take your ear your earbud out, which obviously the original AirPods did as well.  I really like the four sensor.  I think it's a it's satisfying haptic style control.  And I think the sound is pretty darn good for something that's that small.  And these are impressively small.  I will have to say you compared the stems being much shorter.  And I feel like walking around and seeing a lot of people wearing the original AirPods, you know, they're pretty good.  They're pretty small.  But at the same time, you would sort of notice those long white stems and think, it looks a little looks a little dorky, doesn't it?  And I think that Apple has improved their design a lot with these.  But at the end of the day, I'm just a little worried that, like, I will not find them comfortable enough to replace the other headphones that I tend to wear all the time.  And can I then justify a two hundred fifty dollar purchase for something that I'll only be kind of on?  So I think that's where I'm struggling.  I've worn them a bunch in the last couple of days, walked around town with them, tried them in a coffee shop.  The noise cancelling stuff is great.  I'm really impressed by it.  It's not perfect.  I would think my QC 35 Bose headphones still do a better job on average.  But again, for earbuds, they're pretty darn impressive.  So I wish I could love them more, but I'm a little stuck on just the sad fact that my ears are broken.  Yeah, you're hearing it wrong, Dan.

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I had a similar I have a similar issue with Dan is that my ears have been grappled into mushy oblivion and the previous AirPods.  The left one would stay in pretty much most of the time, but the right one I always had issues with these.  I can get both of them to stay in.  I did the test and it said it was fine on the medium, but they didn't stay in that well.  So I switched to the small and they're staying in way better.  So that I really like about them.  I haven't been a huge fan of noise cancelling before.  I did have the Bose, the original Bose in here, and I've had a variety of over the year.  I even have the new Beats Solo Pro on here and I find those just a little bit claustrophobic like it shuts out too much of the world.  And I just love the the sleekness of AirPods.  So this to me, they have all the convenience like it just so easy to pair so easy to switch so easy to control all of that from the original AirPods.  Plus the advantage of noise cancellation when I really want or need it, which is like being on a plane or being on a train or just we've had really bad winds like 106 kilometer an hour winds.  And it shakes the whole place.  It was super noisy and I put these in no music, no video, nothing.  And it just took all of that out.  And it was it probably it probably wouldn't help me see the cars come flying at the windows, but it did help me sort of relax and get the work done that I needed to.  So still no colors, you know, which I think is a bit of a bummer because those were rumored as well.  And there's still like one or two other little things and people who are high end audiophiles or golden ears will tell you maybe they don't sound as good as the Sony or they don't sound as good as the cans that you put over your ears.  But I don't have anywhere nearly that quality of hearing.  So to me, they're they're really great.

Transcript:  Yeah, I I'm an in-ear headphone guy, so I've never liked the over your headphones.  And I did actually buy for various reasons a pair of Sony noise, noise canceling headphones last year to wear on various plane rides.  And they were fine.  But I look at these and I think if these can get me what I got out of those Sony's or even close, even if they don't sound as good, even if they don't block out as much sound.  One of the things that Apple made a big deal about is that they have a vent system in them so that they're not going to kind of have lead to sort of pressure imbalances, which is was my problem with my old in-ear headphones is that I would take them on on flights and the pressure imbalance would give me like headaches and things like that.  Very bad.  And so I'm intrigued by this and I want to try them out on on on a plane, quite frankly.  Quite frankly, but and I regret buying the Sony noise canceling headphones now because I really don't like the over ear headphones.  So for me, as somebody who likes sticking these earbuds in your ear canal, it works pretty well for me, although, you know, again, it's not a custom fit, which I'm actually more accustomed to.  It is nice that although Apple, of course, reinvented the connector, of course they did.  It is a connector that presumably will be knocked off by almost everybody.  And so if you don't like the three different sizes of tips that Apple keeps in the box includes in the box with the AirPods Pro, you can go out probably within days.  If not, then soon.  And and there will probably be some other options from third parties because everybody will knock it off.  And maybe you can find a perfect fit.  But I'm you know, I'm yeah.  Yeah, sure.  I don't think there's going to be a licensing program for it.  I think you're going to seek the seek the gray market.  It's really interesting.  So Devendra, I know you haven't had a chance to play with these.  It is interesting.  They're bringing these in above the existing AirPods, which aren't going away.  It costs fifty dollars more than the regular AirPods with the Qi charging case.  These are, you know, two hundred and fifty dollar pair of earbuds.  They're they're not cheap.  But at the same time, the AirPods have done incredibly well.  So, you know, what do you think is going to happen with these?  Are they going to be a hit like that was?  I don't like I see a lot of people complaining about that premium.  And honestly, I don't think the two hundred dollar AirPods.  I don't know if we've ever gotten like broken down sales because 40 bucks more than the what?  One hundred sixty dollars standard AirPods with the normal case.  It doesn't seem worth it for the Qi charging just because she is slow and honestly less convenient.  So that that never really seemed like a good bet for me.  The AirPods were kind of standouts because they were one of the first wireless buds to kind of do that thing well, sound decent, have good reception, not have the pairing issues as others have had.  I personally haven't been a huge fan.  I feel like talking about weird ears.  I think my my ears are just so funky because I can't hold any AirPods in my head for too long.  If I move my head, if I shake a little, they come flying out.  So I'm very happy.  There's finally another option with the silicone tips.  It will presumably stay in place more.  We should talk about some of the competitors.  And I feel like you guys mentioned the Sony cans, which I really love.  Those are fantastic.  But they did also just release earbuds to the WF 1000 XM3s.  And those coming at two hundred thirty dollars.  Those things sound like miracle earbuds to me.  Like they sound as good as high quality in earbuds.  And the noise cancelling isn't as good as the over the year version, but it's still pretty good.  The only downside is that those are much, much bigger than the AirPods.  They don't look as sleek.  But yeah, I think if somebody is a quality really concerned about quality, maybe wants better noise cancelling.  Those seem like a solid option.  And those are two hundred thirty bucks, too.  So, you know, Apple's pricing does seem a little much given that the best competition out there right now is coming in much slower.  I see. I look at that and I think, wow, only twenty dollars more for the Apple product.  That shows some restraint on Apple's part.  Sure.  You have to round up even further when you're looking at the Apple product there.  And yeah, you know, in ear earbuds are never going to be the same as as as the cans.  I think it's interesting to see the competition here.  You know, I think it's funny, Apple has done really well with the AirPods, despite I don't think anyone would say that they have the highest quality sound.  Right. That's never been a thing for them.  And it's funny. All of you have mentioned the shape of the ears.  Something that Apple mentioned to me when I was talking to them about this that I haven't heard a lot of discussion of.  And they they didn't go too far down this path.  But I read some things into it that I think are interesting, which is that they did for the original ear pods, which then got turned into the air pod shape.  But they're basically the same as the wired headphones that they made.  They had a base of ears that they measured in order to kind of come up with a universal fit, quote unquote, for their for their earbuds.  What they say is that for this product, they they went around the world and measured many more ears in order to figure out what the universe of ear sizes and shapes was.  And, you know, they didn't go much beyond that.  But that strikes me as being actually kind of one of these Silicon Valley stories where they measure a bunch of their friends in Silicon Valley and say, we've got it.  We've got the universal ear fit.  And then they go out and realize that the world is very big and there are many more ears, shapes and sizes that they weren't aware of.  And that and that might mean that if you've had Apple buds that never fit your ears before, maybe these will do a better job because Apple seems to have understood that their measurements didn't really actually universally fit.

It is funny that Apple is talking about that as some sort of like amazing innovation when like every single frickin headphone company has realized let's let's put three sizes of tips in there.  People have different ears.  And honestly, some people I also feel like I have different size tips for each ear too.  And a lot of folks don't quite realize that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I struggle with that is I'm kind of in the same boat as Renee, which is like I get a good seal in like one ear and the other year.  It's like, no, it doesn't really matter which size you use.  I'm just not going to stay put.  And that's so annoying because it's like I'm halfway there, like 50 percent to getting AirPods Pro and the other percent's like, well, only works in one ear.  I only get mono.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not as good.  And it's very bad for your noise canceling.  Really?  You've got the other ear just totally open.  So what is it?  I think it actually turns it off if you have it in one ear.  They're like, I think it does.  I've noticed that.  Go into accessibility and put it back on.

Transcript:  It's a big step for Apple to to let you choose your your bud tip size.  And we should say that the small, medium and large is all in the box.  So you can you can do it.  And it's this funny connection system where they use their oval shaped and you snap them on and you can feel a little snap and then they attach.  So it's not like the headphones you might be used to where there's sort of a plastic tube and you kind of push the silicone tip over it.  So it's a little bit different.  Of course it is.  Apple has reinvented the silicone tip for earbuds.  Of course, revolutionized.  Of course they did.  But, you know, it's right for the holiday season.  I imagine that they'll sell a lot of them.  I think it's kind of funny given that there was that second generation of the original AirPods earlier this year.  I know a lot of people who bought that generation who are unlikely to jump into AirPods Pro.  But it's hard not to look at the success of the AirPods and think that in the end they're going to sell a lot of these.  Because it just it's what happened with the last product.  People love this product.  It does work amazingly well, even though it's not the best sound.  And certainly if you haven't tried wireless earbuds before, as Javendra said, there are a lot of different models out there.  But maybe if you're like me and you always despaired because all the great noise canceling was in big over ear headphones, you've got options now that don't make your ears sweaty.

Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe it's funny that they weren't talked about at any at the event at the iPhone event.  It seems like they could have just dropped the line about this too.  But maybe that would have been too overcrowded.  Just want to say it is worth mentioning.  Microsoft showed off surface earbuds and those look really like everyone's playing around with fit and comfort.  And I tried those on and they look like earring.  They look like eargages, those big round earrings.  Right.  And they fit really interestingly.  There's no there's no noise canceling.  They're completely open in the way the AirPods are.  But I think the fit is kind of fantastic.  And Google like weirdly teased the pixel the next pixel buds, which will show up maybe next year at some point.  Who knows?  But they look better.  So everyone's getting into this now.  And it kind of makes sense because the tech go buds to write on have.  Yeah.

It seems like the the hardware to make wireless buds has come down quite a bit.  And now we're seeing the really innovative side of things.  And at least there's strong competition.  My vote is for the Sony's.  I've been using those for like the past since they came out and they are the best like headphones to walk around New York with.  Yeah, I think the the advantage that an Apple product might have over the Sony's would be with their wireless chip.  If you're somebody who's in the Apple ecosystem and you're switching among different devices, Apple has got you there because having those Sony headphones, it is a little bit more work to switch from like my iPad to my iPhone to my Mac.  And Apple Apple will do that really well if you're using all Apple products.  So that's but if you're not that's how they get you.  Not an advantage.  That is that is so sneaky.  That is how they get you.

But like having them in, especially with the noise canceling on and you just start talking to Siri and I found in most cases it worked surprisingly well.  But it was kind of interesting to be like walking around and have I think it's the closest you can get to having like a Jarvis from Iron Man kind of like, hey, you know what, Siri, I want to listen to this song.

Transcript:  Hey, I don't want to interrupt, but I have to because I am a FreshBooks customer.  I wanted to tell you about FreshBooks.  It is the number one accounting software in the cloud.  Way back when, 2004, we used to go to Canada to do call for help.  I hated invoicing.  Who does?  Who does love invoicing?  Nobody does.  It's horrible.  But you have to do it or you don't get paid.  I just put it off.  I was always whining about it.  Amber told me about this brand new company in Toronto, FreshBooks, that had just started up.  I started using it.  It changed my life.  It made it easy to do invoicing.  But the thing about it, with FreshBooks, you're not just really doing invoicing.  It's an accounting solution with no extra effort on your part.  You can automate everything.  Invoicing, organizing expenses.  You can even use the FreshBooks app to take a picture of the expense and put it in an invoice or just keep track of it.  It will automatically download expenses from your bank account.  You can track time and hours.  You know, hit the website, hit the button, and it starts recording.  You have different prices for different projects, even with the same client.  Phone also, you can track hours.  That's fantastic.  Goes right into the invoice.  Follow up with clients.  It's easy.  It's in the app as well as on the website.  In fact, it's all in there, so it makes it so easy to run your business from anywhere.  FreshBooks is always getting better.  Always finding new ways to make your experience better.  They have now the option to access FreshBooks using Google Sign-In, which is nice because that also means you have multi-factor authentication.  That's, as you know, I'm saying everybody needs to turn it on.  It enhances security.  And you can limit or even revoke data access to third-party sites and apps, so your control is much better.  It's like basically hiring a security force to stay in guard over your private information.  Simplicity and security.  It doesn't get any better than that.  If you've already got FreshBooks running and you have a Google account, you can log in using the Google Sign-In one-click process, which is so great.  It just pops up an approval on your phone and says, you approve this login?  Yeah, yeah, that's me.  If you're a small business using a Google account and you want to sign up for FreshBooks, it's that easy.  It's one click, boom, and you're there.  Now, what's stopping you?

Transcript:  Now back to the show.  All right.  This week, Apple joined Amazon Netflix in the realm of being an entertainment provider on their own with Apple Original Programming on the new Apple TV Plus service.  Which debuted November 1st.  Free if you bought a qualifying Apple hardware product in the last couple of months.  And for a year.  And $4.99 a month for everyone else.  Launching, okay, I'm going to say it.  This is whoever the marketing genius who came up with this one, they get a cookie.  Apple is boasting that this service is the world's first originals only streaming service.  What that means is they didn't buy any catalog content.  There's no back catalog.  There's no sitcoms or no repeats or detective shows from the 70s or anything that you've seen before.  It's only a handful of shows that were made specifically for Apple TV Plus.  And there is an argument to be made that with such a limited supply of programming, it's kind of hard for Apple to make the case that this service is worth buying.  Then again, if you bought any Apple hardware in the last couple of months, guess what?  You can get it for a year for free instead of having to pay $4.99 a month.  So the service is out.  The shows are out.  They're not doing a weekly release or a binge drop.  They're doing a hybrid where they've released, I think, three episodes of a lot of shows.  Some things they've dropped a whole season, but they are going to do weekly releases of their top line shows from this point.  So rather than doing the Netflix thing, quite honestly, they don't have enough shows, right?  They would drop them all and then they would go away for several months and nothing would happen on the service.  So instead, they're doing weekly releases after in the case of things like See and The Morning Show and For All Mankind, dropping three episodes on day one.  So we can talk about this from a strategy perspective.  If you've seen the shows, we could talk about whether the shows are any good or not.  I'm going to bet that they're better than Planet of the Apps.  But beyond that, I don't know.  Dan, what have you seen of Apple TV Plus?

Transcript:  I've watched the first three episodes of The Morning Show and that so far that's it.  As far as the originals thing go, it did remind me of I think it was maybe in the late 90s or early 2000s.  NBC had a slogan that they would run sometimes when there were reruns.  If you haven't seen it, it's new to you.  And I always thought that was such a brilliant tautology of like, well, of course, like if you haven't seen it, it's new.  And in the same case, I feel like that's sort of what Apple's spinning here.  I've actually like The Morning Show.  I know that's received kind of mixed reviews.  It's something that kind of appeals to me.  And it's I feel like it reflects certainly that they put a lot of money into the show.  It looks good.  It's got really top talent, even down to like the supporting cast or like there's a lot of faces that you recognize.  Is it the kind of thing that's actually going to go out and win, say, an Emmy?  I don't think so.  I don't think that it will.  But I think it's a solid effort.  And it's enjoyable enough that when I finished the first episode, I kept watching.  And if there had been more, I probably would have kept watching them by now.  So, you know, in some to some extent, that's all that really matters.  And from a larger business question, there is a there is a question of what success looks like for Apple here.  Obviously, if you're giving away your service for a whole year to most of at least your most devoted customers, probably the people most likely to pay for the service,  then obviously you're not pulling in a lot of revenue that's purely based on the content that you've spent millions and millions of dollars.  If not billions of dollars on us.  That's yeah. So you spent a lot of money.  That's a lot of investment to recoup.  And it's not something that you're necessarily pulling in a lot of subscription money from on day one or even on day three sixty five.  So I think this is a larger play from Apple.  And this is still sort of planting their flag in the sand.  You say like, hey, we've got this as an option.  This is, you know, this is a competition to Amazon.  It's part of our whole package that we are sort of offering to people who use the Apple ecosystem.  And, you know, it's going to be it's going to be good stuff.  I mean, like, I think there's nothing so far that I've heard is absolute trash.  I know there's some stuff that has gotten worse reviews than others.  But I think they've realized that to a certain extent in order to exist as this mega tech company in this day and age, that original content for whatever reason is a part of that equation.  So I'm curious to see how they end up justifying sort of like, does it bring in people to buy other devices or subscribe to other services?  What is the end of the day value proposition for this?  Or is it just something that we feel like it's an investment in the longer term ecosystem and it's kind of hard to figure out exactly how much money we're going to make out of it?

Transcript:  Because it's billions of dollars that they're spending on this content.  Billions of dollars.  Renee, this was available in Canada among many, many other countries.  That's one of the things that's unique, I think, in this launch is that Apple built it for international.  And so it's not going to we're going to talk about what AT&T is doing with HBO Max, which is a US only service, essentially.  But you got to see the stuff in Canada, right?

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, there are services that have fairly good like Netflix has built out fairly good international representation.  But because it is so like the licensing model is so fragmented and it's filled with these little different fiefdoms, you don't have the same catalogs globally.  And it's incredibly frustrating.  I'll go to watch some I read I subscribe to CBS All Access and I'll go to watch a show and I'll hit the button and it'll bounce me into one of my local cable apps because they have the rights in Canada.  And then they want me to put in a cable subscription, which I don't have.  And so I can't watch the thing that's part of the service that I'm already paying to watch.  And it's endlessly frustrating.  But because it's originals only, Apple owns all the rights to them and they can put them in hundreds of hundred plus countries right away.  And I think that's great.  I think in general, if Apple decided they had to do it, this was probably the best way for them to do it.  It's a very Apple way to do it.  It's like if we have these billions of dollars, we want to help tell great stories.  Let's go out and let's just tell the best stories like we don't make four phones a year the way one plus does.  We make like we have our shot of phones all at one time.  They're just making a few series all at once and they're going to be top notch series.  I mean, the morning show isn't the newsroom and C is not Game of Thrones by any means.  They started off with good ingredients that weren't stirred very well.  They got better over the episodes.  And to Dan's point, I would have just kept watching the morning show if all the episodes had been available and I would have just kept watching.  See if all the episodes had been there.  And I get why they're not because there's a free week trial and you could probably get through all of the content and cancel immediately if you did that.  But it's good enough and it's getting better with the opening salvo that I'm curious to see.  And I don't know if they necessarily have to make a lot of money here.  I think they just have to get their platform going and then use it to, again, increase the value of the overall Apple ecosystem for people.

Transcript:  Devendra, what do you think? I know you care about TV and film.  What do you think about what Apple's doing here?  I do. And I've been following this closely and I was really excited to see like what would Apple do differently.  And it turns out kind of kind of nothing.  Like my review title is Apple TV Plus is fine.  And it is like none of the shows are terrible.  They're all perfectly watchable in certain ways.  But yeah, the morning, you know, the morning hour feels like the newsroom and it feels a lot like Aaron Sorkin without Aaron Sorkin, as I think the New York Times review had said.  A lot of all these shows in many ways feel like things we've seen before.  And it seems like at least right now, Apple is taking kind of the Netflix approach to some of their content where it's like, well, this is this is OK.  I guess I'll watch this because it's on a service to what Dan was saying.  I think this is the opening salvo.  And I feel like launching this thing in 100 countries, that's pretty impressive because Disney Plus is only I think going to be available in a couple once it launches in November or later this month.  Yeah. So the scale of what Apple did is impressive, showing that they could produce a streaming platform.  I mean, we knew they could deliver the stuff because of iTunes and people have been buying that stuff for a while.  But showing that they could produce original content, it's more like they prove that they can do it.  I'm interested to see where they go from here, especially like that M. Night Shyamalan show coming up soon.  They talked about some content coming into next year to nothing seems incredible.  Nothing seems like, oh, man, I really have to subscribe to this.  It does seem like, oh, this is a nice benefit because I'm an Apple customer because I just bought an iPhone or an iPad or something.  I don't think they're doing this for subscription money at all.  And that's why it costs five dollars for sure.  Yeah, I wonder about stuff, too.

Transcript:  I just want to say it's tough, too, because they've also not done the thing that a lot of the other competitors have done where it's like, let's license, you know, large existing IP or own existing IP.  Disney gets to roll out all its Marvel and Star Wars shows, and that's a huge way to bring people in.  And Netflix obviously had its Marvel shows back in the day and got to use that to sort of bolster its original like early on.  I don't see Apple deciding it wants to play in that pool, certainly not from corporate partners that are that large.  It seems to be a very Apple way of focusing on let's kind of do this ourselves, stem to stern.  And I think that that presents potential challenges for them.  And in terms of them building up their repertoire, I think it's still possible that, you know, a show that comes out next year from them could pick up enough buzz to be the show that drives people to the network.  Right. The water cooler show.  I think that's kind of what they're in search of is there not necessarily Game of Thrones in genre, but Game of Thrones, i.e. the show everyone is talking about when it goes on every week.  That is what they would like.  I just don't think they've necessarily figured out what show that is yet.

Transcript:  It does feel a little bit like these shows were created in a lab.  Oh, yeah.  They're trying to find that they're trying to strike gold.  And I get that.  But I wonder if you're you're actually never going to do that.  If you're trying for the big hit, what you need to do is find some people who are on the verge of superstardom as a writer, as an actor.  And you have they have a great idea.  And it's going to bubble beneath the surface and they're not going to be a thousand stories in The Hollywood Reporter about it.  But it will be the thing that ends up breaking through, just like with Game of Thrones, other than people who had read those books.  Nobody knew anything about it.  And the showrunners had never done anything before.  And it became the biggest TV show ever.  These all feel like, you know, let's go to Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston and craft something like the newsroom or let's spend a lot of money on a high concept thing, kind of like Game of Thrones.  And it gives you see and we'll put Jason Momoa in it.  And OK, great. But they're coming out of the lab.  Are they really going to be able to just look if you can make Game of Thrones in the lab, there would be a hundred Game of Thrones.  And there's only one.  Well, there are a lot of like that, you know, it is it is let's get Ron Moore to do a space show because we like Battlestar Galactica.  And, you know, it's it's a little bit different, but it's like that.  Renee, you were saying.

Transcript:  No, no, I was I was agreeing with you completely.  And I think also they managed to get the big stars by in some ways green lighting the vanity projects from their own production companies.  Sure. Instead of growing them inside Apple, I mean, it's a good mix of both.  And the risk is that not all these vanity projects or these big stars are going to give you the quality of show that you get from a writer producer like Aaron Sorkin or you get from lighting fire to the entire world.

Transcript:  Now, what Apple hasn't done is make a giant deal with a creator like what you've seen elsewhere.  J.J. Abrams, several other creators that that Shonda Rhimes, Ryan Murphy, right?  All of these where they're like, you have established hits and now we're going to give you a lot of money.  And again, the question is, are you going to get a new established hit from that or, you know,  or would you be better off spending all that money on a bunch of people who are up and comers?  And Apple, I think maybe has just been outbid on those.  I don't I'm not sure that's a strategy because they bid on those people famously.  I think there's a part that Abrams turned them down, even though their bid was higher than, you know, other places where he went to.  So I'm really interested in like Apple's creative approach to like what what were they telling him in terms of like what stories you could tell or what restrictions are they going to put on it?  Yeah, and that was a huge bid was double.

Transcript:  And I will say one of the big narratives coming into this launch was Apple.  You know, Tim Cook is giving notes.  Tim Cook is saying you shouldn't really put things on these shows that we can't show in an Apple store.  The most cutting phrase that came up in the entire discussion was that what Apple wanted to do was make expensive NBC shows, which is a real burn.  Let me tell you.  And I got to say, I think that a lot of that came from people who got fired off of shows or were disgruntled in some way.  If you look at the material that's out there, there is no shortage of edgy material in the Apple TV shows.  The three main dramas are all TVMA.  No, it's not. It's not family friendly stuff entirely.

Transcript:  I would say five or ten years ago, before all these before we had this like surfeit of content from all of these different services, I think any one of these might have been a show that really caught people's attention.  But the problem is that these are the bar is so high.  We're in the platinum age now, right?  The peak TV, right?  There is so much stuff that making something stand out really requires it be amazing.  And I think all of the shows sound like they are good, solid shows and not every show has or couldn't be the greatest show of all time.  But I think that just because the competition is so fierce nowadays and people are dealing with essentially a lack of time, right?  There's only so much TV you can watch, especially if you need your time to read Twitter or whatever you're doing with the rest of your time.  Like you're fighting for your you're fighting for eyeballs a lot.  And I think that's that means you really got to bring your A game.  And I think this is you know, this is B game.  It's not bad, but it's like it's not it's not necessarily the thing that's going to win people over to your service.

Transcript:  Yeah, it is brutal, right?  I mean, Devendra, you know, it's brutal right now.  The amount of content we've got and the quality of the content that we've got.  I think everybody would probably agree the money being spent on TV right now is not sustainable.  It's everybody's spending huge amounts of money on huge amounts of content.  It's going to be more than 500 original scripted programs in the U.S. this year.  It was that way last year, too.  This it's not sustainable, but it's a gold rush right now.  And, you know, Apple can be part of the gold rush, but it makes it that much harder for them to break through.  For sure, for sure.  Like it's that is the ultimate problem right now.  Like I've talked to a lot of people like do they would they be interested in subscribing to this?  And they just list the backlog of things they have on Amazon and Hulu and other services.  I do feel like we're getting to a point where we're going to see some sort of like media bankruptcy.  We're like and not just I'm talking about these companies, but I'm talking about like just for people in general.  HBO Max had me worried for a while.  They would be a completely separate thing from like HBO now and the whole service.  But it actually sounds more like this is what HBO is going to evolve into over time.  So eventually the network will just become HBO Max, which OK, I can understand that.  Disney Plus, they have that entire backlog of nostalgia to bank on.  So that makes sense.  But then there are other things like NBC's that they were talking about.  And now NBC is reportedly we're probably think of making it free.  What is that? Peacock.  Peacock. Yeah, it's just going to be free with ads though.  See, that's that's one of those examples where I think they're going to do the free with ads or and a cable login or something like that.  Because being NBC, that means they're Comcast, which means they want to provide you an incentive to have a cable subscription of some sort.  You mentioned HBO Max.  We should talk about that.  That was the other big news story this week in the streaming wars, which is they gave us some clarity.  It's going to launch in May of 2020.  It's going to cost fourteen ninety nine, which is essentially what HBO now costs.  So basically what they're saying is they want you to pay them directly.  And when you sign up for HBO Max, you will get all of HBO and more.  You'll get all the extra catalog stuff and originals that come with HBO Max.  I think the question here is, you know, trying to have it both ways a little bit, because like if you just get HBO through your cable provider,  you won't get HBO Max. You need to need to go get it.  Are you going to have to cancel HBO?  I think they want you to take your money away from your cable company, make NBC sad and move it over to AT&T and pay them directly for HBO Max.  It's you know what? They're putting a lot of money into it.  They're giving a lot of thought into the way that they're pricing it and branding it.  I know it's a little bit messy, but they've come to play as sort of how I take it.  They are they are completely recasting what they're doing with HBO and they're going all in on this streaming service.  And, you know, they're going to be a serious player, I think.

Start time: 3861.74
End time: 3930.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The price point is so interesting because the like you said, it's the same cost as HBO now, but you get a lot of stuff on top of that.  It's the only way they can get away with charging essentially what will be, I think, the most expensive streaming service, right?  Like compared to almost all the other ones that are out there.  I can't think of another one that that Netflix has some expensive plans.  But yeah, yeah, but you got to get into like the multiple screens.  But so like, you know, Disney and Apple are both playing in sort of the five to seven dollar range.  You know, who lose in the seven dollar range CBS?  Same. And so, I mean, but like people will already pay fifteen dollars for HBO.  And if the value proposition is you pay that and you just get more stuff, then I think that actually wins for them.  And like you said, since they are now competing against, you know,  we have these giant mega lithic corporations that are essentially fighting because now they're ISPs and cable providers and content producers.  Every every bit that AT&T can take away from Comcast is a benefit for it.  So I'm still a little confused about it just because like there's a whole bunch of things where it's like, hey, if you already subscribe to HBO now, you just get HBO Max.  I'm like, all right, so I don't have to do anything like because I already have that.  Is that is that going to work?

And, you know, DC to their sorry, Disney to their credit.  You're going to get Marvel, Star Wars, all of their stuff, the Pixar stuff all in one place where I believe HBO Warner is going to keep going with the DC channel.  DC is a separate thing.  Yeah, yeah.  They'll have different properties on DC Universe and they'll have DC properties on HBO Max.  Yeah, I'm not clear on it.

Is that they like cloud your mind and you don't know what you're getting where and you pay them three different times in three different ways.  That's I mean, that seems to be their their business model almost is you're confused and you don't know what to pay.  And then they just keep taking your money.  That's what I just want to do.

Transcript:  Apparently, apparently, apparently.  So, Devendra, how do you rate the chances of HBO Max over, you know, getting getting a foothold in this?  Well, I mean, they have what they announced another game of potential Game of Thrones series.  It sounds like the content is interesting.  That whole HBO library is so valuable, too.  It just seems like it's not something that's really competing with the traditional HBO.  It seems like they're just repositioning how people think of HBO maybe as more of like a next Netflix watch instantly service rather than this crazy premium add-on.  To your cable package.  And there's some value to that for sure.  So I have more faith in HBO Max for sure.  I am at least interested in things that they were talking about compared to like Apple TV plus where I am very confused by a lot of it.  Now, going back to the international rollout, because I think this is important and we mentioned it a couple of times.  This is a US rollout for HBO Max.  It's not rolling out anywhere else.  There will be a version in Canada, but they're actually licensing it to Bell Media in Canada.  This is one of those stories that, as Renee mentioned before, Apple is doing a 100 percent worldwide launch.  Obviously, Amazon is in a lot of countries.  Netflix is now in a lot of countries, but the service varies.  This is one of the challenges with this.  And I'll throw another piece on it here.  This is all about the contracts that they've signed and they've sold rights to what are now competitors.  And I'll give you the best example.  And this isn't even international.  This is even in the US.  Who owns the rights to the Harry Potter movies?  Well, through 2026, it's NBC Universal, not Warner Media, even though those are Warner Brothers movies.  And that's because like five years ago, they sold those rights away.  What could be the problem?  And they've said that HBO will continue to license using Sky in Europe, the Sky Network.  They'll license their content there.  And I get that they want that money coming in right now.  But you look at these long-ish term deals with other companies and other parts of the world and think, you're going to regret that.  You're going to regret that.  And they're already regretting the Harry Potter thing.  So I think that the advantage of having the international view, like what Apple's doing and what Netflix is essentially doing now,  there's a lot of strength to that when you look at somebody like Warner or CBS is another example where they just can't tear themselves away  from licensing their content to an international partner.  They're totally Spider-Man.

Transcript:  CBS is an interesting example here, too, by the way, because they're producing like really high quality, high budget shows like Star Trek Discovery.  Looks very expensive.  I really enjoy that show, too.  And they have Picard coming up.  They're doing The Good Fight, which is their like sequel to The Good Wife, which was an amazing show that not many people saw, but ran for a long time on CBS.  So like CBS has a lot of quality content.  I don't know how they're funding that thing because I don't know how well it's doing subscriber wise.  But it is interesting to see them pouring money into this.  Disney is certainly pouring a lot into Disney Plus and Apple into Apple TV Plus.  So it's fascinating.  But I look at Amazon, who is producing so many good shows.  And I try to talk to people about like, you know, Mozart in the Jungle, a show that's won Emmys.  Yeah, great show.  Very few people have seen it.  People haven't heard it.  Yeah.  Marvel's Mrs. Maisel.  People don't know what that is.  And does Amazon have shows?  I just want to talk about Bosch.  I want to talk about Bosch with somebody.  You know, Devendra, you mentioned Star Trek Discovery.  The answer of how they're funding that and the former CEO of CBS, Les Moonves, boasted about it.  They funded Star Trek Discovery by selling it in the rest of the world to Netflix.  That's true.  And that paid for the show.  And that was great.  And it was a profit in North America.  But they don't own the show in the rest of the world.  And they can't sell it.  I mean, they can't expand CBS All Access with their flagship show.  And this is the that's the challenge.  I will say everybody who knows and watches this business looks at CBS and says, you know,  if Apple ever did want to buy an entertainment conglomerate and swallow it whole, they're the ones.  But whether Apple wants to own Star Trek or not, I don't know.  It would be two of my lifelong brand relationships in one place.  That's weird.  It's weird.  Anyway, I don't want to talk about it.  We should we should move on.  Let's take a break and let Leo send you a message.  And then we will get back with more in just a minute.

Casper, of course, we've talked about them before.  They're an online retailer of premium mattresses.  But they're a fraction of the cost because there's no middleman.  There's no store marketing up 100 percent.  Casper sells not just mattresses, bedding, bed frames, even a glow light.  So awesome help you fall asleep.  That I do travel with.  Casper has everything you need to create the perfect sleep environment.  And sleep is so important.  Do do not think while I'm unconscious.  It doesn't matter.  It does.

But then they add back the durable yet gentle springs.  And I have to say, I think this is a really nice mattress.  Because you get absolute comfort, resilient support.  It's kind of an elevated lift, which I actually prefer.  It gives you active support and durability.  So, you know, your bumpy bits are nicely supported.  It's very much more comfortable.

Transcript:  Now back to the show.  You know, I did a show very much like this on the Relay FM podcast network called Download for about a year.  And one of the things that I noticed was every single week we had a story about something terrible that Facebook had done.  Devendra, get ready.  Here we go.  Social media, let's talk about it.  Twitter said this week that they have a solution to all of the problems with misleading political ads,  verifying whether claims are true or not.  Are they foreign governments trying to control elections?  They said, what if we just don't do political ads anymore?  How about that?  Maybe Jack came up with this while he was meditating.  I don't know, probably.  Meanwhile, Mark Zuckerberg, now just guess, what do you think Mark Zuckerberg did?  Did he say, that's a good idea.  You know, we've got all the money.  Our latest results came out.  Facebook makes all the money and political ads are a small part of what we do.  So this is an interesting solution.  What if we just, no, he said, I think they're great.  Yeah, they're great.  We love political ads.  And he ended up getting a letter from some Facebook employees saying that they were really troubled by this stance.  But guess what?  Facebook not going to turn away that sweet, sweet money and political ads, whether they may be misleading or not, are going to be a part of that.  Interesting contrast though between Twitter and Facebook and their approach to this, which is kind of like touching on the third rail of regulation in social media.  So I want to start with Devendra because I know we've talked about terrible things Facebook's done in the past.  What do you think about this whole issue, Twitter, Facebook and political ads?  Not surprised at all that Zuckerberg is kind of digging in his heels here because this has been the company's mindset for a while now.  Even though like, yeah, we've pointed to a lot of things related to political advertising and political messaging on Facebook and how they're unprepared to handle it.  And, you know, they're unprepared to even like, yeah, just deal with any of that information.  I think Twitter's solution is probably the best one because it's really hard for any of these companies to police these ads, to really verify them.  And at the end of the day, like the greater harm, I know, on a societal level is like letting bad false information ads out there.  At least we know Zuckerberg thinks lying is bad.  Right. That was his response to AOC.  I think lying is bad. That's his big insight.  So there you go.

Transcript:  He went to Harvard. I mean, he knows things.  Man, it's the competition to see who is slightly less of a trash fire in the social media world.  And I don't know, the problem with this is going to be, is this going to be like the way that Twitter already sort of moderates like, you know, hate speech, which is to say ineffectually.  They can they can talk a good game about it.  And I think I agree with Devinder that it's it seems like the right approach.  But there's a lot of nuance and a lot of question about exactly how this is going to get enforced.  And there's also a lot of questions about how do you enforce things that might be ads, not from political candidates, but touch upon political issues?  What constitutes a political issue? Because lots of stuff is political.  I mean, you know, your opinion on encryption could be political if you're paying for an ad on that.  Like, there's there's just a lot of question about enforcement and how exactly they're going to handle that.  And I think I'm not sure, you know, I'm not willing to attribute Jack Dorsey's motivation here to any sort of altruism or goodness of his heart.  I think he probably just wants to avoid having to deal with the problems that Mark Zuckerberg is having to avoid.  And I think that's make the pain stop.  I don't think it's going to work for him. I got to be honest.  I think they're just going to find themselves embroiled in a huge controversy over what constitutes a political ad.  And they're going to do a bad job of making decisions.

Transcript:  There's also an argument to be made that if you say no politics, what you're really saying is if you're something somebody who's advocating for something entrenched,  if you're a big corporation and you say this is great because it's our company and we're marketing it,  if somebody wants to take out an ad and say, no, what this company is doing is bad, that is a political statement.  And so that this policy will sort of reinforce the status quo.  It's definitely one of the one of the arguments here.  I don't ever assume that Facebook is going to do the right thing, although this is a very complicated issue.  You know, the problem is Facebook's track record, right?  Like, I have a hard time taking Mark Zuckerberg seriously when he says anything at this point, because we have seen time and again that Facebook says one thing  and then does another and knows they'll just have to apologize and pay a small fine probably after the fact.  And that's not, you know, so it's hard for me to as we're entering another election cycle here in the US,  like to believe that this isn't going to continue to be an enormous story and that Facebook is not prepared to deal with it.

Transcript:  They're using their brains. It's because they're smart.  Let's move on. I want to talk about the fires and the blackouts in California.  If you have followed Twit at all, you probably know about it.  The county in which the Twit studios reside has been severely affected by both.  Lots of blackouts, lots of fires.  There is a tech angle here.  A couple of things. First off, a good story that the New York Times ran about the interesting aspect of the California blackouts.  I felt this. I was prepared for a long blackout at my house.  We did have one. We had a three-day blackout.  But what I wasn't prepared for is the fact that all the cell towers went down.  Beforehand, the cell carrier said, no, no, no, we've got backups. We've got generators.  We're going to wire this up. It's all going to be good.  I think something like 60% or 70% of the cell towers in my county went down for three days, along with the rest of the power.  There are a lot of challenges here when you've got wildfires spreading.  Your plan is to alert people via the cellular phone emergency alerts, but people don't have service.  If you've got people who are expected to...  My wife is a municipal employee, and they were communicating via text about how to provide support for the city during the emergency.  She didn't get the text for a day and a half because we didn't have service.  And when we did have service, the service was so spotty that apparently the text just sort of queued up and didn't get sent out until a day later.  And I think this is a really interesting angle because when we think about power outages, we think about, well, I'll just charge my phone.  I'll have a backup battery and I'll be okay.  And then you live through it and you realize that if the data is not there, it doesn't matter that you've got a cell phone in your hand that's perfectly charged.  I mean, you could like crack a walnut with it, I suppose, but you can't do anything with it because the data is down.  We all ended up at a local supermarket, which had the foresight to bring in an enormous generator and somehow had internet.  I don't even know how, but they had Wi-Fi.  And that was the only way that we got out to the world was walking a few times a day over to the supermarket and checking in.  It's a good story. You guys are all not in a place that at least yet has been affected by major blackouts.  But what do you think about this? The coupling of losing your Internet with losing your power?  It's a one-two punch, let me tell you.  We had that before the cellular networks became popular.

Transcript:  We had that famous infamous ice storm in the late 1990s that took out power for a week or two.  And we just know you lost television, but that was the most you lost.  But just this week we had 106 kilometer an hour winds and it was knocking down trees.  And even though we lose power every year when the ice storms, I think only one borough on the entire island has put their power cables underground.  And we have relatively good cell phone coverage, but a lot of them are towers that are on the tops of buildings or churches or other things.  And they are really susceptible to that kind of environmental damage and impact.  And it doesn't seem, and I think a lot of other countries have made fun of North America for this, but doesn't seem that we really intent on hardening our infrastructure against natural disasters in any meaningful way.  Yeah, we've been planned for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All these things are a complete infrastructure failure.  Right. Like I think that's the main thing in New York.  We had Hurricane Sandy or a Superstorm Sandy in 2012 and the city flooded.  And honestly, a lot of things kept going.  It was mainly like the subway systems.  I do have to say, Jason, my heart goes out to you and everybody else in California like this reading about this stuff is terrifying because it seems like you guys are on the front lines of like the critical infrastructure failure that the rest of the world is going to end up seeing.  Power going out is one thing like that alone is the tech angle.  The fact that PG&E is such a terrible company that they couldn't properly do this.  Like this seems criminal.  This seems absolutely insane.  I don't think our current presidential administration has said much about the California fires.  Like half a major coast is on fire here and we're not hearing much or hearing much about like what the government's going to do to fix this.  It's a sad state of affairs.  Like the world is literally on fire.  The people in charge aren't doing anything about it and the people who are supposed to watch them don't really seem to care.  So it is the worst scenario in all respects.  I hope we figure out some sort of solutions here.

Transcript:  It does sort of speak to our complacency, right?  Like, you know, especially in the U.S. where we tend to tout like, well, you know, we're a developed nation and we spend, you know, we have the most advanced technology.  We have all the best stuff.  And it's like, well, yeah, but we haven't.  We got sort of sat like comfortable sitting on our laurels thinking we've done a great job of building out all this stuff.  And it turns out it's not very robust.  And you could say the same thing about other infrastructure points like bridges and roads and stuff like that, too.  But obviously from a tech angle, you know, your power grid, your data network, all of that is really critical.  And certainly, you know, it's funny because we moved away from landlines.  But obviously, like, that was the thing I remember as a kid when the power went out, like you lost power, but you still make phone calls because your landline didn't depend on power.  Yeah, I had a brilliant thought because I have a UPS.

Start time: 5133.26
End time: 5276.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have two UPS at home, which is great.  If your power flickers or not, you get this uninterruptible power supply.  It's like a big power strip with a battery.  Plug it into your computer.  Your computer stays up at least long enough to save and shut down and copy your files wherever you need to copy them.  That sort of thing.  I had these.  I was like, you know, what I can do is I can take a Wi-Fi base station and my cable modem, pop them on the UPS, turn it on and I can get back on the Internet.  Well, guess what?  Comcast was out because they whatever thing was providing Internet also lost power and they didn't have a backup.  And this is if I learned a lesson from this round of blackouts, it was that there's this whole secondary infrastructure that relies on the power infrastructure.  And while as this New York Times story said, they gave a lot of reassurances beforehand, these tenders of the secondary infrastructure that they had a plan.  They did not have a plan.  And so the cell towers, they said, oh, no, we've got generators.  They didn't or they didn't work or they didn't have them for long enough for it to matter.  And Comcast Internet is a good example.  Like they didn't have a backup.  So even if you did have a battery backup for your cable modem, you couldn't get on the Internet.  And and yes, if I had had a landline, I wonder if my AT&T landline would have been active.  I switched to a cable landline, so I didn't get that.  But this is I think a lesson learned here.  There is a large life phones, everybody.  There's a larger lesson here about infrastructure and paying for infrastructure upgrades and the fact that, by the way, the power shutdowns in California happen to prevent more fires because many of the largest fires were started by wind blowing on transmission lines or towers and sparking them.  And the sparks then get blown into the trees.  And then the wind whips that into an enormous forest fire.  Of course, there are at least two and perhaps more major fires in northern California this year who, despite the power shutoffs, were caused by PG&E, the power company's towers still being active in some areas.  So despite all the shutdowns, it still didn't solve the problem of the fires, although maybe there would have been many more had they kept the power on.  It's just it's a lesson to be learned.  And I think if you're Verizon and T-Mobile and AT&T and Comcast, you have to look at this and say, oh, right.  We can't count on the power company to do its job to let us serve our customers.  And we need to do something else about it.

Transcript:  And a lot of it is just a big corporations and big agencies kicking the can down the road.  A lot of times they think, well, everything works fine right now.  Why do we have to invest money in making sure that it works fine over the long term?  And you can see this in a number of places from utilities to public transit to other infrastructure stuff.  People think everything being fine right now is an indication that it will continue to be fine.  And the answer is no, that's not how it works.

Start time: 5299.48

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's there's a crazy existential dilemma happening here because of all this, because it shows us like, yeah, civilization as we know it could just like stop working very quickly.  If like, yeah, these critical bits of infrastructure just start failing.  It seems like they could at any point at this point.  Yeah, yeah, it was my confidence of having enough batteries to get me through a multi-day.  It was like, yeah, great.  And I did. And then the Internet went out and we were kind of wandering through streets that were completely empty and all the businesses were shut down and all the gas stations were closed and empty.  And, you know, the Whole Foods was working.  Oh, great. OK.  Buy yourself some peanut butter.  That's great.  But I did have that feeling with the failure of the secondary infrastructure.  I started to feel a little bit of exactly what you said, Devendra, which is there.  You know, you strip away a couple layers of infrastructure and you start to get a sense of how thin the veneer of civilization is.

Start time: 5354.15
End time: 5383.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the fact that there was absolutely nothing you could do about that, right?  Like you can't control the cell phone towers like you can't control your ISP.  You can have all the best.  Like you said, you can stock up on the batteries.  You can have all your food and coolers or whatever.  But you can't do anything about the rest of the infrastructure not doing their job.  So, you know, add to that the feeling of powerlessness when it's like, well, I did all the right things.  I took all the correct steps to be prepared.  This is no longer my problem, but it is influencing me somehow nonetheless.

Transcript:  Yeah. And I thought about bugging out to San Francisco, which did have power.  And we got on the freeway and it was going to be bumper to bumper all the way into San Francisco because everybody else had the same idea.  Same idea. So we just got off and went back home and like the end of every disaster movie.  Right. Like that point, we're trying to escape.  Basically turn off the car, you know, leave it on the road in the middle of the road.  Just continue to walk like in every zombie movie ever in the in the red ones.  Yeah, I will say I also I feel bad like people who even have solar panels on their homes who thought like they were OK.  Unless you had a home battery pack like the Tesla power thing, like you can't use those cells because you're just pumping power back into the into the grid.  So it's like there's there's a whole other level going on here.  Even people who thought they were prepared probably aren't as much as they thought.  Dan and I have a friend.  I was going to say our friend Lex has solar panels on his house during Sandy in New Jersey.  And the power went out for more than a week.  I think maybe it was like 10 days, 12 days.  Even though they have a solar panel, they didn't.  Yeah, they didn't have the inverter and they didn't have a cutoff and they have all the things that you need to route.  So even in the daytime, they didn't have power, let alone a battery system.  And that is, you know, I called all the solar companies this week and said I would like solar panels and a battery because, you know, I don't want to do that again.  And I would like to be able to take that level of control over my over my life.  But of course, it's not going to solve the other infrastructure issues, including the Internet and, you know, if I can get to a gas station or whatever else, it's just interesting times we live in interesting times.  I want to have a positive tech angle here to a couple of amazing tools in outer space that that came into play during these events these last few weeks.  The National Weather Service tweeted something from the GOES satellite.  It's an infrared map of the big fire, the Kincaid fire, as it was in progress.  It's an amazing, you know, animated GIF of, yes, I said GIF, you heard me, of the infrared of the fire as it spread overnight.  And you can see it. They used to have sort of fire spotters and towers and things like that or flying planes over it.  But now we have infrared cameras in space with incredibly high resolution.  And if you're watching the video version of the show, the the animation is pretty remarkable.  You can see the spikes in temperature and you can see the fire moving as it burns through areas into other areas.  It's pretty crazy. And also the National Weather Service, and this is a sign of the times if ever there was one, is building a computer model that is a different kind of weather computer model.  This is a smoke drift model for places affected by fires to see where the smoke will be so that they can predict when unhealthy air will hit various regions.  Because smoke plumes can travel over very long distances.  And so they plug the smoke information and all of their atmospheric information into a weather model.  But rather than trying to predict the weather, they're just trying to predict where the smoke will go and what the air quality is.  And it's a work in progress. It's experimental right now.  But I think it shows you that a year or two ago when these fires really started to kick in, they said, you know what, we could do a better job of trying to predict when people need to stay inside.  Sign of the times in October and November in California for sure.  We have a little more to talk about. We have some emoji business to get down to.  But first, a lot of things happened throughout the Twitter network this week.  And we made a little movie to show you what went on previously on Twitter Friday night around seven thirty East Coast time.

Transcript:  Let me interrupt one more time.  Look, let you get back to the show.  But I got to tell you about stamps.com.  Holidays are coming and you know, this is amateur hour at the post office, right?  Everybody goes to the post office and mailer packages and their Christmas cards.  And you're trying to get business done.  That's I mean, we have been using stance stamps dot com forever.  I think since 2012, that's that's a long time and I wouldn't dream of going to the post office.  I just print our own postage, put labels on anything we have to mail automatically,  print on the envelopes for brochures and things with stamps dot com.  My computer, my printer.  That's all I need.  I really wonder sometimes who still goes to the post office.  Well, it's the amateurs.  It's people who only do mailing once a year.  If you do mailing every day because of your business, you need stamps dot com.  We've been using stamps dot com since 2012 and I've been telling you about it since 2012.  I kind of wondering, have you are you using it?  Why not?  Stamps dot com really brings the post office to you.  No need to interrupt your work day to fight traffic to get to the post office.  Find parking.  It's extra busy right now because of the holidays.  Stamps dot com is one of the most popular time saving tools for small businesses.  Big businesses, too.  It eliminates those trips to the post office.  But better than that, it even saves you money.  You get discounts on stamps dot com on everything, including postage.  You just can't get at the post office.  Plus, they fill in the forms for you automatically.  They take the mailing address from your software.  If you're an Etsy seller, an Amazon or eBay seller, it makes you look more professional.  These beautiful printed labels.  You can have your company logo on it.  No matter what, whether you're a small office, just sending out bills or an online seller,  shipping out products, even a warehouse, sending thousands of products a day, stamps dot com can handle it all.  Simply use your computer to print official U.S. postage 24 7 when you need it on demand for any letter,  any package, any class of mail, anywhere you want to mail it.  I love the postal service.  It's a miracle.  It's a miracle.  It really is.  And stamps dot com is the service.  You need to use it right.  Because once your mail is ready, the mail carrier comes, picks it up and boom, you're done.  Or you can drop it in the mailbox.  Actually, that's one thing I like about stamps dot com.  Normally, if you have something more, what is the limit?  A pound?  You can't put it in the mailbox.  They have to make you bring it to the post office.  Not with stamps dot com.  No, because that, you know, trademarked indicia on there, they look at it and they go, oh, yeah, we know that is.  That's fine.  That's cool.  We get with stamps dot com.  You get five cents off every first class stamp.  OK, post office won't do that.  40% off priority mail.  And you don't need the postage meter, which is a good thing.  Well, I don't want to go into that.  One of their competitors was bit by ransomware.  A lot of people couldn't use the postage meters.  Not stamps dot com.  You can always use it 24 seven stamps dot com.  It's a no brainer.  Saves you time.  It saves you money.  Seven hundred thousand small businesses use stamps dot com.  I like to think that I'm responsible for at least a few of those.  And certainly we do.  We've used it for years.  Don't spend a minute of your holiday season at the post office.  Well, you can go and wave your mail carrier.  Say hi to your postal clerk.  Maybe give them a little tip.  I think that's a great idea.  But you don't need to go there to do business.  You sign up for stamps dot com instead.  And when you use the promo code twit, you're going to get a special offer that is so good,  they won't let me tell you what it is.  I'll give you a hint.  Four week trial.  A bunch of free postage.  Free postage.  A digital scale that plugs in the USB.  So you never have the wrong postage.  And no long term commitment.  No contract.  It is an amazing trial.  Here's how you do it.  You can find out the details when you go to stamps dot com.  Click on the microphone at the top of the home page and enter twit.  That's stamps dot com and enter twit.  Why go to the post office?  Never go again.  Just go to stamps dot com.  Enter the offer code twit.  Now, back to the show.

That's what happens when the leaves fall, right?  Like the emojis just replace them.  Leaf emojis are extruded and fire emojis are extinguished.  The iOS update that just came out enables a whole bunch of new emoji that were part of the Unicode Consortium's 2019 emoji release.  Meaning that now the two major mobile platforms support these new emoji.  People actually update their iPhones to get the new emoji.  There are lots and lots of them.  You can always go to emojipedia.org run by our good friend Jeremy Burge, and you can find out about every emoji imaginable.  And their blog has lots of great details about it.  There's also a really nice story that I found on The Verge by Jay Peters.  If you've ever said to yourself, I wish there was an emoji for blank, it's a great story to read.  Jay Peters made a couple of proposals for a waffle emoji and for a yawning person emoji.  And this week he's been enjoying seeing famous people tweet out things about the yawning face emoji.  Imagine you do a long text thread and sort of like how I'm talking now and then the response is, yawna emoji.  Like, oh, I talked a little bit too long.  Too long. I will also recommend to people, if you like podcasts, go to the Welcome to Macintosh podcast.  Mark Bramhill did a great four-part series about getting an emoji, a particular emoji created and approved.  And the bureaucratic process that goes into it, it is fascinating.  These emoji don't just kind of happen on the spur of the moment.  There's a whole process.  And one of the big things that happened in this emoji season is gender neutral emoji for emoji that used to default to a gender.  And, you know, you can't say the word gender without it being a controversy.  But this is actually something that Google added and Apple added.  In fact, as Emojipedia reported, the timeline for this was actually more like 2020.  But Google and Apple both jumped on board faster with this.  And the idea is if you wanted to pick a vampire or an astronaut and the gender that was the default was not yours,  then you need to just go, oh, I need male vampire or female astronaut.  And what has happened is that they are they're trying to remove a specific gender and have the defaults, the non-specific gender be a non-gendered image.  Obviously a lot of controversy there.  But kind of makes sense if you've ever personally as somebody who doesn't have a mustache, I never used the male astronaut emoji because he had a mustache.  He looked like Michael Collins in Apollo 11 and I don't have a mustache and I don't identify with that astronaut.  And I can use the regular generic astronaut now and feel better about the fact that I shave my face.  Emoji, it's so, you know, so controversial.  And yet we use it to communicate.  Any any any opinions about emoji?  I don't even know where to go here.  If you were an emoji, what would you be?  Yeah, yeah, emoji.  No bitmoji.  No bitmoji.  God, I'm with you.

Transcript:  And emoji, I'm a fan.  Bitmoji are not emoji.  They're something else.  Something terrible.  They're bad drawings.  I mean, I think I think what I take away from this is I mean, it's a funny story.  But at the same time, like and I get that people get worked up about this stuff because it emoji minute, it matters to people.  But it doesn't happen on the spur of the moment.  The the blame game is amazing for this because sometimes the platforms get blamed.  Sometimes the Unicode gets blamed.  It's actually kind of a partnership.  Unicode doesn't make the art.  The art on each platform is different and it's commissioned by the platform owners, which is why your emoji look weird on in Gmail.  And they look weird on Twitter because they use different emoji sets than if it's running on an app on your phone or your computer.  And, you know, after the Unicode Consortium approves it, the platform owners have to implement it, which is and sometimes get ahead of the consortium, like with going to gender neutral defaults and then letting you specify a gender if you want to.  That's something that that obviously whoever was assigning the art department at Apple and Google, they they already knew that they wanted to do this.  And so they just pushed ahead with it even before Unicode.  That's its origin, though, right?

Transcript:  Like like ASCII are like the ASCII emoji, the winky face.  Those were never gendered in the early smiley faces.  Those were never gendered.  Like this is getting back to the roots of emoji where they could literally represent all of us to all of us without any of the sort of baggage that we pile up on top of everything else.  I'm glad they're they're empowering us again that way.

Transcript:  Yeah. And the idea that that if you have a fireman and it's always a man and then a woman wants to express firemen and she can't say a woman with or even when they add the female firefighter, if the default firefighter is a man, that does say something.  And so now it's sort of like you get a less gendered firefighter and then you get to choose.  That's another thing that so knowing Jeremy Berg at a motion.  And he keeps making the point, which is they are not removing any emoji, right?  It's not like the emoji people came out and said, no firefighters have genders anymore.  What they said was we're going to do a default where there isn't facial hair and there isn't long hair or super masculine features or feminine features.  And then you can also choose male firefighter or female firefighter.  You get all the choices.  There are more choices than that.  So, you know, it's it's just trying to be more inclusive and you can still use you can still represent yourself.  But maybe other people who didn't feel represented are also represented now.  That's a good thing.  Yeah, it seems like a huge I don't see any downside here personally.  Like it seems like a kind of choice.

Transcript:  I agree with with Renee's point that like, you know, we kind of started with very different people.  Even the most of the emoji that I use nowadays are some variety of the, you know, just yellow smiley face.  And I always felt like it's pretty broad.  You know, it kind of reminds me like Legos, like classic Legos where it could, you know, just kind of be anything because it was just a smiley face.  But, you know, like you said, people use it a lot and people have strong feelings about it.  You cast your mind back a few years ago when Apple changed the gun.  And there was a lot of arguments about that as well because people felt very strongly about it, had opinions one direction or the other.  And, you know, people surprising everybody.  People really like to argue about things.  They just really like getting mad about things.  I know that's that's news to a lot of people.  But now I can tell you the most offensive thing that just happened, which is the last time I've ever seen a gun.  I mean, I've never seen a gun in my life.  I've never seen a gun in my life.

Transcript:  There's a huge emoji bureaucracy.  Big emoji is what I'm saying.  But if you could write a boring paper explaining why something should be an emoji, you can  submit it to Unicode and maybe even go and stake your case.  And you could get a famous rapper to tweet about your emoji someday.  That sounds great.  Yeah.  The American dream.  So just imagine it.  But now that there's a taco emoji, I'm good.  So I'm fine.  It's all it's all good.  All right.  I think we've reached the end.  I want to thank my guests for talking about all sorts of stuff.  Serious and not so serious today.
