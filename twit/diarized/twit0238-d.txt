Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Scariest thing I've ever done in my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. We'll show video at the end of the show. Everybody can watch you jump off the...  It's not even a bridge. It's like they suspend something in the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A platform suspended 43 stories in the air. It was pretty nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Crazy.  I was scared to death.  We're glad you made it back.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to go to this from Fox and Friends. Mr. Clayton Morris also does that Great Gadgets.  What's the name of the Gadget podcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's called Gadgets and Games. It streams live on FoxNews.com.  Thank you so much for having me on. My apologies. I'm actually in my childhood bedroom right now, my parents' house.  Really?  I thought it was appropriate.  You moved back in.  I moved back in. Times are tough. I'm visiting. I left New York this morning and I'm in my old bedroom,  which I didn't realize until I was sitting in here doing the show. It's the size of a shoe box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It looks like Dad's turned it into a little mini office as well.  Were the steel case file cabinets yours?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No. There's so much crap in here right now. I'm surprised I found it.  I looked through the closet. You see the closet doors back over there. That's where all my comic books are still stored.  I was looking for my old Sega and my Nintendo NES. I think my mom threw out my NES.  But you got the comic books. That's even more valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you got the NES, you'd probably pull it out and start playing Zelda or something, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, get that out in Dragon Warrior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Those were the days, huh? John C. Dvorak's here. When he was a kid, he used to play with rocks.  Rocks and sticks.  And sticks in the mud. Channeldvorak.com. Great to have all three of you here.  Actually, you're following in Kevin's footsteps, Clayton. The last time you were on, Kevin, you were in your parents' house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right. To the mom and dad. You got to do it. You got to go back to home.  Did you ever fix that smoke alarm?  I know. So many people were complaining that it was beeping nonstop. Sorry about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was really funny. It was the battery dead thing. Isn't it nowadays when you go home to mom and dad's, that's the kind of thing.  They go, what? I don't hear anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They save chores up for you. I don't know if you guys know what I'm talking about. When I go back, I have a list of things I have to do for my parents.  Fix the computer. There's a whole slew of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For years, I'd go home and mom would want me to climb into the attic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's the worst.  She wants you to stay in the attic? Is that what you said?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. No, she said go up in the attic. There's crap up there. You got to move around. It was the worst. It was awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then she locked the door.  Yeah. That was the best.  That's when you wrote your diary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think your mom likes me better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She does, doesn't she? I forgot about that. I was talking to mom yesterday. She says, son, you need to have a special line that I can call in any time when you're doing shows.  I said, mom, that's the last thing I need. I said, mom, if you have something to say on the show, text me and I'll decide whether to call you. She says, you'll have to show me how to do that.  I said, okay. She's right now. See, if she had the line, she'd be calling right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's funny the way you've turned your mom into David Letterman's mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, Letterman wasn't the first to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, he's not really a fan of his mom, by the way.  Really? Like they don't really like each other?  Yeah, that's the real story with that whole thing is it was only after a producer had suggested the situation with him doing that that he ended up doing it. He's not very close with that family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's interesting. He's kind of a bitter sour kind of a guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why we like him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he doesn't leave the house. He just listens to shortwave radio in his basement every night. He never leaves it.  Is that true?  Just like you used to be, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is what I do. I didn't know. Maybe I could listen for David. We could talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You guys are dialing up and listening to radio Moscow together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I used to do that when I was a kid all the time.  But I don't think now there's this thing called the Internet. You really don't have to use the shirt wave anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but he literally doesn't leave the house and he sits inside and he listens to shortwave radio.  He dials in all sorts of stations because he's such a broadcast aficionado.  That's one of the things. But he's such a loner, too.  And he never leaves. He just never goes outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can identify with that.  What do you do in your basement, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can only imagine.  I sort wine.  You've got Alfred E. Newman.  Hey, by the way, thank you for the tip. I went to Costco in Novato and I stocked up on some great Bordeauxs there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they're loaded up. And if there's a couple of people out there who want a quick wine tip from Costco,  there's two wines I think are really good deals.  There's a 2006 Lucente, which is an Italian wine from the Tuscan area, which is essentially a Sangiovese, but it's quite delicious.  And then for 19 bucks and then for 19 bucks, they're dumping boatloads of the 2006 B.V. Rutherford Cabernet.  That's a great cab. 2006.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is Costco sponsoring you guys? This is like the third time you guys are sponsoring Costco.  You know, we give a lot of crap away. You know, we just give it away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to thank Costco for their fantastic selection of car tires.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I see that on 30 Rocks. 30 Rocks got it figured out.  They will do these blatant product things. They'll say Snapple. Would anybody like a Snapple right in the middle of the show?  And then at the end it says promotional consideration provided by Snapple. I've got to figure out a way to do that.  So, John, what happened to your Twitter account? You got hacked, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but it was only lasted for about five minutes because I have a bunch of minions who are producers of a No Agenda show.  And they got on me real quick in every way they could. They told me it was hacked.  I don't know. I mean, there were 200 things hacked. Somebody thinks somebody got to one of the base accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you didn't fall for some phishing scam and give somebody your credentials?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I didn't. And the fact is I'm fairly aware of those things.  And my Twitter account on all my machines, including every machine that I use, is auto-loaded.  So it just basically goes on. I don't really type in anything.  The only problem with your password is 12345.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hmm. That could do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My password is not a great password. It's a skeleton key because I didn't take it too seriously.  But once I changed it, the spamming stopped. They only got three messages in.  And I want to thank the people who told me about it, by the way.  Told me about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you guys get hack attempts on your different accounts?  Because I get those little... You know when so many people try to hack your Gmail that you get little notifications on your cell phone?  I get that all the time. At least three times a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a really good tip. If you have a Google account, make sure you tie a cell phone to it.  Because in some cases, it's the only way you can get it back if you lose it.  And they are. They're always trying to break into it.  My Gmail account is my last name. And there's some French guy keeps trying to get it.  He thinks it's his account. So I get all these password attempt reminders in French.  By the way, I think I'm going to have a Snapple right now. Anybody want a Snapple? It's fresh. It's delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Make it pop.  It's funny. I was doing a podcast that I do with my best friend called the Grizzly Bear Egg Cafe Cheap Plug.  And we loved Yoohoo. We grew up loving Yoohoo. And we started talking about Yoohoo every episode.  And finally, we got a call from Yoohoo. And they were interested.  We started talking about it. We haven't really worked it out yet. But we started talking about doing advertising.  We just started talking about Yoohoo. And we weren't shilling for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've tried that and it's never worked for me. We tried it for a long time with Totino's pizza rolls.  Because I just really wanted pizza rolls. And then we had a guy inside who said, I'll get you the sponsorship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We used to get a lot of free food over at KNBR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you remember that? When you and I did the show, we had Max's Deli.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they were loading up stuff. By the way, isn't Yoohoo, Yahoo, Yoohoo, that chocolate drink, didn't they switch to high fructose corn syrup and kind of ruin the beverage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what? First of all, there's no dairy products in Yoohoo at all.  There's not? It's not milk? It's not chocolate milk?  No, it's not chocolate milk. There's actually no dairy product in Yoohoo at all.  In fact, I went through and spent some quiet time. I spent like an afternoon, one afternoon.  At the Yoohoo plant?  No, I almost wanted to. But David Byrne talks about hanging outside the Yoohoo plant when he was back in the 60s and he was high as a kite.  And he wrote a couple of talking head songs about that.  Really?  No, I went through the Wikipedia page of Yoohoo and they do like Halloween Yoohoo's. They do like Dracula's drink. They do all kinds of weird stuff.  But there's no milk products at all in any Yoohoo beverage. I don't know what it is.  Well, it means it's healthful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is it?  What is it? It's chocolate flavored something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess the high fructose corn syrup doesn't mean that much then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you really a... Is this a no agenda subject, the high fructose corn syrup?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, this is a Dvorak subject. This is a family matter. We don't use the high fructose anything.  Really? Why is that?  Because the stuff is, if you look at all the research that keeps coming out and then getting pulled back, it indicates it's really bad for your liver.  Really?  It's just a nasty product. It's not a good thing to take. And I don't care what anybody thinks. They can send me a memo if they don't like these comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I guess that's it for the Snapple endorsement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they don't use high fructose corn syrup, do they? Kevin, you're a tea guy. Is there any real tea in Snapple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They sometimes have little trace amounts of tea in a lot of these tea drinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As long as we're mentioning companies, I finally went to Samovar, which you highly recommended, Kevin. And that is a great place. I really enjoyed it.  Did you meet with Jesse or no?  Yeah, I saw. I said hi to Jesse. In fact, I'm trying to get it so that we could do like a joint Dignation tweet thing there or something, or maybe just you and me talking tea.  Let's do it.  It'll be really fun. He's such a nice guy.  Sure.  All right. Let's get to some news. We got stories. We got so many stories to talk about. How about the porn detection USB stick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Paraben has made a USB stick you could plug into your computer.  And it's about 100 bucks. If you're a porn investigator or maybe just lost your porn, you plug it into the USB drive of any Windows based PC and run the porn detector.  It searches the hard drive using advanced image analyzing algorithms, characterizing images as potentially harmful by identifying facial features, flesh tone colors, image backgrounds, body part shapes.  And more. I don't know what the more would be after that.  More.  More and more.  Audio recognition probably.  Oh, maybe. That's how I come on.  Something out there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't buy this thing. First of all, it sounds to me like it's stuff. I could be completely wrong. But the way it sounded to me when I saw this earlier this week is that it was recognizing stuff you had stored locally.  Right.  Right. So who's storing porn locally?  I don't know. Why bother, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just, you know.  Porn collectors.  If you're collecting it maybe, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I first heard, I think I believe the people up in Canada that do the very great program called Spy Cop that looks for really deep, the deep sort of Trojans and key collectors. You know, what do they call them? Keyboard, whatever.  They're called deep throat.  What's it called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. They're called deep throat Trojans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm talking about the keyboard capture programs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, the key loggers. Those hardware loggers. Those are very hard to detect. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. These guys do all that and they came out with a program like this. It wasn't a key. It was just software. And I think it was like three years ago or five years ago. I don't see how, you know, I don't know. I never caught on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The same company, I'm looking at the website, para-ben-sticks.com makes a chat stick and a SIM card seizure. This is digital forensic software. The chat stick scans your computer for chat logs. So this is really for cops who could just, you know, come in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it cops or is it parents? It might be like, you know, you think your son or daughter is doing some crazy things and you buy one of these little sticks and hopefully gives you peace of mind or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd stay away from, keep your stick away from my computer. That's all I can say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I mean, this seems to me, I don't know, it seems to me weird because if you've got, first of all, kids aren't, well, maybe I'm wrong, but kids aren't savvy enough to be deleting all of this stuff. So all you need to do is just go check their browser history. You don't need to buy some stick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I put it in the folder called porn. Come on. Just look for the porn folder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't kids know how to do all that private browsing now? I mean, it's like two-plates.  You knew how to do that. You knew how to do that, didn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, there's still some issues with certain programs like the IRC, for example, which depending on what version you're running, but various versions of Merck will go in and they open up an applications folder that's buried under your documents and settings.  And you can't even find it with the search, Microsoft search on the operating system. You actually have to go by hand. You have to kind of march all your way into through all these folders to delete this stuff. And essentially it logs everything you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but I don't think, I don't know, most consumers aren't going to use IRC, right? They're just going to go straight to a website, hit play on the video, sit back and watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're not going to use Merck for sure.  That's not that hard.  So what about this? Apple has now announced that the iPad will be available, we think available for order, what is it, this week and then will come out April 3rd is now the iPad ship date.  I don't think this is a coincidence. Microsoft announces this week that in fact that video we saw of the courier was real and they're going to ship it at some point at some unknown time and at some unknown price.  It's, that kind of reminds me when they came out with a surface announcement right when iPhone was announced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's going on with the service? I've never seen a service, I've seen one in real life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they have one in Vegas.  They had one over at Demetri on for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's kind of, it's 10 grand, it's a table.  Although I have to say that some of the software and technologies did make it into Windows 7.  So some of those surface programs are in Windows 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean it was cool, you could like pop bubbles with your finger and they just set your drink down and it's like there's a drink on the table.  But other than that, like I don't know what was the real practical application for the service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You ever watch CNN?  They do all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you use the service?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, with all their minority report stuff up on the screen, which ends up, you know, it was a novel thing a few years ago.  And then everyone was sort of scrambling to figure out how can we get these great giant screens that Wolf Blitzer stands in front of and you know,  it smacks this and this slides over here and then it ends up becoming more gimmicky than it becomes news disseminating.  You know, you end up finding it more abstract.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, just wait for the blue screen.  You know who does all that for them is David Borman, who's their Washington bureau chief, but used to he was our executive producer on the site.  Remember that, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and he worked at he came in as a consultant over at Tech TV too for a while.  Did he? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I saw him at CES and he's doing that for CNN.  He did the holographic correspondent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was cool.  Sorry, that was awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You like that? I thought that was the worst of the worst gimmicks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  David told me.  It's so hard.  Yeah, help me Obi Wan Kenobi.  David told me that that wasn't working minutes before they had to go live.  It was like last, you know, there are 27, 29 cameras all around her.  And I mean, what did they get?  It looked like there was somebody.  And what was the point?  Yeah, there was somebody standing in the studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just get him a limo and bring him in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cheaper.  And it's not 3D.  It was still 2D to us.  Right.  Maybe to them it was 3D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, you know, there's a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They could see it, right?  They can see it.  It's just blue screened in.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was like when Soledad was looking at me on the site when I was the, you know, Dev Nal, the virtual reality character.  She wasn't looking at me.  She was looking at a painter, a blue dot on the wall.  They put up a little piece of painter's tape.  They said, look at that.  Hey, can you believe Avatar is nominated?  By the time you hear this show, you'll know whether they won or not.  Avatar nominated for best picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, look, I mean, it was a crowd.  First of all, the whole reason they have 10 movies now is because, you know, the dark night.  Got bumped out and, you know, these sci fi films weren't making it in to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Star Wars never nominated.  Yeah.  Now, I guess it was Titanic must have been nominated, right?  It won best picture.  Yeah, it won.  OK, so Cameron has it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember, he stood up there and he did his thing.  Top of the world.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think he should have done that again.  Maybe he will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll see.  We'll find out tonight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he's up against his ex-wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, now I heard an interview with him about that and he was kind of miffed.  Catherine Bigelow, who did the Hurt Locker, is nominated for best director, as is James Cameron.  He said, We were married for two years, 20 years ago.  We've worked together ever since.  She's much more a collaborator and a colleague than she has ever been my ex-wife.  But it's a more entertaining story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is. It's a better story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Watch them closely.  It's like war of the roses.  You know, you know, the camera is going to hover over both of them, you know.  Exactly.  And the winner is.  It's going to be a story there.  Yeah.  So back to this career.  What?  Go ahead, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, nothing.  I just wanted to say that they tried to create trying to create drama between the two of them is bogus.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's that's called television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the courier, I think, is they're going to roll it out before they even see.  I don't know why Microsoft doesn't wait and see what the numbers are for the iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think they will.  They don't know.  I could get out soon.  It's five by seven.  It's got two screens left and right.  And you remember seeing some really cool pictures and video of dragging stuff from one screen to the other.  According to Engadget and Gizmodo that had this story, it's going to run on the Tegra 2, which is in the same OS as on the Zune HD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Tegra 2 is also supposed to power that that that little pad out of India called the Atom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tegra is actually Tegra 2 is actually pretty pretty powerful.  Yeah.  It wouldn't be a bad thing to have something on a Tegra 2.  But can they get this down to 499 is a question with two screens.  It's also a little big.  It's got a pen instead of touch.  It's got hand writing.  I haven't seen this running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a feeling this is vaporware.  This is their response is, you know, they kind of want to put people and let people know that, hey, we have an answer to.  But this most likely won't be off for another couple of years.  I mean, you're right, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They had vaporware at CES showing off the HP slate.  That was vaporware.  And yet Steve Ballmer didn't even know how to use it.  I mean, he was touching it and he didn't.  The only thing he could show off was that was that book app.  So this is this is that video of the I think the video is pretty pretty compelling, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's a it is compelling.  But it's again, I think it's a point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's fake.  Right.  I mean, I think the video is amazing.  I think this is what had a lot of people salivating.  And it's one of those devices.  Yeah.  If they could do this, that's great.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It has that, you know, pinch multitouch, which apparently Apple has a patent on.  Although interesting when Apple sued HTC, those 20 patents did not include the multitouch patent.  I don't think I think Apple even knows that that's not defensible.  But this is cool.  I want I want this.  This is more of a computer has a camera multitask.  It's going to be running Windows 7.  What do they call it?  Windows Series 7, phone, Windows Phone.  Good luck.  Yeah, that thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Windows 7, June HD.  By the way, did you see that video, though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, Kevin brings up the point again, but that that video that was surf rolling around the past few days about the one game, I think, N Gadget had it.  The one game played across all three platforms you could you could be using playing it on a Windows 7 machine with a mouse.  That's stop where you are in the game, then pick up your Windows 7, the series, mobile series, seven series phone, play the game there with touch, finish the game or not.  Leave off where you are and then jump on Xbox Live and play it from where you left off.  That's the first time it was an Indiana Jones platform game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's about time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that is that enough to sell it to sell it?  I don't know.  It's kind of I mean, all of the again, none of this is real, although the Gizmodo documents kind of make you think maybe it's a little closer to reality than.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not buying these articles that have been floating around to saying that Apple delayed now the launch of the iPad or the release of the iPad because of this.  No, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Apple says bring it on, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I don't think Apple does that either.  They just don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What what what do you think of the Apple losses?  So we talk here if we talk about this last week, I guess we didn't 20 losses against HTC.  I feel like Apple's kind of litigating instead of innovating, instead of competing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're going after the little guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know, if they succeed and they keep HTC off the market, that's going to piss a lot of people off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, the reason they're not going after Nokia is because they know that Nokia is holding hand, you know, has a whole handful of patents that they could fire right back at Apple.  Well, they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's exactly what happened.  They're going back and shooting at each other now.  Yeah.  In fact, there's a great New York Times Bits blog that had a map.  Let me see if I can find it of all of the lawsuits in the mobile space.  And it was it was it was the most convoluted diagram.  It just shows you everybody's suing everybody else.  It was crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Doesn't Palm own the bulk of these patents?  Like, do they have a lot of stuff?  Palm had this stuff going way back, right?  To the original pilot.  There was a bunch of stuff.  I remember that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see if Palm the palms not in here.  We've got Apple suing HTC, but Cisco, Elan and let's see Kodak are suing Apple.  But Nokia is suing Apple and Apple suing Kodak back then.  Sharp's getting sued by Research in Motion, Nokia and LG Group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is Tivo all over again.  For the DVR wars.  Yeah.  That patent.  It's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All of these.  And Leo, Leo, you're suing me.  I don't even know what that's.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I don't know.  I just, it was a pro.  It was a preemptive suit because I thought you might want to sue me.  Because of touch.  Well, you touch.  That was not, it wasn't a good touch.  It was a bad touch.  That's what they tell me.  Did you see that Conan O'Brien added a random woman to his Twitter account?  Yeah.  He says, I've decided to follow someone at random.  She likes peanut butter and gummy dinosaurs.  Sarah killing your life is about to change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How many followers does she have now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  We got to check.  I saw that when it happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was clicking refresh on her page and she was going up by like hundreds of followers,  per second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's got 15,500, her Twitter account.  Let's see.  Wait a minute.  Now let's see if we can get her even more followers.  See if we can break Conan's record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We should take another person at random and see if we can overtake that account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh really?  I got an idea.  How about you try this random guy?  Try Clayton Morris.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, nobody would ever follow him.  Do you want to pick somebody at random?  Let's do it.  Who wants to pick?  Kevin, I'm going to put you in charge.  Pick somebody completely random.  Completely random.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll do a search for something on Twitter.  We'll find her at random.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently she had three followers before Conan found her.  You got to have somebody with three followers.  Wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now she was into what?  Peanut butter or something like that?  Peanut butter.  Okay.  What can we search for that we would want?  The only other person that has three followers is Sebastian Rupley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't want to make it be a tech guy.  It should be somebody completely random.  She's now got 15,500 followers.  She's on 284 lists.  She's really become somebody famous thanks to Conan.  Out of Michigan.  Yeah.  I think it's because her name is her handle is lovely button.  How adorable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that cute or what?  It's probably a setup.  Conan probably owns that one.  Maybe it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe it is.  I don't know.  Why would he do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  Just to create controversy.  Who knows?  It sounds like a good idea.  Why don't we create a person, put them on Twitter, give them three followers, you, me,  and Kevin, and then boom, let's do it.  She likes peanut butter and jelly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what we could do is we could create this account and not tell anybody what it  is, but just kind of drop some hints throughout the show and see if people could find it and  follow it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like an Easter egg hunt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like an Easter egg hunt.  And then one of those followers would get an Apple iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now you're talking.  There's nothing like a good gimmick.  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think I may have found a user.  Lisa Tickled Pink says, I hate technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And her handle is Lisa Tickled Pink?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And her last tweet was, I hate technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That sounds like the right person for us.  She's got two followers, ladies and gentlemen.  All right.  Let's see what we can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We gave them a handicap.  She's in New Zealand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Perfect.  Do you know her, Kevin?  I do not know her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin, what's up?  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want everybody who's watching this show right now.  This is the woman who gave you bot worms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to give her three followers.  I'm going to follow her right now.  She now has three followers.  She's got 59 now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What?  You're kidding.  Refresh.  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  This is good.  So everybody followed Lisa Tickled Pink.  She has 163.  Let's see how high we can get her before next week's episode.  We'll check at the end of the episode and see how Lisa Tickled Pink is doing.  Oh, my gosh.  But this is not the iPad one because that one would have to be an account that we created  so we'd know who all the people were and stuff.  Or should we?  Wait a minute.  I could see who's following her.  I could pick a random from her followers.  That's a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is the deal.  I will pick on...  What is the ship?  April 3rd is the ship date.  It has email notifications turned on.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no.  When you get a new follower.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I'm sorry, Lisa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no.  What did you guys do?  Kevin, you're going to prison.  Do you know what?  In New Zealand, this is a federal offense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I did nothing.  You guys are enablers.  She has...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, gee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, so far 1,122.  I was against it.  The best thing is that she's underage.  No, she's not.  Look at that.  She's underage.  I told you not to do it.  I'm not.  I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not.  I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not.  I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She looks like a very nice lady who hates technology, has tweeted twice, and is really  puzzled right about now.  She says, why?  Why, Lord?  What did I do?  I really hate technology now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She has no idea what's happening right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why am I getting all this email?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this illegal?  It feels vaguely wrong.  It feels like it's illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It feels wrong, but I don't think it's illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it feels so right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, let's take a look at the news.  Let's take a look at the news when we come back.  How about that, John C. DeWrek?  I'm going to let you pick the next story.  What about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, it's going to be the Google Gesture search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love that, by the way.  I'm using it, and I love it.  Before we get to that, though, I want to mention our friends.  They're good friends.  It's Citrix, the folks who do GoToMeeting, GoToMyPC.  They do Enterprise Remote Access.  They do GoToAssist.  GoToMeeting is a program we use all the time here at Twitter to save travel.  Instead of going to a client's, you know, across town or flying across the country,  I did that for a red eye and then one day meeting that came back just exhausting.  Instead now we just say, look, go to GoToMeeting.com, join our meeting.  They'll see my computer.  I could show them the PowerPoint, the spreadsheets, we can collaborate together.  If you go to GoToMeeting.com slash twit right now, you could sign up for 30 days of GoToMeeting,  an unlimited account.  That means as many meetings as you want, as long as you want.  But you know what?  Every account is unlimited.  $49 a month for as many meetings as you want, as long as you want.  And that includes free voice and phone teleconferencing.  GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  It's secure, it's fast, it's easy to use, and it is a real lifesaver in business.  Please give it a try.  GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  We thank them so much for their support of This Week in Tech.  How's Lisa doing?  Let's just refresh here and see.  How much email has poor Lisa tickled pink?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She just tweeted that she loves technology.  I'm not sure what that's about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love it now, she says.  I loves it now.  Up to 1,621 followers.  Thank you all.  Those are just the live viewers.  And of course, as people come and listen to the show, we could get her, I think we could  easily get her over 15,000.  Yeah.  So just-  In a campaign like this.  Oh man, this is strong.  One of the new followers, or even the two followers previously, somebody will be picked  at random from her followers and will win an iPad.  You know what?  To make it up to Lisa, I'm going to give her an iPad too.  Oh wait a minute, she's in New Zealand.  I could just send her one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, that'll work.  She might not know how to use it because she hates technology, but in theory, you can send  her one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so that's-  It'd actually be more hilarious if you send her one of the 3G ones.  That doesn't work at all.  That doesn't work in her country at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'll send her a Wi-Fi.  We'll give away the low end iPad because I think that's all you need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you guys going to buy the Wi-Fi?  Here's what I can't figure out.  I can't decide whether or not, because I know you're going to, Leo, I know you're going  to buy one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to buy all six.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm debating whether or not to get the Wi-Fi one or hold out and get the 3G one.  I'm getting Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or you could wait six months and get the iPad Pro with multitasking and a camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't want that.  Do you really think, Kevin, that that's ... Do you think that that's something needed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The camera or the multitasking?  Both.  I mean, there was leaked rumors that they're coming out with a camera on the back of one  of these in the future version.  No way.  No way.  Yeah, totally.  It's been talked about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No way.  Wait.  You don't think so?  To what?  To hold it up and take a picture with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I would say there's more for video conferencing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, okay, think about that.  Now, what are you going to have to do to video ... You're going to have to lean on something  otherwise it's shooting up your nose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's for the shooting up your nose video conferencing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's fantastic conferencing.  People want to see that.  I mean, I wrote up a piece the same day at the announcement.  I said, I don't really care about that, I mean, for the camera because you're going  to have to ... It's not a device ... It's a device you don't want to have to hold out  like this the entire time and it'd be shooting up your nose if you have it down on a table.  Right.  I mean, it's a consumption device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Flip it over.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It'd be more fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Upside down nose?  No, no, you never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I ... To me, I think that the ... I am ignoring you.  It's right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Kevin may have gotten the humor there.  I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got it, John.  Oh, so you guys ... You're too hip for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo, flip the device over.  Where's the camera pointing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At your feet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, what can we say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At your porn stick.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, guy.  Hey.  Hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What?  All right, that's enough of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't know if you ... I thought you were suddenly on chat roulette.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We did that last week.  Oh my goodness.  And by the way, it only took us two clicks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I tell you, I was listening.  I was in Germany this past week and I was driving down the Autobahn listening to last  week's episode and it takes a lot to get me to laugh like that.  Because I knew what was about to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You knew.  I didn't know.  I didn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I fell right into it.  Well, I was on The Daily Show the other night because I was one of those jackasses that  was one of the people doing a segment on chat roulette.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, he did a great bit.  Natalie Delconte was on it.  You were on it.  Yeah, that was a funny bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, and we ... I mean, it's a concern for kids because kids are on this thing, to be  honest with you.  Look, kids are using this thing.  That's who's honest.  Right.  We had already been testing it and playing around with it and within one or two clicks  you're getting some guy doing that.  I knew your second click you guys ...  Two clicks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Two clicks to a dick.  Basically.  Sorry?  Nothing.  You missed a great show there, John.  That's all I can say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It sounds lewd.  I'll have nothing to do with this sort of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very, very, very, very, very.  ABC News says, three-month-old starves to death while parents spend hours in internet  cafes.  South Korea in shock today after police arrested a couple Wednesday for child neglect.  The husband, 45, the wife, 41, the wife, 25, addicted to online games, spend 12 hours a  night in internet cafes.  Why do we keep getting stories like this out of Korea?  Do they really do this or is there just a ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  My experience is in Korea.  For one thing I don't think that the general speed is necessarily as fast as they claim  but I'll tell you this.  I don't care what store you go into, the person that's working the store is on the computer  either doing chat or they're playing some game.  Everybody in the country is on a computer all the time and they don't wait on you.  It's like they roll their eyes when they actually have to take a sale or something because they  have to get away from the computer for a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is like idiocracy.  How long before we're like that in this country?  It's not too far behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They really like it.  The BBC, like I said I was just in Germany this week and I was watching a BBC special  on South Korea and their internet usage and it's ground zero.  It is the most consumptive country for internet usage in the world and they have addiction  problems now to the point where they're talking about people being so disconnected from society  and they have all kinds of depressive problems for these kids that it's becoming a cultural  issue.  In fact there's a new BBC show launching in the next few weeks where they're actually  taking two countries and two case studies where they're taking one family from South  Korea and they're going to force them to turn off the internet completely.  No internet connection and they're going to Nigeria and they're teaching them how to use  the internet.  They've never touched the internet before and they're going to see how these two families  fare in these two different countries on how they use the internet.  South Korea is the worst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think the Nigerian couple is going to make a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What did you say Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've heard about the TV shows they have dedicated to Starcraft.  They see it as like a sport.  There's commentary and people watching other people play Starcraft on TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just got my Starcraft 2 beta invite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm so excited.  I'm so excited.  We suck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You didn't get it Kevin?  No I didn't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of all people.  We can get you one.  We can get you one.  You know people?  Battle.net.  Hey, we need Kevin at Starcraft 2 invite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you can both be disconnected and not wait on John.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He doesn't answer his email anyway.  I love Starcraft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bet you love Diablo 2 Kevin, right?  Yeah.  I can't wait till Diablo 3 comes out.  I'm a big fan.  So I didn't actually have a Battle.net account because I played in the days when it was a  single person game, right?  Actually Starcraft was online.  Starcraft was online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but before that it was a single player.  I love Starcraft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, a single player.  Yeah, great game, right?  Yeah, the original.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that the game too?  And I forget me if, was that the one that had the mighty Spathy?  Do you remember the Spathy?  It was like the little space?  Is that the one?  I don't know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It was like the weakest of...  How do you spell Spathy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  My friend and I wrote a song called The Mighty Spathy back in the day, back in high school,  because it was the weakest ship, but it made this little do-do-do, do-do-do sound effect  and it would get blown up within one hit.  And I got a swan that was from Starcraft.  One hit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What kind of a spaceship is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was extremely agile.  That was the benefit of it.  It was extremely agile, but if you hit it, it exploded.  And that's why you didn't want to use it, but you could zip around like a mosquito.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've got to find out how you spell it.  Those were scout ships.  They were for exploring quickly so you could see the rest of the map.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what's the next news story we got here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, John, how about this one?  Mark Andreessen, the guy who created Netscape.  I think you're friends of his, aren't you Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he sits on our board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Eric Citi talking to Eric Schoenfeld of TechCrunch about how media companies are handling the  digital disruption of the internet.  And he brought up his advice for old media companies.  Burn the boats.  You got to commit, referring of course to Cortez's burning of the boats when they arrived  in the New World so that basically they couldn't go home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wasn't that the Vikings?  That wasn't such a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Turned out not well, no, not so well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say it brought malaria with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think that old media companies are not committed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've met with a lot of media companies when it comes to news and their strategy going  forward.  Sure, because of DIG, of course.  Because of DIG.  And I don't think it's just burning the boats, but it's also kind of a changing of the guard  that needs to take place internally within these organizations, right?  Because you have a lot of people that have no idea how to build really compelling good  websites or web experiences online.  So, I mean, the New York Times is doing a really good job.  I know a bunch of people that run their digital division, but it's still two separate organizations  inside this big company.  In fact, there's a reason to say, get rid of print.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a battle between the print guys who say we got to charge 30 bucks a month for  the iPad and subscription, the digital guys who say you can't charge 30 bucks, nobody's  going to pay that.  He says, yeah, shut down.  He says shut down your print editions.  That's the equivalent of burning the boats.  Just shut them down and say, it is true.  I think it is true that, and you see this in the network television and other places,  that as long as your business is based on the old way of doing things, you're just not  going to commit to the new way of doing things because it cannibalizes that old business.  You have to be willing to say, we're going to lose the old business.  We can't, you know, we just got to go full split ahead.  If you're a publicly held company, I mean, it's going to be a tough thing to do.  That's going to be a very tough thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not something you can do on your own.  That's the board approval and a bunch of other crap that you have to go through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Breaking news, breaking news.  This just in.  The girl now has 2000 followers.  Her email is toast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The best part is what time of night is it over there right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's got to be late at night, right?  It's three hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's homeroosed, man, when she gets up in the morning.  It's one in the morning, right?  Nice going, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're three hours ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hope she's got her phone on vibrate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If she's got a message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She'll be a nervous wreck if she does for a lot of different reasons.  How did you find her, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just did a Twitter search for I hate technology because I wanted to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Perfect.  She hates it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what we do to everyone who hates technology.  We use technology to bring you down.  We hate it more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We just, this is a little 4channy, actually.  I think we're verging into 4chan territory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but they do it so anonymously.  This could not have been more public.  Yeah.  Oh, geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I could use a few more followers.  The real Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  See, we can't, we're not allowed to do it for ourselves.  No, I just did it.  Mark Zuckerberg, interesting article in the, I don't know, the mail.  Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, another friend of yours, Kevin, I apologize  for bringing it in, but you just know all the big shots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're all Kevin's friends.  He knows everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is actually, the Harvard Crimson was planning on running an article on him in 2004  when he was still, I guess he was still a Harvard student back then.  Apparently, according to this article, he used the reporter's Facebook logins to hack  into their Crimson accounts to check and see what they were going to write about him.  In the second instance, the magazine claimed Zuckerberg hacked into the accounts of rivals  at Harvard who accused him of stealing their idea for a social network.  There's even quotes of chat dialogues about this.  The Winklevoss twins, I love saying the Winklevoss twins, accused Zuckerberg of misleading them  about his willingness to help them build their website.  They had a website called harvardconnection.com.  In fact, there was a famous lawsuit and we'll never know what really happened, of course,  everything was sealed.  Kevin, you didn't buy it.  You thought this was kind of not credible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was reading through the article and it was describing how the hack took place and it  just doesn't even sound like possible.  It said that basically, Zuckerberg, he looked up all the accounts that he wanted to hack  and then he would search to see if they had ever mistyped a different password into Facebook.  Where would he find that?  If you're writing and someone mistypes a password and it doesn't match your MB5 back on your  site, you don't save the mistyped password locally or anywhere in a database.  It just doesn't make sense.  I just can't see that happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The other side of this was the email.  If they were using an alternative email to sign up and he wouldn't have to use an alternative  password.  He could use the same password.  Typically, back then, we weren't so worried about passwords that we are now that it just  might have been the same one, right?  It could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nobody really stores passwords in plain text anymore.  I can't imagine Facebook would have done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does have a dubious aspect to it, but it's a known fact that there's some battle going  on between these Harvard kids who supposedly invented the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Winklevoss twins sued him.  They're good-looking twins, by the way.  This is from thebusinessinsider.com, the Silicon Alley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Being twins, I'm sure they had other activities to attend to.  They were rowers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were rowers.  If that's what you call it, Leo.  Oh, stop it, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Calacanis was talking to me last week.  And Kevin, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Calacanis, no!  He thinks the worst of Zuckerberg.  He was really, as you pointed out, Clayton, last week, he was really dismissive and said  Zuckerberg was dishonest and untrustworthy.  And then he sent me the link to this article saying, see, I told you so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He has a history of stealing, was his larger point, too, is that this doesn't seem like  it's outside of the grounds of that.  But I mean...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.  Every time...  I've hung out with Mark a few times and he's always just come off as really legit and nice  guy and I don't know, he didn't rub me the wrong way ever that we've hung out.  I don't know him that well.  That's why we're under the bridge.  I don't know, there's a lot of people...  When it comes to ideas, really, there's a ton of people that will come up and give you  ideas, like even at our Dignations that we do, like, hey, you should do this feature,  you should do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then they say, I did it.  They say, I did it.  And they say, well, you built this.  And in reality, it's the person that goes and builds it.  Anyone can have an idea.  You have to execute on that idea and actually go out and make it happen.  You know?  Well, let me add to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of the things you run into is that most ideas are kind of in the ether and it's because  of whatever is on...  I mean, it's a combination of what's on television, the time of day, the time of year, other ideas  that are out there.  Because when I'm working for some magazine and I'll get somebody, I've got this idea  I've got to tell you about, but you have to sign this or that.  So I'm not even going to sign anything because whatever idea you have, I guarantee there's  five other guys working on it.  And you see that.  A whole bunch of the exact same idea hits the market at the exact same time from all  kinds of different dimensions or directions, I'm sorry.  And it's just the idea.  These ideas are out there and they're always synchronous.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the reason that venture capitalists, if you ever go to raise money or to pitch  them on an idea, they'll never sign an NDA.  They just won't.  They say, we don't sign NDAs because we hear so many different ideas.  We've probably already heard it and you're going to come and try and sue us and they  don't sign them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was the reason at Tech TV that we had a special person who entertained pitches for  TV shows.  We weren't allowed to entertain them.  And I have the same policy here.  People pitch me on a new podcast ideas all the time.  I said, I don't want to hear it because I might come up with the same idea and I want  you to come back and say, oh, it was my idea.  There's only a few ideas for podcasts.  It's a serious problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's the...  Really?  Yeah.  So back on Tech TV days, you didn't field pitches for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They had a special person who was, I think, one of the legal counsels who's not for stories,  for shows.  So if you were on a show to Tech TV, you would pitch it to this one person.  And like the program director, nobody else was allowed to hear pitches.  And I certainly wasn't because they didn't want a lawsuit.  So this is now...  And by the way, this is from businessinsider.com, how Facebook was founded.  I mean, I don't know.  You could fake an IM exchange.  There's no way to verify that an IM exchange was real, but this is the IM exchange they  published.  Zuckerberg says, so you know how I'm making that dating site.  I wonder how similar that is to the Facebook thing because they're probably going to be  released about the same time.  And here's the kind of smoking gun.  Unless I screw, I'll use a different word, the dating site people over and quit on them  right before I told them I'd done it.  Angela, who is the other person, says, ha ha.  Like I don't think people would sign up for the Facebook thing if they knew it was for  dating.  And when you read it, it's like, man, that could be real.  But how do you verify it?  And I think that when you're on top, people do aim for you.  You know, that just puts you in the...  Did you, John, on No Agenda cover the fact that the Arctic seabed methane stores are  destabilizing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That methane story stinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because, you know, I could see the whole climate thing flipping on Adam because I know he's  a debunker now.  But this would be a great conspiracy theory.  He could say, because apparently the seafloor at the Arctic holds vast stores of frozen  methane, which is now starting to vent.  It's a much worse greenhouse gas and it could cause catastrophic overnight climate change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's like all the cow flatulence.  Now we've got the cow flatulence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By land in Canada, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well somewhere high in Canada too, because you guys are going to have all flooding and...  This is from an article in the fizzorg.com.  It's a study of the universe.  No, we did not discuss this.  Well, you got to bring this up.  University of Alaska Fairbanks scientists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've actually avoided the climate stuff for a while.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I thought you guys would have been all over that.  The ice they said because of this area was so impermeable that they never thought they'd  have to worry about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  It was stuck there, but now it's melting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is the methane doing there?  It has a timeshare.  I'm just asking.  Where does all this methane and this ice come from?  I don't think there's any dispute that it's there.  Was it a bunch of car... were they sequestering cow farts?  I mean, what was the deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were storing it like the seed storage unit up in the Arctic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Bill Gates has got something to do with that.  I'm telling you, they're trying to kill us all.  That's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't say where the methane came from.  Merely that it's there and it's leaking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I ask you guys a question?  Leah, you brought this up about the old media thing.  I get to talk about it because I think it's so fascinating, this idea and these future  platforms.  We're like a month away now from the iPad.  I'm curious, Kevin, you said you've been talking to a number of these media companies about  their platforms and moving forward.  Have they addressed... are they talking about the tablet space?  How are they addressing that?  I just see this wide open area right now where the New Yorker is going to have one app that's  going to look completely different.  Who knows if people are going to pay $12 or whatever they're going to pay.  Then somebody else is going to have a $60 app.  I'm just curious where this marketplace is unfolding over the next month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It strikes me...  I haven't had a lot of meetings since the iPad announcement, but the stuff that I've  read is that there's a bunch of magazines that are preparing their digital versions  for the iPad.  And newspapers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure the Times will have an app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's weird.  When you think about subscribing, do I subscribe to the Times and get an ad-free version or  do I just go to NewYorkTimes.com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe they'd shut that down.  It seems to me this is a step backwards from the free and open web to these silos again,  these closed things.  I love the iPad and I'll buy one and I'll probably subscribe to all of those things.  Isn't that you, Leo?  I think a lot of people will, but is this really the right direction to go in?  It's kind of the contrary to where we were going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just working on a piece that will probably be published tomorrow for FoxNews.com about  why I'm...  It took me a little while to figure out how I wanted this device.  Where in my sort of space I'm going to see this device.  I found myself sitting in bed the other night.  I was getting ready for Fox and Friends and I just didn't want to browse all the headlines  and go through my feed, sitting there with my laptop propped up there.  I also didn't want to then hop up and jump on a desktop.  I wanted a simple device I could just grab and I could just skim.  I don't like being in Google Reader.  It feels like an industrial way of consuming news.  To have this device where I could see my mom sitting there on her recliner on the couch  at home jumping on this device to just grab a few headlines and see what's going on.  She jumps on it and it's going to break.  It's very sturdy.  She could also use it as a coaster or a cheese plate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what she could use it as?  I think that actually this might sell a few of them is it makes a pretty good digital...  Cheese plate idea is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It makes a pretty good digital photo frame.  Yeah.  There you go.  That's what they're going to end up as.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did verify though that you could use a cheese stick to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you really?  Now is this a fact?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a fact.  By accident.  No, intentionally.  There was a story that Koreans were using sausages because...  You remember that?  They were using frozen because their fingers were frozen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they were using these...  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like Jimmy Dean links.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was too cold.  They didn't want to take their gloves off so they're sitting in the subway in Korea  and they're using sausages on their iPhones because it's capacitance.  So you need...  I don't know what.  I don't know.  So I didn't buy it.  I thought that can't be.  It would get all grimy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would get so nasty.  Well, yeah, but...  A slim gym on the front of your iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't think it would work.  Have you tried licking the thing to see what would happen?  Let me try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Try and unlock your iPhone right now with your tongue wheel.  I got to see this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, John just provokes.  All right.  Will you try licking a socket to see if it works?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, ready?  We're ready.  Ready.  You want a close-up?  Okay.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's locked.  We don't want to really see a close-up.  Well, I won't touch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's part of the HTC patent.  Lick to unlock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it doesn't work.  It's not working.  Oh, it did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It worked.  Now dial a number with your tongue.  I can't dial...  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Call me.  There's so many germs on that thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh.  No, wrong passcode.  I just want to tell the chat room that we'll be going overtime.  And...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the deal is, I thought, well, let's try it, but we didn't have any sausages in the  fridge, but we had cheese sticks.  And it works.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the best marketing.  This episode brought to you by Polly O String Cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If it's too cold to use your iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's fascinating, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Quite like an amuse.  You wrote an article in PC Magazine this week, John, in which you think that Microsoft is  behind Google's woes in Italy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and I have a story that was kind of left out of that because nobody wants to talk  about the situation.  Microsoft is seriously in Italy.  Italy is the only country that never licensed the Dvorak columns from PC Magazine in its  heyday.  And that was because the Microsoft Italy guy basically just told me, can't run my stuff  there because I'm not amenable.  Wow.  I'm not playing ball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You were on Bomber's enemy list, as I remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't know if I was really on an enemy's list, but I was definitely not going to be  in Italy.  And there's a history of Microsoft in Italy that is extremely, their tentacles are really  strong in there.  So now we're having this crazy stuff happening.  And so I said, well, maybe it's Microsoft causing trouble because they have a lot of  influence in Italy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So just to recap, three Google executives were indicted for privacy violations in a  video that was on YouTube for, no, I'm sorry, Google video for a couple of months.  They pulled it down when the Italian police told them to, but the Italian judge felt that  they should have noticed and pulled it down sooner.  And you think Microsoft put them up to it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I do.  I don't have any proof whatsoever.  I'm just going by anecdotal information and the fact that they have a lot of influence  in Italy and they throw their weight around when they can.  And Microsoft is on the attack against Google right now in a big way because I don't think  Microsoft appreciated Google jumping on the bandwagon against Microsoft in the EU.  I mean, I don't blame them in some ways.  And by the way, Schmidt and Microsoft have always had these little battles between the  two companies because when he was at Sun, obviously there was a, you had Scott McNeely  who was an out and out Microsoft basher.  And so you have a lot of history here.  And it just seems to me that this wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for Microsoft.  So I'm just putting two and two together.  There's just one of my subjective columns where I suggest this or that may be the case.  I'm not being insincere about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, this isn't link bait, you're saying.  This is something you think might actually be the case.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that's an interesting thought.  Microsoft, remember, there's a history of Microsoft being kind of this way.  Remember, Windows ain't done till Lotus won't run.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'm surprised actually, they're not, I mean, I think they still are that way, but  I don't think they're as aggressive as they used to be.  But the situation in Europe right now, you know, they're picking on American companies  generally speaking because they can gouge us for certain amount, you know, for huge  fines and Microsoft got stung big time and both Sun and lesser extent Google were in  on the deal, kind of snickering in the background.  So Microsoft, the shoe's on the other foot now.  So they're doing whatever they can to harass Google and we'll see where it ends up.  I mean, this whole thing is becoming hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got a story that is verifiable and not conspiracy theory and really annoying about DRM and Ubisoft.  But we'll talk about that in a second.  Right now I'd like to mention our friends at audible.com, the folks who do those great  audiobooks and you can get two free books right now.  If you go to audible.com slash twit two, you'll sign up for the platinum account.  That's it.  You know, you can get audible books a la carte one by one.  A lot of people do that.  In fact, you see some great deals.  This is House Rules is $9.95 right now and they always have half off sales and stuff.  But if you are a regular audible reader, the subscription is the best deal.  I am a platinum subscriber.  That's two books a week.  Oh, sorry, a month.  I wish they had two books a week.  I probably could read it.  And if you sign up right now, the first two books are yours free and you get to keep them  even if you cancel at any time.  So we're basically going to give you two books here.  audible.com slash twit two.  Audible is a great kind of bookstore of audio selection, 70,000 titles.  I read them all the time.  I'm reading, I just love this book, but we've recommended it before, but I'm going to recommend  it again.  Daniel Suarez, Demon.  Have any of you guys read this book?  Oh, is this good?  No, it's there.  It is.  So the story is I don't want to give away too much because it's full of twists, but the  story is essentially a kind of a kind of John Romero type famous, famous game programmer  dies but leaves behind a demon, a computer program that is demonic.  And it is a great murder mystery story.  Can you have, can you have a murder mystery where the guy who's doing the murders is dead?  Yes you can.  And Daniel Suarez knows tech.  So this isn't one of those books where you read and it's got a lot of bogus technical  jargon and stuff.  It's clear the guy's a complete nutter geek.  It's as if one of us wrote it, which makes it so much fun.  Let me play a little bit of a, this is Jeff Gerner reading Daniel Suarez is Demon.  This is right at the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Penguin audio presents Demon by Daniel Suarez, read by Jeff Gerner with Garrett Scott.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  D-A-E-M-O-N, Demon, noun, a computer program that runs continuously in the background and  When the, when the Hummer, the remote control Hummer goes crazy, that just gets exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll tell you, this is one, really, really one of those great page turners with a lot  of...  That's a carry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What am I saying?  What's the car?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The bulldozer.  Don't worry, the chat room will tell it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A ghost in the machine or something like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're talking about the Stephen King book with the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I want the Stephen King because, well, I have to admit a few years ago, whenever  Audible first started...  Killdozer.  ... first, Killdozer?  No, that's not it.  That was my first Audible book I ever bought a few years ago from Twit.  And I've been a subscriber ever since.  I'm reading Under the Dome right now.  Yeah, how's that?  Oh, it's fantastic.  Raul Esparza and someone just in the chat room mentioned it as well.  You get your money's worth out of that puppy too.  Under the Dome.  I think it's like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  34 and a half hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  I mean, you will age an entire year by the time you're done listening to this book, but  it's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, wait until you get to the end because who was reading it?  I think Andy and Ako or somebody said, oh man, the ending's kind of weak.  Oh, really?  Well, maybe not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nice way to ruin it.  Really good job.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's into it.  Oh.  You know, the first 34 hours are great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The last half hour, hmm, not so hot.  But you know, it's a great journey.  This would be a good one too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the journey.  That's what people say to people at graduation.  It's the journey that you want to remember.  Not where you're going.  Paul Farazad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.  Some of the people in the chat room are denying the weak ending.  Okay, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, good.  Paul didn't like the ending, but you know what?  Yeah, The New York Times gave it a great, great review.  It was Paul Farazad that said that.  Yeah, I cannot wait to read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It has 4.15 stars out of 1,600 ratings.  That's pretty good.  So that's a possible five stars.  That's an excellent rating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's fewer followers though than Lisa.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's Lisa out right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's check real quickly.  But anyway, audible.com slash twit two.  Sign up today.  Get your free books.  We're giving you a couple of great ones, but there's tons to choose from.  Audible.com slash twit two.  And we thank them so much for their support of This Week in Tech.  Lisa Tickled Pink, can I have a little drum roll please?  As the tote board goes round and round, 2,131 followers.  Let's keep those followers going.  Remember, one of you will win an Apple iPad.  How are you going to figure out who wins?  I'm just going to look at her list of followers and I'm going to pick it random from that list of followers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a program at Cali Kansas that will go and select a person randomly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll have to get that from Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you should, Leo, you should give her the iPad after the news.  No, I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You weren't paying attention.  She's getting one and one of her followers is getting one.  And Lisa is in New Zealand, so she's going to be one of the few New Zealanders who will actually have an iPad.  And you know what would be great too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could also be like Doug Llewellyn because if she doesn't know, you pick a guy on her list and she's single and she hates technology and then you bring these two people together, they end up getting married.  Boy, there's a guy from Fox.  That's how Rupert would do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then we'll put them on an island and have them duke it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And by the way, we're rising to the top of dig.  So quickly go to a dig and dig this story.  And poor Lisa is her picture is now on the cup on the front.  This is Lisa.  You're queen for a day.  Let me just say you're queen for a day.  Does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's a captain in the chat room says, does Leo know that Conan asked permission before he friended his random person?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the difference between me and a network superstar.  That's what I'm asking.  Is it illegal?  Is it immoral?  Is it wrong?  No, I don't think so.  I think I'm making her a star famous, famous, whether she wants to or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Holy crap, Leo, you got a huge story on dig the other day.  Best tech I call her ever.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we were on the front page for a while.  So I had a good week last week.  I had two viral videos that made it to the front page of dig.  And I've had several hundred thousand.  Nothing like you get to Barney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You didn't get to one point three million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nothing like this stupid Barney video that John is.  I will never ever understand.  John has one point three million hits on a video of Barney singing I love you in his bathroom.  There's nothing else.  It's just that's it.  It's the whole video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, I'm a genius.  I guess it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So no, I'm only at three hundred thousand.  It was a woman called the radio show.  I didn't even put it up.  Somebody watching said this is funny.  She called the radio show and she said my Wi-Fi is down.  I bought a Wi-Fi extender and I can't get it anymore.  I said, oh, well, that's too bad.  And she said, yeah, I mean, it's just there's no signal.  I said, well, that's and let me ask you a dumb question.  Did that call ever end, by the way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was like, it's pretty long.  I said, let me ask you a dumb question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You do have Internet access, right?  She says, no, no, no.  I said, you have an access point.  She says, no, no, no.  It's Linksys.  I said, what?  She said, it's Linksys.  It's I'm I'm I said, you have an access point.  I said, you mean you're stealing it.  Well, it's so expensive to get Internet access.  And I said, and you're and you're mad because it stopped.  The person probably moved or just turned it off or passed away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And she said, well, I've been getting it for a year and a half.  Oh, that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's another woman I've made famous, Jennifer.  And I don't know, somewhere in Southern California anyway.  So, yeah, that got in front of dig.  And then I'm on a horse, Old Spice.  We got the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everyone's talking about that interview you did.  I love that commercial so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we just called the agency and said, would you explain how this is done?  And so we walked through it and they explained how it was.  It was all one shot.  They actually.  OK, you've seen the commercial, right?  There's this good looking guy says, ladies, look at me.  Now look at your man.  Now look at me.  Your man doesn't look as good as me, but he could smell like me.  If he used Old Spice and he's in a shower.  But then the shower disappears and now he's on a boat and his shirt comes on  and he's dressed and he and he continues to talk.  And eventually at the end of the commercial, he's somehow he's on a horse  and he says, I'm on a horse.  So I thought, oh, there's a lot of CG or editing or cutting here.  It's all one shot.  And the final scene, he's actually standing on this boat.  And he's but he's on a gurney that without, you know, he stands completely upright,  but you don't see below his waist and his slides him onto this horse physically.  So I just it was amazing.  Anyway, so both of those guys get viral.  I was very happy about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, they do that over and over again.  Another breaking news.  Yeah. Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Let Clayton say something.  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to I was going to riff on what you were just saying.  That on the horse.  We had a guy on a show, you know, the guy was in the train spotting.  Yeah.  One of the guys.  He's in something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Scottish fella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And they did this entire they do these over in England where they have four minutes to do a commercial instead of 30 seconds.  And all in like, you know, they did it like in 30 takes, but he starts at like the top of this mountain in Scotland.  And it was all for some sort of whiskey or something.  And he ends up on the bottom.  He walks for like four and a half minutes and all of these things along the journey.  Like he grabs something from someone.  Someone hands him a sword.  A woman walks in the frame.  He makes out with her.  He has this bottle of whiskey.  He does this and that.  It was like a Scorsese shot through the bar.  Oh, I love that.  Yeah.  And everyone's good fellas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  There's no cuts at all.  And they do this.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you've seen the new OK, go video.  Oh, my God.  The Rube Goldberg thing.  That's that's it.  They've got to be submitted.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's in that though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's Johnny Walker ad?  Johnny Walker.  Yeah.  Coming down from the mountain.  Yeah.  No.  Get out of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is he wearing a top hat?  Somebody, one of our maniacs here, I guess, who is at the Oscars and also on the chat

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  room took a picture of him.  And he's like, oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to be in the middle of the night.  I'm going to be in the middle of the night.  I'm going to be in the middle of the night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to be in the middle of the night.  I guess who is at the Oscars and also on the chat room took a picture of him in the apparently  over by the red carpet.  Oh, you're kidding.  Let's let's take a look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The chat room.  Yeah, it's in the chat room.  No, it's not.  Did you see the weird hat?  Clayton was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you actually see it?  No, he put it on when he got I didn't see him with the hat on.  He walks in and I run into him.  So and I tweeted this the other day.  You know, it's not every day you walk into to work and you just walk run into Steve Jobs.  He's coming through the one door at News Corp and I just walk right there and there he is  with like a contingent and he was going upstairs because now the Wall Street Journal moved  into our building.  So he was going upstairs to show off the iPad.  So but then I heard these reports of him in this funky hat and I didn't see him in the  hat.  So I was so disappointed.  I don't know if it was like a some sort of like jester hat with bells hanging off of  it or what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They said it was just a strange hat.  So here here is the picture.  This is somebody's posted this on his apostress.  It says, Oh my God, it's Steve Jobs.  I'm the only one yelling at him.  But I'm looking where now Steve, of course, there he is.  Yeah, he is, of course, on the board of Pixar founder of Pixar and Pixar is nominated.  So I could see he'd be there.  And there there he is.  There's a security contingent, obviously, unless you know.  So there's Stooges.  You can see the Stooges in front and back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess that's one event he would actually leave the house for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's great.  He's obviously, I think it's great.  He's healthy enough that he's going to the Oscars.  That's fantastic.  Well, I'm sure they're going to have some cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If they're doing their job, somebody's going to have to throw a camera on him during the  presentation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, this is Hollywood.  This is Hollywood.  He's Steve Jobs.  You know, I guess they would know who he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, they have this policy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's the only guy yelling at him.  Maybe nobody knows what he looks like in Hollywood.  Who knows?  Could be.  I mean, if I had a choice between a shot of, let's say, Anne Hathaway and Steve Jobs, I'd

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  push the button on the Hathaway shot.  Anne Hathaway.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they have this looser.  They have this looser policy this year.  Loser?  For speeches.  What?  Yeah, they have this.  They have a loser policy now.  So, no, they have a looser policy now for speeches.  And every person who is nominated has been told to prepare two speeches for tonight's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  performance.  One long, one short.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're kidding.  One for the stage, if they win, and then one because they're going to have separate cameras  now out in the hallway to speed up the feeling of the show.  So they're going to be out in the hallway for like quick interviews or sort of like  the, you know, I don't know, Cineba Verde interviews.  Hey, we just, hey, here's Steven Spielberg.  What do you have to say?  And they're just going to like randomly grab, randomly grab people.  And you're telling me those speeches are rigged?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they don't know who's going to win.  So I found the Johnny Walker.  You're going to have two speeches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In other words, you give your canned speech in front of the microphone in front of the  public and then you go in the back and you give another canned speech.  Give me a break.  Why can't these people ad lib one line in their life?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You'd think they're actors, you know, they're actors.  They could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's the point.  They're actors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have to read a script.  I'm suddenly thirsty for Johnny Walker.  I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know why.  This is the ad you were talking about, Clayton?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this is the one.  We had, what's his name again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  You recognize that guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  From Trainspotting.  I don't know his name off the top of my head.  But yeah, so this thing goes on.  He's, you know, and this is all one take.  There's a cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was a grave.  So he's telling the story of Johnny Walker.  Yeah, the history of it.  As he's walking.  Now he goes in the grocery.  This is good.  It's just a door in the middle of the road.  Well, it's like a grocery, but it's just a door.  So let me talk about some tech news.  We'll play the rest of this at some other points.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can we, Leo, can we do a sidetrack since we did do a little bit on Hollywood there?  I went to the Dolby screening of the Alice in Wonderland movie.  What did you think of that?  I liked it, to be honest about it, but I'm a big Tim Burton fan.  So as far as I'm concerned, it gets a pass on everything.  I really enjoyed the movie and I thought the whole thing was well done.  But you know, did you ever explain on this show what those glasses are that Dolby uses  and how they work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we did actually.  Ray Maxwell did a whole, he's from the Full Monty, by the way, not, I have it on a Post-It  note, not Trainspotting.  He's the Full Monty.  Wait a minute, he's not in Trainspotting?  No, he's the guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you're right.  I know he's in Full Monty too, but you're the one who wants to check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Post-It notes never lie.  Anyway, anyway, so we did, Ray Maxwell did a whole thing on 3D.  Those glasses, there's three different kinds of 3D movies.  There's the Real D, there's Dolby 3D, and there's the IMAX 3D.  The only one that's active is the IMAX.  No, it's not active.  None of them are active.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, which is the stuff that you can buy for your home now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they have a variety of different ones, and those are active because they need batteries  in those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those are shuttered.  Those are bad for you.  Polarized?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the Real D is polarized, essentially polarized.  There's a circular polarized one.  I can't remember the details.  It's a notch filter.  No, there's one that's frequency.  Maybe that's the Dolby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, that's the notch filter one from Dolby.  It's a notch filter glass, and the notch filters are angled at different, or they're slightly  different notches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jesus, I can't figure out why they can't sell this crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's a notch filter, and apparently they're just notched slightly differently so they  can shoot the whole thing through one lens because it's the way the mirror spins around.  It has to be done on one of those DLP projectors.  You get this notch filter thing, which gives you the 3D effect, which is actually quite  good for anybody who wants to see it, but it's a little muddy.  The real problem is because the notch filters take out half of what you're seeing on each  eye.  It's a little bit of a turkey jerk in a funny way, so the real fast action doesn't seem  to be that great.  But that's the reason there.  I think those glasses that Dolby has, I didn't ask them about this because they gave us a  big presentation.  I think those lenses probably cost about $100 a piece.  Really?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, one of the reasons these, the real D...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not those, the notch filter ones.  It's a real thick lens.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of the reasons the real D is very popular in theaters is the glasses are $4 each, or  they're cheap, and the process doesn't require any special projector.  They just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but it requires a silver screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does require a modification of the screen, but that screen can continue to be used for  other movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but it has hotspots all over it.  I'm just giving you the dirty propaganda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is interesting.  So how was the, Alice, was it 3D?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I liked it.  I enjoyed it.  I thought it was great.  The 3D was outstanding.  It was fine.  It was a little muddy.  They claim it's got better colors.  I'm not seeing that.  But it was, I thought it was a good film.  I would recommend it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So now every film is going to be coming out in 3D.  We just got word that Spider-Man 4 is going to be in 3D.  So Sarah.  Shrek, the next Shrek film is going to be in 3D.  Every film coming down the pike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dolby, Dolby people that I was talking to, spending most of the time with one of the  senior VPs, they believe that it's going to boil down on a year-to-year basis to 25 films  in 3D no more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why do they say that?  Well, I mean, I can imagine if you're Christopher Nolan sitting there thinking about doing  the next Batman film.  You want to do it in 3D, right?  Yeah.  I mean, or if you're Sam Baby.  Yeah, the tent pole movies probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think I don't see Woody Allen doing a 3D movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, Robert Carlyle was in both the Full Money and Trainspotting.  Speaking of tent poles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Finally.  The facts come out.  Yes.  Thanks to the chat room.  So the text story I was going to mention, a lot of heat on Ubisoft when they announced  that they were going to require that you authenticate before you play their games online.  In other words, you couldn't play Assassin's Creed 2 even if you were playing the single  player unless you were connected to the internet so that their DRM could authenticate this.  And they really pissed a lot of people off.  Silent Hunter 5, same thing.  So what happens today?  Ubisoft's DRM servers go down and you cannot play the game.  The cloud strikes again.  You cannot play the game.  So if you're trying...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do they expect from people that don't have internet access?  They can't play?  They can't play.  Even though there's one single player mode?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this is something that you always try to hit home on, Leo, which is the DRM hurts  the person who buys it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It hurts the honest user.  I want to point out that the Ubisoft DRM was cracked within 24 hours of its release.  So the pirates, they're playing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're fine.  They're fine.  The pirates are the only ones having a good time right now.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They'll be able to screw it up.  Yeah, but those of you who bought Assassin's Creed 2 for the PC, I guess you won't be playing  that game today.  Not your internet access, their internet access down.  That sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now what's this DRM for the iBook store?  I thought Apple had abandoned that but now what is it there's going to be DRM with the  iBooks that you purchased through the iBook store?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're using EPUB, which is kind of open and not DRM, but they're using a DRM version  of EPUB.  But the publishers make them do that, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't you think?  Yeah, but I don't know.  If you buy an EPUB book, can you buy an EPUB book from a publisher on SOTY eReader and  have it be DRM?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, Sony stuff's DRM.  I think so.  Kindle certainly is.  Kindle certainly is, but...  I think the publishers demand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the same thing with audiobooks too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Audible is DRM'd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm telling you, look at this product coming out of India called the Adam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A-D-A-M?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's a what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a pad?  It's an iPad killer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I hate to use that term since the iPad's probably dead anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think it's...  Oh, I disagree.  I think that's going to be huge.  So this is from Notion Inc. and it will have flash, it will have 1080p, it will have twice  the battery life, and it will run Android.  And by the way, yes, there's a camera on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's 350.  Okay, that's great that it'll run Android, but the problem again with these devices is  they run a version of the operating system that's not optimized for the device that they're  on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know, you have the iPad that comes out with a version of OS X that looks beautiful  on this device optimized for that device instead of having to scale.  I mean, this is a problem that Microsoft had with Windows Mobile.  But you know, they stick a version of it on there that doesn't really work for the device  that it's on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree with you.  I agree with you 100%.  I mean, the hard idea of a start button on a phone was just ludicrous.  And Apple has designed this really for a small device.  It worked on the iPhone.  I think it's...  I think it's going to be a hit, but that's, you know, we'll have that...  We can have a bet, John.  I'll have a little bet.  What would you like to bet?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I already have a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll think about it.  I already have a...  A bottle of wine.  A bottle of wine.  A bottle of wine.  A bottle of wine.  From Leoville.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  From Costco.  Costco, Leoville.  Leoville is a very good Bordeaux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's three of them actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And which one do you want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if I have a choice, the Leoville Lascasse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lascasse.  And what are you going to give me?  And what is the criteria?  I'm going to say they will sell a million iPads in the first year.  How about that?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's kind of low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that kind of a low ball?  That's kind of low.  That's kind of low.  That's kind of a low ball.  Five million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  Five million.  I'm in.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And what are you giving them?  Can I show them as well?  Yeah.  You don't believe that either?  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no.  I believe they're going to sell five million.  Easy.  Absolutely.  We'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And what do I get if they do?  I get you the bottle of fantastic wine.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  1999 at Costco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've had that wine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, those wines are good.  I know.  They're fantastic.  But I want to give you something better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're fantastic.  All right.  One more check to see how our queen for a day, Lisa Tickled Pink, is doing.  And remember, you've got to follow her.  You've got to follow Lisa Tickled Pink.  And I will pick from one of those followers.  They will win an iPad.  And to compensate her for what will be undoubtedly a day of horror tomorrow, we will give Lisa  an iPad.  Drum roll, please.  Lisa Tickled Pink is now up to 2,467 followers that she's never heard of, has no idea.  She's on 88 lists all of a sudden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You just hit the front page of Digg, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And she's now on the front page of Digg.  Thank you, Kevin.  She's famous.  Thank you, Kevin Rose.  You did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This story had like 250 digs in no time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  It's really shameful when we use our power in this.  The power.  The power.  Kevin Rose is the man at dig.com, of course, the host of Digg Nation.  I'm really excited.  I'm going to be in Austin.  Can I come see you?  No way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you serious?  Yes.  Oh, dude, we'll get you.  Come out on stage and say hi to everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will.  I'll say hi.  I'm going to be there covering South by Southwest.  We arrive Thursday.  We'll cover Thursday night, Friday night, Saturday night, which is the big Digg Nation  party.  It's Stubbs.  Where is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  You should come out and do a story with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will.  Come out and have a beer with us and do a story.  It's a deal.  I have my camera on a stick and I got one of those live streamers.  It's a 20-pound backpack.  I've got a light, a camera, and a microphone, and I'm just going to wander like Gandalf  with my stick.  In fact, I even have a hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is the camera on the staff itself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  It's starting to sound like Scoble.  It was Scoble's idea.  How did you know?  I saw you at CES with that thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You had a sherpa carrying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This time it's all me.  We wanted to see...  Colleen said we spent a lot of money because we flew, I think, eight people down to CES,  put them up, and it was very expensive.  She said, you really could just do this by yourself.  We're going to try that.  I'm going to South by Southwest by myself.  I think five or six hours of battery life.  So I will turn it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I see your net?  Please don't tell me AT&T 3G or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, the live streamer does them all.  So it has eight 3G cards, two for each of AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, and Verizon.  And then it load balances across them depending on who's got the bandwidth.  We believe it will give us, no matter how bad the circumstances are, enough.  We only need three or four hundred kilobits to stream a decent picture out of there.  So what I was thinking of doing, you're of course, you're going to do a live stream of  the Dignation, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, we don't do live streams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, I won't be doing a high quality live stream, but I'll show you what it's like  to be in the audience.  Sounds cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Come on stage.  I will.  I will deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, you dig yourself that hole.  I've been doing this one podcast, Grizzly Bear Egg Cafe, with my best friend, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, can I bring my staff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you ever done that before?  No, what is it?  You can jump out into the crowd and the crowd supports you with their hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, but I have to have my staff with me.  I'll wear my Google slanket.  That's going to be funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you yell out Frodo in the middle of DIG Nation.  That'll be me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
