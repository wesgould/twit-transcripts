Transcript:  This is Twig This Week in Tech.  Episode 130 for February 4th, 2008.  Micro who?  This Week in Tech is brought to you by Audible.com.  For your free audiobook, visit Audible.com slash Twig.  And by listeners like you.  Thanks for your donations.  This is Twig.  Ladies and gentlemen, we're actually recording this a little bit early.  I realized our normal record time Sunday afternoon was not going to be ideal this week.  I guess there's, I don't know, a football game going on or something like that.  So we're taping a little early with a different kind of crew because Dvorak's on in transit.  Patrick Norton's at the, believe it or not, this is not a joke, at the farmer's market.  But good news, I can't imagine a better couple of people to talk about the hot news today.  Jason Kalakannis of Mahalo.  Hey Jason.  Hey, thanks for having me.  Oh, great to have you.  And of course, Robert Scoble, fresh from Davos.  It's a great honor to be here.  Yeah, honor.  And Fast Company, congratulations on the new gig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, thank you.  Fun first couple of weeks so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No kidding.  So Jason, you're pretty happy about your Giants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm pretty happy about the Giants.  I think we got a good chance tomorrow of competing.  I mean, that last game of the season, we led the game for a couple of quarters.  So it's going to be a great game.  And if they win, I mean, you got to hand it to them for the perfect season.  So I'm hopeful.  I think the Giants are going to put up a good fight and have a chance of winning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a little scary to go up against somebody who's never lost a game and beat you already  in the regular season.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, except that we competed and you know, that's true.  It was a good game.  The term any given Sunday exists for a reason.  Somebody gets hurt, a fumble, a missed field goal.  I mean, that's the great thing about sports is anything can happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I should mention that this will air, this will go out shortly after the game.  So anything you say, everybody's already knowing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, they're going to seem like a total genius or an idiot, right?  They're going to get crushed 50 to nothing.  We look like an idiot.  I think they're going to be competitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Robert, who are you rooting for?  I don't know.  Who cares?  I'm a New Englander, so I got to root for the Pats.  I'm going with the winners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whoever won, I'm going for them.  Robert picked the winners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, you know, I know Jason and I kind of knew that there was a little mobility in Scobel's  future.  In fact, Jason talked a little bit about on Twitter and said, you know, basically you  could write your ticket anywhere you go.  You'd be bringing in, you know, a significant audience too.  How did it come out that it was Fast Company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I got a long process.  I talked to, I don't know, about 10 different companies and people, including Jason.  Jason really, he's a hard negotiator.  I'll give you 10 bucks.  No, no, no, no, no.  He offered me like more than 10 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Robert's a unique talent and I have a great way of negotiating with him.  I just CC his wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mary Ann says, take the job, take the job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like, you know that Jason, he's a smart fellow.  Consider it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good, that's, I have to remember that, Jason.  You need to negotiate with married guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the other thing I do is I always just tell people like, at the very least, let me  hear out what I have to offer because then you can at least bring it back to the perfect  job if there's something better for you and tell them to pay you more because Calacanis  is willing to overpay.  There you go.  And everybody knows I always do overpay for talent.  You're famous for that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I know, and you know, I tell you, scored big with Veronica Mahalo daily is incredible.  It is, you know, clearly there's a lot of writers behind the scenes too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have five people, including Veronica, working on the show.  So it's a pretty significant staff, but you know, they're 30, 40,000 views per show in  three months.  You know, and I gave them the goal of hitting a hundred thousand views per show by the end  of year one.  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Her show is actually entertaining.  Isn't it?  I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not sure mine's going to be that entertaining.  Well, you have a different thing going on.  It's all about, first of all, it's all about the fact that you're doing it with a cell  phone.  The funniest thing, and Merlin Mann was giving you a hard time.  The funniest thing is you're using, and you did it to me at Macworld right before you  went to Davos.  Yeah.  And it surprised me.  You hold up a Nokia N95 and you say, and by the way, we're streaming live on the internet  right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep.  And there's usually a bunch of people watching, which makes it a lot of fun.  Oh, cool.  Yeah, the audio is a lot better, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but you also get the stunned looks, especially at Davos.  People go, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  There were a few of those looks from people who didn't realize you could broadcast video  off of a cell phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't know.  You surprised me.  Yeah.  Did they feel like they were being ambushed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Generally not there because I was pretty careful about making sure that I could film them.  People like that, you got to be careful.  I had a few people who didn't realize when I was up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that how you're going to do it or are you going to go back to the old big camera?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm doing two shows.  One will be with the cell phone and interactivity.  Because the neat thing about the cell phone isn't really that you're broadcasting live,  although that's pretty cool, but that the audience can participate in the interview  while it's going on.  And that makes the interview a lot more fun and a lot better, to tell you the truth.  I interviewed some brain researchers in Davos and I really don't know the questions to ask  a brain researcher, but people were posting links to Wix.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're watching these things on the phone while you're taping?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Yeah.  That's bizarre.  If you watch a quick video, when you comment, the comment goes to the phone while you're  filming.  And that's what's really killer because it makes the interviewer smarter because of the  audience that's watching.  It's sort of like the power of crowds.  Interesting.  You only really get it if you try to do it yourself.  But once you start doing interviews with an audience watching live and you're interacting  with that audience, then you realize, wow, you're getting better questions because of  that.  I was asking questions off my cell phone from people around the world and interacting.  Plus, when I interviewed Yossi Vardi, Jeff Pover was on the phone and was asking questions.  It just brings a lot more into the conversation than just one person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What you didn't mention was when you start broadcasting, it sends a tweet to your Twitter  saying I am broadcasting live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's different now.  I have to hit 55 on my phone, but as soon as I hit 55 on my phone, it sends a message  to Twitter saying, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, so you can pick when you do when you don't?  Yeah.  It was kind of spamming Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was filming an Obama lunch and I didn't send a tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was kind of spamming Twitter for a while.  I was like, Oh, come on.  Every five minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  The other problem, the reason that was happening a lot was if the wifi went away and my connection  got dropped, then I'd have to restart it and it would send another Twitter.  I filmed the concert on Saturday night and my wifi went away four times.  It sent four Twitters for the first day.  That really pissed people off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Had the same thing at the DLD conference when I was doing it.  It really is like William Gibson had mentioned in one of his books, this like kid, a thing  called little God's little machine.  And it was like a, I remember correctly, like a little zeppelin that flew about 10 feet  over your head with a, and it was like GPS coded to you.  So like if you were walking down the street, there might be people with these little, you  know, zeppelin floating above their heads with cameras, life casting them and recording  their entire life, putting it on a, you know, shared server on the web so that at any point  you could pull up any moment in a person's life.  Yeah.  This is, it's, and it's different than just in TV because that requires a whole rig and,  you know, this is just like, oh, I met somebody interesting.  I'll turn it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's amazing.  You could do with an N95.  It's mostly Nokia phones.  This is qik.com is a site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And there'll be several competitors within a couple of months.  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Within a month.  I think Seismic is going to be doing it any day now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the quick already sends video from quick over to Seismic, which is really interesting.  So everybody who follows me on Seismic gets the video as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got, by the way, I should mention like two top Twitterers of all.  Robert's number two.  He's the, he's the number one human with 6,866 followers.  Jason's number seven with 6,528.  So they just, damn Jason's catch it up.  Hey, I'm never, never going to catch up to you.  Oh, you're close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're close.  You're only a few off.  If I wasn't spamming my readership, I would be staying ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What the hell's that sound?  Who's got the, is that you, Robert?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is that?  That's me.  Sounds like television in the background.  Oh, it's quick.  Oh, it's quick.  I opened the quick website.  Yeah, it auto launches.  Very weird.  That's not good.  I'll tell you something, you know, like we were talking about on that other show, the  value of someone like Robert Scoble to a company.  That's right.  Robert Scoble owns his audience.  You know, like, no offense to PodTech, but if he had previously been working at CNET  or like when you guys worked at Tech TV, right, you guys all had to scramble and restart  your enterprise, right?  And now what's happened is Robert seamlessly brought his audience over to Fast Company.  So when he negotiated his deal with Fast Company, as I was saying, you know, each of those people's  worth a dollar, I think, you know, per year.  So he's got whatever, or maybe two or three, 7,000 people on Twitter, 5,000 people on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  Microsoft just paid what, a few, more than a thousand dollars.  Well, let's get to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the reason you two are on.  I couldn't think of anybody better to get on.  I mean, you guys, this is a fascinating story and controversial.  Microsoft, essentially a hostile takeover bid $44.6 million in cash and stock for...  Billion.  Billion.  Billion.  With a B.  Yes.  For Yahoo.  Now, of course, rumors have been flying for the last two years that Microsoft might take  a stake in Yahoo, but this is an out and out attempt to buy the whole kit and caboodle.  You're sitting on the sidelines.  You probably know better than anybody what's going on right now.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the piece of this that's the most important is the advertising.  And so if you look at the advertising space, search marketing, direct search inventory  is the greatest advertising inventory on the planet right now.  It's the most profitable and the most desirable.  And we may have talked about this before, but the reason is pretty simple.  If you're typing, you know, Nokia N95, people listening to the show are typing that into  Google right now.  We know they're interested in the Nokia N95.  That inventory is actually better than Engadget's inventories in some way, because if you're  reading Engadget, you might be interested in the Nokia N95, but you might not be in  the mode to buy it right at that point.  And then, you know, after that comes things like social networking advertising, which  would be like, we know that you own a Nokia phone or your friends own it, and maybe we're  going to try to target it to you.  That's worth even less.  So advertisers are flooding to that.  Yahoo has a big chunk of that, right, like 20% of that, and Microsoft's got 10% of it  or whatever.  So now they can actually have this very big overture slash Microsoft Ad Center base of  advertisers.  So why is that important?  Well, it's very affordable.  It's a very good business and it's a very profitable business.  But Microsoft is going through a sea change right now.  No kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, they were a software company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they still will be.  The difference is how does that software make money?  And for 30 years, they sold it for $99 with their computer or $300 for Office or, you  know, $5,000 for a server.  Now what they're faced with is, OK, 90% of people are going to use a free version of  Office, you know, five, 10 years out.  And it will reach the corporations at some point and the cost is going to go down.  So they need to have some sort of advertising monetization engine to have their company  shift from being subscription based, i.e. paying every year or two, advertising based.  And so that's really what they're buying.  And that's the core of the thing.  I mean, there's other reasons as well.  If you look at what the main businesses that have been established on the Internet for  gaining traffic are, email, instant message and search, right?  So you have Microsoft and Yahoo are, I think, you know, the number one and three player  in email.  One and two in, I think they're one and two in email, one and three in instant messaging.  So now consolidated, they're by far and away the number one instant message platform and  the number one email platform.  But how do you merge those two communities?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you keep them both alive as?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's actually very simple.  It's a great question, but it's, you know, when I had my time at AOL, they consolidated,  you know, CompuServe email, AOL email, Netscape email, all these different email platforms.  So what you do is you let people keep their email address.  Then when you have whatever's next in the upgrade cycle, you know, when Yahoo went from  Yahoo mail to the Ajax version to compete with Gmail, which was, I guess, based on Outcast  or Out.  Yeah, what was it?  Whatever that was.  Yeah, yeah.  They bought for $30 million.  Outpost.  Outpost, right.  So whenever they make that next switch, then you just move those users over and they keep  their email box and it's pretty seamless.  So then what you look at is, and that doesn't have to occur year one, that can take two  or three years.  And if you look at Flickr, Flickr's only grown, right?  And now you log in with your Flickr, with your Yahoo ID to Flickr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As a Flickr user, I don't, I'm nervous about Flickr.  Let me ask you, Robert, before we start talking about individual properties, is this a smart  move for Microsoft?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it gets Microsoft back in the web and makes them a lot more interesting, which they've,  you know, they've really not done anything in the web.  Well, they've tried.  They're live services.  I mean, they've tried.  They've tried, but they've failed.  MSN.  This gets them back in the web game in a big way.  You know, I remember being in a meeting and Microsoft, where Kevin Johnson came out to  our group and he said exactly what Jason just said, which was the advertising market is  10 to 20 times bigger than the software market, you know, the selling of software market is.  And so he saw that Microsoft was going to make all its future growth, at least, off  of advertising.  You know, this is a huge play to get them back into the online advertising world, mostly  with a search, you know, having a decent search engine with millions of users is a big deal.  You add that into what they were trying to do with live and it gets them back into search  in a big way, which they just were completely out of the game line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I asked Jerry Pornell, he was going to join us.  He's not feeling well as under the weather, but I asked him what he thought he said, and  I kind of agree with his, Microsoft should stick to its knitting, make a better version  of Windows.  They got problems with Vista.  What do they see change?  Jason, they're they're getting into a new business entirely.  And I have to say, it doesn't look good when you're when you've got Vista, which is a complete  flop.  If I'm a Microsoft stockholder, I'm not sure I'm happy about this.  I mean, I mean, it's a different company now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I guess the thinking is if you failing at one of your two core competencies, should  you take on a third?  Right.  It's a valid argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So especially since neither Microsoft nor Yahoo is the leader in search.  I mean, everything Microsoft's done in the last two years looks like they're chasing.  They're trying to play catch up with Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  But you know what the other thing is, is, you know, Yahoo, Microsoft, Yahoo and Microsoft  are the leaders and AOL ahead of Google in email and it's the messaging and some other  things.  And they're bigger than Google combined.  They are.  No, no, individually.  I mean, Gmail Gmail's got no users.  Nothing compared to Hotmail.  I had no idea.  Yahoo mail and yeah, because well, those things take a long time to get people to switch off  of them.  The switching cost is high.  Instant messaging and email, high switching costs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So yeah, Google's not a player in IM at all.  No.  AOL is the dominant IM player, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you know, people have to, it's very easy to look at Google and get intimidated  because of the growth, but you have to remember they're really only number one in two businesses.  The advertising network that they have in search advertising and search itself, everything  else, they're not even a player.  And so, you know, if you can compete with them on the two things they are, you don't  have to beat them necessarily.  You just have to be competitive and you're in the game.  You know, it's sort of like you don't have to have perfect special teams or perfect defense  if you have, you know, these other things.  It's okay to be number two.  It could be fine for Microsoft, being number two, it could be just fine for Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And keep in mind when you say failure on Vista, how many tens of millions of copies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They sold a hundred million copies of Vista, but this is why I consider it a failure.  They sold 250 million PCs that year.  So 150 million people are buying XP or more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but it was like I met Michael Dell at Dallas and I met the CEO of Lenovo and both  of them said, come on, be realistic.  Well, that's the point is that people aren't.  Even if Apple doubles or triples its market share, which it did in the last 18 months,  it's still a very small player in terms of the number of machines sold.  So you're going to buy Vista, whether it's a failure or not.  And that's why, how Microsoft looks at it internally.  You're going to buy, you know, they're going to sell a hundred million copies of Vista  in a year.  And so where are they going to get any close?  That's depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's Microsoft saying, it's OK.  It sucks.  Big deal.  We're going to get the business anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it is depressing.  Well, you have to define what a failure is.  So, I mean, we're saying Vista is a failure.  It's maybe not as huge a success as it should be.  Maybe it's not as good as OS X.  Obviously it's not.  But they have time to fix it.  Microsoft always puts out, you know, schlocky stuff and then all of a sudden, you know,  it gets better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it's not like the first version of Windows they've done, Jason.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  Well, listen, I'm not saying it's forgivable.  I mean, it is kind of shocking, but you know what?  I have to say a big part of it.  I always believe that the leadership from the top is a big determinant in the success  of companies and specifically products.  And I don't think that Vista being a failure on a technological basis, on a reviewer basis  is because it was launched during the transition of Bill leaving.  And now if, you know, some of these new people, you know, take over and have 100% ownership  of it, I think you may see, and that's not a fault of Gates, it's just the way it is.  You know, it's hard to stay focused like that, I guess, on the way out the door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're buying stock, do you buy stock in Microsoft now or do you worry that Microsoft  is a new business?  And let's wait and see.  I mean, it sounds like it's a new business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think over the next two or three years, Google far outruns the Microsoft Yahoo group.  Microsoft and Yahoo getting together are going to have a lot of trouble integrating.  And it's going to be a year before, first of all, they're going to have to get this  deal approved by the governmental agencies, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not just the US, the EU, which is hostile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let's say they do get it passed because neither Microsoft nor Yahoo have a monopoly  in search.  It's still going to be, you know, six months before that happens.  And then it's going to be another six months before these groups really get together in  jail.  I remember when I got a job at Microsoft, it took me six months just to figure out,  you know, how to work with people and which people were important to work with and how  to, you know, what I should be doing there.  And then all of a sudden my career started taking off.  It's going to be a year before these groups get together and really understand each other  and before the executives can really figure out which, like, you know, Hotmail has what,  250 million people on email and Yahoo mail has 300 million active users.  Which team wins out of that?  And which engineer goes where?  And man, that's a lot of work to figure those things out.  And then there's going to be culture clashes and political fights and, you know, Yahoo's  down here in Silicon Valley and Microsoft has a real strong headquarters culture.  So if you're not up in the headquarters, you're going to feel left out eventually and you're  going to get pissed or you're going to have to move up to Redmond to figure it out or  you're going to have to travel a lot up there.  There's going to be, you know, a year to 18 month period for these companies really to  figure out each other and work together to really get something going.  And in the meantime, Google's going to just keep running.  And the real growth market right now is mobile and Google is firing on at least seven of  its eight cylinders on mobile and you're going to start...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Except they haven't made a penny from it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm looking at the growth and the stock market cares about growth.  They don't care about what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think it's safe to say Google will make money on local.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, in fact, from what I'm hearing inside Google, the growth on mobile is just  astounding. It's outpacing all of their expectations.  So I remember when Microsoft used to talk like that, that kind of talk turned into  quarterly profits within one or two quarters.  And I expect Google is going to be the one to own out of this thing.  Certainly the market agrees with me.  Microsoft went down 10 percent or 5 percent yesterday, something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we're making one assumption, which is that the Yahoo board will accept the offer.  Jason, do you think it's a given?  I mean, it's a 62 percent premium over Yahoo's stock price closing price on Thursday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, a deal is going to get done.  The question is at what price, right?  Because it may have to increase the offer and with who?  It's not Microsoft put in a very aggressive offer.  And, you know, again, going back to like the principles in these companies and, you  know, the hedge fund, the, you know, the investors who own a lot of money in it,  et cetera, they're going to like the idea of making 50, 60 percent of the money  overnight. And they're going to want to bank that because it might take Yahoo a  couple of years to actually get that kind of growth.  Right. If ever Yahoo is not exactly at a downside risk.  And it's huge. Exactly. It's huge downside risk.  So you could lose money.  So people are going to want to take the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a very rich deal. Now, how about a white knight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Could we see some? Yeah, that's the thing is, I think that there's what could  happen here. There's two or three scenarios.  There are other players like News Corp and hedge funds who could try to make a run

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  at it. It's really it's pretty that's a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's big. Yeah. I mean, News Corp could pull it off and they could certainly pull  it off with another partner.  And the the thing that will be interesting, though, is what Google might do.  And nobody's really talked about this yet.  But Google and Yahoo have talked about in the past, you know, giving Yahoo's search  advertising business over to Google.  So what if Google bought Yahoo's search business for ten billion dollars, which is  the increase in what we see in the Microsoft deal?  And Yahoo said we're going to try a bunch of other businesses, content and services,  et cetera, and we're going to give our search business over to Google.  And then so, you know, that that that would be a bigger regulatory issue,  obviously. Would the shareholders go for them?  Well, that would give you the blend of get the money, get some get some money and  get some upside in the company still there.  So but I think the Microsoft deal is going to get done.  It just feels like they're determined.  And also, I mean, Jerry Yang has been at it for what now?  Ninety four, ninety five.  He started the thing or whatever, a 12 years in.  He's tired. He might want to go.  He increases, I think, his personal stake and David Fowler's personal stake went up  a billion dollars that day.  So, you know, it makes sense for them to get out now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Weblogs Inc. joined AOL after the AOL Time Warner merger.  But did you see culture clashes, though, when you came in?  How difficult was it working with Time Warner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's things I can say and there's things I can't.  What I can say is I was outside of the main organization,  but there was definitely a dynamic there that's been pretty well documented in a lot  of different publications. And there always is a dynamic like that.  However, I think people like Robert, who are in the thick of it,  like Robert is actually when he was at Microsoft, correct me if I'm wrong,  was actually doing work.  And so he would be like, oh, my God, it's a lot of work.  Yeah. But to guys like me, not that I'm like CEO of Microsoft, Yahoo!  But guys who were in the CEO slot are looking at it going,  yeah, it's a lot of work, but I don't actually have to do that work.  You got people. You got people to do that. Exactly.  And all it is is like you sit in a meeting because I've done this.  You sit in a meeting and you say, OK, give me the three proposals of how we're  going to consolidate Hotmail and Yahoo! Mail. OK.  This one seems like it makes the most sense.  Mail seems easy. What happens to Flickr?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, Yahoo!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, Yahoo!  The great thing for Yahoo!  I think in the last couple of years is they learned how to buy things  and not destroy them. Right.  Delicious. Delicious and Flickr are good examples.  Good examples.  And they in Weblogs think would be a good example at AOL.  And there's other examples, MySpace, at News Corp.  A lot of these big companies realize, you know what, our managers are going to  screw these things up, let them run themselves.  But then, you know, the founders go away and that's what's going to happen here  at Yahoo! And they take a lot of brain with them and momentum.  So. But then again, you know, Yahoo! had an inability.  I think Yahoo! just had to get in their ass kicked by Google every day.  And then they have an identity crisis.  You know, are they a content company, a services company, a search?  Are they doing display advertising, search advertising?  Just they felt like they were all over the place.  And you can really only be great at one, maybe two things, you know, as a company.  And Microsoft and Google, perfect examples of that.  eBay, perfect example of that.  eBay is good at two things, auctions and PayPal.  That's it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In terms of Flickr, the places where it would go off the rails is if they  if Microsoft forced the team to translate from Linux over to Windows,  which they did with Hotmail and it caused Hotmail a lot of trouble.  I don't think the culture is there anymore to have that kind of strategy tax.  But you never know, you know, somebody gets it up there.  But Yahoo! has a number of things to go to Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yahoo! has a number of small but important open source projects  like the Yahoo! user interface system, which they've been giving away.  And yeah, I mean, a lot of people use it and things like that.  I kind of think if they go to Microsoft, Microsoft's going to say,  what is this little?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the place I'm more worried is I'm sure there's going to be pressure  to monetize Flickr, and I'm not sure there's a good way to monetize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Flickr is a big money loser from what I hear for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It absolutely is.  It's a crown jewel in terms of a brand, but it hasn't made money.  How do you make how do you put ads into a photo  screen without pissing off your users?  And that's going to be a tough, tough thing for Flickr to do.  Actually, one of the bright spots about Microsoft is in their research team,  they have some really great people doing photographic research.  And both in China and in the labs, there's some amazing stuff.  They have amazing stuff with photography.  You know, the photos, I gave a demo, the demo of the year in 2006.  It was the best demo I'd ever seen.  But, you know, how do you turn that research into products  that people can use and get excited about?  And Flickr certainly has that brand, that kind of cache  you know, with the community that we're really scared  that Microsoft would come in and screw it up. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, there's another couple of other deals that went on  that we probably should mention, Etsy, which is a site  that does handmade goods, which I love.  I mean, it's a great site. It's a craft site.  It's raised $27 million, which is kind of a stunning amount of money.  I don't know if crafts are the next big thing, but boy, somebody thinks so.  Any thoughts, either of you?  You ever use Etsy? You know, your wives use Etsy. Trust me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't. You know, it is and it isn't a lot of money, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the deal of the century.  Amazon buys Audible for $300 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, now Audible, that's a good company.  There's a good company.  I should never tell you how much I use Audible.  Audible, are they sponsors of the show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're still sponsors.  You know, the funniest thing is, oh, yeah, the day before the deal goes through,  I get an email from Audible's agency saying how much they love us.  They're going to stay on through all 2008 and all the shows.  The next day I read the headlines and it's like, OK, well,  we'll see what happens now.  But until that deal goes through, which is at least Q2.  Yes, Audible is still a sponsor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that makes sense.  That's a good synergy.  I think that's a great synergy, actually.  Yeah, it makes a lot of sense when you see the Kindle and...  Kindle already plays Audible audio.  Yeah, but it makes sense when you start thinking about their strategy there  and look at their move, you know, away from, well, into the electronic book world.  And I'm sure that Kindle is not the last device we're going to see from Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it makes a lot of sense.  I mean, why not have both or all three, the print version,  the electronic text version and the audio version of every book published?  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And subscription based services to underwrite the cost of the Kindle, which is high.  You know, they I think Audible had a subscription program.  They still do. Yeah, they still do.  Right. You can subscribe and get like you take out one book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a monthly thing and you get credits, a certain number of credits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And yeah, that's a highly profitable business for them, I'm sure.  And there was actually this audio book.  I'm trying to remember the name of it.  There was a Netflix of audio books and I was subscribed to it for a year  and I really enjoyed it  because, you know, you just get to keep rotating and that stuff.  You know, those kind of services, it seems to me like  with the cracking down on with the combination of cracking down on people  stealing stuff on Bittorrent, etc., combined with a reasonable price  and the wireless devices,  you're going to have this great resurgence, I think,  of people subscribing to this kind of content, which they have.  I mean, everybody subscribes to their cable television,  but nobody subscribes to music. Right. Right.  But all these people I know are getting Sonos.  And the reason they're getting Sonos is not just the Sonos.  That's half of it. It's Rhapsody. Right. Right.  That comes with it. So like they're like, look, I can play any song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want any song. Yeah. You just keep paying that monthly fee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. It's genius.  And so, I mean, that's what I'm waiting for with iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And, you know, why do you think that people prefer iTunes, prefer to buy  than the subscription services like Rhapsody?  It's a habit.  They're just used to the idea of owning music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People used to go to Blockbuster and not pay for HBO. Right.  And then this took people a while. Right.  I make a lot of people renting VHS tapes.  I mean, that was a weird thing in the 80s.  It was like there was a whole culture around going to the video store.  You remember, like in strategizing, right?  Like when you went, you want to go on Thursday, you want to go at three.  Like when do people return the latest releases?  People will be waiting at the desk.  You know, what came back? What came back?  You know, oh, three movies just came back.  Which ones were they? You know, you sort of wait in the queue there.  You know, it's interesting that whole culture is gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you subscribe, Jason, to music or do you buy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I buy music on iTunes and I buy a lot on Amazon now,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  actually, because of the lack of DRM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got to start doing that because I hate this.  I'm just like, I have to like every I'm constantly losing my music  because I replace my laptop literally every six, 12 months.  Like I just got the air, the Jesus book, by the way.  Did you get it? I got it.  I've had it for like three days.  This thing is unbelievable.  Anybody who thinks it has any downside is absolutely kidding themselves.  There is zero downside to this device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Zero. What makes it so cool besides the size?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was sitting on my couch watching the Nick game,  and I usually sit there with either my black MacBook, right?  Or I have a little Sony tiny one.  The Sony tiny one, the screen is too tiny.  The keys are too tiny.  And I can't really put out a thousand more blog posts without my hands hurting.  The bigger one is heavy and hot and, you know,  you know, it's just huge.  That MacBook, the black one, this thing has the lightness of the Sony  VIO tiny ones combined with the Mac OS.  It's a beautiful screen.  Full, beautiful screen.  The LED backlight is gorgeous.  That feels like you're on a 24 inch monitor or something.  And it's so light that when you put it in your bag,  you'll pick up your bag and say, oh, I forgot my laptop.  Open your bag up and it will be in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just don't sit on your bag because the thing will snap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It feels I don't know. It feels kind of sturdy, actually.  When you close it, it feels like it's like a it feels like a  just a piece of metal, like one piece of metal.  And the price is going to come down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And, you know, the hard drive is my only thing.  80 gigs. Oh, man.  It doesn't. You know what?  You don't put all your music on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't put all your photos on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know. I know.  I'm getting trained by Steve Jobs to accept smaller, smaller spaces for all my stuff.  It's funny because I just bought a MacBook with 250 gigs because I wanted all that space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want the space.  Now, Jason, did you must have now come on.  You're you're comfortably off.  Did you buy the solid state?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, well, embarrassed enough to say I bought three of them.  The regular and one of the solid state.  So tell us about the solid state.  Solid state's not in yet. The solid state is going to.  I I told my assistant to watch the keynote and whatever,  you know, they put out to buy me three of them, whatever the three different versions were.  Because I said I'll give one to somebody on my staff.  We're having a contest at the office for one of them.  They were calling the Serpathon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could have had this job, Robert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I could have.  He might still. You never know.  Things might not work out fast.  I just like, you know, for my friends, I just like pumping up their deals with other people.  I used to do this with Gina from Lifehacker all the time.  Yeah, she did.  I was trying to hire her for Weblogs Inc.  And I said, Gina, you know, I know that you're really comfortable  and you're good friends with Nick.  Will you at least let me sit down and explain to you the value proposition?  Right. So she's OK.  You know, no harm in that.  So, you know, see her and say, OK, I'll give you this amount of equity in the brand,  this amount of cash, you know, in this this kind of budget and, you know, whatever.  And she's like, wow, that's a much better deal than I have with Nick.  And I was like, well, let me give this to you in writing here.  And you can wave it.  Wave that you can email to him.  And every like nine months, six, nine months, I say, hey, how you doing?  I wanted to make you an offer.  I'd like to increase the offer 10 percent.  And I knew she wouldn't take it.  But I was like, this is just great.  I must be making Nick Denton's life miserable.  So I just kept and I did that with two or three of their different employees.  And you just ruined it, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Next time you do that, could you email me the deal too?  And I'll add another 10 percent on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Me too, because this guy at Twit's not paying me.  Oh, never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do want to hire Gina.  She's awesome.  She's great. She really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But anyway, the solid state one I'm going to get next week.  And I'll definitely let you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm intrigued on that one.  And I don't know anybody who's willing to spend that kind of three grand on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're doing video editing, that's not the this is not the machine for you.  No, obviously. Yeah.  If you're surfing the web and doing word processing in Excel,  it's the same as any other machine.  How's the battery life?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because that's the one one area that I can't swap out.  The battery. Yeah, I carry two or three batteries.  I'm flying it with Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Solve that. He carries two or three MacBook Airs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I sit in business class where they have a plug.  Oh, yeah.  Back in the day, you know what?  It's funny that you mentioned that.  It's light enough.  And see, this is the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a machine that the executives are going to love.  But the normal people are like, I don't know.  80 gig drive, non replaceable battery.  I don't know. I think it's a total BS class issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why they won't put plugs in regular seats.  They can obviously put them everywhere on the plane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they got to give you something for your five thousand dollar airfare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what? Listen, three years ago, I used to carry four batteries  and me just like Scobel because I was broke.  And I used to have I used to buy, you know, targets would sell  these like six or seven pound bricks that would go underneath your laptop  and you have plug it into your laptop.  So your laptop would think it's plugged in. Right.  I saw a few of those lying around. Yeah.  I still have them around here.  I paid 100 bucks for them because I would be just like Robert  going to Switzerland or something like that, going to Germany.  And I can't be offline for the ride.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you don't care about but you don't care about battery life on the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I don't anymore.  But and I bring a little power strip on the airplane  and I plug in six devices while I'm on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about DVDs? You can't watch a movie on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I always.  I know you fly Virgin Atlantic and they've got three hundred different movies.  And I have a friend who rips movies off the DVD with his laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a friend named Mr.  Bit Torrent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a friend, his name is Kason Jelikanis.  He rips his DVDs with his laptop and watches them that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't really need a spindle, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the thing weighs a couple of ounces, the external one.  So it's like, what's the big deal with that anyway?  And it's not it doesn't need external power, right?  Power is a several things.  So, you know, again, I just think there are  unless you're doing video editing or something intense like that,  there is no reason that you shouldn't get this.  Except if you don't agree with the price and nobody agree with the six  hundred dollar price for an iPhone and a lot of people seem to like it at four  hundred. People don't agree with this at seventeen hundred.  I think they're going to love it at thirteen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Looks like Apple might actually, I would say, drop the price of the iPhone.  Sales aren't going very well.  It depends on who you ask.  But of course, of course, two ninety.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is how out of whack the expectations on Apple are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Apple keeps saying we're going to sell 10 million.  They better get going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they still already got 20 percent of the market share,  which is more than Microsoft got in five years.  True. After spending a billion dollars to try to get that 20 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I see you're going to see a two ninety nine or even a one ninety nine  iPhone pretty soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although one of my friends is over in a secret meeting with Nokia  this week or last week.  This is not a secret anymore.  Well, it's not a secret anymore.  But he says they have some really interesting phones coming out.  I love Nokia.  He says they're they're still struggling to get to the to the experience  of the iPhone. But in terms of hardware and stuff like that,  he said they're really, really getting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Nokia N95 versus the iPhone.  iPhone is such a more elegant device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is. And if the battery life in the N95 is ridiculous and on and on.  But you can't do quick.  You can't do quick with an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's the only reason I have it.  I bought a six hundred dollar phone just so I could do quick.  So I can take my dogs and.  So you're doing it, too.  Yeah, I started doing it.  Oh, yeah. You're still there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So can I get on quick or do you have to is it like one of those things  where you ask and then they say, OK, maybe someday or is it is it open?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's not open, but you just ask Robert Scoble  and he sees you with the CEO of the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, just email Michael at Quick.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, everybody's listening.  You know, Michael, it's fine.  Yeah, he doesn't care. He probably loves it.  Sure. Good publicity, right? Yeah.  Uh, let's see what I you know, I thought of something.  And as we were talking, I knocked it completely out of my head.  Audible.com, they continue.  Despite all odds to support this show,  God only knows why audible.com slash twit.  We love them.  Audible is a great place to get audio books so easy.  You subscribe, you get credits or you could buy as you go.  It's I'll tell you what, if you join them right now, you go to audible.com  slash tweet, you'll get a credit towards a book.  Are you either you guys listening to anything you want to share  or should I pick a book today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We can pick a book. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm always listening to audible books.  I'm going to I'm going to pick, let's say I should pick something,  some some business book that it's something about Amazon, audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And let me think, what is their book about Bezos on there or something?  Oh, I bet there is something about the story of you actually know what I listen to.  Was it eboys was a story about the eBay?  I think eboys was a story about a read business books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, do you care? Are you? Oh, yeah, I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I read a ton of them.  Did you like eboys?  Eboys, I actually listened to on audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The first inside account of venture capitalists at work by Randall E.  Strauss. Now, see, I like this.  I'm always looking for something new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The narrator on this, this guy, Eric Conger, is really good.  He's done a lot of other really good.  And let's listen, let's listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll play it. We'll play a little bit of him just so you can hear his voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You got to tell you, it's a great way to read for dollars.  Oh, yeah. I looked upon a company in Boston that was about to launch a search  and would be willing to hear a pitch from Ramsey Byrne  at a breakfast meeting the next morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that brings that brings a business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Robert Scoble was at the DLD conference.  And Robert Scoble was talking with the editor of Fast Company magazine.  He pulled out a offer from Calacanis from his bag.  Nobody's written that.  The editor of Fast Company smacked his head.  Calacanis, that bastard got me again.  OK, Scoble, you win this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The author is a business history professor at San Jose State  knows all about a contributing editor at US News and Report, Randal E.  Strauss. This sounds like I'm going to I'm going to put this on my list right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  E-boys. It really is good because it will take you back to that period of time  when like anything was possible.  And, you know, the amount of money being raised was silly.  Oh, wait, I'm sorry. Is that the time we're in now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sounds familiar.  Wait a second. Forty six billion dollars.  That sounds familiar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Forty million dollars for a company that's trinkets online. OK.  Twenty seven million for Etsy. What the heck?  Actually, I think I could see being a high margin business, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's you know, I don't know, because it's it's all handmade stuff.  It's a lot of high and high.  I think, yeah.  I mean, it's not like they're going to India to have it made.  These are individuals who do this.  They're artisans. It's cottage, cottage craft.  What's great is it kind of opens that all up.  But that's an advertisement for another day.  We're going to finish up our audible ad right now.  E-boys is the book. I think a great choice.  I just added it to my wish list.  That's one of the nice things about audible.  It's kind of like Netflix.  You add books to your list so that you always remember  what you're going to listen to next.  It's easy to find another book.  They also have, you know, all of the lists like the Oprah's Book Club  and, you know, the Booker Prize winners and all that.  So you can figure it's always a great way to browse and find a new book.  Audible dot com slash twitch is for forty five thousand plus books.  And I think they have hundreds now of devices, including the Kindle,  the iPod, the iPhone.  You can burn CDs or listen on your computer audible dot com slash to it.  We do thank them for their support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Audible, they just had their 10th anniversary.  You know, I got to tell you one other book I got off audible  that I think is a great one is called Authentic Happiness.  I haven't heard that one.  Authentic Happiness.  I was a psych major, so I'm big into psychology.  And it's a guy named Marty Seligman,  and he runs the American Psychological Association.  And he does he studies what makes people happy in this sort of new genre  called positive psychology.  Was it just like the power of positive thinking all over again?  No, no, no, no, no. This is much more sophisticated.  What it is is they look at they've done a lot of studies on when people are happiest,  what groups of people are happy and happy most and why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, no. Nicks are happy all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no, it's really interesting.  They I learned a lot from this book because they have, you know,  attribution theory.  So how you attribute what happens to you has a big way of how you  that makes sense.  Look how you're level of happiness.  So if you get pulled over by a police officer and you're like, oh, I'm an idiot.  I was speeding. Right. Right.  That kind of stuff will make you feel depressed.  But if you say, well, everybody gets a speeding ticket once in a while.  It's my turn. At least I didn't get in a car accident.  Boom. You know, and so there's like all these like little things  that you can tweak, tweak the way you think.  I hope I don't sound like Tony Robbins, but you really start to understand  why certain people get locked into that negativity.  And if you blame the world for your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, of course, it's going to suck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like Robert Scott, like, oh, I got no battery life.  My battery.  I blame the world. It's all.  It's all I use.  I keep dropping on my Nokia.  And I just don't take it personal.  It's just a device.  Actually, Robert is one of the more positive people I've ever met.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, they say the smart.  I think it's about control, a feeling of control, too.  If you feel like you're out of control, like somebody else is pulling the strings.  You're never going to be happy.  That's not true. They say.  Well, look at the three of us are all doing everything we can  to be in control of what we do. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if we actually believe that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the happiest people in the world, I saw a list once.  What do you think that the two happiest people in the world are traffic cops?  Because when they go like this, when they wave and blow the whistle,  people do what they say.  Yeah. And orchestra conductors. Same reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hmm. They feel a sense of control.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got in a car wreck where a lady came out of nowhere.  And that shifted my whole life around.  Is that true? I realized I'm not in control.  Is that true?  Might as well live life large and do your best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, is it really was that a transition transformation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A moment that was right around the time of 9-11, too.  No kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. 9-11 had that impact on me.  I totally looked at the world differently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I couldn't. Well, you were in New York.  You were just down the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was. Yeah, I was up the block.  And my brother's a firefighter.  Oh, dear. Family of firefighters in the middle of Lincoln, Savas.  A bunch of his friends died. Oh, yeah.  I was like games for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I met that last week.  I met the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, who lost 700 employees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That whole floor. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And yeah, he's a real remarkable guy.  They're given they're still given 25% of their profits to the families.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's interesting, though, if you think about,  you know, our industry and what happened with the stock market  over the last couple of weeks and people panicking and, you know,  layoffs possibly coming at Yahoo.  Our whole industry shifted over the last month from being  Uber positive, anything's possible, Facebook, 15 billion, you know.  And then all of a sudden, people start feeling bad  because the stock market's down.  Who cares?  I mean, don't people realize that's just like a bunch of people gambling  and doing arbitrage and it has nothing to do with reality, you know?  And, you know, you're there's some reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it's based on the housing starts and mortgage crisis.  And I mean, there is some reality that people are  they're getting their homes foreclosed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course. And so I feel terrible for this.  What I'm saying is for people in our industry to watch the stock market  and, you know, get really upset about it and be depressed.  It's like, well, the stock market is not the bellwether.  Exactly. And it's going to go up and it's going to go down.  But, you know, Steve Jobs came out with the iPod in the down market.  You know, right. OK. Good things.  I mean, Facebook was built in the down market.  Weblogs Inc. was built in the down market. Flickr. Delicious.  A lot of things were built in the down market.  Down market is not necessarily a bad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you bullish? I mean, do you feel you don't feel like we're headed for recession?  Are you bullish for the economy in general?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I absolutely predicted there was a recession coming a year ago.  I had I was actually probably three or four quarters off  because I moved everything I have into bonds and cash.  You got out of the market like a year ago.  Gold buried in the backyard, buddy.  But I moved it all to bonds.  I was like, this thing is going to come apart, you know.  And it was so obvious to me with the way we're spending money in Iraq  and everything. And a lot of other people felt the same way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what I did? I bought I bought aerospace and military stocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That makes sense. Energy aerospace.  But, you know, the thing is, it's  I'm generally bullish because every time there's a down market,  what happens is, is that people there's a flight to quality in the advertising  space and advertising is what drives much of what we do in our business.  And the advertising on the Internet is so much more efficient  than in other mediums.  What happens is we'll go, oh, we have to pull back.  Where are we going to pull back? Search advertising, Internet advertising?  No, that's the most efficient.  Oh, what's the least efficient?  Oh, outdoor advertising and magazines and then television and then radio.  OK, let's cut in that order.  And the last time magazines got their ass kicked.  And then outdoor advertising, then television, then radio.  And radio actually was a bargain.  People get value from radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what the biggest bargain is right now?  Frickin podcasts. Cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's pretty cheap.  I mean, one of people is like five grand a week, ten grand a week.  You can owe it a hundred thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thirty five bucks cost per thousand is what we're charging.  I think that's pretty common.  I was hoping for more.  I think that's low, but that's what we're getting now.  And that seems CPM of thirty five dollars.  That's not I'll take it. I mean, I'd like more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, so thirty five hundred dollars you could get into an ad  by four grand, four or five grand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And traffic's up on podcast, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I don't know if traffic's up.  I'll tell you.  I don't want to become the podcast about podcasts, but  there's a lot of misinformation about numbers and podcasting.  I'd say traffic is pretty flat right now.  I think in general, what's happened is there's a saturation.  People, everybody who could figure out how to use iTunes has.  How what now you're doing something completely different at Fast Company.  I don't even know if I would call what you're doing podcasts exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a mixture of blogging and podcasting and I'm sure your numbers

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  are up here because you do what you're doing.  I mean, Davos must have driven a lot of traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a fair amount.  Some of the videos got watched a thousand times.  Some of them may be five, ten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but you're doing a lot of videos so that you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did 50 videos in a week.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's so we're talking, you know, 50 to a quarter of a million.  I mean, views.  I mean, you're talking about a lot of views.  Yeah.  What was Fast Company's idea behind?  What were they thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What were they thinking?  What were they hoping?  They saw a way to get their online space expanded quickly and get a lot more  visibility there.  They spent a lot of money on a new social network that's coming out in the next.  Oh, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And you're you're from your point of view, control was key, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I, well, not really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't control anything.  Wait a minute.  You just told us you had an accident.  The woman then did you, I want control.  What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I mean, what I, what I liked about Fast Company was they have a great brand.  They have a great team that can get me into things I couldn't get into, you know,  events for instance.  I was at a Fast Company party just the other night and it was really, really neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think it's a good brand, an excellent brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And for me to do all that work, I'd have to, I'd have to beat myself up.  And I watched O'Malley have a heart attack in December.  And I just said, you know, hanging out with my new five month old is more important  than spending every waking moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That does change your perspective a lot.  Yeah.  I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'm, you know, I got an offer that's just unbelievable.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And now I have teenagers.  So I'm doing everything I can to get out of the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got to come down to Half Moon Bay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anything I can to get away from my kids, I will do.  You'll see.  You'll see.  I got a good 14 year old.  You got Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's great.  I got a teenager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Patrick was with.  Do your, your sons or daughters, I don't know what they are, but do they, do their  friends listen to the podcast?  You know, it's funny, Henry, some do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He has one friend who's a huge fan.  Henry doesn't understand it at all.  Henry's 13.  He says, why is this guy listening to your crap?  And then he has, he was at skates camp at Woodward West down in the Southland.  And one of his counselors was a huge twit fan.  And I think he got some, I think he got some, some points out of that.  But mostly my kids are like, they don't even know what I do.  They say, oh, he's in computers or something.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have no internet thing.  It's never anywhere.  Hey, you get ready.  Here's a, here's our, here's our art bell moment of the week, our conspiracy theory.  So, uh, the, the cable that crosses the Mediterranean, carrying the internet  to the middle East and Asia, there's three of them, two of them get cut.  Egypt has to kind of shut down.  They say, please don't download movies and music.  We don't have enough bandwidth.  There's a 20% cut to bandwidth to India.  Iraq is offline.  Then the third gets cut the next day.  All three cables go down.  You think a, uh, some sort of, uh, conspiracy or just coincidence?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It sounds too, uh, too kind of weird, huh?  Kind of weird.  I know.  I know.  It's dragging a lot of anchors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Our allies, two of our big allies, Dubai and Saudi Arabia also offline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Um, I think it sounds too strange.  Sabotage.  Yeah.  So what do you think, Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  I, you know, what's that thing?  A, uh, Akim's razor or whatever, you know, the most obvious thing.  Like maybe it's the most obvious thing.  Maybe it's just an anchor.  Maybe, you know, sometimes, uh, an anchor is just an anchor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To quote, to paraphrase Sigmund Freud.  Or exactly.  It does show you how fragile the infrastructure for the internet can be  in some of these countries.  I mean, that's a little scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, wait until we have our big 8.0 earthquake in the Bay area.  I'm, I'm, uh, between, between me and Google is, uh, San Andreas fault, you  know, and wait until that thing rips, rips.  Well, that's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You just use Microsoft Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go north.  Go north.  Young man.  The cables to Microsoft are across that fault too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Our feel good story of the week across the universe.  NASA celebrating the 50th anniversary of its founding, the 40th, uh, anniversary  of its deep space project, which is big dishes, uh, actually not, not sending,  but receiving signals from some of these deep space satellites and the 40th  anniversary of the Beatles song across the universe on Monday evening, seven  o'clock Eastern time, they are going to beam across the universe.  They're going to aim at Polaris, the North star, which is 431 light years away.  So in 431 years, the aliens on Polaris are going to finally figure out we're  here and they're going to come and eat us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh no, they're going to just go to BitTorrent and download some Beatles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whoa.  These guys are good.  These guys are pretty good.  Do we, I gotta go to the pirates bay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By then, who knows 431 years from now pirates bay may be all over the  pirates bay guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's actually interesting news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're getting sued by Sweden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's the whole thing is coming apart or something.  I, it seems that these guys are going to face jail time for guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Finally, the Swedish government, I guess, uh, found a law, some sort of law they  could prosecute these guys under, um, and yet, you know, the pirates bay announced  just shortly before that 10 million users, 1 million torrents, uh, they say,  and this is usually their defense, the Swedish government, the Swedish police,  they don't understand.  We're not sharing files.  We're just telling people where to find files.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're just telling them where the BitTorrents are, where the BitTorrent files  are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't have any, they don't have any illegal files on any of their servers.  How are they going to prosecute them?  Or is that disingenuous?  Is it obvious?  Tributory infringement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know the law over there, but, uh, no, it's contributory infringement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I shouldn't do that because we have 189,000 Kronor.  We have many Swedish listeners and every time I do that, they get mad at me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  1.2 million Kronor is the fine.  They probably make that in their ads every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's a fine.  It's not jail time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's a year in jail too.  Interesting.  Should they be found guilty, the head pirates punishment will include a year in  jail.  Ouch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I always thought Pirates Bay was kind of immune.  They sure act that way with that section where they mock people for sending them  cease and desist letters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It seemed to have been an operation for a long time.  And so they shut it down and it's going to move it somewhere else.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Remember they wanted to buy that, uh, wasn't exactly an island.  It was an old oil rig or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was the one that was featured in Wired back in the day as it was going to  be like the offshore place to put your stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I remember talking to a government official in the Bahamas and that was their  plan.  You know, they said, he said, you know, this is where pirates came 200 years ago  to store their booty.  We want to be the kind of offshore, you know, like the Cayman islands are for  banking.  We want to be the offshore home for data for data nets, free data nets.  I don't know if they've done it.  They were, they were putting in a big line to the mainland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's also known as China.  Yeah.  Isn't that what China's up to?  I mean, you can, I was, uh, at the office of the day, I walked by somebody's  computer and they were watching South park and some of these other shows.  And it was because it was on a server in China.  Well, that's yes.  If you can go to the Chinese search engines and search for stuff, you'll find  all the stuff there.  I just don't think it's not indexed in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How are you going to stop this stuff when you, when, when it's global and every  country has, that's why WIPO exists.  They're trying to get our copyright laws enforced.  It's very simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You just charge people a fair price and make it more convenient to get it.  You know?  No, that'll never work.  That'll never work.  Sonos and the Sonos and Rhapsody.  I mean, it's like, it's so much easier to just pay your 10 bucks and have  everything than install a BitTorrent client and then figure out how to just  win rare and unzip stuff.  I mean, people don't want to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And the more you push down on, on this kind of stuff, the more you're just  going to force sneaker net to come back.  Um, cause I have a stack of terabyte hard drives sitting behind me.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and the iPod, despite everything Apple's ever done, the iPod is still  the world's best piracy tool.  You just fill it up.  Bring it to your friend.  They download one of many programs.  It'll copy the contents and there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, they don't even bother with that.  They just trade iPods.  Oh yeah.  That's a good idea.  Patrick says, God, we don't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Patrick's listening.  What do the 14 year olds do these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's playing WoW right now.  Oh, that's what they do.  World of Warcraft.  They play WoW.  They're totally into it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does he?  Is that his new thing?  You better watch out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, he's, how many hours is he allowed to play?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's that?  How many hours is he allowed to play?  Uh, unlimited.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.  You're like Dvorak.  Dvorak said that he brought up his whole family.  His kids are grown now.  I think one's in jail.  The other one's a drug addict, but they're, but they're grown now.  I'm just kidding.  And he, and he said, you know, I never limited him and let him play wherever they  get tired of it after a while.  I limit my kids.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't limit you Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, fortunately, my kid doesn't even want to do that.  He likes to skate.  That's all he wants to do is go out and ride his skateboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're lucky.  I mean, most parents are worried about their kids being like 800 pounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I know, no, he's not, but, but he's not also, he'd rather skate than do  homework.  That's the other.  Oh, I mean, did you do now, Jason, tell me when you were in seventh grade, did  you do homework?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was like straight C guy.  Good.  That's what I like.  I was, I was a total screw up, but I knew how to use computers and I was hacking  when I was 12 years old, 13 years old and phone freaking, doing all kinds of  illegal activity.  Oh really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But get out alone.  I mean this jobs and was they were blue boxers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I mean, actually, you know what?  I shouldn't say it was illegal.  It was unknown if it was illegal because there weren't laws on the books at that  point.  It was, this was like 82, 83 was pre I guess they started busting people in 85, 86  when they started coming down and knocking people's doors down in Brooklyn and  Queens.  And I was in Brooklyn and we used to do phone freaking all the time.  Really?  Yeah.  I would say it was basically, I mean, as the light is freaking and hacking you  could ever do, you basically, the people traded software via sneaker net where  it would dial on your phone, like the different codes and put in random codes.  And then you would get some of the, you know, you'd know the first two codes and  then you would randomly do the next codes.  You had to write a little bit of code to try different things and it would listen  to the tone on the phone.  And so if you called sprint or whatever, MCI, if it was an 800 number, then you  dial like an eight digit code or nine digit code.  If you got it right, you heard a dial tone.  If you didn't, you heard, so you just set your thing up to identify that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I met Captain Crunch one time and he got his name by blowing in our Captain  Crunch whistle to make the, make the tone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's still around, you know, I've known him for some time.  He actually was a great influence in Woz and Woz has just agreed to serve on the  board or something, some new business that Crunch is doing.  That's kind of strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I heard about that.  Woz involved with something strange or kidding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  With something strange.  I think it's probably for Woz is just supporting an old friend.  Yeah.  But it apparently crunches coatings still.  The guy has no teeth.  Of course, I don't know why, maybe he ate a lot of Captain Crunch.  He also likes to wrestle.  He's big in a nude wrestling.  That's, that's all I remember is that we'd go over to his place, hang out and then  eventually come around to it.  When you want to go in the back room and wrestle.  That's when I'd leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's much more information than we probably needed at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  No, that was 60s.  There was a lot of things experimented.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was young.  I needed the money.  What can I say?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So then Captain Crunch and Woz were like, I don't know if they ever wrestled.  You want to come to the back, wrestle with us and Bill Gates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I tell you, you want to see an explosion, Joe, just light a cigarette and Captain  Crunch's presence.  Oh my God.  Oh yeah.  Oh boy.  There's something going on there.  Some sort of deep sated resentment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The interesting thing I remember when I was a kid, somebody figured out with the  New York City phones and the Bell phones, that if you took a hanger, it was like a  normal hanger, you know, like a wire hanger.  And if you bent it a certain way and made a curve and you stuck in the coin slot  and you shook the phone and just ran it up and down, you could get quarters out.  Like quarters would fall out.  Yeah.  And not a lot.  It was something to do with like, I think if the phone was like sort of more towards  the filled up end, you know, where they.  There was a little extra slop.  It was a little slop on the top and you would just do this.  So that's what we would do as kids.  We'd go around to phones and shake them and bang them.  I mean, I was involved in a lot.  You were a thug.  I was involved in dead stuff.  I was involved in this.  He's still a thug.  What are you talking about?  Come on.  I could be.  I am the most upstanding guy ever.  You're an upstanding citizen now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am totally honest.  Do you miss those days?  You wish you were kind of a little bit fringy still?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, no, actually, because I realized something really, I was in this  conversation with somebody who is involved in law enforcement.  It's just like, I don't understand people who are criminals because the system of  entrepreneurship in our country is basically set up to be almost as criminal  as possible.  I mean, you can you could start a company tomorrow.  Absolutely fail.  Run up debt, you know, screw up, lay off all your employees, not pay them, whatever.  And because of the corporate shield laws and everything like that, you get away with it.  I mean, I don't necessarily agree with it.  I mean, and that's why in Europe, they don't allow you to do this kind of stuff.  You're responsible for your employees.  You're responsible.  But with the exception of paying the government for tax, you know, if you don't  pay your taxes, you are screwed.  And that will be the government wants its cut.  But but anything else is up to you.  Anything else basically can just and that's why, you know, I'm always  confounded when people are like, should I take a risk and try this to do this  company? Because I'm like, yeah, because you can always go back and work at Yahoo.  What if you lost?  What if you lost?  Well, what if it doesn't work out?  Well, it doesn't work out.  Swung the bat. You missed the ball.  You don't go to jail.  Yeah, you just swing again.  Yeah. You know, and so the life of crime is so ridiculous

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that you know, it's somebody stupid who hasn't didn't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The amount of work that goes into committing crime.  It's too much work.  It's too much work for two little benefits.  Start a company like just go be an accountant.  You'll make if you learn how to use QuickBooks, you can make 50 bucks an hour.  If you're trying to rob somebody, you're not going to make 50 bucks an hour.  Learn something here.  I mean, literally, QuickBooks guys who people who know QuickBooks,  which you can learn in a weekend, are making 40, 50 bucks an hour on Craigslist.  That's a crime.  Yeah, right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, there's a huge loophole.  I can't find people to do QuickBooks, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to start a new page on Mahalo for innovative ways to make money.  Jason Calacanis is the founder of Mahalo, among many, many other things.  M-A-H-A. I always get this wrong.  A-L-O. Am I right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Mahalo.com.  And you know what I have to tell you is every time I do the show,  the number of searches for Mahalo, we get like maybe seven,  800 people a day search for Mahalo and come to the site, right?  Because you can watch that.  It doubles or triples whenever the show comes out.  And I get at least, I don't know, 100 people adding me on Facebook.  That's every time.  So anybody can have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Every time I'm on Twitter, you know, my Twitter goes nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Knock on wood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's more like if you weren't CNBC or something like that or, you know, like CNN,  you don't get the response you get from Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was on CNBC for an hour.  I didn't get the kind of response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not one person called you, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A few people, but not as many as...  I got two. I got two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got two people like, oh, so you're on CNBC.  Twitter, it's like literally dozens of emails,  hundreds of like social network ads. It's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't get it myself, but I'm...  Hey, knock on wood. Thank you, everybody, for that.  Jason is Jason McCabe Calacanis on Facebook.  Yeah. And you're not you're not full yet, although I don't think, Robert,  you have any more room, do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I can't take more friends.  I talked to Zuckerberg about that last week.  He said they're going to fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, don't fix it, because who wants more than five thousand?  I do.  I got to stay ahead of Jason.  I'm at four thousand four hundred seventy friends.  I've got I've got room.  I think I'm going to save 30 slots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have like 300 ads to do.  I just haven't had the time.  You know what's interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's about 30 or 40 people a month drop off.  So there's a decay rate, which that's what would be fascinating to compare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So those are people annoyed with all your your wall posts.  Well, you can't unfriend somebody.  Robert Scoble and Jason Calacanis are in a relationship.  They're not in a relationship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's my favorite part.  When you have a lot of friends on Facebook, you see a lot of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Every day, it's like if it's raining out, I get like seven breakups.  Isn't it funny?  Sunny day, almost everybody's in a relationship.  It's so funny. I love that.  I think you should have a correlation between the weather and relationship  up and down, like, you know, breakups and make ups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's that's part of the best part of having a lot of friends on Facebook.  On Twitter, of course, Jason is Jason Calacanis.  C-A-L-A-C-A-N-I-S.  Robert is Scoble-izer.  They're in a race to the top.  I'm in there somewhere.  I think I'm number 12.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A latte still costs three and a half bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm still I'm still accepting friends on Facebook and Twitter.  I'm trying to catch these two.  I'm a laggard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if you had never left Twitter, you would have been there.  I know I'm starting. I had to start over.  You were the guy.  The reason I joined Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had to start over just to get back to where I was.  It's not right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Come back. No, we'll help you.  Everybody will do a little rush.  We'll get you in the top 10 within a month, I guarantee you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A month. I think I think closer to sooner than that.  I'm right out of the top 10 right now, and it's going up a couple of hundred a day.  So I think I'll catch up with you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't know that.  I'm going to Twitter right now and tell everybody to friend you.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to do it too, yeah.  Oh, stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The thing that's weird about Scobel.  Now, I have to look at your page, Jason, but how many people do you follow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I follow almost all of them, but I don't do it on my phone.  I only follow them on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You follow everybody who's friends with you?  You follow them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There used to be a button that said add everybody, but they took that away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have 4313 friends.  Robert, I don't know how this happens, has more friends than people follow him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because people drop me.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, like Dave Weiner the other day was doing the political stuff.  So he was like literally using Twitter like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was live Twittering the debates, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. By the way, there's something wrong with the numbers right now.  Whatever.  On Twitterholic?  Oh, on Twitter.  I was just looking at the stats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What happened with Twitter and Joint?  Does anybody have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they moved off.  Joint was there.  Was that a divorce?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was that a bitter divorce?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think it was bitter.  I think they just outgrew Joint's ability to scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ev announces or Biz announces on the Twitter blog,  we're going to start using Joint for Super Bowl coverage because we know it's going to be big.  Joint is a web service company that offers peak bandwidth in times of need.  And then all of a sudden, and then all of a sudden,  Twitter's having all sorts of trouble falling off, getting off.  I mean, I'm so sick of that error message.  And then we see they've split up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I heard a month ago that they were moving off of Joint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, OK. So maybe that was planned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hopefully, they get these problems under their belt and move on.  We're getting tired of getting kicked off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to say, I'm glad I'm back on Twitter because it's not about functionality.  It's not about features.  It's totally about who's on there.  Yeah.  That's all that matters as a community.  That's it.  Nothing else matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's amazing the friendships you build on Twitter.  And then when you go to a conference, everybody, you meet people that you know on Twitter.  It's really amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if I could figure out some way to follow all the people who are following me,  I would. But there is no button anymore to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a script.  If you write to the Twitter team, they'll turn on the script.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know.  It makes me... I get so much.  I only follow 134 people, but I get so much, including you too.  And I get so much out of the links that you guys put up.  It's very valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the problem, I wish I could follow two groups.  One really close friend and then one in the math group.  Because the problem is when you follow so many people...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't find the good stuff in the draws.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's just that it's a chat room and you have to watch it like a chat.  Constantly.  It's constantly...  There's a new post every two seconds on my Twitter and I just can't keep up.  So now I'm using search engines to pull things out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To search your own Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, absolutely.  Not my own Twitter, but I search Twitter for things.  Oh, that's interesting.  And there's some really good tools.  I'll put them on my blog.  That let you watch live Twitter.  Like I was watching the Microsoft Yahoo! reactions yesterday on one of these Twitter search engines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twitter's an interesting platform.  You know, they haven't really done anything to monetize it, I don't think yet.  And yet there's all this interesting stuff going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It'll be very easy to monetize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you were the CEO of Twitter right now, what would you do, Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they have enough money.  So I would just try to get...  There's no urgency.  Yeah, I said this.  They should be trying to build a billion dollar business and try to get to 100 million users globally.  That's it.  I mean, if you do that, you'll have a huge business.  So there's no reason for them to...  I wouldn't even focus on trying to build a revenue model right now because all that's going to do is take 30, 40 percent of your energy and put it towards servicing advertisers and they take over your life.  Right.  Just focus on getting to critical mass.  That's what I'm doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's my philosophy.  Just build audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, if you focus on building critical mass, then what happens is the advertisers just show up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's been my experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So it's like you can spend all this time trying to convince an advertiser who doesn't believe you or you can prove it by showing, I have a lot of traffic.  How could you not advertise here?  Right.  Make it a must buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Guys, you're the greatest.  It's really good to talk to you.  Jason Calacanis, mahalo, M-A-H-A-L-O dot com and Twitter and Facebook and many other...  La la la.  And he's got dogs.  Audible.  Audible, audible, audible.  He's got dogs.  He's on quick q-i-k dot com.  Yeah.  Robert Scoble is back on the air at Fast Company.  Where should we go?  Should we go to Scobleizer dot com or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Starting March 3rd, Fast Company dot tv will start up.  But for right now, Scobleizer dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we're looking forward.  You're going to have your own Fast Company dot tv page.  That'll be cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's not just me.  There's other people joining the network.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  You want to share anything with us?  Well, my friend, Shela Israel is on the network.  Oh, I saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I saw Shela join you.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there'll be others.  Jason, you want to be on the network?  I see how Jason and I are talking.  So we can chat.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would do it.  I donate.  Whenever I do the podcast and stuff, I donate to charities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should do Muttcast.  Have a little Muttcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that would be fun.  It'd be on Valleywag every two days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  No, they use basically every week.  I have to do something with Taurus and Fondue, my bulldogs,  because they now close every Friday on Valleywag with my dogs.  That's great.  I love that.  It's like the traditions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love that.  I got to get some dogs to keep up.  Look at you.  You just can't.  Jason's taking me off of Valleywag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, see that?  You just can't let it go, Robert.  Everything has to have to be number one in everything.  I can't even have Valleywag as my number one.  You can be number two.  Number one on Facebook, number one on Twitter.  There is a little bit of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a little competition going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very competitive, Robert.  He'll smile at you, and then he's  reporting you to Google and spamming your site  and doing denial of service attacks.  He'll do anything.  He does denial of service attacks to my blog  just to keep people off of it.  So I don't make news at the scene.  I'm hacking Jason's blog.  He was.  And also, my Quick account got hacked,  and I couldn't report from DLD.  I don't know what happened.  My battery life on my phone is going down.  I think he swapped out the batteries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not Robert.  It's some guy named Scobbert Robel.  I don't know who that is.  It's advertised.  It's Robert Scobbert Robel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If only I had those kind of skills.  Social media sabotage is coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We think Patrick's playing World of Warcraft.  It ain't so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What would be more damaging, turning off the T1 lines  and all the broadband to the Middle East or whatever  and fiber optic lines or turning off access to Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And ooh, man, people start shaking, quivering.  Guys, great to talk to you.  Thanks for joining us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Another tweet is in the can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go Patriots.  Giants.  Robert goes, oh, I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm number one on Twitter.  I don't really care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  CNN, five spots behind me.  Oh, geez.  Ron Edwards, you have to make a good vice president,  but he won't be as good for number one on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, he'll beat me on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We got the impersonation thing going.  It's very good.  I like it.  You got to do like a total improv thing, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fake Robert Scoble.  Has anybody done that?  Oh, yeah, there's a fake Robert Scoble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a fake Calacanis for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not interesting, though.  The problem is, really, Robert Scoble  is the fake Robert Scoble.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How could you be more over the top than Robert?  You can't parody.  Parody.  It's a parody of himself.  Exactly.  Nothing to parody.
