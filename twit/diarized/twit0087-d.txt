Transcript:  This is Tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Bandwidth for This Week in Tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com slash podcasting.  This is Tweet.  This Week in Tech, episode 87 for February 5, 2007.  We've got Wood.  This is a special edition of Tweet thanks to George Wood who made a best of for our  request.  We'll be back live next Sunday.  But meanwhile, thanks George.  Enjoy.  John C. Dvorak had an interesting idea.  Neither John nor I went to Vegas.  I just didn't go because I'm lazy.  But John actually is trying something out.  You're doing a virtual CES?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, I gave up on the idea of going to CES.  And I'll tell you why.  There's over 6,500 analysts and media people.  They are covering 2,500 booths.  I mean, it's like over covered.  And so I put up a meta site instead, which is basically I went and looked at all the  people that are linking to CES or that have news about CES, which includes PC magazines,  If Davis, ZDNet, PC World, Engadget, Gizmodo.  And you go to my site, dvorak.org slash CES and you'll find it.  And that's essentially as far as I'm concerned, you can get the whole show that way.  And in fact, it's very well covered if you take a look at those particular sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  So it was a very, I think, a very exciting keynote.  It was kind of like a rock show, really.  I mean, you didn't go, John.  Who was at the keynote?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I went to, I just got the thing.  You know what I did was smart money.  That's not the same.  The macrumorslive.com thing is a minute by minute breakdown.  Works for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  And you know, that's every bit as good as being in there.  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah.  Come on, it's an Apple keynote, which means there's going to be applause at every announcement.  There's going to be a huge number of basically engineers and Mac employees in the back to  make sure if there's no clapping, the clapping starts at the back and moves it way forward.  They take the journalists and they bury them in the middle or off to the sides, although  they're surrounded by enthusiastic people.  They're brilliantly managed.  Oh, you think you're so smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  The Apple people were in front this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They were all over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I don't think we've ever seen those old Betty Boop cartoons.  But the audiences that they show typically with a Betty Boop cartoon with everyone clapping  and jumping up and down, hippopotamuses and whatever, it's pretty much the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there was a hippopotamus?  It's in Steve's contract.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  There was a couple of hippopotamuses.  In a tutu.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Except Steve was kind of down today.  I think he was actually sick.  You think he was down?  No, I think he was sick.  He was slow.  He kept referring to his notes, which kind of surprised me.  He's usually got that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He misspoke a couple of times and that is not like Steve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I mean, if Steve could clone himself, he would have fired himself for the presentation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So tell us the story.  So here's the first story that I was just we've been sitting on for a while, but this  is the story that ran an info world and a few other places, which in its title, the  IBM expert warns of short lifespan for burn CDs.  Did you all get this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I got this from 30 different people in the email.  It's like, what about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  He says two, two and a half years, two years to five years max for four for burn CDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that coming from like a specific period, like CDR is created back in like 99 or 90?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I had no idea.  To be honest about it, I have no idea what he's talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because I just installed an application I had on a CD that I've had for six years.  I think it's both.  I have.  Are you talking about using CDs for archiving purposes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_28
Transcript:  I think it's a terrible idea to archive stuff on burn CDs.  What are you archiving on?  I think it's pretty much been proven that a CD that's pressed lasts longer than a CD  that's burned.  Oh yeah, well that's a fact.  It is a fact.  So what?  If I have a bunch of stuff like family heirloom type stuff that I want to keep, I'm not going  to burn it on a CD.  Here's what's really funny.  I recently actually bought a damn Flickr account because I figured, you know what, I can upload  all of my stuff there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Flickr will be around in six years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_28
Transcript:  But you know what?  I trust that right now more than I would stick in a CD in a safe.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh brother.  Listen, this guy, Gurecki.

Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  I'm backed up by putting stuff on my hot dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Because Gurecki, the guy from IBM, he recommends that people use magnetic tapes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Amazon now admits it's going to open a music store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  It's going to make its own mp3 player.  They're going to basically model themselves after Apple with the closed music store.  Are they going to license the iPod design?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No.  Well that's a dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  It's not going to work.  Well, what they're saying is, look what Apple did right.  They said we're going to create a music store that only plays on our player.  You want to play our music, you've got to have your player.  So if we create a better, I think this is their thing, if we create a better music store,  and they're going to do subscription by the way, so you pay a monthly or yearly fee and  you'll get all you can eat, and you'd have to use the Amazon player.  Good idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I wonder how long that would take to crack.  Better idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But don't a couple of companies already do that?  Like Rhapsody Music.  I don't think it's a good idea at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I don't think the Apple idea is very good either.  I think it's an old idea.  The problem comes down to the DRM.  I don't like this locked in stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Apple doesn't license fair play to anyone, so you're stuck using their player with the  Apple iTunes store.  If Amazon licenses their DRM technology cheaply to enough people, then it would make at least  an open platform to distribute music on, more open than Apple's current is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Their goal would be to make a closed, I mean if you're going to compete, if you're going  to do what Apple did, you make a closed platform, right, and hope that people like your music  store so much that they buy your player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  You're placing then dependence on creating good hardware that people want to buy, and  that could be tricky.  You've got to hope that Apple doesn't lose their lawsuit over tying their music store  to their player too.  That's true too.  But that keeps the record companies happy on Apple's side.  That's the other thing, the a la carte, one fee per all the downloads you want.  I think the music companies are going to go a little crazy about that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Sunday, I should announce this also.  John, you won't be there, I'm sorry to say.  You'll be in Hanover.  But next Friday, I should say March 3rd, we're going to be doing the show live from the Apple  store.  Waz said he'd join us for that, so that'd be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That'll be pretty exciting.  I got lucky to get out of that one.  You don't want to be there?  Oh yeah, that's right, they'd stone you.  At least currently, I'd need until it blows over, let's put it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  One of the biggest articles on dig.com right now is somebody I guess has written a point  to point, point by point, refuting every single thing you pause in that article.  I keep running into Mac people that I know that know I know you, and they're like, Devorak  doesn't believe that, does he?  He just did that for the column, he just likes to agitate people.  I'm like, yeah, every 6 to 12 weeks, John goes, I haven't pissed off the entire Apple  loving community in a few weeks.  I could use a couple hundred extra thousand hits on this column.  But people are like, he doesn't believe that, does he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I'm surprised anybody would take the time to do a point by point refutation, that's  what cracks me up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It shows you how psychopathic some of these people are.  It's just nuts.  Why spend the energy on that?  It's only just a consideration.  Somebody wrote me something nasty and I said, it's not like I'm on the board of Apple suggesting  this and you should be yelling at me.  It's just a thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  It's just a column.  Now, February 28, this Tuesday, Apple is going to make a big announcement, and I think that's  exactly what they're going to announce.  What do you think they're going to announce?  They're going to announce they're shipping Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_28
Transcript:  Have you seen the pictures of their new iPod?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah, I have.  I don't know how real they are.  Let me just tell a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_25
Transcript:  I just heard it was an announcement of something fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah, let me tell a story and we can see if we can decipher.  It's kind of very cryptic.  I got the email myself.  It says, it's just got a little iCal picture, February 28, 2006, and it says, this is all.  It's just eight words, but everybody is reading into this eight words amazingly.  Come see some fun new products from Apple.  That's all it says.  Now, we're going to go down there.  I'm going to go down with the camera crew and we're going to cover it, but it could  just be iPod Sox version 2.  Fun new products doesn't sound big.  Any thoughts from anybody?  The speculation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  There's so little information to work on at this point.  It's like semiotics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  You're trying to understand what could they have meant by fun?  What do they mean by products?  Fun new products?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  It's a video player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Then Gadget had a picture, very similar to the picture of the video iPod.  Except the whole thing is a display and it's a touch screen.  You feel that that's accurate, David, or do you have inside information?

Speaker: SPEAKER_28
Transcript:  I don't have inside information, but that's what everyone that thinks that they have accurate  information don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Keeps things secret, saying iPod Hi-Fi Boombox arriving next week amongst the other products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  I guess really the story is how the press made such a big deal out of what Apple clearly  wanted to be just a little announcement, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean the predictions of what was going to be...  It went crazy.  It was crazy.  And, you know, a severe letdown, I believe, is an understatement about...

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  And we were guilty of it too.  I mean, you know, all Apple said was...  What are you looking at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Apple just wanted it to be a small little gathering with four or five friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So they sent invitations to everyone and every major media outlet in North America.  And what a hold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  It got big.  Sometimes these announcements are, get ready to get your socks blown off.  This time it said come join us for a few fun new products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_30
Transcript:  And the rumors were not exciting enough to not expect too much anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  Well, I mean everybody...  And it's expectation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  What did people think?  It was going to be a video iPod, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  I think people thought it would be everything from a video iPod to a standalone DVR to the  Apple HDTV.  I mean, it doesn't really matter what the invitation says.  It matters that you got an invitation and it's at Apple and it said it's going to be  a thing.  There's going to be a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  And that's enough.  I actually did not get our invitation at first.  My man.  Oh, me neither.  I've never gotten an Apple invitation.  So I felt really left out of, you know, everyone's going to the party.  Oh, he's Kevin Rose, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  He's here.  He brought beer.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Is this Dignation?  Did you bring enough for everyone, Mr. Rose?

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  It wouldn't be a Kevin Rose show without some beer.  Can we get a mic on Mr. Rose?  You don't have the fancy mics we do.  I'm so glad to see you.  We thought you weren't going to be here so we just got started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_30
Transcript:  Actually, this event at Apple, I normally get invited to all the big Apple events and  I wasn't invited to this one.  Usually I hear from Steve, but I may have actually turned it down because of a conflict  in schedule and then the conflict erased itself, but I know I wasn't there.  You know, okay, so they announced two new minis, I think overpriced, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I mean, by like a couple hundred bucks, this mini, don't you think?  And then, what do you think?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  Well, I like to go to these events and when they come to the pricing point, I like to  try and guess the price.  And my guesses were way under what they actually have the prices at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  Well, they actually raised the price of the mini from $4.99 to $5.99.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Why?  Because it's Intel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  Because it's got a remote control?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Because they felt they were undercharging for Airport Express and Bluetooth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe they just didn't want the people who bought the previous versions like me to feel  like heels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  Kevin's lawyer is asking.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They said the Wi-Fi was hacked, so I guess we can't get on.  Oh yeah, you can't get on.  I have something for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Plus, you don't want to.  I heard a dirty picture comes up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Well, John, you just wrote a column saying Web 2.0 was just Web 1.0 rewarmed and equally  dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's the same, you know, what you have to do is just, I think there's been some lists  put on some websites and some blogs where it shows you, you know, the old name and the  new name.  It's the same thing.  They just renamed all these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Think Free Office rightly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_25
Transcript:  Well, there was a discussion about that at eTech too.  I don't know who said it.  I wish I could remember, but somebody said that Web 2.0 really is the same thing as Web  1.0, but what happened in the meantime is that the investment community came in and  popped a bubble or created a bubble and popped it.  So this is essentially the geeks taking the Web back from the investment community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I think there was nothing wrong with Web 2.0, except that there wasn't a business model  for a lot of these.  And now that banner advertising is successful and you can make some money, I don't know  I mean, yeah, you might see some overheating.  I think Google snapping up rightly so quickly is probably some evidence of that.  But is Web 1.0, was it so very flawed?  I mean, who cares that it was a, you know, investment bust?

Speaker: SPEAKER_25
Transcript:  Well, except that somebody needed to put a new spin on it so people would pay attention  to it.  The techies are doing the same stuff we did all along.  We never stopped.  Right.  So it's a continuum.  I think John's right in that sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Well, you know, who else never stopped is Amazon and eBay.  And John pointed this out that some of those companies just kept on going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What's the big story?  Is it?  It's sitting right behind you, Patrick.  The DOJ.  So this is bigger than the DOJ story.  Don't you think?  Bigger than the Google DOJ.  In the long run, the repercussions will be bigger.  Tell the listeners what I'm pointing to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  My God, it's a copy of Windows XP running on a Macintosh Mini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_28
Transcript:  On a Macintosh Mini.  On a Macintosh Mini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No graphics drivers.  It works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No wireless drivers.  It works.  No network drivers.  But it works.  Except for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_31
Transcript:  But you can play Windows Native Solitaire on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_28
Transcript:  And you can go into the emulator.  Without an emulator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's pretty nifty.  But can you dual boot yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_31
Transcript:  Yes.  Really?  No, that dual boot, when you start it up, this is using the one that was posted for  the 13.1.  The slipstream one.  So when you start it up, you hit page up or page down and you go OS X or Windows and then  you hit enter and you're good to go.  You have two partitions on there.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_28
Transcript:  And then you like, how does it work?  Do you manually install each of the operating systems after you've...

Speaker: SPEAKER_31
Transcript:  Yeah, I will admit that I didn't do it.  Ben Durbin here did it.  But that was what, we were doing it for MacBreak.  And he did, he partitioned the drive and then installed each operating system on each.

Speaker: SPEAKER_28
Transcript:  Did you install one first or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_31
Transcript:  I think you install the OS X version first.  And then it's really on that bleeding edge side of things where two hours before, you  They do a new patch to work just with that mini.  What did you need it for?  The patch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, I mean, what did you need to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_31
Transcript:  Oh, we wanted to see if we could do it while we were shooting MacBreak.  So we were shooting all day and we were like, hey, let's see if we can, you know, actually,  it had just come out the day before.  So we wanted to see if we could make it work before the end of the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's using the NT bootloader to swap between?

Speaker: SPEAKER_31
Transcript:  I don't know what it's using.  It's using magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Welcome everybody.  We had invited Robert Scoble of Microsoft Corporation to join us to talk about our top  story, but he can't make it.  Maybe we'll get him back next week.  Actually, there's a bunch of Microsoft news.  The biggest story, of course, is that Vista Consumer Edition won't be out till early 2007.  Business Edition comes out late 2006 as planned.  That just makes me laugh.  Why would they release it?  Clearly nobody in business is going to adopt it until the Consumer Edition is out, right?  Is it just so they can test it?  I don't think that's true.  What's the rationale?  Why release the consumer?  What is the story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Why are they doing this?  Well, I mean, the word on the street is that they have some multimedia issues in the main  part of the code because, you know, they want to incorporate all this cool stuff.  Right.  I don't know.  I mean, the whole thing sounds a little fishy to me.  It's not as though they haven't done this before.  There's one rumor on the net that says it suggests that it's possibly some licensing  deals haven't been signed off on and then maybe it's going to be harder to get them  to sign off on them because, you know, Microsoft doesn't like to license anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  LA Times says it's a big yawn.  Everybody's happy with XP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I don't know about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_25
Transcript:  Well, that's my question too.  I mean, you know, take a look at an IT department.  These guys have fought for years to get something stable and like it or not, they've got something  stable.  I can't think of anything worse than having to get rid of XP and go to Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Well, and in fact, that was same issue happened with Windows 2000.  I think they were very reluctant to go to XP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_25
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, it took a long time, but a lot of them didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Microsoft has to light a fire and I have to say, well, you're not going to get updates.  You better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_25
Transcript:  How many times are you in somebody's office and they fire up the computer and there's  Windows?  If I had my choice, that would be the version I'd be using.  Really?  So, you know, I, I, you know, we all assume that, you know, every few years there's a  new major version of Windows and that we're all going to follow it.  I wonder if that eventually breaks and we just stopped doing it at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, you know, one of the things I have a issue with is that what's the difference?  I mean, what are you going to, what is Vista bringing to the party?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Well, Patrick, you played with it more than anybody else.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  So first of all, happy anniversary.  Let me probably should introduce in, in order of a Apple employee ID number.  And I think Bill, you'd probably get the pride of place until was gets here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm number four.  Number four.  Hired.  After was dropped in Markala.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  And hired on April Fool's Day, 1976.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think it was like February.  Okay.  Or I'm not sure when exactly it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well what a lot of people don't remember is that this is actually the anniversary of  Apple's second incorporation.  Randy Wiginton.  The first was actually done at Jobs House and it was sometime in the fall.  It was like after one of the homebrew computer club meetings.  Then at that point, I think like Ron Wayne owned, you know, a third of Apple, which he  sold for $900 and other things.  I don't think it was set up very well, but that was actually the first incorporation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  We were trying to track Ron Wayne down.  I thought it'd be fun to see what he's up to and whether he has any regrets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  He's probably out drinking heavily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Well I think was told me that he, that, you know, he was just scared.  He was afraid of betting the farm on this crazy little company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  He had lost money on every investment he'd ever done.  So he was thrilled to get his original investment back.  He got his money back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah.  Bill, were you at all nervous joining up in those early days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, not really.  These were some people I knew and it sounded like a great and fun thing.  And I was still living with my folks and my car was paid off and I wasn't married.  So I figured what the heck, I could take a risk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  And was your job mainly soldering?  What exactly were you up to in those early days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My title was electronic technician, which means technical jack of all trades.  I do everything from running to the store to pick up parts that have been ordered to  designing and building burn-in boxes and test fixtures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  And this was on the, at that time, I guess it would have been, would have been the Apple  One still or was the Apple Two?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it was the Apple One.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think we'd had the first batch of Apple One.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  And who was next in the group?  Was it you, Randy, or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I would be next.  Yeah, Rod Holt was number five.  I was number six and then Scotty was number seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  It's fun.  Do you still have those old badges?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I still have mine.  That'd be fun to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think they took mine when I left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Give it back.  How long were you there, Bill?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I was there for about a year and a half and then some other friends I'd worked with  before hired me away.  And then I went to Japan for a couple of years and then I returned in about 81 to work on  the Mac project.  I worked on the Mac project with about 15 people on it.  That seems...  So I think total life worked about 13 years for Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  That seems very common that people come and go, isn't it?  Yes.  Many people have...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's common in this industry in particular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah, many people have multiple tenures.  Randy, what were you doing in those early days?  I was in high school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Really?  Oh yeah.  I actually started working at Apple before I could drive.  I love it.  The entire executive staff of Apple went to Randy's high school graduation, I think.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  That must have been fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Very unusual honor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Watt would come back from one of the homebrew computer clubs where he had taken  an Apple I to show and he'd come back raving about some high school student who'd done  some fantastic demo on it, something with colors and something with graphics.  I think Randy Wiggington was one and Chris Hesbunoff was another that I remember particularly  in those days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  So, I mean, for all of you, was this your first experience with a personal computer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I had actually worked on a friend's InSight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah, and there was the Mitz Altear too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, nobody had the Altear.  It was too expensive.  We were going for the InSight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was doing timesharing and I had my own KSR35, which was the military version of the Teletype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  This must have been pretty exciting at that time though, the idea of building a mass market  personal computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, throughout high school, I and all of my electronic buddies, we wanted to build  our own computers.  So, to finally be able to have your own computer was incredibly exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Leo, I don't think any of us really thought of in terms of a mass market for computers.  We just wanted one for ourselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Actually, I was excited about this story and it turned out to be not so.  Bill Gates doing a guest appearance in Doctor Who.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  But not true.  What a let down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think that one's true.  Bill does a lot of fun things though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  He was in Frasier.  I mean, in 2001, he did a cameo on Frasier.  The thing that probably was the giveaway was in the original story was when they said that  Gates would play an alien whose goal was total world domination.  See, I don't see Bill doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Well, maybe.  I mean, you should see some of the funny videos they do internally for employees to see.  He got together with the guy who does Napoleon Dynamite.  I forget what the actor's name is, but they did a fun skip for the employee meeting.  That was fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, I would like to see that.  I saw that.  I actually think they posted that online, right?  Didn't that leak out somewhere?

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  They posted some of it, but they did some other stuff that just was shown internally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  If I go search YouTube for Bill Gates, I'm not going to find it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Probably not.  I'm not sure.  They usually don't share those because they only pay the actor for small group sharing  and not internet sharing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Well, wait a minute.  Here's a five minute 30 minute clip.  Bill Gates goes to college with ... How long was the original clip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Yeah, that was about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I think it's all ... Oh, here's Bill.  He's got a Vote for Pedro t-shirt on.  Well, I'm sure it'll be off YouTube by the time ... It looks like somebody had a camcorder  in the conference because I could see people's heads.  This is one of those pirate videos that you would buy on the street corner in Taipei.  That looks good.  That's pretty funny.  I want to watch that after the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, here's an interesting story that came up in the news that changed the topic a little  bit.  This AMD subpoenaed Microsoft in the antitrust case against Intel I personally thought was  quite amusing.  Any irony?  Well, no.  The reason I thought it was funny is because Microsoft's always been in bed ... This has  got to come out in the court, but Microsoft's always been in bed with AMD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  You've said this before that Gates owned AMD stock and Microsoft preferred AMD to Intel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Remember they had that one product that one ... There was some Windows only thing that  AMD was making for them.  I forgot what ... I can't remember this was some years ago.  Yeah, I remember that.  Yeah.  That's a lot of fun by loading up your email with all kinds of negative stuff on the other  company and who's going to be able to disclose that?  It's like, hey, wait a minute.  We never even had this meeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I think people don't realize what you just said is true.  I think people assume that it's Windows, Microsoft, and Intel are in bed together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's because it's been so long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, everybody in the Valley knows for a fact that Microsoft and Intel have not gotten  along for the longest time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  But I think we should start off with Kevin Rose because you were in the news this week.  I was all over the place.  All about dig.  That's right.  So, lots of digs being taken at dig, people complaining about lack of transparency and  how stories make it to the front page.  People are alleging that you're doing stuff.  Where did it start?  Did it start with CNET?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Who was it the first?  Well, it started with a blog that posted an entry about a spammer that had been posting  stories to dig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  This is Forever Geek?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right, Forever Geek.  There was two stories that made it on the home page from a website called The List Apart,  which is an amazing website.  Both of those stories I dug and I was the 17th digger on both stories.  So they thought because of the order in which all of the digs were happening that I was  a part of this ring or bot that was actually digging these stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  People are so conspiracy oriented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I can see where they're coming from though because if you look at the actual history,  if you go into dig and you go into any story and then you go down to the very bottom, it  lists all the diggers and what order that they were dug in.  You can see that this person was clearly using a bot to dig all the stories because it would  rapid dig 16 different accounts.  This is the spammer that you're talking about.  This is a very, very common way that we see happen all the time on dig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  They're trying to game dig by using a bot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Like the biggest, the number one thing that we have to do at dig right now is fight spam  on a daily basis.  We are constantly, constantly fighting spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  The reason is if you get dig on dig, if you rise up on dig, you get a lot of clicks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a ton of traffic.  So it's like instant traffic to your website.  But what the person really didn't point out is that this person was also listed as one  of my friends.  Actually, three of their accounts were listed as my friends because I track a bunch of different  people on dig.  I have about 40 different people that I track through the friends feature that's built into  the site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  And you're tracking him though not because he's a friend may not be the best name because  you're tracking him because you're trying to keep an eye on him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So they're kind of using their stories and they submit good stuff.  So these accounts, so spamming has kind of evolved on this site.  So basically, there's several different ways that people can spam the site.  There's the people that will sign up for mass accounts.  So they'll come in, they'll create 50 different accounts, and their main goal is to all dig  the same story and get their blog or their website or their story on the front page.  So that doesn't work because we've kind of put in a karma system behind the scenes.  This was a long time ago, like a year and a half ago, right about a year ago, we added  a karma system behind the scenes that kind of takes a look, kind of creates a baseline  of all the different digging activity that's done on the site.  And then we can very easily tell when someone is a spammer or just creating fake accounts  or is all behind the same IP, is behind one of the many, many anonymous proxies that are  out there.  Or we'll see the same URL that's getting reported by users submitted over and over again.  So that's the old way of spamming the site.  Now the new way that we've seen in the last probably, I don't know, 60, 90 days is when  you have people that are submitting quality content to create these like fake accounts  that appear to be real.  So you'll see sites that will, or spammers that will create and submit a couple dozen  stories that are actually quality stories.  Some will make the homepage, some won't, and then they'll somehow get in there with their  own unique URL and try and promote it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Well that makes sense.  So then it doesn't look like it's the same guy over and over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.  And it's very hard for our systems to detect that kind of stuff because obviously if they're  using unique IPs, if they're not behind proxies that we can detect, it's hard to really kind  of put, it's hard to detect when users are kind of digging together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Is it the same people who are doing the Fenteremine blog spam or who are these spammers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Just people that want to, I mean it's all different kinds of sites.  We ban dozens of URLs per day, dozens of accounts, and these just happen to be a couple really  good submitters that I had added to my friends list here probably several weeks ago and I  was digging their stories because they were submitting stories from Wired, they were submitting  stories from just a variety of different really good high quality sites.  I was digging their stories and listed as number 19 on that day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  And then they spam you.  Big story of course, I guess, I mean it was kind of a slow week this week.  If this is the biggest story then that really proves it.  Nintendo and the Wii.  Actually, I thought of, I put an article in the show notes that I thought was kind of  right on saying that this is really just a bogus attempt to get some publicity as we  approach E3 and there really is nothing.  Bogus attempt by Nintendo?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  A bogus attempt.  How can it be bogus?  We were giving them publicity now.  It worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  You're right, it's not bogus but so what I guess.  There's no really, there's nothing new to say except that they've changed the name from  Revolution to Wii.

Speaker: SPEAKER_28
Transcript:  Well, I think the main problem aside from the fact that I'll even agree that Wii is  kind of a stupid name is that they have a significant amount of branding that's invested  in Revolution.  Everyone is familiar with Nintendo Revolution and everyone seemed to like it.  So what basically I think a lot of people have said about is that why throw Nintendo  Revolution away?

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Wii is friendlier.  Wii!  It's a more friendly name than Xbox.  It's a more friendly name than PlayStation.  And since it is in fact a kid's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_28
Transcript:  Well look what happened with Windows Me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Me and Wii.  Oh, it could go down.  It could be like the Coke classic of technology, Me and Wii.

Speaker: SPEAKER_28
Transcript:  Well, I think Nintendo stands by the merits of their system as a gaming machine and not  a home media center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Aaron McKenna writing in Tom's Hardware said that Wii is not even pronounceable in Japanese.  That the Japanese can't even say it.  Although they like it in France because it means yes in France, right?  Wii.  Wii.  Say Wii.  But he also points out there's nothing really to say about it and it's just attempting...  I mean look, I guess E3 is May 9th.  Microsoft's going to try to get attention by announcing a Blu-ray for the Xbox 360 but  all eyes are really...  HDD.  Oh, it's HDDV not Blu-ray.  Oh, interesting.  Not with Microsoft.  Oh, that's right.  Well, I can't follow it all.  Sony is Blu-ray.  Microsoft is HDDV.  Although a lot of computer manufacturers like Blu-ray because it stores more on the disk.  I mean it's a better data format, right?  Supposedly.  So, of the panel here, is anybody else going to E3 besides Will?  Nope.  That's silence.  That's silence, isn't it?  I was going to go.  I got a funny phone call from Al Lowe last week.  The guy who did Leisure Suit Larry.  Leisure Suit Larry?  Hello?  Yeah.  I was going to meet my guest at E3 and I said, wow, yes, but then I just have so much  to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_31
Transcript:  You know, I guess the big hubbub is that all the booth babes are gone.  Yeah, that's the main reason I'm not gone.  I'm kind of guessing about that.  They're cleaning it up.  They're cleaning the whole thing up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Do they still have the Tycho drummers though?  I mean, because that's really what drove me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I was invited to a thing that Viya is doing.  You'll probably go to this, Will, featuring the girls of destruction but I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  So, that's a really interesting thing because we actually went...  The girls of destruction is like a girl gaming clan, right?  Oh, all right.  So, they're not booth babes.  They're actually gamers.  They're not booths.  They're actually gamers and they've set up a house in Sweden of all places and they've  basically got like a training house for this girl gaming clan.  And we went out there to see it.  Are they Swedish?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Are they Swedish?  Why are they in Sweden?

Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  Well, I think it's because Sweden has like really chunky broadband.  You can get like a hundred meg there just like for nothing.  So they went there for the broadband.  And so they flew in.  They've got a girl from England, a couple of girls from California and a girl from Japan  or somewhere and they've put them all in a house to train together and to like hone their  elite skills, I guess.  And then they're flying them off to different tournaments and stuff around the world.  Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Maybe it's just me but I think if you got a bunch of girls together to live in a house  to play video games...

Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  You wouldn't be video gaming, would you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Well, I'm just thinking it probably looks just like a frat house.  They're probably no different than a bunch of guys.  They probably sit around in their boxer shorts drinking beer playing games, right?  No?  That's about right.  I wouldn't think.  I mean, maybe not beer.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think like Chardonnay is being served?  Come on.  They're not drinking chablouli.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I could tell you that right now.  So Viya, I guess, what has hired them or is sponsoring them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  Yeah, so they're sponsoring them.  I mean, they're all pretty good gamers.  They won some stuff at QuakeCon last year.  And it's like a promotional thing.  Viya gets the name associated with these cool gamers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Thoughts on E3.  What was the big story at E3, Jen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think far and away for me and a lot of others was definitely the Nintendo Wii.  Just finally getting to play it and see it in action and wave around the controller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Really?  The Wii stole thunder from the Xbox 360.  I guess there wasn't much to say about the Xbox 360.  It's been out for almost a year.  And PlayStation 3, which is kind of a surprise.  Al, do you agree?  Does the Wii get you excited?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We went in as the underdog and came out as the winner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah, kind of a surprise.  What made the Wii so interesting to the attendees, Al?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think the controller, I think the integration of the software with the machine, just the  general buzz about the whole thing.  Everyone that I talked with said that was the big story.  Isn't that funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I wouldn't, if you'd asked me a year ago, is Nintendo out of the game?  In fact, I think I might even have said this.  It's now between Microsoft and PlayStation and Sony and nobody cares about Nintendo anymore.  I did say it and a number of people said, oh, wait a minute, the DS is a great product.  Jen, did you ever count Nintendo out or was I just misguided?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I am one of the people, I started playing games on television and then NES.  So I do have a soft spot for Nintendo, but the DS had been going strong since pretty  much day one and the Wii is kind of capturing that same market of people who don't really  play video games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I have a major confession to make.  I didn't go to New York to buy it, but the minute I, I guess it was Monday morning or  was it Tuesday, it was Tuesday morning without a fanfare, without a, you know, no Steve Jobs  speech, no mystery invitation to the press.  Apple just kind of put it up on their website, the new MacBook.  And I admit, not only did I buy one, but I paid the $150 premium to get it in black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  How'd you like it?  Am I a sucker?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  This is no, Leo, you have, you are the most unbelievable example of like not beyond early  adopter.  Anything that happens, I mean, we can go on with some of these things we've done like  ventrilo and some of these other things.  It's amazing that you jump on anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I have no, I have no impulse control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I have a fun, one of the funniest posts I've ever done right now.  It's online.  It's the, it's a cat.  Has anyone seen this thing, by the way?  It's a, some jokers put a cat toy on a, on a, on an overhead fan and this cat's reaching  for it and then he gets caught in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh my goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, it's not bad.  He catches, goes around and around and then gets thrown against the wall.  It's quite humongous.  Is it a video or an animation?  It's a video.  It's a video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's very real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  There's actually, somebody put together like a 25 minute collection of viral videos of

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  cats doing, cats doing weird things.  Yeah, that's definitely worth checking.  It's called youcat.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Yeah.  Remember the scan, the cat scans?  Remember that?  There were, they had scans of cats.  People would upload their, they would put their kitty on a scanner and they would scan  it like.  Cat people plus cat people, bad combination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bad combination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Let's talk about the first story, the big story.  There really is only one story this week.  Bill Gates stepping down at Microsoft.  He says in two years he's not going to be in charge anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  He'll stay chairman of the board, but he's already handed Ray Ozzie the keys to the car

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  saying you're now the chief software architect.  Good news, bad news.  The market said, eh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  The market's holding its breath on Vista's release, I think more than anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Well, and Microsoft lost something like 25% in April.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  So it was already depressed stock to begin with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  I think judging from, I looked up the stock price earlier and judging from aftermarket  and today, it's after hours trading and today it's like dead even.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Like no change.  That's what pundits say.  I mean, it could be good.  It could be bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Let's talk about Blu-ray because we've got we're still waiting.  Our Blu-ray box is supposed to show up Friday.  So hopefully it'll be in Monday.  First Blu-ray players are now shipping from Samsung.  Sony's are delayed another month or three months or six months or they're going to drop  it to push PS3 sales.  But we've actually we've had one of the desktop bios and a notebook bio in house.  And I got to tell you the Blu-ray software that they ship with the bios really needs to  really need some more time in the oven.  What's wrong?  What goes wrong?  It doesn't work.  Yeah.  The one on that we're still waiting for Sony to get back to us to explain why the stuff  on the desktop doesn't work.  You would think that if they.  They're blaming architecture issues on the notebooks for its occasional slowdowns while  playing video.  Hey Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.  Can you ask Sony a question when you're going through the discussion on this thing?  I'd like to know exactly how their primary competitor in consumer electronics, Samsung  manages to roll out what's essentially Sony's product before Sony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  And we have I think this fascinating explanation of net neutrality from Senator.  Senator Stevens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  What the Senator is talking about is allowing all of these entities that support this to  provide streaming stuff going on the internet.  Now the internet, you know, let's go back.  Internet started with a concept of local to local connections across the country.  And you could go for Alaska, but you only had you had to go through local connections  to get there.  Industry wisely provided for streaming for in effect a new kind of long distance.  And that's what we've got.  We've got a service that's immune to distance and it's there for the consumer.  But when we take and really indicate that anyone that wants to use it, this system for  massive, massive commercial purposes, there's one company now you can you can get sign up  and you've got a movie delivered to your house daily by subscription service, by delivery  service.  OK.  And currently it comes your house, put in a mailbox for you to get home and you change  your order.  But you pay for that.  Right.  This service is now going to go through the internet.  And what you do is you just go to a place on the internet and you order your movie.  And guess what?  You can order 10 of them and it's delivered to you and this delivery charge is free.  Right.  Ten movies streaming across that internet.  And what happens to your own personal internet?  I just the other day got internet was sent by my staff at 10 o'clock in the morning on  Friday.  I got it yesterday.  Why?  Because it got tangled up with all these things that are going on the internet commercially.  And here we have this one situation where enormous entities want to use the internet  for their purpose to save money for doing what they're doing now.  They use FedEx.  They use the delivery services.  They use the mail.  They deliver in other ways, but they want to deliver vast amounts of information over  the internet.  And again, the internet is not something that you just dump something on.  It's not a big truck.  It's a series of tubes.  And if you don't understand those tubes can be filled.  And if they're filled, when you put your message in, it gets in line.  It's going to be delayed by anyone that puts into that tube enormous amounts of material.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Which reminds me of that old April Fool's gag I did some years ago where I said these guys  were trying to pass a law saying you can't be drunk when you're using a modem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Lawsuits fly over Google Founders big private jet.  I didn't realize that they had bought a 767.  This is a jet that normally carries 180 passengers.  It's three times as heavy as the conventional executive jet.  Sergey Brin and Larry Page bought this.  It was a used one.  It's from the Qantas fleet.  And they're converting it to hold 50 passengers, including, by the way, a special executive  suite for the president of Google, Eric Schmidt, a lounge in the front with two adjoining state  rooms for the co-founders farther aft.  There's a plan if you want to look at it in the Wall Street Journal of the jet.  This thing is talk about excess.  So what are the lawsuits for?  Well, the company that they hired to do the Blue City Holdings is the company that owns  it and the company that they hired to do the redesign, Leslie Jennings, a high end aviation  designer.  Apparently, it's not going well in the transformation.  This is the guy who did Paul Allen's jet.  He also does the Queen's jet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think Paul Allen's got a 757 though, right?  Is that bigger than a 767?  No, no, the 767 is big.  That's pretty big.  It's generally an overseas plane.  So this would be a plane that these guys could fit.  It's a little more practical, I think.  I don't want to defend the fact that these guys are throwing money at stuff like this,  but it's a little more practical a plane if you can afford it than these little private  jets that don't really make.  You can make a trip from San Francisco to Paris on a 767 nonstop.  You can't really do it with too many other planes.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Dateline, Hanoi.  More than 20 desperate students in Vietnam paid up to 50 million Dong.  I didn't know that was their unit of currency.  It is.  It's about $3,000 to Don elaborately wired wigs and shirts that allowed them to cheat  on their college entrance exams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's a good idea.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  During a week.  I'm sure you blogged this already, John.  During a weekend.  No.  Yeah, you get to it.  Get to it.  You're slow.  Which ones?  During a weekend raid, Hanoi police confiscated 50 mobile phones, 60 earphones, 150 SIM cards,  8 shirts and 5 wigs.  I guess the idea was that they were going to phone in the answers.  The reason they wore the wigs because their hair was too short to cover the earphone,  and then they would wire up the shirts.  It's pretty competitive in Hanoi.  It says only 10% of the students who take the exams get in to the universities.  Really the big story of the week, and it's still at the rumor stage, although I think  it's less of a rumor than just a matter of time.  AMD, a friendly takeover of ATI for $5.5 billion.  Billion.  An interesting merger because, of course, you've got the Nvidia ATI battle and then  the Intel AMD battle, and to see AMD take on a partner here.  Now, I want to say right up front, Kevin, that we're going to say right up front, you  are not speaking for Nvidia in any way.  You're not here as a representative of Nvidia in any way.  That's correct.  I want you to feel able to speak freely, and so I'm not asking Nvidia this.  I'm asking you.  It is a rumor.  It seems pretty credible, yes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a rumor that's been around for a few weeks now.  It actually goes back to just before Computex, and it's a rumor that just doesn't seem to  want to die.  So, it's spread quite widely on Friday, and at this point in time, it's looking fairly  realistic.  I mean, it's something that you would expect AMD and ATI would have denied heavily if there  wasn't actually something ongoing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Apparently, somebody in the boardroom at AMD leaked the fact that the vote occurred on  Friday.  The fact is that the stock market believes it.  AMD declining ATI going up considerably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And all the other tech companies were going down on Friday except ATI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  What's the advantage of it?  What does AMD get out of buying ATI?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, actually, short-term, there's a couple things.  One, they get to zing Intel because Intel invested heavily in ATI and Crossfire for  the launch of Conroe.  So, there's a little bit of a zing to Intel.  That's by far not important.  That's a transient type of thing.  The most important thing is AMD now can say they have a full, complete solution.  They have chipsets that work with their processors, and they've always felt a little bit disadvantaged  to some extent that Intel had their own chipsets, and AMD did not.  They're relying on third parties.  Now, that said, AMD's partners, ourselves, Nvidia and ATI, as well as VIA and ServerWorx,  have been doing a pretty good job supporting AMD over these years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Nvidia makes a great AMD chipset, the N4 chipset.  Well, thank you for saying so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, no, but I mean, like, literally, that brings me back to why would they know?  I'm not sure I see the corporate synergy that justifies the leveraging of assets.  Well, you're not alone. The stock market didn't either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  They thought that AMD stock tanked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What it is, it's actually a long-term bet.  Partly, it's all the fab capacity AMD's putting in place.  So, now, ATI would get access to that directly, and even though ATI could always sign an agreement  to access the fab as a foundry-type deal, having ATI design group part of AMD would make it easier.  The real long-term issue is about four years from now, two more process generations.  We're going to go from multi-core to many-core.  There will be going from two to four next year, and then eight.  And eventually, what you have is Moore's law keeps giving you more and more transistors to play with.  And what do you do with those transistors on the silicon?  Somewhere along the way, you really seriously consider adding the GPU function  onto the same silicon with the CPU.  Much like back in the 46 days, we added the math co-processor onto the same silicon with the CPU.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So, Kevin, this is essentially you're releasing the earliest long-distance rumor  about the acquisition of NVIDIA by Intel.  I was going to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  There's traditionally some tension between Intel and NVIDIA,  because NVIDIA makes a chipset competing with Intel's chipset.  Not as much as it's going to be after the buyout attempt.  Okay, so the mainstream media, you know, or you hope you know that that's going on,  but who's watching over user-created content like podcasts and blogs?  And how do you know whether to trust them or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The blogosphere. It's a self-correcting mechanism.  That's what makes it so powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  People will know. You think people can tell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_24
Transcript:  Well, you can do it this way.  You can say, yes, indeed, people are paying me to write about their products,  but they are products I use, products I endorse,  products I would not endorse if I did not believe I can recommend them to you.  Now, at that point, it's a matter of how credible are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Well, we're faced with that on Twitter.  I mean, we have some advertisers, both advertisers I use.  We have two more coming, both of which I use.  And we also make it very clear, now comes the ad.  And I think we also make it very clear that our coverage,  and I think if you listen, our coverage is not biased toward or, you know,  in fact, in some ways it's somewhat biased against, I shouldn't say this,  but the advertiser.  We're certainly bent over backwards not to look like we're in their pockets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_24
Transcript:  Well, but Leo, that's a real problem.  That happens more than once in people who think they're trying to be fair.  They end up being unfair to the people who are supporting them,  and that's not right either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  We certainly, you know, AOL has been very good  providing bandwidth for this podcast from day one,  and they provide a lot of bandwidth.  In fact, I just found out a podcast, Twitter 55,  which emerged at the same time as a big ad campaign on Morpheus for Twitter,  had 700,000 downloads in about three or four weeks.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  For the single episode?  700,000, 400,000 downloads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Are people paying for those?  No. Well, that's the thing.  AOL gives us the bandwidth.  If I were paying for the bandwidth, this network wouldn't exist.  So AOL is a sponsor in kind, and I have to admit,  if there's a negative story about AOL, I'm disinclined to ignore it.  I certainly don't want to look like we're ignoring the negative stories.  But you're right, Jerry.  That would be biased in the opposite direction.  This is Twitter, This Week in Tech, episode 65 for August 6, 2006,  The 60 Million Dollar Man.  All right, let's get started then.  We've got a great panel, and I'd like to introduce everybody.  We have William Harris who is back via cell phone  because he can't get grounded from Los Angeles.  He's back in the States, Ladies and gentlemen, Cory Doctorow.  Howdy.  It's great to have you back on Twi.  And we'll talk a little bit about what you're up to,  because you're no longer the European Affairs Coordinator for EFF.  You're in LA now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What could that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  We also have Will Harris from Britain who very kindly stepped out of the way  for Jerry Pornell last week, so we owe him one.  Hello, how's it going?  Bit-Tech.net.  And you were up late last time.  I think it was what, two in the morning when we bumped you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  Yeah, something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I apologize.  Also with us, the poster boy for Web 2.0, ladies and gentlemen.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  We're just proud of you, Kevin, although the picture on the front of Business Week

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  wasn't exactly the best picture of yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have a story about that.  We can talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  And of course, to anchor this whole mess, John C. Dvorak,  who only got one plug in last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  All I need, one plug, dvorak.org slash blog, I'm in business.  Is it that good? Does it work that well, really?  Well, you know, it's actually diminishing returns.  If I probably, you know, at some point I notice that, you know, I got a bunch of,  I've got to run up and then it's pretty much nothing now.  Nothing, you get nothing, huh?  I get nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  So you just appear out of the goodness of your own heart.  Well, I thank you very much.  You did blog this week about Kevin's cover.  And let's, we might as well just start off with that.  First of all, Kevin, embarrassed or not, I think it's wonderful.  I mean, you're getting a lot of recognition from Business Week.  It was kind of, the counting in the article is a little strange.  As they pointed out in the article, your dig is breaking even.  But on the front page, they say this kid made $60 million in 18 months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Actually, a dig isn't even breaking even.  So they got that wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Kevin, you're taking this out to dinner, didn't I, with all that money?  $60 million!

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have no, there's no, I'm not a multimillionaire, I'm not even a millionaire or a thousandaire.  I don't know how they came up with that cover.  But I guess it was just based on, they put a value to the company.  $200 million.  And you have 40%.  They estimated how much, yeah, it's all estimates.  And obviously it's just paper fake money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Hey, I thought, Leo, you kind of liked that piece.  I thought the article read like a, like a slipshod hit piece.  Really? You think it was a hit piece?  It would seem like it to me.  It was snide, he called him a kid.  I mean, the guy, you know, Kevin's 30 or close to it.  And I mean, if you look on the pictures, he's got a six o'clock shadow for God's sake.  I mean, he doesn't even look like he's young in that thing, except for the crazy outfit.  And then they had all these comments about...

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Tom Cruise's doughier little brother and, you know, they were some snotty stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, and that about the tech TV loser, you know, kind of a loser on tech TV, you know, unknown.  I mean, the whole thing just rang.  You know what? You're right. I'm mad as hell now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I'm mad. Dang it.  Before we do anything, I think we should commemorate, as we have done in the last few tweets, an anniversary.  So remember we talked about the 15th anniversary of the internet or the World Wide Web.  10th anniversary of Flash.  August 1981.  25 years ago, something important happened in technology.  Does it have anything to do with IBM?  It might have. The first IBM PC, the 5150.  It cost $1,565, but that's because it didn't come with any drives.  It came with 16K of memory and a cassette port.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Woohoo!

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Wow, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember the cassette port. You know, I just want to...  Does everyone remember that used the Kansas City standard or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  What are you talking about? Kansas City standard.  Do you remember that?  Is that a cassette data standard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.  John, do you still have your 15th...  It was called the Kansas City standard. That was the upgrade to the old whatever.  There were some original ones that came out.  And then the Kansas City standard were up the ante and it was like the high speed...  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  My Atari would make, and I think the Apples would make noises they read in the tapes.  Did the IBM do that also?  Brrrr, brrr, brrr, brrr, brrr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, you know, it was like you could...  The drive you want, you could use any drive that had kind of...  You know, you were looking for a monophonic drive like a radio shack.  And you would push the buttons manually and you'd load the data from this thing.  And it wasn't like a tape drive that was controlled by the computer necessarily.  Right.  It was like, you know, you had it going into this port and you pushed the button and it would load the data, maybe.  And depending on...  It was not very reliable, I have to say.  Yeah, you know, I disagree with that. I'd never have had a problem with the reliability of those things.  Well, fortunately...  If you had the right cassette player, they were quite reliable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Fortunately, they came out with a floppy and a hard drive very soon after.  I'm sure that cost thousands of dollars at the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Actually, the floppies were available immediately.  Were they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah.  These things were built like tanks. I mean, literally they were steel, sheet steel.  Well, I had an 8088.  Which one was this that came out?  This was an 8088.  Okay.  It was 4.77 megahertz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Wasn't as cool as my Atari, though.  Four point...

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I mean, 25 years ago, this was 4.77, not gigahertz, not megahertz.  And of 16...  Yeah, well, that was pretty fast for those days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I mean, the fastest chips before that were like a megahertz or something like that.  Less than that. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  The 6509 that ran on the Apple, I think, was one point something megahertz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  That's what the Atari had. It was like 1.4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah. It was really amazing, really.  Anyway, I just thought we'd mention that.  Ray Ozzie said last week, it's the end of the PC era.  Here we are 25 years later.  I don't know if I agree with him on that.  What are you talking about? What's that supposed to mean?  Should we talk about...  What do we want to talk about?  Any... you want to talk about Apple's announcements on the...  No, actually, let me call one, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Call one, please.  What is this about Microsoft shutting down MSN Chat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  What is it about that? Are they afraid of...  You know, it's not the first time Microsoft has shut down something.  Remember, they used to run those MetMeeting servers,  and they turned out to be a hotbed for horny men and women.  Could it be the same things going on here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No. You know, if it is, I mean, is this like new?  This thing's been here for a decade, and now all of a sudden they've discovered that, like,  you know, people are, like, flirting with each other in some odd way online.  Shanked. We are shocked to find out.  There's something else going on here.  Why would...

Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  Well, according...  Well, they say that after October the 18th,  it says MSN Chat will no longer be offered.  Please download Windows Live Messenger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  That's really what's happening. They're moving to live.  Everything's going live.  But is MSN Chat and Windows...  They're the same thing. Have you used Live Messenger?  It's just a relabeled MSN Chat.  They say MSN Chat has...

Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  No, I think they're talking about shutting down MSN Chat as in, like, the Yahoo Chat kind of webpage.  Oh, the website chat, not MSN...

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah, no, no, no.  Oh, oh, oh, I see. So it's just relabeling it.  I don't know.  Nobody uses it. Does anybody use it?  I mean, people use the Messenger Chat.  Yeah, but this is, as Will's correctly pointed out, this is web-based chat. Who uses it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  Well, I think that's the point, isn't it?  The point, isn't it, is that web-based chat used to be really the thing sort of back in the day,  and everybody would hang out on Yahoo Chat.  You'd have all these gazillions of different rooms and stuff.  Oh, come on.  But now everybody's just got their own...  Oh, come on. No biggie.  ...AOL.com.  Do you not buy...  Everyone just uses IM there, surely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I'm not buying it.  I like MSN Live, actually. Have you played with Live at all?  Not me.  Robert, have you played with it?  The live website?  Yeah, well, of course.  No, of course.  That's where the chat's going to live. I think Microsoft's doing some really interesting things there. It's live...

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Leo, you're the only one who thinks that. Am I?  I don't know. Does anybody else in the group think that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  Actually, there is one thing that Microsoft is doing with Live and with messaging that is really cool,  and that's linking Xbox users with Windows users and letting them play against each other and chat with each other.  I love that idea, yeah.  To be on your PC, and if you're in IM and you can see if one of your mates is playing an Xbox game,  and then you can just go and join in the game with them, and that's pretty neat.  But aside from that, you know...  It's a billion-dollar idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  You want to see some cool things.  Microsoft's doing kind of the same thing that Google does with the research, Google Labs.  If you go to... I think it's labs.live.com, there's some really neat stuff that...  I mean, Microsoft... Look, you've got to admit, Microsoft has some smart people working there, right?  So this is their kind of clever thing.  Let's listen to a little background. WIPO is the World Intellectual Property Organization.  The UN Chartered, originally the idea was for the nations to get together and kind of make a...  Which makes sense, a global policy for copyright and trademark and patent and all of that,  because after all, it's a global economy. Unfortunately...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, hang on, hang on.  That's not why they were put together.  They had been an industry association whose job it was to promote that,  and what happened was they went to the UN and they said,  you know, knowledge goods, copyrights and patents and trademarks,  they're really important to humanitarian efforts.  What you need is a humanitarian agency to do humanitarian work in respect of knowledge goods.  Then, of course, they got a UN Charter and threw out any kind of notion of being humanitarian agency  and just worked on making more and more exclusive rights for the corporate members that had started it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  It was really a Trojan horse to get them a UN Charter.  It's not clear when you're doing the commercial...  I think when I start talking about Visa, that's pretty clear it's a commercial,  but I'm going to say now, this podcast brought to you by Visa.  And then now you'll know it's a commercial, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Maybe you should have an UGA or like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Do I have a what?  A website.  A website to go to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I mean, Visa, I mean, why does Visa have to advertise?  That's a really good question, but I'm not going to...  No, I'm just saying because everybody knows who they are.  Everyone knows who they are.  It's like there's two cards, there's Visa, MasterCard, and then there's I guess...

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  They need to advertise. It's so important for their image.  You know what they're trying...  Actually, they have the best image of all these guys.  I think they do have the best image.  Compared to what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  They're indistinguishable from MasterCard, and they're in a long running battle with American Express.  Maybe that's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's a different style. American Express is a different game.  I think so, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You may think so, but a lot of the public may not notice the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I think also when you get a credit card, do you really have a choice?  Can you go to your bank and say, can I not have a MasterCard? I prefer a Visa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  In some cases, you want to apply for one or the other.  In other words, what Visa is doing by advertising is really advertising to banks to get them to use them instead of the other guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I'll tell you why they wanted to be on Twitter.  They wanted, and that's the whole network, by the way, they wanted to tell people who understand security  and who use their credit cards online that they're working to make sure that the fraud doesn't happen on Visa cards.  They keep an eye on things.  They actually do this.  I've had this happen where if somebody uses your card out of context, you get a call and they say, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Or if you use your card out of context.  Well, I actually got that, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  When I started using it in Canada, they called and said, do you go to Canada a lot?  I said, yes. They said, oh, great.  We're just checking. I think that's good.  And then, you know, I'm getting the award for a podcaster, a pod person of the year, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You know, I was waiting for you to talking about what you were going there for so I could introduce that fact and congratulate you and make you seem all swank and humble.  But you mean if I hadn't tooted my own horn, you would have done it for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I've been waiting for a chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You got my back, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Thank you.  Is there a gift bag?

Speaker: SPEAKER_28
Transcript:  There is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  There is.  I'm probably give it away, but there's some nice stuff.  Yeah, there's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_28
Transcript:  Are they enough like the over at the Emmys?  Not that kind of a gift bag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I don't have to worry about the Sopranos stealing my gift bag.  No, it's it's I think I'm getting a Morant 670 recorder like I don't have enough of those.  A pair of Sony headphones, something like that.  But I think it's the it's the it help a young blogger with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I'll help a young blonde.  I mean, blogger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yes, I will.  Yes.  No, I think it's a it's a I'm very honored.  I think it's great.  Doug Kay won the award last year, the first award.  And this is, you know, I feel bad.  I might give the money to Adam Curry, I think, you know.  But anyway, that's nice.  It's nice acknowledgement.  It'll be a lot of fun.  We didn't win any awards for our podcasts.  So I thought the podcasts weren't eligible for the awards next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  We were not eligible for the Podcast of the Year award.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  We were not.  But we were eligible in the categories.  And I think Security Now was nominated in technology, but did not win.  What would you say, Doug Kay, you've been podcasting longer than anybody on this panel,

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  longer than anybody except Christopher Lydon.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  What would you say is different this year about podcasting from years past?

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  I think, you know, last year, it was still new to everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_25
Transcript:  I think those of us who have been in it, I think what I'm seeing today is people who are  podcasters and have been podcasters and can be considered veteran podcasters.  A whole year.  I think that's it.  That's right.  I mean, some of us are here for the second time.  Wow.  You know, so I think it's I think at least for our little club of 2500 people, we are  mainstream.  It does feel like a club, though, because you see the same faces.  In fact, one of the things that kind of surprises me about this is a lot of people here

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  promoting their podcast to other podcasters.  And really, what we need to do is promote it to people who don't know about podcasting.  Right.  Right.  And that's, you know, I mean, it's great.  You want to get the word out.  But these are the last people that you'd probably say, hey, I have a podcast to.  Scott Borne, you also a longtime audio guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  In fact, you come from, as I do, and I think Doug, too, from Real Radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Scott was.  He's got that voice.  He does.  That radio.  Do the thing you were doing.  The he's a Scott Allen is that or Alan Scott.

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  Al Scott.  Al Scott.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  OLet's just hear a little bit of the Al Scott.  OK, we're gonna go back in time to the days of A course radio, and this is the Al Scott

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it.  Anybody from Indianapolis recognize that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  Yeah.  A couple of fans there, including Elvis Poultry.  You're from India, huh.  It would be your only excuse for dressing in a chicken suit and singing Elvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I got to tell you.  I never met anybody in a chicken suit in Indianapolis.  Well, you just have to go back.  Things have changed since the days of radio.  You were doing streaming radio before anybody.  Yeah.  In 1994, we launched a company called Net Radio.  We used real audio 1.0.  We delivered music to folks on 1200 baud modems, and it sounded like your Aunt Edna singing in a toilet.  But we had an IPO and made a lot of money and got away with it.  But, you know, we wanted to do what's going on now.  We'd have the bandwidth.  We didn't have anything like RSS.  We did deliver information on demand through a company called Pointcast, as you and I discussed last week.  You did Pointcast?  We did Pointcast.  We took Net Radio, attached it to Pointcast.  So technically, that was the first podcast if your criteria is audio delivered on demand, and that was done in 1994.  And if you don't use the word pod.  And you can't use the word pod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  So we gather together to talk about the news.  And Paul's here in a very timely way because on Friday, RC2 came out.  And it looks like we're very close to a final version of Vista.  Paul, you're running RC2 right now.  Yes, I am.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, first of all, if I drop off, that's why.  Wow, that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  You're actually in RC2 right now.  Yes, I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.  That's pretty good.  Not a lot of changes.  You know, as I have been telling people this weekend, I mean, there's one new icon and control panel.  And they colorized, maximized windows.  And that's about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Well, you wouldn't expect really much change from RC1 to RC2.  It's all about the bug count, isn't it?  It depends on how bad RC1 was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  RC1 was pretty good.  That's pretty good.  There's some compatibility stuff.  I noticed that Photoshop no longer throws up a compatibility window.  But nothing major.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  The story was that you said when we were on Windows Weekly, October 15th.  Now they're saying October 25th is kind of their drop dead date for ready to manufacture.  And according to, and I don't know if this is accurate.  Maybe you can confirm it.  I think it was Tector.  They said that to get to RTM, you have to get 500 or fewer bugs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that was actually in something I wrote earlier this week.  Yeah.  They, I got a bunch of internal emails this week, which was kind of nice.  But basically they went from something like 2,500 bugs at the end of September to 1,500 bugs about a week ago.  And they need to get down to 500 to get into the RTM tree, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  And most of those bugs are cosmetic, I would imagine.  In Ed Bott's Microsoft Report at zdnet.com, taking a look at the Windows Vista team blog.  And now at the license terms for Windows Vista.  And come up with some pretty kind of stunning things.  I think the one that is most annoying is that you can only move it once.  If you buy a new computer, you can move it to that new computer once, but the second time, no.  And you also can only sell it once.  It can't be resold after that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  And also it's going to cause some major problems if you are a heavy upgrader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Well, yeah, because you can only reinstall once.  Yeah.  I mean, most people buy computers with Windows installed.  But for those who build their own, this is a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You know, my experience with Microsoft, I'm not going to...  I hate to take this...  I'm not a big fan of this concept either.  But my experience with Microsoft over the years with these upgrades or moving the operating system  or putting in a new hard disk or whatever is, you know, you do get the error message  and they give you an 800 number to call.  I think it's going to change, John, because of this new Windows Genuine Advantage thing, you know?  Well, maybe.  But in the past, you used to be able to call them up and explain what you were doing.  And they'd say, OK, whatever, and they'd give you a code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think that's going to happen this time.  Kind of a great story, I think. Good news for the good guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_23
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really interesting. I've been following this story for a while.  Apparently, Logan Airport has a four-pay Wi-Fi service where you have to pay some amount,  maybe a range of T-Mobile or somebody.  But Continental Airlines was offering a free Wi-Fi service in their lounge for their customers.  And Logan came along and said, You can't set this equipment up because it interferes with our equipment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  It interferes with our right to make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_23
Transcript:  That's right. That was really the bottom line.  But they were claiming that because they were the property holder,  that they had the ability to control the wireless, the unlicensed band,  well, licensed in a broadway band of what Wi-Fi is,  they had they claimed that they had the right to control that.  And it was clearly seen as just a money grab.  But the larger, more important issue is, you know,  what really are the rights someone has to broadcast and receive in these so-called unlicensed bands?  So what did the FCC rule?  From the recent posting, apparently, FCC did in fact side with Continental.  They said that Continental had the right to set up their own wireless  as long as they were complying with the FCC's rules.  In other words, the FCC claimed jurisdiction over the Wi-Fi signals in that building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  And there are actually very few rules over this 2.4 gigahertz band.  That's an unregulated band. That's why Wi-Fi is on that band in the first place.  Speaking of, you know, Dell is a sponsor on this program.  I don't know if Dell pays President Bush.  I know that Michael Dell is a supporter of President Bush.  You know where I'm going with this, Molly.  Yes, indeed.  I want to play a little clip of it for you of the president's remarks  in which he essentially plugged Dell.  But do you think it was a... Do you know what I'm talking about, John?  Have you seen this video? You probably put it on your blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, I didn't put it on the blog. I'm familiar with it.  And there's actually some... It's some sort of a violation, by the way,  to do this kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  He says people will be watching it on their Dell televisions.  He says, oh, I meant to say televisions, but I started saying tele...  And then I stopped and I said...

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Although, when you watch the video, I watched it a couple of times  just to make sure because it was so odd.  And I actually had it on in my office live and remembered turning around going,  did he just say... What?  It doesn't seem like a stutter.  It doesn't really seem like he starts to say televisions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me play a little bit of it.  It's tough in a time of war when people see carnage on their Dell television screens.  The amazing thing about this...

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  That sure sounds like Dell television screens, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  It's absolutely deliberate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  Well, on the other hand, it sounds like maybe he went to say a curse word  starting with D.  Damn television screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You know, Dell is a big company out in Texas.  Dell's in Austin.  They give a lot of money. Michael Dell is a big Bush supporter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When people see carnage on their Dell television screens, the amazing...  That sure sounds like Dell television screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_29
Transcript:  All of the mail I've gotten this week is about personal audio players  says simply, does the new little shuffle sound as good as the old shuffle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  It does too, doesn't it?  That's one of the things you've done that I really like is  you've tested the audio on these.  I know you like the old iPods. The shuffle's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_29
Transcript:  The shuffle is superb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  The first shuffle was the best of all of them, right?  Yes, absolutely.  And the new one is as good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_29
Transcript:  Yeah.  They're using the same technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  So shrinking it didn't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_29
Transcript:  Shrinking it helps because they can't put the evil capacitors in there  that they put in the regular iPods.  And no one, no audio engineer, no electronic designer that I've spoken with  can figure out why Apple took the low road on the other iPods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  What does the capacitor do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_29
Transcript:  Well, the capacitors are... They're coupling capacitors.  And basically the signal that comes out charges the capacitor  and your headphones discharge the capacitor.  And that's how the sound gets from the transistors inside to your ears.  And if you make those capacitors too small,  they discharge too quickly on the bass notes.  And that's just simple electronic physics.  So it sounds like a... instead of a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  Instead of a...  The creator of China's largest pornographic website jailed for life on Wednesday, according to Sin Hua.  I'm going to put a stop to it.  He handed down life sentences to this guy and then  terms of 13 months to 10 years to 8 others  convicted of profiting from pornographic dissemination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They should be given these guys awards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  They should be given... No!  China's always whining about population control and we need fewer people.  Great! Let them view porn and sit in dark corners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think that deserves a memo, Patrick.  You should send one to the Chinese Ministry of Culture immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  This is quite an amazing site.  Apparently, according to Sin Hua again,  the site contained more than 9 million pornographic images and articles.  That can't be right.  Why not?  The police said 9 million?  You got a billion people? Labor's cheap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Somebody could put together iPods for $60 for like 50 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  You know what I think...  It's a miserable place to work.  I think it was a 9 megabyte file.  And they thought it was 9 million pictures.  Any thoughts from the panel on that?  Is Microsoft, Andy, is Microsoft an innovator or a fraud?

Speaker: SPEAKER_27
Transcript:  No, they're following...  I mean, all you have to do is look at the Zune.  I mean, the Zune is a big fat disaster.  And they didn't even do it well.  They didn't even copy the iPod well.  They did it badly.  So this is a classic example of Microsoft following what they know best  and missing the boat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I played a clip on the Windows Weekly a couple of days ago from Ferguson,  the guy who hosts the Late Late Show on the CBS.  He's talking about the Zune.  And he says, the Zune, it's Microsoft's attempt to beat Microsoft in the iPod market.  To beat the iPod in the iPod market.  He said, it's five years late.  It was funnier than that.  There were some jokes in there.  I'm just synopsizing.  But the Zune is a good example of something that's not an innovation,  except for a couple of things.  Is Wi-Fi music sharing?  That's innovative.  I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_27
Transcript:  I don't know.  I mean, and then I look at Vista, which kind of looks like, you know, Mac OS X.  Yeah, good point.  What do you think, Jeremy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I mean, you've followed Microsoft longer than anybody, probably.  Well, I think they do both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_24
Transcript:  Clear Type certainly was important.  It made it comfortable to write books on computers when it wasn't.  I love it.  Especially LCDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  It made a huge difference.  So the big story of the week, which just came out a few hours before we convened this,  Time Magazine has declared the person of the year, ladies and gentlemen, is you.  No, not you, John.  No, no, no, no.  Not you, Steve.  No, you.  The other you.  Yeah, you.  I thought we should maybe say it's yous guys.  Yous guys.  Not that.  The you listening audience.  But you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  That's assuming that there's no digital divide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_28
Transcript:  I just keep thinking if Time's goal is to have a digital divide,  Time's goal is the event of the year for the six billion people on the planet,  or is it, I still think it's a fantastic selection, though.  It's a fantastic idea to pick it.  Well, you guys can debate this in a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Let me just explain what they're talking about.  They're talking about user-generated content.  The subtitle is, Yes, You.  This is a little bit like a commercial.  Yes, you.  You control the information age.  Welcome to your world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I thought they controlled the horizontal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  You control the vertical.  Lev Grossman writing this, he says, he pulls up Thomas Carlisle.  This is typical Time magazine overheated prose,  but eventually says that it's not the great man who makes the difference in the world today.  Our collective destiny is shaped by all of us.  Blogs, Wikipedia, he uses as an example, YouTube, MySpace.  He's saying the fact that we're reviewing books on Amazon.com  and getting together in Second Life.  This is Web 2.0.  It's about social networking.  Hey, David works for Revision 3, which is Digg.  I think Digg is a very, I don't, they didn't mention Digg,  but Digg's a very good example of the you they're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You know what it is, these guys wimped out.  They couldn't figure out who to make person of the year.
