Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that what you're saying?  You didn't know that?  Which of you has horror grammar?  I'm a hologram.  Anyway, it's great to get you back on.  I love following you on path because Ohm travels like crazy.  And you were in India, I know.  And just fun to watch, fun to follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Come back.  Good tea though.  There was great tea.  Oh, I bet.  Yeah.  I went to New York after that, Seattle.  It was fun.  It's been a good travel year for me.  What are you looking for Ohm?  I'm looking for inspiration.  And did you find it?  A little bit.  I think the more interesting way to think about technology is to look outside technology.  And I go to all these places looking for that.  And I come back very refreshed and with a fresh perspective on things.  You know, if you live in Silicon Valley too long, you start smoking the air which we have here and start believing and start believing what is essentially Silicon Valley trying to solve Silicon Valley's problems.

Start time: 349.14
End time: 354.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 355.31
End time: 356.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow, what a concept.  Yeah.

Start time: 357.20

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you do a very good job of that, Leo.  I think it's just very nice to see the show and still not feel that it's inside.  It's the challenge.

Start time: 374.59
End time: 431.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One of the reasons I didn't move to San Francisco is because San Francisco really is.  Like you go down everywhere you go.  You go to McDonald's and there's a guy talking about his B round of funding.  And here it's a little bit more, you know, while we talk about cows and eggs.  The butter and eggs.  I want to invite you all the butter and eggs day parade is coming up next weekend.  And if you're in town, it's a wonderful little parade.  It's Petaluma is such a small town that everybody in town is actually in the parade.  Wow.  But the way they handle that so that somebody's watching is you lead the parade and then it goes around in a circle.  And then you sit down and you watch the next people that come around so that everybody gets to be in the parade and watch the parade.  And it's a wonderful family time for all.  There we go.  It's really good.  It's you remember the beginning of Blue Velvet, the slow motion fire truck going by.  Sure.

Start time: 432.00
End time: 435.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just like that minus the gas mask and Robert Duvall.

Start time: 436.36
End time: 444.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does the parade have an app, Leo?  It should.  You know, Petaluma, there's no we don't have apps here.  We should have a butter and eggs app.  Why don't we have an app?  That's a great idea.

Start time: 445.16
End time: 449.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The butter can talk to the eggs about their series be around the funding.  Exactly.

Start time: 451.24
End time: 462.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One of the things in the echo chamber we talked about for several weeks now is that billion dollar Instagram purchase.  That felt very bubbly.  Didn't it?  What did that feel like to real people?  I mean, what do they think?

Start time: 463.20
End time: 532.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think there is an interesting after effect of that deal, which is going to happen is a lot more people will be moving to San Francisco.  Yeah.  Because it's the you know, it's like the firing gun has been shot.  The starting gun has been fired so people can come here and start companies.  And essentially, you know, I think the way I thought of Instagram is why I think a lot of mainstream people saw Instagram.  They saw it as a way to start in your own reality TV show.  Right.  Essentially, you create your own reality and you follow all these people.  You talk to them.  It just is essentially a reflection of our modern society.  And that's why it took off and it got a 30 million people only on iPhone, which is quite, quite astonishing.  So I think from that perspective, it's a pretty it is an interesting company on the valuation.  I mean, geez, when you are talking about people like Mark Zuckerberg with a hundred billion dollar Facebook, it just is a rounding error.  So bubbly or not, I don't know.  Right.  Also with us, Justin Robert Young.

Start time: 533.04
End time: 543.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

End time: 582.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The new one is Andrew Maine Stories, the podcast, which I read audio book style.  A new Andrew Maine, a new Andrew Maine short story every week.  And that's going really cool.  And yeah, that's that's the Weird Things site right there for anybody watching live.

Start time: 583.06
End time: 599.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've been reading Public Enemy Zero on my Kindle.  That is heart stopping.  Yeah. Yeah.  Holy cow. That has the best.  You know, I thought for a long time Snow Crash was the best first chapter ever written.  Wow.  I'm not saying Snow Crash yet, but it's close.  It gets your heart pumping.

Start time: 599.24
End time: 622.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll tell you what.  So I'm actually Andrew's not watching live because he's in Italy right now, but he's going to be very excited to hear you say that.  That's great.  No, it's super cool.  And that book is actually you can download for free on podcast.  I read the entire audio book version of that that you can get on iTunes or buy it uninterrupted at AndrewMaine.com.  Slash books.  But listen to that better, you know, like not exactly Snow Crash, but close.

Start time: 623.00
End time: 623.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It must have been fun to read.

Start time: 624.32
End time: 628.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 629.04
End time: 645.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So let's see.  Microsoft's numbers are out.  I don't know.  Gosh, it seems like it's a lot of us don't even want to talk about stuff like that.  But we've got such great inspiring people here.  And I'm talking about quarterly results for Mike.  They had a good they had a good quarter.

Start time: 647.56
End time: 665.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They had a good quarter largely based on their enterprise.  But what was kind of surprising about that was what had been the shining star last year, which was Connect and the entertainment division was flat.  And there was a lot of enterprise money in this one in advance of Windows 8, which is also kind of interesting.

Start time: 665.67
End time: 683.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Now, of course, Windows.  This always happens right before a new Windows comes out, which is there's a pause.  There's almost like everybody in the PC industry holds their breath.  Nobody buys anything waiting for the next version of Windows.  So maybe we won't see that in this quarter, but the quarter that we're in right now might see that.

Start time: 684.24
End time: 715.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But boy, it was interesting about about Windows 8 is that right now we're kind of in the upswing of the cycle of people moving off of XP.  You know, businesses have not leapt to XP.  Now they move it off of XP.  That's three versions ago.  I know. I know.  And so I don't know necessarily that businesses are going to move to Windows 8.  I can tell you right now they ain't.  Now, this is the this is the migration now for businesses and Windows 8 will be consumer if it sells at all.  If at all. Right.

Start time: 717.22
End time: 719.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why is it not attractive to enterprise?

Start time: 720.98
End time: 745.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because it's a tablet operating system on a desktop computer.  I don't even it baffles me that Microsoft.  Now, I like it, by the way, because it's kind of cool and fun and I kind of like the interface.  But it's going to drive businesses crazy because they don't want cool and fun.  They want productivity. They want a desktop.  They want everything to look like it did in Windows 7 or actually Windows XP.  I finally got a chance to put it on a tablet.

Start time: 746.24
End time: 815.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had tried it at the build conference in September and they made the press give the tablets back before we left.  And I got a chance to install it this week again on a tablet with the consumer bill.  What do you think?  And it's much better. It's much better on a tablet.  But the problem with it is that it really forces you tablet or a desktop to keep going back to the Metro interface.  And I think if people just want to use Excel and Word and the traditional versions of desktop software, they are not going to have any need for Windows 8.  You know, if they're not interested in Metro, they're just going to leave it aside.  And right now, there's not that much that's compelling about Metro.  I think the transition when you make the shift in the operating system from desktop to Metro is a little jarring.  And some of the things I've heard kind of on the side from Microsoft about what they're working on as they run up to the Gold Master will address that.  But I still think forcing people to use that Metro interface when what they want to do is use the desktop is going to backfire on them, similar to kind of the way Vista did, I think, a little bit.

Start time: 816.84
End time: 838.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Meanwhile, though, $17.41 billion in revenue, 6% up, $5 billion in profit.  It was a very good quarter for them. And this waiting for all of their newer products, Windows 8, Office 15, Windows Phone has not been, I don't think, added too much, as you said, to the overall.

Start time: 840.33

Start time: 851.53

Start time: 852.14
End time: 854.30

Transcript:  It used to be the big story, right? What's Windows going to be?

Start time: 855.12
End time: 921.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think, you know, there's a lot of people who care about Windows 8. I just don't happen to be one of them.  So I'd be wrong in giving any kind of opinion about it.  I have seen it and I've used it and I think it'll be a great tablet environment.  I just think it will be pretty awesome for a tablet environment.  I have not experienced any productivity.  I will make just a random observation, which has got nothing to do with Windows, is that more and more of my computing time has been siphoned off by my iPad and my iPhone.  It could have been like Android devices if they were, you know, I had those, but it just is the tablet and the phone have taken more of my compute cycles.  And so the computer itself is reduced to, you know, doing the video conversation with you right now and basically writing those long form posts,  even those I don't do anymore on the computer.

Start time: 923.12
End time: 931.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's for heavy lifting, but you know what? Skype on the iPad is actually great. I don't even Skype on the desktop anymore. It's great on the iPad.

Start time: 938.90
End time: 945.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The one thing about Windows 8 is they do seem like they announced this week that they're simplifying the versions that they're coming out with.

Start time: 946.28
End time: 950.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are four SKUs. That was the big announcement is they're going to do. Thank God they did this.

Start time: 952.62
End time: 975.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If it's going to be a consumer operating system, if it's not going to super appeal to enterprise, then it makes sense to kind of not make it the, you know, Windows agriculture edition.  You know, Windows, if you have four to five kids, you know, like to just have a very it's not as simple as let's say what Apple does where they just released a OS and you put the OS on or you don't have it on.

Start time: 975.48
End time: 1013.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's close to it. There's Windows 8.  Windows 8 and then there's Windows 8 Pro, which is the business version.  And then there's Windows 8 Enterprise, which is even more. Actually, that has to do with the licensing more than the capabilities.  Yeah. And then there's Windows 8 China. Yes. CN.  Windows RT. Yeah. Oh, I forgot RT, which is the tablet.  Now that is the worst name I can think of. I call it Windows Retweet.  Yes. What would you what?  When this is guaranteeing that no one will be able to find Windows 8 when they search for it, the tablet.

Start time: 1013.28
End time: 1059.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And and it won't run the Windows RT won't run any legacy desktop apps, except for the ones that ship with Windows.  So like it'll run notepad. Right. But it's basically Metro Metro Metro. Right. Right.  And it will also I just read a piece today. It won't work with Active Directory.  So if you're thinking about bringing it into work and handing it to your IT guy and say here, hook this up to our domain, it won't do it.  And it won't do it the same. The the X86, the traditional tablets, the Intel based tablets won't do it the same way that the desktop version will either.  They have to use something called Intune, which will let it connect.  So it you know, it's not even necessarily going to be all that friendly in the enterprise.

Start time: 1059.70
End time: 1075.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We should explain for the Mac users in the audience that Metro does not mean it gets many petties and buys its shoes.  Yes, it does. Tootsie Plohoun.  It means that it's that kind of the zoom crisscrossy.  It's that tablet interface. Yeah.

Start time: 1078.57

End time: 1108.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, what a terrible name. What is wrong with Capri pants?  So am I.  What is wrong with that Microsoft that they call this, which I think is probably their greatest hope, given that the iPad has got to be killing them.  They're the Windows RT, which, by the way, it already has there already is a Windows RT.  That's the core services.  Windows is the Windows runtime. Right.

Start time: 1109.30

They chose the name no one liked, hated, no one owned  because it was the only thing politically they could do.  That's what it sounds like to me.  Random thought. Windows random thought. I like that.  A certain RT that I can't say.  I got to get your opinion guys. We're going to take a break.  When we come back I got to get your opinion on what the FBI just did  because I can tell you in the real world it's making people nuts.  And there are now articles in every mainstream journal saying  your internet may stop working July 9th.  And this is making people nuts and I think it was reprehensible to the FBI  but I want to get you to tell me because I may be completely wrong.  No they did not order hookers. That was another story entirely.

Transcript:  Please do not confuse your federal agents.  But first, thank you chat room.  But first I want to talk a little bit about stamps.com.  Speaking of federal, you can buy your own postage, print your own postage.  Now there are people who probably think that you're going to go to jail  like if you printed your own money.  But no, you can actually use your computer and your printer  without special links, without a postage meter.  You can actually print stamps.  I did it the other day. I've got my envelope in the other room.  It's so cool because we use stamps.com.  Stamps.com, I want you to check it out at stamps.com.  It's Windows or Mac. It lets you print your own postage.  It lets you basically bring the post office to your desk.  You never have to go to the post office again.  You print the postage. You put it on a package or envelope.  You could postcard anything.  They've even got, and they'll give it to you for free while shipping and handling,  a scale that's a USB scale that you pop it on there.  The software sees the scale, says exactly what the postage is, prints it out.  If you're mailing internationally, I'm sure,  when you want to send a letter to your mom,  it's a pain to mail something to India because you've got to go to the post office,  get international stamps and fill out forms.  This does that all automatically. You don't have to go to the post office.  You've got discounts the post office cannot offer, will not offer,  on express mail and priority mail, up to 21% on express mail, 15% on priority mail.  You don't even have to go to the post office with the packages.  They come and get it.  You just call them or the mail carrier on his regular rounds will come and get it.  It's a pretty good deal, I've got to say.  Here's the special offer, a one-month trial,  and they've thrown in some sweeteners to make this good.  But you've got to do this right because normally it's an $80 offer.  You see that $110 offer?  The way you get there is by clicking that retro radio microphone in the corner,  as seen in The Hunger Games. Click that.  Give it in for the kids, Leo.  That's just for the kids.  Yeah.  You know that, The Hunger Games microphone? Click that one.  And then enter the offer code TWIT, and you'll go right here to this page that I'm seeing,  and you get $55 in postage coupons.  Now, I've got to tell you, people say, wait a minute, that's not all at once.  No, not all at once. They spread it out over like four or five months.  So it's not like I'm going to give you $55 in postage.  You just spread it out, but it is free.  You get the digital scale for free. You pay shipping and handling.  You get the supplies kit, and you get the four-week trial.  And this is such a great trial offer. I want you to do it,  and I promise you will never go back to going to the post office again.  Stamps.com. Offer code for this is TWIT.  Make sure you click The Hunger Microphone in the upper right-hand corner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you know where I'm going on this.  You know where I'm going on this.  So in November, the FBI, in conjunction with Estonian police, arrested this wild group of people,  these Estonian virus authors, that had been, since 2007, they're putting malware out called DNS changer  that would infect computers, I think 4 million computers over the five-year period.  And what it would do, among other things, it would change your DNS settings  so that you would go through their malicious DNS server and they would do things like inject ads into your web pages.  Apparently they made $4 million on these injected ads over the five...  Was it 4 million or was it more than that, actually?  It was several million dollars a year.  I think 14 million.  14 million dollars over that period of time.  Really?  They would also, but sometimes they'd send you to spam sites.  And in fact, they could do other things.  Among other things, what they did is they turned off antivirus updates and they turned off Windows updates  so that if you had this malware on your system, very likely you'd get other malware  because your system would never be updated or protected again.  So when the FBI arrested these guys, and this is where I kind of get a little funny, I'm curious what you think,  they went to the ICS and they said,  would you take over the IP addresses for these servers  and continue to serve proper domain name resolves through these servers?  And so for, what is it, since November, even if you had this malware, your system worked...  Well, this part of your system worked fine. You got DNS worked.  You didn't get any of the...  The other stuff still happened, but your DNS worked fine.  Now, the Internet Systems Consortium says, well, it's costing us money,  so we're going to turn these servers off on July 9th.  And they put out a big press release and every newspaper in the country,  and I bet the Houston Chronicle, has this big story that says,  for hundreds of thousands of people, the Internet will stop working July 9th.  So tell me your story.

Transcript:  So this went up on our website, the front of our website on Friday night,  and I started getting emails from readers who were asking if our site had been hacked  and a malicious story posted, and should they actually click on a link  that takes them to an FBI site that will scan their computer?  People were so freaked out about this...  I'd be freaked out.  ...that they didn't believe it was real.  It doesn't sound real. What was the eff...  Alright, go ahead.  Right, so I looked at the story, and it's an Associated Press story,  and the writer is a real writer, and to be safe, and I got a little nervous,  I clicked on it on my iPad and went over to the site, and sure enough,  my iPad was not infected.  Yeah, of course not.  And it is legit, but the way the site looks, the way the whole theme of it  sounds like a scam, and you would almost think if the FBI was going to do this,  was going to essentially try to make sure that Internet service continued for these people,  that at least it would try to do it in a way that didn't look like a scam itself.  Look at this.  It was very suspect.

Doesn't this seem like, on the face of it, the FBI is not really doing the right thing by keeping these servers alive?  The thing that they should do is tell people how to get rid of this software.  There's other larger issues because these people have this malware.  They almost certainly have lots of other malware in their system.  That there's all other things going on.  Why did the FBI decide to use these phony servers and then decide to pull the plug July 9th?  It doesn't sound right to me.

Now the government-sponsored blackout is the story.  Then they try to keep it alive.  They realize that it's costing them too much money.  Now they're in a position where they have to do what they probably should have done at the beginning anyway.

Transcript:  Then meanwhile, there's just really no effective way that they can communicate in a clear, open, and honest way with the public.  Everything is clunky on their website.  They don't have a good enough surrogate to explain this in clear, plain language.  This is why podcasts like this incites writers like Omendt White are important to explain this to the laypeople,  which are really the ones who are at most risk for this.  In fact, they didn't have no idea what the hell was happening.

We've gone on a world tour to meet all the normal people in the world.  I just worry about normal people and what they must think when they see this.

End time: 1951.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the worst possible headline because it completely misses the point.  Right.  If you are infected...  Now, this is actually a fairly minor infection now.  There were four million computers.  It's just a few hundred thousand.  There are far bigger...  Even this Mac malware hit many more computers than that.  So it's just very strange.  I think a lot of people, millions of people are scared that should never have been worried.  And the people who should be worried never got the information they should have gotten on the first place.

Start time: 1951.06
End time: 1988.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also, in a lot of cases, many of the infected machines like this,  if people haven't been updating their systems and don't run antivirus by way,  a lot of that stuff is on pirated machines running in China and in Eastern Europe.  And so my suspicion is that a lot of the machines that are having their DNS properly redirected are not necessarily legitimate machines.  There probably aren't that many in people's homes.  So when they turn it off, it may not actually affect that many legitimate users.

But when the US government unilaterally decides to,  well, you know what, we'll take over those servers.  We'll run them for a little while.  Don't worry about it.  That really worries me.  There's a little bit too much willingness in our federal government here in the United States  to kind of intervene in a kind of blunt-handed, blunt way with the Internet.  It started with SOPA.  This reminds me of the same kind of attitude.  Is there a question of who else would do it?  Nobody should do it.  They should do what Dwight said.  They should arrest the people and shut down the botnet and move on and let the normal process happen.  It bothers me that the FBI was handling these redirections for five months.

If you look at the data, people want to buy two kinds of phones.  One is Android phones, and the other people want to buy the iPhone.  And just to kind of jam another operating system on these people is going to be really tough.  So, like, the Windows phone doesn't do anything different or new.  And that's the problem.  It can't stand out.  Just the tiles are not enough for it to stand out.  That's the key thing.  It is, oh, we can be the third option.  Well, why do you need three options?  Right.

They're not saying, oh, but there's something new in town.  We say, oh, it's new, I got to try it.  Well, the one thing I think that is a normal person selling point is the price.

People see their friends use Android, they want to buy a Samsung.  Essentially, that's how people normally behave.  That's how fashion trends start.

So you're saying we're halfway in?  We're halfway in.  Of course, I don't think it'll ever be 100%, but Microsoft sees an opportunity there.  I think Microsoft also believes, and I'm not sure that I agree with it, that there's this longing to have an end-to-end experience from the phone to your desktop to the tablet.  And that's...  We go back to Windows 8.  That's why Windows 8 looks like it does.  And in fact, developers who write software for Windows Phone can just tweak the code a little bit and it runs on Metro, on the Metro UI.  So they're trying to kind of get back to that holy grail that they initially tried to get to with their original Windows...  What was their...  Windows Mobile and Windows CE or Wince.  And they're trying to get back to that holy grail of making one operating system that crosses over.  I don't think they'll do it.  But they think that the simplicity of it, the live tiles out on the home screen, being able to see your Facebook notifications and everything out on the home screen is simpler and is different enough that people will flock to it.  I don't know that that's true, but that's their strategy and that's what they're thinking.

Like they should, you know, they should have been calling this the Skype phone.  Oh, that would have been smart.  Just call it the damn Skype phone.  They own Skype?  Yeah. And keep it simple.

So they're already losing SMS traffic to Facebook and iMessage and things like that, the over the air services.  So why not just build a carrier class as Skype experience in which everybody's happy.  Right. So the carriers make money making intra, you know, like going from Skype to landlines or other phones.  You charge for that.  You charge for international calls, you know, but, you know, they just needed to completely radical rethink here.  And I think they have a good asset in Skype.  Skype has a brand presence.  It is a smart product, you know, even though the UI is currently very bad, but it's still they can do a lot more like they can create.  I think they did a good job with Zoom.

They want a feature phone.  They don't want a smartphone.  You know where Microsoft, again, had an opportunity?  The Kin was a perfect halfway between smartphone and flip phone.  And that lasted like a week.  Two weeks.  It literally lasted a week.  They didn't know how to market it at all.  The problem is they had none of the features of a smartphone,  but it had all the price of a smartphone.  They were charging data plans for it.  But if they had not done that, it had messaging.  It had, you know, there was a keyboard one.  It had a cute little camera.  It was cute.

That's made out of liquid metal.  But now they can make a whole phone out of it.  Now, it's not really liquid, but it is metal, right?  One would assume, sure.  It's an alloy of, get ready folks, and please, if you're a mineralogist or metalurgist,  just live with this because I'm going to do the best I can.

And you know, it is true if you're going to do...  They say that Apple's doing this tick-tock development cycle  where every other iPhone is a big upgrade because they want to give you the two years to get used to it.  So the 3G, 3GS are pretty much the same in the 4. Boom!  And then the 4 and the 4 is pretty much the same.  And then the 5, or whatever they call this next one. Boom!  That'll be a big one.

It's fairly lightweight.  They basically make it like they would make plastic. They mold it with injection molding.  But yet you get metal. It sounds great.  And Apple actually has used it before. They have some experience with it.

Transcript:  I mean, this seems like the way that Apple does things.  They build up a component advantage and they build up a manufacturing advantage.  And then they try to leverage that against every other competitor.  To me, the most exciting thing about this that we have yet to see is exactly what this does  in terms of their capabilities to make the phone thinner and lighter.  And if they can use less material to give it a strong quality build,  maybe that changes the form factor in a significant way past what the 4 and the 4S have been.

He wanted just solid...literally, which is a terrible idea, a solid glass wall.  And he pushed Corning, I don't know who it was, I presume it was Corning, to make it bigger and bigger.  And they finally got bigger...they actually replaced the panes. They got bigger and bigger panes.  Even though everybody said, this is dangerous.  This is a terrible idea.  Because he didn't want any bezel.  So I could see, absolutely, I could see Steve Jobs saying, we're going to create this.  We're going to get...vest heavily in this. We're going to make this happen.

You understand, just like you understand your kids better than anybody else is the same thing.  And I think if Zuckerberg felt that he needed to have Instagram  and basically make a big play for mobile and all these other things,  which are happening around in the web, he needed to buy that.  And if it took a billion dollars, so be it.  Because essentially 70 percent of it is stock and, you know, 300 million is in cash.  So, but the reality of today's Internet is that, you know,  the one commodity you don't have as a successful big company is time.  So if you lose the time advantage, you don't come back.  Look at Motorola, you know, still struggling.  You look at, you know, Microsoft itself on mobile, still struggling.  Grim. Because, you know, the market moves so much faster.  Our world has gotten so much faster.  So from that standpoint, I think you can you I mean, I'm not trying to, you know,  either defend or denigrate the deal.  But I think there is a certain different kind of action which is required  to run a company in today's time.  And I think Zuckerberg did absolutely the right thing.  I think the other the other thing is the IPO.  And I wrote about this about six, seven months ago.  And the news first came out.  This is the this is going to start an 18 month cycle of sustained,  you know, investment activity and, you know, euphoria in the valley.  But there's a lot of people who are going to make a lot of money from this.  And they're going to leave Facebook and they're going to go become angel investors  or do other things.  And Facebook will have to replace those people with more people.  So they will hire people at higher salaries or they'll start buying these tiny  companies to fill out their ranks.  And this is going to create a flywheel effect.  So just it's pretty likely that you're going to see this thing escalate a little bit.  You want to call it bubble or you want to call it, you know, euphoria or you want to  call it whatever it is, it is going to happen.  I mean, it's like it's only a matter of time.  And the IPO is just just probably another another marker for that.

We had the same thing with with the with the with the real estate market, right?  Like must be somebody told somebody, hey, I bought this house for 100,000 and flipped  it for 250.  Look how much money I made.  And next thing you know, everybody else is doing it.  And it's the same thing.  You don't know quite when you know how this will go.

Sometimes, you know, one of the cases to be made for a bubble, you could point to the  Internet bubble of 1990s and ended in 2000, is that a lot of all of the money that was  funneled from investors into the Internet economy created a huge amount of infrastructure  that this second wave took advantage of took advantage of things like fiber in the ground  and and so forth and made it possible for us to be in this situation.  You know, and in what generally doesn't happen is while you may have some ramping up like  this, you generally don't have a second bubble.  I don't think right on the heels.  Of course, we're in the first bubble, unusual situation.

And if it pulls back at a certain point and we know the bill comes due on dumb decisions,  as happened with real estate, as happened with a lot of the spending in the late 90s and early 2000s,  then that happens.

Transcript:  Go ahead, Om.  Sorry.  I think the key there are two things to remember, right?  Like I was there during the 90s bubble and it was very different because we didn't really have a commercial internet base.  Like we didn't really have that many people.  All these things they used to talk about can really make a lot of sense because there wasn't a big enough market.  Now you look at just let's just look at mobile.  Two years ago, Instagram didn't exist.  And in less than two years, it had 30 million people using the service.  A year ago, a company called Ridley didn't exist.  And now it's number one video app on iOS.  So the velocity of the Internet has increased.  So has the size and scope of it.  Right.  So to you know, it's really hard to say whether this will become a bubble or it will, you know, it will be a normal situation because we don't quite know because this is all very, very new.  Like it's the history can only teach us not to make mistakes.  But we don't know what the future looks like because there's all new mistakes can be made.  Absolutely.  And the scale we are playing at is very different.  Right.  The scale of the Internet is so much more bigger.  Now, like we have, you know, almost a billion people using wired connections to connect to the Internet, almost a billion, you know, mobile Internet connection.  So that's a lot of people on the Internet.  And so that that's why, you know, I hesitate to use the phrase bubble because I don't know.  You know, does it feel like, you know, the some of the things we saw in 99?  Do we see the same things?  Absolutely.  Is it the same thing?  I can't tell.  I could tell in 99.  Right.  That things were not making sense because there wasn't a big enough market and everything we just everything was focused around the idea of investments and not building businesses.  At least for now, you see companies like Facebook trying to build a business and sizable business on top of that.

The key is the I do believe the effect of Instagram deal is is going to be more mainstream because the stories of Instagram have have appeared many times in The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, so many small papers.  My mom was asking me, so what does this Instagram do?  It's like, Mom, why are you even bothering with stuff like this?  Because it's a billion with a B.  And I think the word of that, that's the scary part.  It's not like, you know, the housing boom in Phoenix in near Phoenix or in Sacramento, where everybody else feels that it should be part of it.  I think there is a risk to that.  Right.  Happening. And I think let's see, you know, next couple of months are going to be interesting.

They won the lottery.  What I what I think the concern is, does this then cause this kind of irrational exuberance among others who say, wow, if Instagram is worth a billion, what is Pinterest worth or what is Viti worth or what is, you know, what are all these other companies that have no revenue?  Whereas I think when you look at Facebook, I think it's reasonable to say Facebook's worth.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook makes money.  They make a lot of money.  Yeah.  And one of the concerns I think about the bubble is, is that these huge valuations are going to companies that don't appear to have any business model other than to get acquired.  By the way, Mark Cuban got six billion for broadcast.

Transcript:  Right.  Right.  I just don't think, I just don't think that that it's sustainable.  And, you know, I agree with Ohm.  I think there's going to be an escalation, but it just doesn't seem to me that the lessons, you know, you could make an argument that Instagram is the pets.com of rights of its day.  Right.  But, but that said, it does have this 30 million user base.

Start time: 3838.05
End time: 3842.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And every one of those users was already a Facebook user.  I mean, they didn't, they didn't gain any new users.

Start time: 3843.22
End time: 3897.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, but, but I think what they did do is Facebook has been very good at trying to keep ahead of what the coming trend is.  They don't want to be like Google, where all of a sudden they find themselves 18 miles behind in social.  And they don't want to be like MySpace that, you know, found them, you know, were napping when Facebook took them over, you know, overtook them in terms of users and influence.  So if they see mobile is the future, if they see we don't want to lose our stranglehold on when people think about taking pictures with their phones and posting them somewhere, then Instagram is a very important target for them.  And if it had gone to, let's say, Google so they can fold it into Google+, that would have filled in a big hole for that competing social network where photo uploading is never done and is really kind of non-existent.  So I think it is, you know, it's them trying to stay relevant, trying to stay ahead of the, ahead of the game.

Transcript:  There was a story in the New York Times this week, an essay in which basically I forget who the author was, but it basically said that what you know, forget about Facebook and forget about the acquisition of Instagram.  There is something else percolating out there that the next new thing Facebook was trying to grab for it in its purchase of Instagram.  But mobile is OK.  We know about mobile.  There's something else that's going to happen.  There's a really telling essay, you know, presenting the idea that even this too shall be eclipsed.  And Facebook may have understood that when it was, or Zuckerberg may have understood that as part of the purchase.  But even this too will be over the hill at some point.  I think that's the story of Silicon Valley.  That's kind of what we're seeing here.  It's a pattern that repeats.  What was that line from Battlestar, Galactica?  All of this has happened before.  And it will happen again.

He's actually sold that for $80 million in 2005.  And he has a patent for a system he developed to generate domain name recognitions and recommendations  and then register the domain name.  So you say to the software, Chumbee.  And he goes, and it's got 20 names like that.

Start time: 4901.72

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's why I've always been nervous about whenever I search for a domain for like  a project, I won't search for it via whatever the registrar stuff is because that you can  that's kind of a trigger to say, yeah, they'll know that you're looking for that.  So you just you type in the URL and you just pray it doesn't load.

And you enter in a domain name and it's available, but you don't buy it.  You come back five minutes later and somebody's got it.  Yep.  And it's interesting how that always happens.  It's very weird.  Anyway, I tried to buy the URL, the Facebook.com.  The guy now averages 300 names a day at his company's called DomainMarket.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that this is...  Arrested Development is the big splashy thing.  They saved Arrested Development.  But I'll tell you what.  I think that they're really making a mistake because they announced this week...  Actually, I think it was...  One of the corporate leadership there announced that NAB or told somebody at NAB that their  philosophy is going to be released the entire season as they did with Lillahammer at once.  All at once.  Like Netflix.  So you can watch it all.

Start time: 5299.90
End time: 5306.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have to because that's the culture of Netflix.  You binge-consume shows.

Start time: 5306.52
End time: 5378.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's a horrible mistake.  Really?  Oh yeah.  You think they should parse it out?  Because like HBO, HBO doesn't necessarily care as much about viewership numbers.  They care about awards.  They care about press.  Because every time that they get an award, every time that they get press, it's a free  advertisement that HBO is something you should buy.  And you're constantly reminding people that this is something that you should be paying  money for.  Press to Development is a very beloved show that critics will give the benefit of the  doubt and will want to talk about and will create a significant internet buzz.  When they drop all 10 episodes, that buzz will last for three weeks.  If they released these 10 episodes over the course of 10 weeks, you would consistently  be talking about what the last episode was, what the next episode is going to be, and  you can spread that out and continue to get an advertising drive for people to be aware  of Netflix and think, well maybe I should subscribe to Netflix now.  It's the same reason why people advertise on the Twitter network.  Why Netflix advertises on the Twitter network?  Because they consistently on all the shows on the platform remind you, this is a thing,  this is a thing, this is a thing, you'll like this thing.  And I think they're really dropping the ball in putting it all out at once.

Start time: 5378.68
End time: 5395.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not sure I agree.  I think it's a new culture.  That's the old culture.  And the Netflix culture is you watch 24 hours and you watch every episode of season four,  Battlestar Galactica and one gigantic gulp.  Yes, but they're also dropping subscribers.

Start time: 5396.06
End time: 5425.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then you tell your friends and they tell your friends and watching all that takes a  lot of time.  And that's how Netflix has built its audiences really almost by word of mouth and those annoying  pop-up ads, pop-unders.  But this is how Netflix has won so far and I think that they are smart to continue dropping  it in this way.  They drop it all at once.  They will generate a lot of buzz and I think it will actually happen over time as more  and more people take the time to watch it.

Start time: 5747.90
End time: 5791.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah?  Original programming.  That's the new...  That's the wave of the future.  And it's only going to be a couple years before when we saw movie stars...  The lines between a movie star doing a television show was sort of broken down about five or  six years ago and you started to see guys like Gary Sinise or people that were otherwise...  Doing TV.  Yeah, Laurence Fishburne doing television.  You're going to start to see, especially because these stars have enough money to fund the  budgets and be producers on web content shows, I think you're going to see more and more  that these are going to be viable places where real acting talent and writing talent and  directing talent will come to get original visions out to people that want to see them.

Start time: 5791.22
End time: 5823.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But there's a risk here because remember Hulu was originally started to take network programming  from NBC, Fox and others and put it on the internet because these guys couldn't figure  it out.  Well, they were investors and so this was their idea and now they're kind of competing,  aren't they, with these companies?  Hulu, I didn't realize this, $8 a month, very similar to Netflix streaming.  Yeah, but you have to have ads.  You watch ads on Hulu.  And it's 2 million subscribers though.  That's a good number.  What is Netflix?  Does it say?  We can find that out.  It's got to be more than 2 million.  24 million.  24 million, that sounds better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not in my crystal ball.  I see on my iPad a lot of television and I don't really make any difference in what kind  of television I watch.  It could be Hulu, it could be Netflix, it could be HBO, it could be Vimeo.  It could be...  And I watch...  It could be Twitter.  It could be Twitter.  You don't care.  I don't care.  For me, I watch video.  I have no concept of differentiation between various services.  I just look for things I want to watch and things which people tell me are interesting.  If people were not talking about Mad Men, it won't be very interesting.  It might be a great show.  And it's the same way people talk about other things.  So I think the whole notion of what is television is changing, what is video is changing.  We shall see how this evolves.  My view is we're going to see one more service come out which will be like Netflix and Hulu,  but it will be slightly different.  And that would be the third competitor in this space.

Start time: 5920.30
End time: 5922.11

Start time: 5929.78
End time: 5953.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what it needs to be.  I mean, that's what held Hulu back was these connections with existing networks.  And it's what hurt Netflix is they need content from the movie companies.  Both of them are trying to divorce themselves from their past, in effect.  But isn't the conventional wisdom that people don't want all these little bills?  Or has that changed?  It used to be people say, oh, another $8 a month bill.  I don't want another one.

Start time: 5955.56
End time: 5972.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think it all depends on how good the billing systems become.  So if you look at the Apple iTunes billing system or Amazon's billing system, it's pretty  easy to kind of subscribe a la carte.  You can go, I want MLB, I want NBA, and I want some HBO.

Start time: 5973.10
End time: 5977.96

Start time: 5978.44
End time: 6003.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  So Netflix is just a cable channel.  I don't care what kind of content they have.  And they, you know, like I used to think that they don't have the cutting edge content and  that's going to have an impact.  Well, really, you know, you watch TV for about 30, 40 minutes after dinner and it doesn't  matter like what you're watching.  Sometimes you're watching the new shows.  It doesn't.  Sometimes it's Jeopardy.  It doesn't matter.

They're sitting there watching YouTube like it's television.  And they're going, they're choosing videos.  They're watching it.

Start time: 6246.72
End time: 6283.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think they have a lot of challenges, so they have to go into different markets.  You know, they have Facebook and Apple and Amazon all pushing and pulling them in different  directions and they have to compete with them.  I think...  And all this is new competitive landscape for them.  So...  And it's Google+.  And, you know, Google+.  I, you know, I'm not even sure what problem it solves for me.  I don't think I have a problem with Facebook or Twitter.  I have a problem using those things.  I don't have a problem per se in that service.  I don't have time.

Transcript:  Exactly.  And I think that's...  So it's solving Google's problems.  And I think that's what I mean by a company doing unnatural things.  core competency was you go there, look for a, you know, make a query and go elsewhere.  That was the behavior on Google.  And that behavior turned Google into a mega billion dollar corporation because it created  a lot of happy people everywhere you go.  You know, everybody started using the idea of like, Google it.  Like the Google it became like, you know, it changed how society behaved.  It stopped bookmarking our whole behavior towards information change, how we consumed  it.  Now they have a different problem.  And I don't think they are looking at it in a very rational manner, in my opinion.

End time: 6378.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And right now they have gone from being a company whose main customer was you and I  to a main company whose main customer is the advertiser.  So I think there is that push and pull which does exist.  And they have to do it.  It's not like they have a choice because they are a publicly traded company.  They need to make money.  They need to have earnings.  They need to show growth.  If they don't have growth, the stock's going to fall.  Stock's going to fall.  Engineers are going to leave, et cetera, et cetera.  So it is a dilemma for them.

Start time: 6380.94
End time: 6459.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's essentially what it is.  You know, the interesting part with Google is it's facing innovator's dilemma in less  than a decade.  I know.  Amazing.  I mean, that's what I meant earlier that the internet and the connectivity has changed  the metabolism of the technology industry.  And Google, you're seeing it.  I mean, I don't think Facebook can assume that they're going to be the king of the web  five years from now.  They cannot assume that because things could just so radically change.  Look, you know, Google was started in our time.  Like we all saw it come out of nowhere and become this giant.  And now they're suffering from an innovator's dilemma.  They're doing all these interesting things, except they're not really that interesting  in a larger scheme of things as they are a bigger company.  I think it'll be an interesting one to see what happens.  I wish they would they would put more resources towards YouTube, in my opinion.  I think YouTube is like an undervalued asset they have, just like I think they need to  kind of get really serious about Android.  They should stop mocking about, you know, Google Plus and things like that and focus  on Android and YouTube and a couple of places where they're succeeding right now.

Start time: 6459.84
End time: 6487.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's funny because I've said they should get rid of YouTube because to me, it's a channel  conflict because they, you know, in search, they favor their own products.  And as somebody who competes with YouTube, that's a problem for me in search.  And so but you're right.  I mean, if you're if you look at what their assets are, you can start to replace search  with YouTube and and a few other products, but not but search is starting to give way.

Yeah, this is such a great thing.  This is the audio books.  Hundred thousand books.  Instead of listening to podcasts, you're probably listening to books now.  In fact, you're not even hearing this ad  because you love audible.  Now, if you are hearing this ad, then this is your last chance  because you got to listen to audible.  I got two books for you.  So, no, I mean, I don't have two picks.  Maybe you guys could help me.  But definitely there.  This is something you want to take a look at.  Two books for free.
