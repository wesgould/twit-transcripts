Welcome everybody to a twit just want to kind of explain what we're doing which is a little  bit out of the ordinary turns out that the twits have an unusual reverence for Mother's  Day and and I extended invitations to fully a dozen people to be on this show and.  Some I haven't heard from Kevin Rose I still haven't heard from Debbie Jones I haven't  heard from.  Will Harris I haven't heard from but those I heard from are with their mommies and I  think that's a wonderful thing but here's a bunch of guys who don't like their mothers.  And we're also going to use and we're also going to use talk shoe today to open it up  to our audience so I'm calling this the volunteer twit.  Let's start by saying hello to Alex Lindsay who is always welcome on the show Alex is  one of the hosts of Mac break weekly and he's of course the head of the pixel core and lives  down the street so we pretty much get him in here.  He's a freebie.  Freebie.  Somebody else who just wandered in Brian Daniel Eisenberg he's at infinitelymeta.com he was  just in town from Seattle you were you were visiting a lot of different things yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I've been yeah I started out at the Star Trek viewing that Arrington put on and then met  with Scoble and then crashed TechCrunch headquarters crashed friend feed headquarters then had  lunch with Lewis well Lewis is the one that took me down to both TechCrunch and friend  feed and then gosh that was it Scott Beals event last night so you're doing the whole  scene very important for I didn't realize it was so happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't even know that most of the stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We live we live within inches of the San Francisco you know epicenter of all things web 2.0 and  yet because we're about an hour north by car we get this great kind of removal too and  I don't mind that so much.  I love it.  Yeah you live in Seattle so you're also in an epicenter.  Yeah.  But there is a little you were saying it's a little more relaxed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's a little more relaxed and it's not you know the investment community I think is not  quite as evolved as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's why it's not relaxed there's money and you know there's everybody's hoping to  make everybody's open to score you know this is this is where this is where people are  you know gunning to make money.  Also here Lewis Gray so good I don't know what Lewis is doing here on Mother's Day he's  a proud papa brand new papa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well the good news is the twins are asleep right now so that won't last forever.  I was told the audio is coming into you guys but not over the stream so there might be  some work to do there.  My mother's doing great.  My wife is also taking a nap.  One of the advantages is you try and sleep when the kids sleep and that's how we got  time for you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm so glad you could be here.  Lewis is a regular on Friend Feed as well as at lewisgray.com a great blog site.  In fact you've become kind of almost an instant Friend Feed and Twitter celebrity because  of your great blog posts and Twitter's been very very good for it to you hasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I appreciate that.  It's an interesting thing I'm one of the few people who is on Friend Feed well before Twitter.  I was really kind of a lagger on Twitter because I didn't want to get into that.  But I recognize that you kind of have to go where the people are.  You can't be a holdout and say one way is the right way.  I got onto Friend Feed very early on and saw the benefits that were there and continue  to champion the service.  I don't think it's a situation of either or.  You really can do both in tandem and they're a good complement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah I would agree with you 100%.  I think that Friend Feed gets a lot of its content frankly from Twitter.  So I don't know what Friend Feed without Twitter is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Now Friend Feed is also a Twitter client.  That's how I use it.  I don't post natively to Twitter anymore.  I post to Friend Feed and it gets blasted out to there and Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But I try to reduce the echo.  I already broke the promise because I said we weren't going to do any social media today.  And then we jumped right into it.  Let's introduce one more person.  One of the things I try to do with This Week in Tech is get an international perspective.  30% of our audience is outside the US.  US tech companies in particular I think while the companies themselves understand that it's  an international business, the people in towns like San Francisco, I bet it's true in San  Francisco and Seattle too, are very provincial.  You know in San Francisco or nothing.  But really there's a vibrant exciting internet community.  Joining us right now from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, we have a web designer who volunteered.  This is the volunteer edition of Twitter to be here.  Carlos Gustavo Xavier.  Am I saying that right Carlos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Xavier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Xavier from the land of Kinshasa.  Hello there.  Good to have you on Carlos.  One of the things that Brazil has become very famous for is its embrace of open source software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes of course.  We have a thriving community here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Why do you think that is?  Is that economic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well I believe it's got a little bit to do with economics.  Of course Brazil started as a third world country.  We are now in the status of developing country.  So we're off that.  But like our government here, they use a lot of Linux for computer programs for the community.  So I believe it's got a lot to do with economics.  But people are also more open to new experiences.  So I think it kind of fits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Speaking of new experiences, this is going to be the first Twitter that we've also opened  up to the general Twitter community.  I said it was a volunteer edition.  We're using Talkshoe today.  I think it's something we're going to probably keep doing.  And so I'm going to open up real quickly.  I'm going to unmute all of you in Talkshoe.  We are in a room at Talkshoe.com.  This is room 49966.  That's the room we'll always be in.  If you search for Twit on Talkshoe you'll find us.  And you can go in there, you can be in the room and you can be on the show.  But let me just open it up, unmute and say hello to everybody who's listening on Talkshoe.  Hello.

Transcript:  Carson City, Nevada.  All right.  Judd Pratt, where are you calling from?  Los Angeles, California.  From LA.  Missing intellect.  I hope you're not completely missing.  Where are you from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's an old video game.  I'm from Los Angeles, California as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I haven't heard that video game, missing intellect.  It sounds like fun.  New Media Designs, where are you calling from?  PH Largo, where are you calling from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, it's Flargo and I'm from Seattle, Washington.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Flargo, I'll say that right, Seattle.  Bruce Turner, where are you from?  I'm in Melbourne, Florida on the space coast where the shuttle's going off tomorrow.  Oh, that's exciting.  That's exciting.  I hear they have two shuttles on the pad because they want to have a rescue shuttle ready  because this is the first shuttle flight where they couldn't shelter at the space station  because they're in a different orbit this time.  Very interesting.  To see two shuttles on the pad must be a sight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  One of the last few times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, let's hope you don't see the second one launch.  Thank you, Flargo.  Bruce Turner, where are you from?  Yeah, that was me.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Senka, where are you from?

Transcript:  You're a very brave woman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Thank you for being here representing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  All right, I'm going to put you on hold, all of you,  so we don't have that massive sound.  And I'll take you all one at a time in the future.  We'll go one at a time through you, so be ready.  I would encourage you, if you can, to have,  it would be great to have headsets.  Turn off any background audio.  If you're listening on headsets, that'll be okay.  And then we'll call on you and you'll be able to come up.  I'm going to get Louis back.  He dropped off.  And we can start talking about the news of the day.  And the big story, I think, is the Amazon announcing  a new Kindle one month after announcing the old Kindle.  I'm a little pissed.  Brian, are you pissed?  I don't own one, so I don't really care.  Louis, can you remember, I can't remember,  you're too young to remember anything, Louis,  but can you remember ever a tech company  announcing an update to a product  a month after announcing the first product?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Apple tends to do some updates similar to that.  I remember they updated the RAM on the iPhone  and people were pissed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But remember, first of all, that was a year later.  Second of all, Apple gave a $100 discount.  Yeah, a year is one thing.  This is two months later.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  What's the deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can't complain too much.  It's one of those things where the early adopters  don't always get the best deal.  But they did have it first.  I'm not too concerned about it  because I don't have a Kindle at all.  You know I'm an Apple fanboy,

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, here's the theory that's going around.  I don't know, Alex, you might want to comment on this  because you're from MacBreak Weekly  that maybe this is a preemptive strike.  I mean, one of the things that's kind of interesting is  they have announced it, but it's not going to be out  until the summer, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That could be August 31st.  I do think there's some concern.  Are they worried about the iPhone or the tablet?  I think there's some concern that there is a,  from a media perspective, there's going to be kind of a black hole  in this sector as we reach early June.  Oh, so that's it.  There's no coverage after this.  Yeah, because the problem is that if Apple releases a media pad,  like if they actually do something in June,  they announce it, they probably won't ship it until the fall,  but they'll announce, you know, a lot of people believe  they're going to see some kind of larger iPhone.  You're not going to be able to get,  everyone's going to compare whatever that item is  for the next three months.  Anything that's related to the media pad,  I think that's the challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think it's incumbent at this point on Amazon to do something.  A little love for those of us who bought,  I've bought two Kindle 2s because I got one for myself,  and I got two days before the DX was announced for mom,  for Mother's Day, a Kindle 2.  Well, we knew that it was going to be released this week  because you got the tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, you do have 30 days to return it,  so I could tell mom, but I'm not going to tell mom,  oh, return it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's your Mother's Day gift.  She's loving it.  You'll get a bigger one sometime.  Well, the question is, I think there's a lot of people  that don't necessarily want a bigger one.  It's not that much bigger, is it?  Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's 9.7 inches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, how much bigger is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's like, no, I think it's like four inches.  It's a four inch difference.  It's not that much bigger.  It's not like you couldn't.  Here's the thing that I think is way more important than the size  is the support for PDF.  PDF.  Because this is how the iPod, I believe,  squeezed the record companies into Apple's hand,  which is that Apple gave them a legal outlet,  but they also created something that  anybody could use for anything.  And now the issue is, especially when you look  at the textbook market,  what you're looking at is a bunch of students  who are going to have,  some of whom have access to very high speed scanners.  And what you're going to end up with,  I think, is a pirated, a pirating market  for a lot of the textbooks  if they don't react quickly.  So what Amazon now has is  it has that publishing industry  between a rock and a hard place.  Without doing anything overt,  they're able to make it available.  People can put up PDFs of anything  as well as...  That's big.  Well, it's also the textbook community

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  and the academic community.  I was talking to KiwiNerd in our chat  at IRC.twit.tv  and she said a lot of the documents  that we get are in PDF form.  A lot of the scientific papers and stuff.  This is definitely aimed at the academic market.  But if you're a publisher, you should be worried that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I would be worried as a publisher

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  that my intellectual property has just gone out of order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  DRMs are gone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I don't know if DRM is gone, but I think  the issue is if they don't play,  if they don't play with Amazon,  if they don't produce something that is...  If they don't aggressively move their textbooks  to an electronic format, think about  bringing the price down to something reasonable.  If they don't play that game, I think  the issue they end up with is a lot of students

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  circumventing them.  It's the same thing that happened with the music industry  and songs being distributed through peer-to-peer networks.  They finally figured out a model for  iTunes and Amazon for distribution.  And that's taking off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They wouldn't have done it if  the piracy market wasn't  so prevalent.  They would have never given...  This whole market would have moved slower.  This could be a whole new wave of piracy.  When you have a closed system, like the Kindle,  it didn't put a lot of pressure on publishers.  The other thing to remember is  just like movies, we saw The Wolverine come out.  Just like movies, every single book is in PDF format.  Before it goes to the printer.  So the thing is, if you have a PDF available,  the danger is that  any of this stuff can slip out.  And it's such a widely known format.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Carlos, you're kind of left out on this

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  because there is no Kindle  for outside the US, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, there's no Kindle.  I get some friends that actually  have it. Of course, they brought it from abroad.  They love it.  But this PDF material is already out there.  It's not like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, it's probably on Pirate Bay, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's already out there.  It's not because it now supports PDF  that all this new pirate wave is going to come.  It's already here, right?  So I don't see it  as doing more damage than we already have.  Well, except that it's on the Kindle platform,

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  which does damage just because  if you like the Kindle platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think just the netbook concept,  touch computing, I can't mouse with my right hand,  because I've moused for 15 years.  And I've destroyed my arm.  But I want to be able to touch,  and it's the glass.  It's the Corning patents  that make the iPhone multi-touch possible.  Oh, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So Amazon couldn't do a multi-touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's interesting.  Apple has an exclusive agreement with Dow Corning  for the glass that this thing is made out of.  But Corning, I've been told,  has come out with a new process for new glass  that apparently makes this look like child's play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, it's in Corning's interest  to make sure that others can get it too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You think about netbooks and the Crunchpad  and the thing that Scoble was talking about the other day,  that he was some company in China,  having computing devices that are made out of glass.  I want four walls,  and I want them all glass.  I want some sort of projection system  that I can compute on all walls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't think Amazon's going to bring you that.  However, the question is,  does Apple have a built-in advantage  because it has multi-touch, it has color,  doesn't have the battery life  that Amazon can't compete with?  I would think Corning would get in bed with Amazon  if Amazon asked them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Look at Amazon's growth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We don't know what the deal with Apple is.  Amazon is so closed

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  with divulging anything about what they do.  I think that Amazon is really looking at selling those razors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're not interested.  Why do they charge $360 for the razor?  Because I think a big chunk of what we pay there  is for the connection.  They could take it out,  they take 5% of each book,

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  they could pay for it with the books.  I think Amazon...  Here's my thesis on all this.  Amazon has never done a consumer electronics device.  They haven't asked anybody.  All you have to do is take a look at the Kindle One  to realize they're not the kind of company  that's asking anybody for input.  That thing was a joke.  They're just going along, they're bumbling along,  and they're making mistake after mistake,  complete newbie mistake.  Mistake one, the stupid design on the Kindle One.  They just made a mistake by releasing Kindle DX  two months after Kindle Two.  They seem to be missing the boat on the price.  I think Amazon just has their head up their butt.  Now that said,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  they're seeing huge growth points  in certain age markets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Here's the other thing.  What we don't know is how many they've sold.  How many Kindles they've sold.  We know they've sold Kindles  predominantly to people over 50,  over 40.  That's because my mom loves it because they've got the big font.  But Amazon's not disclosing sales numbers.  They're just saying we're selling out.  We don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You were talking about the price and saying that it was too expensive.  It's actually gone up in price and not down  with the Kindle DX.  It's a hundred bucks more.  You look at Apple, you say people are worried about what Apple's going to do.  Is this a preemptive strike?  Is this a preemptive strike against a product that nobody knows actually exists?  We've all been watching Mac for a long time.  They've been talking about a tablet for a decade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Do you think Jeff might know something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that everybody thinks they know something.  My little sister who works at Apple Store  or retail tries to give me tips on when the MacBooks come out.  But if you take a look at Apple,  when they first came out with the iPod,  I thought it was undervalued  in terms of it just didn't have a big enough hard disk.  Five gigs wasn't enough for me.  And it was too expensive.  iPhone, people said it was too expensive.  And what did they do? They went out and just beat the industry into a pulp.  So Amazon can look at them and say  this is not too expensive.  Maybe they can show it as a premium product  in a type of marketplace  that doesn't have a lot of competition right now.  They're not forced to bring the price down  because they don't have a lot of competition  in this space for what they do.  We're not even talking about the Sony's version, right?  The Sony e-reader?  No one's talking about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I own both Sony e-readers, Louis.  I'm a Kindle fan.  I abandoned it for the Kindle.  And that's for one reason only, the wireless.  That's the killer app on this.  Are you buying RSS feeds on that Kindle?  No. You mean blogs and that kind of thing?  I don't understand what that's all about.  I do get Salon.  So I guess in a way that's kind of...  I mean I could read that on the web.  I also get the New Yorker, which is huge.  But I don't find it a very good device, frankly,  for scanning these things.  I wonder if the DX with a bigger form factor will be bigger.  You know, the Time supposedly is going to do a deal  that will give you the Kindle DX  if you can't get delivery.  Now talk about it. A company mired in its old business model.  If you can't get delivery, then you can get a DX.  I think that the issue though is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I do think that the advantage of the Kindle  is of course that it will last a long time.  It's probably easier on your eyes.  But I think that also depends on  whether you're planning to read an entire book  or whether you're planning to read things in small pieces.  I have to admit that I read...  It's great for a linear book. Page after page after page.  But if you look at reference...  Scanning is terrible.  Or if you want to add video or color or whatever,  I think that anything that Apple produces that's larger,  and to be honest with you, the iPhone,  I routinely read large chunks of data  from whether it's CNN.com or New York Times  or other outlets on my iPhone.  And I'm quite comfortable with it.  It took a little while.  I thought it was a little kloosy when I started.  But once you get used to it,  and I think that a larger screen  I think would be much more compelling to me  than a black and white low contrast screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you were talking about piracy earlier,  Jason Kincaid at TechCrunch said that  piracy was going to save the Amazon DX  at the fact that you can get PDF on there.  It's a lot more advantageous to copy over  a $70 textbook  than it was a $10 paperback.  And they're saying that the price differential  for the actual media you're trying to get on there  will push piracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I think it will. I agree with that.  And I think that the...  I think also, though, it also makes the Kindle  a more utilitarian  piece of equipment.  When you only could read  what you could buy  or download through the system,  it limited the number of uses you could have for it.  But now you can definitely imagine...

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's an Internet device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can definitely imagine companies being able to  distribute lots of PDFs to people for meetings  or for information  or morning, whatever.  A lot of that stuff was difficult  when they were controlling that pipe.  But being able to move anything over there  provides a lot of other uses  for this device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  All right, I'm going to pick up...  This is going to be interesting.  I'm going to pick up one of our callers from  The Talk Shoe.  We've got a good bunch of people in our Talk Shoe chat room.  And I'm going to pick up Rachel Zee,  who I mentioned is the only woman  in our Talk Shoe chat room.  So, Rachel, that gives you pride of place.  Welcome to This Week in Tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Rachel, you have a Kindle?  I don't have a Kindle, but  the thing I actually wanted to comment on  is with being able to do textbooks  and the future would be perfect  because I'm actually dyslexic.  And so when I was going through school,  I had to get tapes  and listen to them and try to read along  and stuff. But if they could somehow match up  what you're reading in the textbook  with the audio and not just  the Kindle voice, that would be  absolutely perfect for dyslexic people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You've got to figure that Amazon must be planning  something like this. You know, they also own Audible.  So wouldn't it be great if they tied the audio  on audible.com?  My mom tried the automatic voice  and she said,  by the way, it goes  brrraaammaa.  She tried  the automatic voice  and said it's too robotic for me.  But what if you had Audible  with a good quality reader reading the book.  They own Audible. Tied it into the text.  Wouldn't that be awesome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know who  would make a killer  voice  for books?  Apple  with its voiceover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think the Kindle voice  you haven't probably heard it, Carlos,  but I think the Kindle voice is very much like Alex.  I think it's probably the AT&T  voice synthesizer  which I think is what Alex is based on.  I mean you, Alex. I mean Alex on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, actually I think, I often  think that it's based on me.  That's the way I view the world.  So Rachel, would you buy

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  a Kindle if they added that feature?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah, hands down.  I'm already an Audible listener and  so now I have my book and my iPod and  it would just be great if they could just be together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be nice? Yes, if you're dyslexic

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  audio books are a life saver.  One of the other things is that I grew up with  I grew up with dyslexia  myself and one of the big problems  is that a lot of times  my form of dyslexia was mostly  color related. So  if I had, on a black and white  black on white is the hardest thing for me to read  because my brain...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So you don't mind the black on gray of the Kindle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no. Well I actually would prefer  I prefer actually light text on black  or green on black is really what I can read.  Green on black is...  You guys are old school. You're the old  console. It's literally just  that I see the patterns. My brain  will tend to pick up the patterns of the spaces between  the words which is what makes it difficult  for me to read it. And so I tend to avoid  reading as much  black on white. But all of these readers  allow you to start customizing them.  It allows you to start customizing  how you view  books rather than however they

Speaker: SPEAKER_10

We're glad to have you as a listener.  And glad to get your feedback.  On the kindle.  Let's move along to another  story. Another big story of the  week which was I'm trying to think.  Star Trek.  You know I think this has to do with  unmuting all on the.  All right now I should warn people  there's no way we could discuss this flick.  No way.  No way.  There's no way we could discuss this flick.  No way we could discuss this flick without spoilers.  Are we in agreement  here? Yeah. Who's seen it? You saw  it Alex? Yeah. Yeah. You saw it.  You were sitting next to me. Did you see it Brian?  I have. You saw the tech crunch screening.  Lewis Gray have you seen it? I have not.  No. Lewis is anti-Star Trek. Okay.  Lewis you stick your fingers in your ears and go  me me me me me me me me for the next five minutes.  Okay. I don't intend to see it anyway.  What? What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What? My entire family  is a Star Trek fan so it means I can't be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What? Carlos have you seen it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No I haven't  seen it. I just watched Wolverine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh you watched. Is Star Trek in Brazil  yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes it is. It starts  the same day that you guys did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think that the idea of rolling international  releases is gone now. I think they have to  because of the piracy really pushed that forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because you know you could  see any movie that was released in the US in Africa  I know within days. Instantly.  You know through you know from  on DVD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Is there piracy problem in  Brazil?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well we have a big  piracy problem here.  It's all due to economics as well.  We have this little Chinese  shops on each  corner and they got all  these cities. They are all running around  from cops and  yeah we do have a. That's what gets

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  me. The movie industry in the United States  analyzes us. You go to a movie you pay ten dollars  and fifty cents for a movie and the first thing you see is an ad  saying stop stealing our movies.  And it's not  me. It's those Chinese  guys in Brazil. Go show them  the ad. I don't need to see that ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I think that one of the things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's the Chinese guys in Brazil.  I blame them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah I remember my dad  brought back a bunch of DVDs he got in China  and it's like just random quality  from the guy who's holding the video camera.  Yeah yeah it's handheld. And some of them are Oscar screeners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You don't know what you're going to get.  You don't know what you're going to get.  Well alright so  I'm going to chase everybody away  except Lewis you don't have to leave because you don't care.  Wait a minute how could you not care? You don't like Star Trek?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's one of those  generational things. I don't know what the right answer is Leo.  My little brothers and sisters  love the fantasy, the Dragonlance  series, the Star Trek, the Star Wars  and it just never hit me. You're too old  for it. I like sports and biographies. It was just

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  different. I don't know what we're going to do  with you Lewis.  I don't know Lewis. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think I need the agenda in advance next time Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No it's okay you're not  going to go see it so we can now spoiler the  movie. Spoiler of the movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So we're definitely going to have spoilers huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Are you going to cover your ears?  No we don't have to do spoilers. I don't know  what's a spoiler? What's a spoiler first of all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Define a spoiler. There's spaceships.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's spaceships. You loved  it Alex. You said it was the best movie you've seen since

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Matrix. Well I think it's the best, I think it's one of the best  sci-fi since Matrix.  I think that it was well done. I think one of the things that made it  $75 million weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's a good weekend. Now it's a $130 million

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  budget so they still have a ways to go to pay it off  but they will. They will.  Here's the big difference is they've got great  audience review, they've got great  critical review, they've got all the things that are necessary  to move to 3 or 4 hundred. And they've got the hardcores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I mean the hardcore  trekkies. I mean I was walking  last night to the robot  games thing that Scott put on and I was  past the Metreon and  trekkies were out. By the guys with ears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We saw some guys with the Star Trek shirts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I think that the thing is  what was great though is that  while trekkers were  into the  process I think one of the things that  was important was that  JJ Abrams didn't come from a  trekkers background. Didn't come from  it being a huge fan. He wasn't a hardcore  You know he came from a I'm going to make a great movie, I'm going to  tell a great story. He didn't know anything about it you said.  Not very much.  In some of the interviews he just said I'm not a big  Star Trek fan. Genius. How he pulled

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  that wide of a swath.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know what the genius is. Spoiler alert.  This is the genius alert. He managed  to reset the timeline  so now he can do anything he wants.  Right. In other words he's  I heard that.  I didn't say how.  But he did something. No actually a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  friend told me before you so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But he's done something I think very clever  because he can start the franchise over  without being too tied to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He doesn't have to get to a certain point  somewhere in the future.  100% creative. He can do whatever he needs.  Well and imagine

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  one of the biggest problems  with making a Star Trek movie is the  trekkers. I mean they're both the blessing and the curse  because if you say oh I'm sorry  Mr. Spock there's no way he  could have known that the  and so this way  he could just say well it's an alternate timeline dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Sorry. Well I mean unlike  Star Wars I mean I grew up  as a very young kid when I was  Star Wars came out in 79, 80 I was like five years old.  And I remember seeing it  and I didn't  even see the last three that were made  because I saw the first one and I just completely  lost interest. But now I'm  not a big trekkie guy. I went  and saw this movie and all of a sudden it's  evoking memories and like nightmares  that I had as a kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well and I think that also were you know they  spent a lot more money on this Star Trek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You told me something interesting. You said that  J.J. Abrams decided not to  use models so much. This was in

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Post Magazine.  There was an article about  what they were doing. So it  wasn't from any inside information. I was reading  the article and what they were talking about  was the fact that because of a lot of dynamic moves  one of the issues you get into is when you really want  to make a lot of dynamic moves.  You make camera moves. Yeah big  camera moves. It's easier to do that with  CG than it is to do it necessarily  with miniature. Now the thing is is that  typically what happens when I work  for instance on Star Wars  when we got really close to the  ships when we're flying right over the very  top of them we're using miniatures.  When we're a little further away we're  using 3D models because a lot of  times it's very hard for a CG  model to hold up when  you get really close to it and I'm afraid that we saw  a little bit of that. You know I wasn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  sure because we were sitting in the fourth  or fifth row. We were fairly close.  Second row. We were like IMAX  close. Yeah. Right.  And I thought maybe because we're so close to the screen  we're seeing it you know maybe if you're a little  farther back but to me it did not feel as  real as a model might have. And I will say

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that overall I thought that the graphics  were you know stellar.  Little too many lens flares for my taste.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah lens flares. I should have worn sunglasses.  There were a lot of lens flares. It's like the sun's  constantly blinding you in this movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It definitely gave it a look. That's a style.  It's a style. Yeah. A style that  Abrams went after.  I think that as we got  some of the very close shot of the ships  I didn't feel like there was  quite the same level of detail that we would get from a miniature.  But it gives you a lot  more dexterity to do a lot of different  things because you can rebuild  the moves. The problem when you use a miniature is what  you're doing. You shoot it and you got it. Or you're doing a motion  control camera. So you're basically you program  the camera. You run it through the thing and it's a  big deal to go back and do it again. Whereas  with when you're doing CG you just keep on tweaking  it. And so that gave them a  lot more flexibility to create much  bigger more dynamic moves  on a lot of the ships.  And as I said I think that overall  there were definitely places where  if you know what noisy smoke looks  what we tend to call Perlin  noise whether it's actually Perlin noise or not.  So when there's certain parts where the ship's  going through stuff that you can  that some of that smoke is obviously  CG from someone who makes CG stuff. I don't know.  Oh you can recognize it. Yeah I didn't recognize  that. I look at it and go oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Fake smoke. Saw fake smoke.  Now alright plot wise though I mean that was  it was a classic Star Trek plot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was but I thought it was much tighter. I thought  that it was left. I thought it was  I think if somebody's

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think if Louis  Gray goes to see this and he's not a Star Trek fan  he's going to say  what?  Come on. Oh come on. Oh please.  Oh no. What? He injected  the red stuff. Oh come on.  Right. Yeah there's some stuff where you go.  Come on. So do you think he brought with the red  Wait a minute. No spoilers.  No spoilers. You can't say. Was he bringing

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  stuff back from Alias?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Was that from Alias? I think so.  The TV show Alias? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's some red stuff in Alias.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't think it's the same red stuff. And Alias kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  just ended. Like I never. Oh you think

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  JJ actually is kind of tying his other  stuff together? Who knows. Who knows. Oh that's an  interesting thing. One thing I liked  speaking of red and this is not a spoiler.  Who's breathing? Carlos are you breathing?  Who's breathing? Maybe that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Maybe that's Louis. I am breathing but not in the mic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You're not allowed to breathe. Whoever's on the. I think it's you Louis.  Move that microphone a little away from your  There you go.  He's all head up because of this Star  Trek stuff. I'm wasting my time on this.  I don't want to hear anymore of this Star Trek stuff. I can't talk  about Friend Feed. We almost do. We'll talk about  Friend Feed in a little bit.  I'm trying to get away from the  social media. Now I'm over doing the Star  Trek stuff. I can't win.  But one of the things I thought that first of all  maybe because JJ  wasn't a Star Trek fan and he had  I think he had a book saying you got to say this this this  this and this. He hit every post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I thought it was done well. I thought when it inserted  it was just inserted well enough that  it really ties it all together. Oh no and you

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  can hear the gasps in the audience  when Scotty says Cap'n I'm giving it all  she got. And everybody goes yeah.  But did you  notice? Redshirt guy.  They even had a redshirt guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And not only that they had a cocky redshirt guy.  Did I not lean in? Did I not lean in?  And say redshirt guy?  The only thing Leo says during the movie is  because he's required the whole movie but  there's one part where there's cocky guy in a  redshirt and Leo leans over and he's like  there's the redshirt guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I was so pleased that he did that because  that was really. For me the single

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  thing was what  came out and well  I can't say. Don't spoil it. We haven't spoiled it yet.  It was something  that was in I think Star Trek 2 or  3 that caused me  a great deal of nightmares  and that kind of stuff. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm going to have to think about that now.  And somebody's saying in the  talk shoe that  he wasn't crazy about it. It felt like it was a little forced  when Bone says damn it Jim.  I'm a doctor not a physicist.  Or Spock. I think it's damn it Spock.  That one seemed a little forced.  And I think the guy playing Bones  was almost doing an impression  of Bones.  Yeah.  Simon Pegg was so good as Scotty.  Yeah. Yeah.  This was definitive Scotty.  I'm sorry James  doing but this was the definitive Scotty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was a fantastic  Scotty. Well he's actually.  I thought the portrayal of Spock was good  and Kirk. Chekhov's accent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Chekhov's accent.  I don't know what to say about it.  Just Chekhov's accent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  He reminds me of the  Russian guy in that  stupid Bruce Willis movie. Armageddon.  Yeah.  It's a little over the top.  It's a little over the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think they were having fun with it.  Well they clearly were because there's a comedic scene.  Yeah. So I think that was  purposely a little over the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Scotty TD is in our  talk shoe chat. Scott says  he went to the movie and he went  in costume.  Scott what was your costume?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I'm actually  studying engineering. My name is Scott  so I went as Scotty in  the wrap of  Kron era uniform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's pretty awesome. Did you have that or did you  actually make that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We made. Me and two friends of mine  all in engineering made  them last year for Halloween  because we realized the movie was coming out.  So I ordered the parts.  My mom helped us assemble them  because she's the master seamstress.  So it was really awesome.  People were taking our pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh and say hi to your mom because it's Mother's  Day. I already did.  Good. Good.  She doesn't listen to twit probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No my dad does though so he's going to  be kind of confused when he listens to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And what did you think? Give us your review of the movie.  Were you satisfied?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was completely satisfied.  I don't think the movie could have gotten  any better. It could have been  a lot worse because it could have  been wrecked but I think. It could have been

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  a nightmare absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was really hard to  come up.  The fact that he wasn't married  to Star Trek. He wasn't  a big fan. He could  just make it up whatever he wanted  to and then bring in the  allusions to the old thing. The thing about Admiral  Archer and his dog which I even missed while  watching it and all these other little cute  things. He could bring in as opposed  to having to write the  story with needing those things to be there.  I think that's how it really succeeds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I remember when  the first Star Trek movie came out.  There was this  frisson when Kirk  and Spock appear on deck  that you're seeing them again.  There was this wonderful sensation  of wow, they're back.  I'll never forget that. I got chills  seeing that first movie.  He was able to do a little bit of that.  Seeing them young. The first time the kid  says James Tiberius Kirk.  There's just this little frisson of  wow, we're back baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  We're back and we can do whatever we want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He reset this movie.  They've got all the  worm in the world to play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I was thoroughly entertained by that movie  from start to finish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What was your favorite scene Scott?  You've got to pick one. No spoilers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the hard part.  Talking about the models and how it looked.  I was pretty close up  and I didn't notice anything from the  model being digitalized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Alex has an eye. He's looking with a professional's eye.  He's going to see stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it was fantastic.  I don't want to say that it wasn't.  I felt like a physical model  might have felt still a little bit more  real.  You don't get those great hero shots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They did a hero shot of Enterprise  for instance.  You're seeing in all the windows and stuff.  It didn't feel to me like those  classic hero shots of earlier movies  where every detail  is there. You're really looking  at something real.  I'm not sure because I was so close  but it just felt a little soft.  It didn't feel quite  as realistic as a model might have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The level of detail and what I'm thinking is  the scenes from Star Wars  where the Emperor is looking out at space  and Death Star and that kind of thing.  That, it's like wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You notice it when they're really really  inside the ship. Going between  support panels and stuff where the  ship is just full frame.  That's where I felt like it wasn't  completely home right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It didn't bother me as much because I was admiring  the fact that they made the ship real.  It's the first time you see pipes in the  Enterprise. You see ducting. You see  stuff happening. It really looked  like you were geeky stuff. Like you were in the  bowels of an actual ship.  We've never seen that before.  Normally the Enterprise is  sleek and clean.  Maybe Scotty's climbing inside the core  but it's all beautifully lit. This  looked like it was a working ship. I liked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There were pipes in the  original series because they were all labeled  GNDN which is goes nowhere does nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh Scotty  you are a trekker. Now I  know.  Yeah, you guys shouldn't have admitted that.  Really goes nowhere does nothing.  That's awesome. That's hysterical.  That's wonderful. Hey Scotty thank you  for being on the show. Yes, no  problem. Keep that engineering outfit. You might  need it. Starfleet might be calling

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  you up. I thought it was a really  I thought the casting was very interesting  all the way across. Excellent casting. I thought it was a really good casting. I thought that  Winona Ryder did well. I didn't know it was her  until I saw her. Yeah, me neither. Now

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  she was aged, right?  I think she was. I don't think Winona  has those kinds of bags under her eyes.  And you noticed in the credits there was a  company that does... Goes back and forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Typically they're known for making  people look younger than they are. But that's the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  as making somebody look older, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's in some way. So  Lola Effects, that's their specialty.  So in the credits they were there and

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We should say Winona Ryder is Spock's mom  if you want to watch for her. Right.  But you'd never, I don't think you'd notice it unless you knew it was her.  You noticed it, Alex. I was  shocked when I saw her in the credits. I can't recognize

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  but I was like... Well, I said, who is that? She's

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  beautiful. She's somebody. I don't know who she is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Of course, under her robe she had stolen  three faux necklaces and a  pair of gloves from...  Ow! I shouldn't bring that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's mean. That's another kind of bag, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's another... Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But even guys like, I mean, I thought that  Ben Cross who played Spock's father  as an actor that you see in lots of little places  and you just wouldn't expect to put him in as a...  He was great. And he was... You know, he had that

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  bone structure that he made him look like a Vulcan.  I mean, there was something about his mouth and his bones.  He just didn't look quite human. And I thought that was really nicely done.  I don't know if that was makeup or  if he really looks... Does he look like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The center of his face looks largely the same.  But the, you know, obviously some of the other...  They were doing something to him.  But yeah, it's... So anyway, but a lot of...  And Eric Bana, you wouldn't think of Eric Bana as Nero.  No, he was a very good Nero.  He did. Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The Romulans in this movie are evil, baby.  They are bad m...  But here's the thing is that they're bad.  Hush yo' mouth. I'm talking about Romulans.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think that one of the things that...  About the Romulans though is that he made...  He did not...  I guess the wrong word to say humanize.  But he did make his beef real.  You know, rather than... Oh, yeah.  With a lot of Star Trek, you get these kind of crazy...  That's a good point.  We're angry, we're going to do whatever.  You almost wanted to feel sorry for him.  He created a reason for them really to be angry.  I think it's more story development than we see often times in Star Trek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's because he's an actor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I mean in the story line.  No, no, in the script. I agree with you. I'm just teasing you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Alright, we're going to take a break.  We're going to come back with a story.  Give a guess before we go to the break.  Give a guess. How many homes in the United States do not have landlines but just...  What percentage of homes do not have landlines but just have cell phones?  Don't tell me Alex, Lindsay.  We're going to hold on. We're going to come back in just a bit.  Carlos, you can play this game too even though you're in Brazil.  And I'd like to know what the percentage is in Brazil.  Luis Gray, thank you for listening through this entire boring Star Trek episode.  You couldn't care less, could you?  He's been on Friend Feed the whole time.  He's been on Friend Feed? Have you been posted on Friend Feed?  He's not saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you've got a live chat there so you might as well participate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's true. We've got 412 comments already and we're just a quarter of the way through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Watching that comment stream is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We should tell people that I have lately on Twit been starting...  We have a Twit room, a Twit conversations room.  We actually have a number of Twit rooms on Friend Feed which I created a long time ago.  But there's one Twit Dash conversations where every time we start a new show, I'll start a conversation.  So if you're on Friend Feed, you can follow that and participate.  And we watch it and it goes quite... it's really kind of a static, persistent chat room.  It's like a static IRC channel.  Yeah.  I actually want to ask you, Luis, what you think now that Friend Feed's beta is out,  we'll talk about this also in a little bit, what you think of what they've done with Friend Feed.  Yay, social media!  Oh, stop it. Oh, just stop it.  By the way, Brian is on Twitter as...  InfinitelyMeta.  Of course he is.  Meanwhile, I'd like to talk about Squarespace.com.  Show of hands, anybody here using Squarespace?  Squarespace, anybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We are going... Leo's just throwing me a softball here.  We're going crazy with Squarespace.  So what do you mean? Pixelcore?  Pixelcore. We started off moving Twip Log.  So Twip... this week in photography.  This week in photography is on it now.  And so we put up our online presence there as Twiplog.com.  And it was so easy to adjust.  Aaron, Maylor and I, you know, what was great is we'd sit there on Skype,  and the two of us had a two-hour session and like designed almost the whole thing, you know,  and I could move stuff around, Aaron could move stuff around, we could move, you know, and so...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You mean in design terms. It's really cool that way.  You can drag and drop the column.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You decide how the width of the main content area, you can drag and drop everything that you need to do.  And here's the thing that's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Rachel, Rachel, Rachel, you said you used Squarespace before we did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  All right.  I thought about it on Dignation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Rachel, you're going to... I'm going to see if we can get the hat trick for you, get you in every commercial.  So Rachel now is an audible and a Squarespace user.  You have about 15 minutes to try our third sponsor.  I'm not going to tell you who it is, Rachel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I think that the thing that we're really excited about related to Squarespace is the idea that our people who are managing our content  are not having to email somebody to ask them to make a change in the website.  You know, and so the thing is, is when someone who's managing a certain area of our websites needs to make a change  and there's a structural change that needs to be made, they can make it on their own.  Now, we still are going to need to do some custom code to get some of the stuff done that we want to do.  But you can do that because it takes JavaScript, you can do anything.  You can make the adjustments that you need to it.  So it's not that you're limited to whatever Squarespace gives you.  You can inject code into the system, but you can build the entire skeleton of what you're doing on something that is very malleable,  very changeable.  If you decide somewhere down the road you don't like Squarespace, one of the things that made us feel safe was that we get exported out to WordPress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I love it. Import from blog, removable type, type pad, WordPress, export to.  Rachel, what's your site? Do you want to give it out on the air?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, sure. It's girlsnightinradio.com. It goes along with one of my podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, so you're a podcaster.  Yep, I have Squarespace.  And one of them is called Girls Night In?  Yeah, WordPress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Girls Night In Radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Okay. And what's the other podcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sims 2 Challenges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Jim's 2 Challenges.  Sims.  Sims 2 Challenges. Oh, so you challenge people to do stuff in Sims?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, people write different challenges and then I review them.  Oh, that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Look at this. This is beautiful. So this is on Squarespace. How hard was it to get that design in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not too hard. I think it took me probably about four hours total to get the whole site up and running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And I noticed it has a podcast player. That's handy.  So people can go there and listen to your show.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Very cool.  girlsnightinradio.squarespace.com  So there's a unsolicited, until I put her on the air, I guess I kind of solicited it at that point, but unsolicited testimonial for Squarespace.  It's more than a blog. It's more than a podcasting medium. You can do forums, photo galleries.  It's really your next web host as well as your next content management system.  Complete permissions for multiple editors. That's kind of how you use it, Alex.  Cloud architecture gives it speed and site stability. I mean, you get dug, don't worry about it.  Kevin Rose uses it. I guess that's Dignation, apparently.  Squarespace.com slash twit, free to try, no credit card needed.  And if you use twit as the coupon code, when you sign up, you're going to get 10% off.  You could say Dignation, but use twit, okay?  And I want you to sign up again, Rachel, with my coupon code, okay?  No, you don't have to.  But I bet you Dignation never gave you a plug for your blog and your podcast.  Squarespace.com slash twit, we salute them. We thank them so much for their support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think Squarespace, iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, now that's interesting. I didn't know that. iPhone app.  And like Flickr, now you have my attention.  These guys, Dane and Anthony, who's the programmer, are brilliant guys. They're really sharp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And like with other blog sites, I'm starting to play with putting stuff up through MarsEdit,  putting stuff up through iBlogger on my iPhone.  And all of that's just, you log in, boom, you're just able to upload.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  What framework are they built on?  They're their own. It's all their own. It's Java. It's all Java. They did it themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  These guys are very talented Java programmers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, that's what I've been doing for 10 years.  You know a little bit about that.  I'm not a programmer, but I know enough to be dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They're using, which I could remember because he told me, the virtualization is done through Java as well.  So it's very easy for them to add more capacity. It's really cool.  Very interesting.  All right. So the CDC, apparently the Center for Disease Control, keeps track of landlines.  And actually I was told in our chat room by a nurse, the reason they do is a lot of health monitors use phone lines.  So something the CDC has to keep track of.  They have put out some new results.  Huge growth in the number of people not using landlines, using cell phones only.  What was your guess, Alex Lindsay, for the percentage of households that have cells only in the United States?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My guess is that it is a third.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  33 percent? What do you think, Daniel? I mean, Brian.  It's Brian Daniel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.  You think a third is too high, too low?  I think it's about right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Carlos, what would it be in Brazil? It's probably very high in Brazil, right?  I would think more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In Brazil, it's still very high cell phone mobile market.  It's a big thing here.  But a lot of people still have the landlines.  A lot of them also get the usual land number with their cell phones.  Oh, that's interesting. It comes with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, that's very interesting.  Hey, Luis, what about you? Are you do you still have a landline?  You're a young, hip kind of dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My wife has a landline, I'll put it that way.  24 percent would be my guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, you guys kind of ruined the story because it's 20 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought that was a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's one in five people in the U.S.  An increase of three percentage points over the first half of the year,  the largest six month increase since the government started collecting such data.  Now, here's the other side of it.  Seventeen percent don't have cell phones.  Seventeen percent are landlines only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, we haven't had a landline for 10 years.  I haven't had a landline for 10 years.  You're one of those people.  Well, part of it was I was moving a lot for a little bit in the early part of this decade.  But then I just couldn't, I didn't want to deal with people calling me.  I didn't want to deal with all the other pieces.  And I just wanted one number to get a hold of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm going to say that you actually are probably correct because in addition,  there's a 15 percent of the households have landlines but don't use them.  They're there for emergency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Comcast is my provider for cable, internet, and VoIP.  So I have a Comcast line.  I run my own apartments.  So that's my business line.  I don't answer that phone ever.  You never use it?  I have a voicemail when I have apartments for rent.  I put the ad up there and that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So you're in a large group of people.  Same thing, Carlos.  You have a landline but you don't use it.  I use it for internet, phone, and TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a whole package.  I don't use the landline.  It's just for emergencies and maybe my dad calling me from Brasilia.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The crazy thing is that if I make a phone call from home and I'm not using my cell phone,  I'm calling out of Skype.  I don't think of it.  Yeah, me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I rarely use my cell phone anymore.  I use Skype all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The only thing I use my landline for on a day-to-day basis is conference calls where I have dialing in at 800 number.  Because we have bridges.  Everybody in our company has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think, Alex, you win this because about a third of people in the US don't use a landline.  They use their cell phone in lieu of a landline.  Some of them still have a landline but it's vestigial.  Of people 18 to 24, about a third of people only have cell phones.  They don't have landlines in the house.  So you're right there too.  It's really the older folks who are giving the landlines some credence.  That's a big shift.  That's a big shift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I think as you start to ... When you start having people who are moving around a lot and are used to people ...  That's why.  You want a single line.  You don't want to tell people, this is my cell number and this gets back into my Google Voice.  That's where Google Voice is.  That's exactly where I was going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Daniel just turned ... I've had a Grand Central account.  Oh, you never upgraded?  I've never used it.  Oh, no.  So, yeah.  When I called Daniel, I was like, wow, I have five cell phones.  I need it.  It sounds like it's a very good service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The first big thing for me was moving to where my business card now has my Google Voice number.  That was a big shift over where I'm ready to commit to just giving someone one number.  Now I route some people to my office, some people to my cell phone, some people ...  I can set all of that up on the web.  The fact that you have control over that.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I carry three cell phones around.  It's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Let me ask in the chat room, talk to chat room, if somebody wants to talk about Google Voice.  Who's in there that would like to talk about Google Voice?  Looks like a lot of people.  Jeff Carter says he's using it for your students.  Hi, Jeff.  Welcome to This Week in Tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hi, Leo. How's it going?  It's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So, you're a teacher or a professor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am.  I'm a professor.  Yeah. I teach science, biology, neuroscience, that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And where?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do this here in beautiful Loma Linda, California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Awesome.  So, you have a landline and you have a cell phone, but you use your Google Voice line how?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do. I tell you, I've got at least three different phone numbers.  Google Voice, what it does, what's so great about it, is it allows me to give my students one number.  And it's a number that's not necessarily associated with my personal information.  That being said, what's great about it is when they call me up with an excuse about why they can't quite make it to class that day, it rings up on all of my lines.  Right.  It's pretty handy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And you know what I love, and I don't know if you use this, I have a text message me with the text of the call.  Now, the text is, the voice recognition is not great.  Right.  But I can usually kind of figure out what's going on based on the context.  It gives me enough.  To understand.  Do you use that, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely.  You know, as I get older and my students get younger, I find that they very much prefer to send me a text message.  Yes.  As opposed to using a voicemail.  And what's great is with the Google Voice service is when I reply back to their text message, it reflects the Google Voice number.  Again, protecting my personal...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's nice.  So you call back via Google Voice.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  I think Skype might be a little threatened by Google Voice, frankly, because Google Voice is going to offer cheaper calls to international calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it still needs to be a little bit more, it's still smoother as far as an experience goes to use Skype, I think.  I think that's one of the things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Now, we have to say, I apologize for those of you who are listening and saying, well, darn it, I want Google Voice because they aren't yet public.  I don't know when they're going to do that.  They say they're going to do it.  Right.  But right now, I can't send you an invite, I would.  You're lucky you signed up for Grand Central.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  When beta came out, I signed up for all that crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Every time I see one of those things, I get an invitation from Leo or I get an invitation from somebody else.  I'm always like, oh, I just sign up, put my name in.  Just do it.  Just to reserve a seat.  I never know.  Half of them are out of business, but there are a couple that I've...

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  How about you use Google Voice, Louis, or is that something you're aware of?  I'm aware of Google Voice, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not lucky enough.  Not lucky enough to have it.  The Skype I'm using here, you'll see I get kicked off every 20 minutes.  Why is that?  The iPhone's the best thing.  This happened on other podcasts as well.  We're kind of used to it.  So we watch the time and then in eight minutes, I'll die off and we'll start again.  Who's your internet service provider?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's Comcast, just like everybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a feeling Comcast is screwing with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  If that's true, we don't have it nailed yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We can't complain about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Every 20 minutes is a little too regular, if you ask me.  That's very strange.  It is.  It's very strange.  Wow.  Well, that's good.  I'll just keep an eye out and I'll dial you back.  Carlos, this is another service, fine service from Google that they say they're never offering internationally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's always the other countries that get these kind of services that rolled out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I have friends in Canada.  I used to go to Canada all the time.  Canadians are bitter about the fact that iTunes is Amazon and Hulu and the Kindle.  This must really gripe you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're also locked out of iTunes, not the App Store because the iPhone is a big thing here.  But it's been in Brazil, I don't know, for less than a year.  It's huge.  We can get the apps, but we cannot get tracks from the iTunes stores.  Isn't that ridiculous?  It's not Apple's fault.  It's not Apple's fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not Apple's, not Google's.  It's all of the interrelationships.  We do have credit cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, and I imagine that there's probably a pretty brisk market in credit cards with US addresses.  I know that in Canada that's one way people handle that.  If you have a US address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Of course, we have ways around it.  I have an iTunes account.  I can buy tracks, but it's almost a hack.  You get yourself an American address.  And then you just do it.  People are actually doing it.  Yeah, of course they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And because there's demand for it.  And I guess it's really the record companies, the publishers.  And it's people who are tied to business models that unfortunately are old fashioned.  They're fading out.  They're nationalistic.  And it doesn't make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can see some movement being actually starting here to change this.  We don't get Hulu here.  We don't get Hulu.  But Fox just, yeah, we don't have that.  And actually we are also locked out of Last FM.  Because it's only, I think in the United States or Germany, right?  Yep.  Without pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Pandora too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Love Pandora.  I hate liking songs on friend feed.  Because I know everybody that's outside the US can't listen to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  How about Blip FM?  Can you guys do Blip FM?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sure.  We love Blip FM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, see Blip FM is a way around this.  And we talk to them.  I love it.  It's kind of a Twitter for music.  So you pick the song and you blip it and then it goes on your Twitter or your friend feed.  But the songs are coming from other people's posted MP3s.  So it strikes me as completely highly illegal.  However, they say, we interviewed them on Net at Night.  They say we've got to deal with the record companies.  No, no, it's okay.  So I don't know what they're up to.  But I love Blip FM.  I love Blip FM.  That's a solution for people, international listeners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What about Last.fm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Last.fm, who's just saying, doesn't work in Brazil, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it used to work before they passed that whole new strategy to charge for outside the US and Germany.  Right?  So yeah.  A lot of my friends got really bumped out about that.  A lot of them just simply stopped listening to Last.fm.  They were really, really hooked.  It's a big thing, especially among tech people here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, Jeff, I thank you for being on the show with us.  And say hello to all your students in Loma Vista.  Loma Linda?  Thank you so much for having me on.  Great to talk to you.  Thank you.  Yeah, I think we're big fans of Google Voice.  We look forward to having it available universally.  Hey, here's the final shoe finally dropped after years and years of being the laughing stock of the gaming community.  Duke Nukem Forever is finally, well and truly, officially dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is, I actually, I shouldn't say thank God.  I feel very, very sad for the developers of 3D Realms.  I mean, they've been working on this thing for...  12 years.  12 years?  I'm sorry, I'm not going to laugh.  12 years, 12 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm crying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  12 years.  I'm not laughing.  When I thought enterprise, you know, software development cycles are long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  12 years and finally they just ran out of money.  That's what we call mission creep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think that was the issue.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Take two.  The original was such a good game.  Say again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The original was such a good game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, I love Duke Nukem, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, it got me hooked when I was a kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And, you know, the trailers we saw, we saw a trailer as recently as a year ago for Duke  Nukem Forever that made it look like it was imminent, it looked really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The problem was Forever was actually going to the production cycle.  If they had actually given it a specific time span, it would have been completed, but their  big problem was naming it Forever.  Kind of like the new one next to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Your mistake is a bad name.  Yeah.  Take two says that they retain the publishing rights to Duke Nukem Forever, but they can  confirm that the relationship was a publishing agreement only.  It didn't include providing funds and 3D realms is essentially run out of money.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And evidently this is from the chat room from Phil 404.  It said Duke Nukem is now, it's Duke Nukem for never.  For never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Thank you.  Duke Nukem trilogy, however, continues.  The handheld version continues under development with Apogee and Deep Silver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now some of the, also if you do a little searching around, I think I might have tagged this for  twit, but some of the artwork, some of the folks who got laid off, some of the galleries.  Yeah, release some of that stuff.  They have.  There's some galleries up there.  I don't know how long they'll be there, so if you're listening or watching.  Whatever collateral you've got, release it.  Go check it out, because some of the individual artists I think have released it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Couldn't somebody come along and take an existing engine and say, port it over to that and say,  well, we'll do a open source.  It would be a lot of work.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It would be a lot of work.  You know, and take two isn't, it doesn't have any real reason to make that possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Or as Electronic Arts used to call it, take two billion.  That's what they were going to buy it for.  Wow.  Two billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.  Two billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Let's see here.  We're going to get to some more stories in just a second, but I do want to mention, all  right, this is your chance.  We're going to see one more time if Rachel uses this.  Our next sponsor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is going to be a big curve too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I have to check.  I don't, I think it's, well, I don't want to say it out loud until I know.  Yes, it is.  Go to my PC.  Rachel, do you, oh, she's gone.  She didn't want to.  Oh, wait a minute.  There she is.  Rachel, do you use, go to my PC.  She's going for the hat trick, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have used it.  I actually just used it a couple of weeks ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You're lying.  You're lying to me now.  No, I'm not.  You're, you are, you've actually hit for the hat trick, Rachel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The trifecta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The trifecta.  Tell me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My co-hosts on my show, we were all in different states.  And so we kicked turns editing and it was my co-host in California's turn.  And there were some mix ups with the files and we had to like realign all three of our  tracks back up together.  And she had no idea how to do it.  So she installed it and I went on and taught her how to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Unbelievable.  Isn't that amazing?  There you go.  That's great for tech support.  It's great for remote access to your system.  You know, nobody, nobody these days wants to stay at work any longer than you have to,  especially if you're surrounded by people who are sick with the flu.  You want to go home and if you're sick, you want to be able to stay home.  The internet cafe on my PC lets you do that.  You don't have to be a tech expert.  You figured, Rachel, would you call yourself a tech expert?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Medium.  Did you find it difficult to set up, difficult to use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's very easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's because it's from Citrix.  These guys really know what they're doing there.  Sometimes it takes the biggest, the more the more expert you are, the better you're able  to make something easy to use.  And they've been doing this for years.  Wherever you are in a hotel in New York, on the couch in your living room, an internet  cafe in Borneo at Rachel's house, trying to help her partner.  You can use it.  You can access any program work on any file.  Check your email.  Rachel, you're amazing.  You have used every one of our products here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can lift off all the stuff from Daily Gizwiz that we've bought too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Let me ask you on your podcast, is there any gear that you need for that podcast that you'd  really like to have?  Like a microphone, a recorder, anything I can send you as a gift to thank you for playing  our home game?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  Off the top of my head, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, think about it, Rachel.  Let me give you my email address.  Actually, how am I going to do this?  Because I want to make sure it's actually you.  Well, what is your email address from your podcast?  That would work.  Okay.  So you'll be the only person able to use that address.  GirlsNightOutPodcast.com.  Send me an email, leo at leoville.com.  Tell me what you need or I'm going to send you a prize.  Oh, wow.  Just because you're such a good listener.  You bought everything we sell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My husband uses Spinrite as well.  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Now I have to send you two prizes.  Thank you, Rachel.  It's really great to have you on and I'm glad you use all of these products and you listen  to all these shows.  And good luck with the Girls Night Out podcast.  That sounds great.

Transcript:  I need a new brain.  Can you give me that?  GirlsNightInRadio.com.  You got it.  Thank you, Rachel.  Think about what you need.  A new microphone for one of your co-hosts.  How about a unlimited Go To My PC account?  How about that?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That'd be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  All right.  I'm going to send you that.  We're going to get for you your very own year subscription to Go To My PC.  Absolutely no charge.  Now the rest of you could try it free for 30 days.  Just go to GoToMyPC.com slash twit.  30 days free.  See, everybody who listens gets something.  And I'll send you a year, Rachel, of Go To My PC, GoToMyPC.com.  We thank them so much for their support.  They're really a great company.  I've known them for years and they make a fantastic product.  If you need remote access, that's the way to go.  Rachel, that's so cool.  We're going to do this every show from now on.  I'm just going to get our listeners on here.  So Biz Stone goes on the view.  I am, these Twitter guys.  Oh, don't get me started.  They become movie stars.  So now Biz Stone is on the view with, oh, look.  Got it.  Can't start this story without getting Lewis on.  It's 20 minutes.  They're up.  I got to get Lewis back on because I don't want to do a Twitter story without the FriendFeed guy on here.  Lewis is the biggest FriendFeed evangelist.  Lewis, you don't have an investment or stock in the company or anything, do you?  I have no investment or stock.  You're just a fan of the company, as am I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've been using them for a long time and I recognize their potential very early on.  I was responsible for getting Scoble on there, so I apologize on his behalf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that was you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, but yeah, but Lewis, I think if because I can't remember how I got on, but it probably is because Scoble was using it.  It might have been because of you.  I don't remember exactly when I, but boy, as good as FriendFeed was, this new live real time beta, it's a killer app now.  I mean, this is so awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the rumor.  It's obviously become a great destination for live events.  You can see the chat room just flowing.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  571 comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  FriendFeed, obviously, it really kind of has the two pieces to it.  Number one is your friends.  That's what the friend part is for.  The second part is your feeds, and that can be anything.  It really is a top notch aggregation service, gets all of your details from all the services that you're already on, and then enables a conversation platform.  You know, a lot of people like to say FriendFeed versus Twitter, but Twitter is an important ingredient in FriendFeed.  It really does get those updates from around the web and put them into your feed and let you talk to your friends.  But what it also lets you do is have threaded conversations, comments that last more than 140 characters.  Let you have pictures.  Let you have video.  It just makes sense.  And so it's not one of those situations where you have to choose one or the other, but it's really kind of difference between radio and a color television with cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You sure you don't want to stock in this there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't need to own stock to know it's a good company.  So Twitter's basically got one thing down, and that's text that's short to your friends and following your friends.  And that's it. That's all they do.  They haven't customized really anything in the last two years, with the exception of making sure that the site doesn't crash every 20 minutes, like my Skype connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, you kind of admire them for keeping it simple, right?  But at the same time, the function and you know, some people sometimes people say that FriendFeed is hard to use because its functionality is so, you know, right.  Much right. And I don't find that to be the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would say the same thing, to be honest.  At times I've requested that they find a way to make a lighter version for people who are coming in new.  If I came in today and saw all the features that they have today, it might be overwhelming.  I would have to learn how to hide things, block things, delete things.  If you're used to something like Twitter, where you follow thousands of people, you can't just jump in on FriendFeed and expect to do the same thing because it's a much richer experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, Kim Kardashian can.  Did you see that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She followed 45,000 people. I was one of the lucky ones who didn't get followed, which is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So she, as I understand it, Kim is, of course, Kim is some sort of B grade celebrity with a large mammary glands, which apparently is her key to success.  And there's a reality show on her, I believe.  But I've never heard of the name. But anyway, she was on Twitter, I gather, and then had quite a few followers on Twitter.  Now there's this new thing on FriendFeed where when you join FriendFeed, you can add your Twitter social graph to FriendFeed, all your followers and friends.  Is that what it was, Louis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can log in using your Twitter credentials using OAuth, and in a single click it will check your FriendFeed.  It'll check all of FriendFeed for people who you're already connected to on Twitter and automatically subscribe you to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So that's what happened, right? She got her friends from Twitter, just, she added them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep. So if she already had hundreds of thousands, and I don't know because I obviously don't follow the lady, but if you've got hundreds of thousands of people on Twitter and you happen to have 20 to 40 percent of them already checking out FriendFeed,  then she would have been automatically subscribed to dozens of thousands of people.  The interesting coverage around that was that less than 1 percent of those people she'd followed followed her back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, if you look at her feed, isn't that much going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, a lot of people tend to use FriendFeed as kind of a dumping ground for their tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's the thing you really don't want to be doing on FriendFeed because people immediately sus.  You want to see if she's got 905 subscribers, 45,000 subscriptions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's a 2 percent return, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So what that means is if she goes to FriendFeed, it's going to scroll by at a pretty rapid clip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I don't think she's visiting, to be honest.  One thing, if you go back up to the top, it should show how many comments and likes she's ever made.  None.  And since they don't display, the answer is none.  Zero.  So she's not the best person to give the good FriendFeed experience.  If you would type in either your own or my own address, you could get a better idea for the type of things that do occur.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's one of the neat things that you can do with FriendFeed is you can see, you can kind of, for instance, you can see Scoble's FriendFeed, right?  You can see what it looks like for him.  And what is it?  Friends slash Scoble-izer?  Is that how I would do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you would go to FriendFeed.com slash Scoble-izer.  And there's a link in there that would show who he is subscribed to.  OK.  I'll just side with you.  Twenty three thousand subscriptions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And if I click that, will I see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you click it, you get all the names.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So I could see who he's following.  Right.  But then I can also see his stream.  I could see how fast it goes.  I'm trying to remember what it...  I think it's friends.  I mean, it's kind of fun.  He did this to me once.  He said, well, type this in and then you could see how fast my stream goes.  And it's kind of like scary.  He did a quick video last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  That was just fascinating to me.  I'm always curious of how he handles the noise.  Well, he's a librarian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He's a different person from everybody else.  Anyway, this started because there was a really incredibly stupid rumor from Fast Company.  I mean, just stupid rumor that Apple was going to buy Twitter.  Which doesn't make any sense.  Made no sense.  Everybody.  I mean, you know, I'll fall for these.  I'm pretty bad at falling for these.  This is a big story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, I thought Jared was dead because Kevin Rose tweeted it out.  You fall for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.  I didn't fall for that one.  But I didn't.  And this one, this Apple's gonna buy Twitter, immediately said, I don't care who they know  or what source they've got.  That's ridiculous.  And of course, Biz Stone goes on The View and tells Baba Wawa, we're not for sale.  Which is what I always thought.  I'm just getting started.  Well, I always thought that.  First of all, Ev made plenty of money selling Blogger to Google.  Right.  He's sitting on a pile of money, a pile of dough.  He doesn't need to monetize.  You know, he's gonna make, it's gonna be more and more valuable.  It's kind of like Mark Zuckerberg.  Why should they sell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So you read what Jack is doing next?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, Jack has a new, Jack Dorsey, who invented the Google Play Store.  Who invented the idea of Twitter and was kind of forced out as CEO of Twitter by Ev just  a few months ago.  What's his new business?  He's got something new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's called Project Squirrel.  That's all I've, there's something on TechCrunch and it's apparently a hardware and a software  device for the iPhone that allows you to convert points of sale.  Yeah, it's a point of sale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You can take credit card.  But they already got that.  It's a big ad that Apple shows a big ad of that all the time.  Like, oh, look, you can take credit card.  I don't even know why I would want to.  Apparently there's some hardware that you can slide the credit card through and it doesn't  need power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, and it looks like an Acorn, which is why it's Project Squirrel.  Silly, silly, silly, silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They might as well add springboard modules if you guys remember those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  That was, who did that?  That's right.  Handspring.  Handspring.  Whatever happened to that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The handspring acquired by Palm, if you remember that.  I actually had one of the first Visor phones.  Visor.  That's what I was trying to remember.  Visor.  I had to fit it on my desk because it wouldn't fit in my pocket.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And you could add all the, you could add the hardware, a little plug-in hardware to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I think that one of the things as far as importing stuff, and I don't know anything  about Project Squirrel, but I know that the one thing about point of purchase is that  you can't use the iPhone, you can't use the iPhone to take pictures of the barcode.  Barcodes.  Because it doesn't focus.  That's why I have a Clarify case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Because now I can do that.  But you can with my G1.  Really?  Oh yeah, you haven't seen this?  This has a little magnifying glass.  He slides over so you can take close-ups.  I just lost mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You lost your Clarify?  I lost the top part of it.  Oh, that's a bummer.  Just like two days ago.  I love the Clarify case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, the G1 can do it.  G1 is a great phone, and you're a G1 user.  Yeah, I do both.  I mean, these are my two development platforms.  Me too.  Well, I don't develop, I just, these are my two.  You have very sparse iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I can't, my problem is?  You know why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I just restored it.  Oh, I was like, I was like.  No, I just restored it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The thing, the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I jail broke my phone and, and I screwed it up.  There's this mode DFU, which stands for what should stand for what you think it stands  for, because the disc is F U'd.  And I, so I jail broke it and it never has been right since I restored it.  It's never been right since.  So finally I did the DFU restore and I'm hoping this will be.  So you want to take a picture or something?  I'm trying to find a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,  a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You've got me one of those books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So yeah, project squirrel.org McNeely says project squire.  No, that's not it.  Become a citizen scientist.  Click here to record your squirrel observations.  I don't believe that's Jack Dorsey's next business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  There was something on tech crunch.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think this was, this was a wag, a wag making a joke.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.  Let me see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, no, no.  It's a really nice thing.  It works with Evernote very nicely if you're going to do a, you know, you want to use the  Evernote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because that's been the big thing that's been missing as far as the being able to just buy,  buy stuff.  Let me try it with the G1.  Being able to just buy stuff from your iPhone.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He's going to show off now.  Brian's going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I've never tried.  I just downloaded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, you got to try the barcode application and look up the thing.  You'd find the cheapest.  It's outrageous.  Yeah.  Lewis, are you an iPhone guy?  I've got mine right here.  When are we going to get a FriendFeed iPhone app?  That's what I want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why don't you don't talk about that?  You kind of the real time does real time doesn't work too well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Friend.com slash iPhone is there.  It's a great improvement over the original mobile app, which was FF to go.com, which  is still good for non iPhone mobiles.  The FriendFeed interface is intended to actually just work in the iPhone, but they have made  it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But I would love to see real time in an iPhone.  That would be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is also a Nambu Nambu is another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I use Nambu too.  Yeah.  But again, not real time.  If you really what we really want is some scrolling.  Nintendo is hot.  More gaming news.  Nintendo's annual profit up eight and a half percent thanks to success of the Wii and the  DS doing much better than even Toyota and Hitachi.  They're actually probably one of the most successful international companies in Japan  right now.  They say they're going to expect a seven point five percent rise in net profits.  What are you doing over there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So no, there is.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, I've used that.  And it's incredible.  So you took a picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'd be threatened by this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, you took a picture of the barcode and it looks it up and finds it online.  In fact, you can be in a bookstore.  Take a picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Amazon should be threatened.  It's borders.  Borders.  Borders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And you take a picture of the barcode and then it says, oh, you could find it cheaper  down the road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and the worst part for me is that I'm that I sit there and take a picture of the  cover of the book because I can send it to Amazon remembers.  And so I look at, oh, I really want this book and take a picture of the cover.  We had an argument over when you should buy a book from Borders online.  And it's some people will order it from Amazon while they're still in the store.  I say that you have to get out to the sidewalk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  All right.  We're going to we're going to wrap this up in a unique way.  This is the volunteer edition of Twit and it's been great.  And I think we should we have so many people in our talk show chat room that I'm just going  to cycle through them.  What's what's your big story of the week?  So we're going to just cycle through the people who have asked to be called on starting with  Ben Gold, your first.  I'm sorry.  It's not you, Ben.  It's fellas.  Fellas.  How do you pronounce it?  Hey, is it fellas?  Feliz?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yep, we're here.  How do you pronounce?  How do you pronounce your handle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It would be fellas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Fellas.  And where are you from fellas?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And what do you think is the big story that we should be covering on Twit this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I don't know.  I'm still thinking about a release candidate and how well it's going.  And some people in the chat room were wondering, still wondering how you thought it was going  to do in terms of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We haven't we haven't mentioned the fact that is actually a big story.  I kind of left out.  Thank you for reminding me that Windows 7 release candidate came out this week.  I'm sure millions have downloaded it.  I haven't seen numbers.  I immediately downloaded.  And I have to say it's I have I was saying the best version of Windows since Windows  I'm now saying the best version of Windows ever.  Wow.  Yeah.  This is a remarkable comeback, I think, from Microsoft.  Now, what made it?  Well, you know, XP was a big improvement over Windows 98.  They went to the NT kernel.  They got some robustness, some multi-user functionality.  You know, a login meant something in XP.  But it looked like a Fisher Price interface.  I mean, it went big, colorful buttons.  It was just goofy.  The search dog.  Give me a break.  The search dog.  You go to search.  A little puppy comes out.  You have to wait for it to come out.  Then you type your search and you have to wait for it to go.  Look, what do they think we are?  Four year old morons.  So XP, not my favorite operating system, not to mention all the security issues.  Vista.  You know, the problem with Vista is it was five years in.  It wasn't done.  And they said, we can't hold on any longer.  So they released it knowing that they were going to be faced with huge.  It was not only heavy, but huge compatibility issues.  And it really hurt Vista.  You know, by the time Service Pack 1 came out, Vista wasn't any lighter,  but at least it worked with everything.  But it was too late.  The perception, the public perception of Vista was this thing is ugly.  It doesn't work.  So they said, I think they did the right thing, which is they said, all right,  we're not going to make any major changes in the core of this thing,  but we are going to polish it up.  We're going to get rid of the bloat.  We're going to make sure it works with everything.  And that's what they've done.  And so really Windows 7 is Vista for all intents and purposes,  with all the rough edges polished off.  It's slick. It's fast.  It's much faster.  It runs fine on a netbook.  You can put it on the Acer.  Oh, man, it runs great.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, in a lot of ways, isn't that what Snow Leopard is going to be for Apple?  That's what Apple...  I don't think it's a coincidence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think what's happening is that operating systems are fairly mature.  There's not a lot of new stuff you could put in one.  This is the time for both Apple and Microsoft to say, let's sit back.  Let's make it.  Let's take what we've got, not add major new features, not change the file system,  but make it better.  Now, what Apple needs to do is they really need to update the file system.  HFS is long in the tooth.  It is not the best file system out there.  I presume moving to ZFS, which is just fantastic,  which is a huge improvement over any file system anybody's ever used.  This is the file system of the future.  Everything that you get with RAID, all the redundancy, the time machine stuff...  Well, you really start moving towards being able to do a cloud of data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  I've got a bunch of drives that are all piped in.  I can pull drives out, put drives in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So we're still HFS on the Mac.  We're still NTFS on Windows.  However, in every other respect, I think it's time to sit back, retrench,  and say, let's make this better.  And that's what they really have done that with Windows 7.  So, fellas, to answer your question, yeah, I think it's great.  Now, I did this on the radio show, and I think I made a mistake  because I think a lot of people started downloading Windows 7.  Some things to remember, it's beta. It's not released yet.  You're going to have to reinstall at some point,  either when it comes out in September or October.  And we know, by the way, that it will be out October 23,  because Acer accidentally told everybody that.  They said, we're going to sell a computer with Windows 7 on it October 23.  So basically, that's pre-announced for Microsoft.  They may even do it before then.  But even if you do install the beta, and by the way, they're not limiting it.  Anybody can get it.  You can download the 32-bit or the 64-bit or both.  You get a serial number. It's going to be good for a year.  It's going to be good through 2010.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I've had a number of friends that go, oh, I wish I could run it.  Well, whether or not you can, you can just go out and get it free for a year.  And it's a Windows operating system, perfectly legitimate. It's wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's an important paradigm shift for Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Any of you guys tried using it on VMware as an image?  Yes.  Does it work well?  I just got my Macbook Pro, and I'm thinking about trying it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm going to tell you. I have got another little thing.  In fact, I'll probably tell you about this on Mac Break Weekly also.  I started using Sun's VirtualBox, which is a free version of Parallels or VMware.  And it's free. It's every bit as good.  And Windows 7 runs great on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and the thing is, this is really right now, if you're going to have a dual boot machine,  this is a great way to do it because you get it free for a year.  Free, for a year.  So if you're going to get VMware or Parallels or Sun, the thing to do is do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So now you get either with the boot system. What is it?  Bootcamp.  Bootcamp. Or with VirtualBox from Sun, you get a completely free.  And Windows 7, Macintosh users get Windows for free.  For a year.  For a year. Now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I doubt that there are going to be a lot of them sliding over.  In a year. It's going to stop running every two hours.  It's going to have the Lewis Gray effect.  As you're starting to try to figure out how much are you going to actually use it,  because there are a lot of, all of our new machines, all are dual boot.  And there are definitely legitimate reasons we're going over to Windows.  Now, I have to admit, we're still on XP. So we'll move on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is time. I really think this is the program that you're going to want to use.  It is a really awesome program.  Fellas, thank you for reminding me.  And yes, I do think it's the best version of Windows ever in terms of performance, reliability, security.  I mean, if you're still using XP for security alone, you need to move to Windows 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm not crazy about IE8, but so what? You put Firefox on there and you're fine.  That's the first thing I do.  Thank you, fellas, for calling. I appreciate it.  No problem at all, Leo. You're great.  All right. Take care. Thanks for listening.  Thanks for being on our first volunteer tweet.  Element 1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Hey, Leo. Element J.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  J. I'm sorry. One looks like J to me because I'm old.  Where are you calling from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I'm in San Antonio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Did we miss a big story, Element J?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  No, you just hit on it with Windows 7.  I'm just surprised that out of my closet I dug up a six-year-old ThinkPad that I had, installed Windows 7 on it,  and completely just amazed at the performance that I got out of that six-year-old laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Wow. That's a testimony.  And then it makes you wonder, well, why couldn't they do that before?  What were they doing with Vista?  It took them five years and they came out with a pig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think when you're writing fast and you're adding features, it's a lot harder to get back to clean code, to get back straight to the metal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So maybe that's the key. You're a developer, Brian.  The key is you sit back and you say, okay, let's fix this.  We've got our template. We've got our roadmap. Let's go back. Let's sit back and fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, I suspect that Vista got so bloated as a project that it became almost impossible to manage.  And when you're a developer and you have to write unit tests...  Lean into the mic there.  ...functional tests, unit tests, it makes it really hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Now you're using a netbook there. Windows 7 would run great on that. That's Atom-based, right?  You're a fan of the Atom processor. You said something kind of provocative before we began.  You thought Atom was going to be a revolution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think the Atom processor is a game-changing device.  Why?  Because I get seven hours of battery life with the N280 chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What? You're getting seven hours? You're using the EPC?  This is the brand new 1000HE.  Is it a six cell or a nine cell?  It's a six cell battery.  You're getting seven hours?  Just about. Between six and seven.  Wow. I have to trade in because I haven't had this I win and I'm not getting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I've had it on for the entire time I've been here and I still have an hour and a half left.  That's awesome.  I was on the entire time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, you were sitting out in the... Yeah, wow, that's impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And it was 400 bucks. It was 400 bucks and the day I got it...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's the new Asus EPC. What's the model number?  1000HE.  Oh, the HE. Okay.  Amazon is where I bought... I bought five of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Not for yourself, for your employees.  Yeah. And I dropped it the first day on concrete, literally.  And it chipped off a piece, but it didn't crash XP.  Lean in.  It still works.  Use that mic.  I'm still using it.  That's your mic.  And I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Element J, you had a question?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  No, I was just wondering, Brian, what kind of battery life he gets on the G1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh yeah, well he... Brian and I both use the G1.  Okay, so...

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Sucks.  iPhone G1...  Suck.  I charge them up in the morning and they don't last me to the evening.  Even the iPhone you're not... I'm getting better battery life on my iPhone.  I... No, I think I get better battery life on the G1.  Really?  Personally. I don't know if my iPhone just sucks or what, but I can't get through a day with either of them.  And I'm using both of them for similar things.  I'm posting pictures of the internet.  I'm browsing friend feed.  I'm doing tweets, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I love this software. I love Android.  I really think that this is just bad hardware.  Now we're going to see this week, in fact, T-Mobile says version 1.5 Cupcake,  code name Cupcake of the Android operating system will be out.  I don't know if I'd really name my version.  I don't know. Is that the official name, Cupcake? I don't know.  That's what they're calling it.  That could make a big difference in a lot of things, including, as we've seen with the iPhone, it could be battery life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, in 3.0 iPhone, apparently that's the big...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I was impressed with 2.2. 2.2 got much better battery life for me.  I think you're getting unusually bad battery life.  I think I am.  Yeah. But not on the G1. That's just terrible.  Do you... Alam and Jay, are you thinking of buying an Android phone or...?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  No. I got one when they came out back in October.  Oh.  I got one because of the battery life, and I stuck with my iPhone 3G.  But I get some poor battery life also on my iPhone.  I go the whole day and die by 1 o'clock in the afternoon.  I'm not using it. I'm just going to put it in my pocket all day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  All we ask... Look, it's a smartphone.  It's not going to be like your Motorola rocker.  It's going to... You're going to have to... But all we ask is we get through the day.  Yeah. It's an internet device.  Just let me get through the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And don't tell me to turn off features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, without turning off Wi-Fi.  I find that with my second generation iPhone, if I charge it every night...  And I don't charge it every night.  Now, if I turn off Wi-Fi, I can go three days, four days.  But with Wi-Fi on, I typically...  I never have an issue where it runs out of battery inside of a one-day period.  Unless I'm playing Minesweepers too much.  Right.  Is that with Wi-Fi and 3G off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, no. With Wi-Fi and 3G on, unless I'm playing Field Runners too much on a bus or on a plane, I will not run out in a day.  That's interesting. It sounds like there's some real variation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I mean, because I don't play games.  I use it as an internet. I browse the internet. I send SMS messages.  I do GPS. I do maps. And that's about it.  Yeah.  And I can't get through a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Element J, I thank you for being on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Thanks, Leo. Appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Thank you for calling.  I think we lost Lewis once more and it doesn't seem to be getting back through.  So Lewis Gray, I thank you for being here at lewisgray.com.  And next time, you know, you just got to shout out.  You just got to yell if you want to be on this show.  Right, Carlos? You just yell. You just say, I got something to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, of course. Always.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, it's always been like as it ever has been.  It's a little harder when there are people in studio as Brian and Alex and I are if you're a person on Skype.  And so I apologize for making a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a different interaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah. But I thank you for being here. I really appreciate it, Carlos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, thanks for having me.  It's great to talk to you.  And I'll send you some cachaÃ§a, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't know if I want any. It sounds like it's going to burn a hole in my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You need it with.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but what you need is the proper amount of sugar and limes.  All right. And then you get a fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You need the green limes, not the yellow ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Absolutely. The little green limes.  I can make it. I can make it.  Take some sugar. You take some little green limes.  You squeeze the limes, mix in the sugar.  You take the cachaÃ§a, you throw it out and you drink the lime juice and sugar.  No, no, no. I'll make you some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Drink the whole thing.  It's so good.  It's one of the most popular drinks around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When I was in Brazil, I have to admit, I would think I was comfortably numb most of the time on caipirinhas.  Caipirinhas are a great drink, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  After the second caipirinha, it's all downhill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's why you drink them on the beach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  How is it that your English is so good? Did you study English in school?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I lived in Oklahoma.  There you go.  With the rednecks.  That'll do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, it's been great having you on the show.  I really appreciate your being here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thanks. Thanks all of you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Our volunteer Twit, Carlos Xavier.  He's on Twitter, Carlos Gustavo.  One word, follow him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Please. Twitter followers.  He needs Twitter followers.  Trying to beat Ashton Kutcher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, that would be a great goal is just to pick somebody out of the blue and say, let's beat Ashton Kutcher.  Let's take Twitter back.  Release a press release.  Leo Lepore.  We should do that.  Not me.  Carlos.  Not me.  Carlos.  Yes.  Just some random person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Follow me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Thank you, Carlos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay. Thank you so much.  Take care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We're going to hang up on Carlos.  I have a few more people in our talk shoe, though.  Let's go quickly to our next talk shoe caller, and that's Flargo.  Hey, Flargo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hello, everyone.  It's good to have you.  Where are you called from today?  I've been listening for a while.  I'm up in Seattle.  I'm a listener.  I started following you about five months ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, thank you.  We're welcome to the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So everyone else seems to be talking about Windows 7, and while that's a big deal, I'm  actually going to chime in on Duke Nukem.  I've been following that game for over 10 years, and I never really hoped that it would come  out, but it's kind of little tears for me to finally be canceled.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean, that's a heartbreaker.  Although it was the butt of many a joke.  I mean, I think we all saw the writing on the wall here.  My jokes included.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Duke Nukem forever.  That was the mistake.  It was the name.  Did not finish.  Did not finish.  Well, it's great to talk to you, Flargo.  We appreciate your being here, and thanks for listening to the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I appreciate you being there.  Nice to hear from you all.  Take care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Bye-bye, Flargo in Seattle.  Now, Datalore.  Hey, Datalore, where are you calling from?  Dublin, Ireland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's nice to talk to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Thank you for calling.  It's kind of late at night.  We appreciate you staying up late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or early in the morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's the case, maybe.  I hope you don't have to work in the morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually do, believe it or not, but I'm working on a college project tonight, so you  can feel sorry for me now.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, are there any stories on your mind that we missed or anything you want to comment  on and what we've talked about so far?  Yeah, mostly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was an article that I came across yesterday on CNET regarding the European Union wanting  to make software makers liable for their code.  What you were talking about, like with the trouble with Vista and stuff like that, I  know the BSA aren't really kind of going ahead with any plans.  They're actually criticizing it.  But I think, personally, I think software makers, software developers should be liable  for their code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, that's going to...  Maybe you're right.  I mean, maybe kind of morally and ethically they have some responsibility, but my goodness,  if you're considering a software business and you know that you could be sued if your  code doesn't live up to somebody's expectations, that's going to put a pretty big chill on  the business.  Look at, Brian, you're a developer.  What do you think of that idea that you should be liable?  What if companies sued you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, they wouldn't sue me.  They would sue the company I work for.  Right.  Maybe in the open source community, people can be held liable if they contribute a piece  of code that blows chunks or brings down a site.  Every time you open a piece of code, it says, we're not liable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Don't...  However you use this...

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Every time you install a piece of software, there's a checkbox and you have to agree to  the terms.  Those terms typically spell out the service level agreements for that type of thing.  And it's not any one single developer that's going to be held liable.  If I check in a piece of code, it breaks Bank of America's financial transaction system,  I'm not going to get sued.  My company is going to get sued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So here's the point.  Commissioners Vivian Redding and Maglena Cunneva say that consumers have protection for physical  product failings.  If you buy a tire and the tire fails, you can sue the manufacturer.  Why shouldn't software makers be liable in the same way?  I have to ask you a data lure.  Sometimes I feel like the EU commissioners are very anti-business.  Is that something typically European or...  I mean, here in America, business rules, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, it depends.  I work as an IT manager, so I've got things that I need to make sure that they're reliable,  particularly like protection, security and IT virus.  And if those products don't live up to their expectations, my manager director would have  a canary and he'll want to point the finger at somebody.  And I think that's the problem is that people who are responsible for this need to be able  to point the finger at someone.  And there has to be some sort of consumer protection, whether it be consumer or business  protection.  I don't think it's easy just to kind of let this go because particularly with antivirus  software, like where we protect it with free antivirus software.  We all know that if we download AVG free, for example, thinking about our machines,  it's not going to be as resilient as North or Mac.  Right.  You know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  BSA director of public policy, Francisco Minioranz said, unlike tangible goods, creators of  digital content cannot predict with a high degree of certainty both the product's anticipated  uses and its potential performance.  He says we shouldn't be held to the same standards as a toaster is.  You know what you're going to do with a toaster.  Software can be used in a variety of situations.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When you build a car, you have a you know, if you drive it off road, you know, that's  kind of they're saying, well, that's not what you're off the hook.  And in many ways, there's on a PC, there might be 20, 20 or 30 different variations of what  that software has to run against.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I tell you, I don't think this maybe would hurt commercial software.  You know, Microsoft just, you know, this is their business, but it's going to kill open  source software.  If you're in it, by the way, they want it to extend open source software as well.  If you're an open source developer and you know you could be sued if somebody uses your  code and has a problem, you're not going to make you're not going to make your code available.  So I think the unintended consequence of this is I mean, I agree consumers should be protected,  but the unintended consequence of this is to kill open source software.  And I don't think the EU commissioners are aware of that at all.  Do you agree, DataLore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I would have to agree with that.  But at the end of the day, like it's really what you pay for.  If you get something free, you're not going to expect it to be to be that resilient.  Do you know what I mean?  At the end of the day, it's more about the paid for software, the software you depend on.  Let's say if you go open office and stole your machine and it dies, fair enough.  You know, you can download this one.  You're able to take control of it, open source software.  I guess a court would recognize that too, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Would say, well, look, you didn't pay for it.  What do you expect?  You can't sue the developer here.  Yeah.  Although they explicitly say this, we want this to cover open source software.  Hey, great subject.  I'm glad you brought that update, Allure.  That's a very interesting point.  I think, unfortunately, we miss a lot of stories out of Europe.  We tend to be a little bit US centric because it is a was originally a US only podcast.  But I'm glad that we have listeners in Dublin and really appreciate your being here.  I'll do my best for you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No worries.  Thank you, Data Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Take care.  I think we're going to have to.  All right, take care.  We're going to have to wrap this up.  We have many, many, many, many, many, many more callers, but we really have made this  the longest tweet in history.  So, but it's a volunteer tweet.  It should be longer.  Exactly.  Alex Lindsay is at the Pixelcore.  Pixelcore.tv is where the podcasts live, soon to be a Squarespace site.  Pixelcore.com is the place to find out about his guild of multimedia artists, the kind  of people who make Star Trek possible.  It's Alex.  Always great to have you.  We'll see you on MacBreak Weekly on Tuesday.  Two days.  In just a couple of days.  And I really want to thank you for coming up and leaping into the breach, Brian Daniel  Eisenberg.  You didn't know that you were going to be on the show, but we appreciate your being  here.  InfinitelyMeta.com is your company and also your Twitter handle.  Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, thank you very much for having us.  It's been a pleasure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Thanks for being here.  I thank everybody who watched the show, who participated in the chat rooms, who participated  in Friend Feed.  We had 739 comments.

See you later.  Good night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Good night.  All right.  And here's a Star Trek spoiler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Everybody shout out your Star Trek spoiler right now.  The red shirt guy dies.  I think that's the name of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tweet 194, the red shirt guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
