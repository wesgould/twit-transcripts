Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which ones are the best?  I'm gonna hear Enrique.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Enrique?  There you go.  Now the viewers are gonna be very bunny- Maeve.  Come on audience, remember who's the eigenen son of the division, should I be there or  This Week in Tech, episode 144, from May 26th, 2008.  The FBI vs. the Internet.  This Week in Tech is brought to you by Audible.com.  For your free audiobook, visit Audible.com slash twit.  And by listeners like you.  Thanks for your donations.  It's time for This Week in Tech.  We are gonna talk about tech and nothing but tech.  Except if some kids come in the room and then we might talk about kids.  And if John has to leave to do some pulled pork, we might talk about barbecue.  And maybe a little Twitter, but other than that.  I am Leo Laporte joining us right now.  Denise Howell, we're so glad to have you.  You took some time on your vacation and I really appreciate it, Denise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sir, my pleasure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Denise does, of course, This Week in Law, which is really a great podcast on the Twitter  the law of the Internet.  And she's a very well known as a blogger for many years at Bag and Baggage and now at Logarhythms,  which is her blog column for ZDNet, which is blogs.znet.com slash Howell.  And in fact, you talk about Twitter on this one, but we won't get into that.  Every time I say the word, we get in trouble.  Also here, the real Dvorak, John C. Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, Leo, I can see why you don't want to talk about Twitter because there was this  contest.  Oh, yeah, that.  That ended today.  Yeah.  Did I win?  Yes, of course you did.  You know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so I actually want to apologize because I ended the show on a very negative note last  week and I feel so bad about it.  And Kevin and I have kissed and made up.  And I said a foolish thing.  I was, as Valleywag said, drunk and out of control.  In an attempt to win this stupid horse race on Hubdub, I said, if you follow me and you  unfollow Kevin, if you follow me and Dvorak and you unfollow Kevin, we'll put you in this  contest.  And then I heard from a sweepstakes attorney that that really wasn't a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that was setting off some bells and whistles in my head as you were saying it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So can I take it back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the whole thing, if you if it's actually humor, I think you have a lot more leeway.  It really was.  I was just fooling around.  And also, the fact of the matter is, and I can reveal this now.  Well, let me reveal it later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Save it for the end of the show right after the Audible commercial.  Would you do that?  Yeah.  Let me put it down a little note here.  But we are going to we are going to build the ultimate gaming machine in June as part  of our kind of launch of the twit live video stream.  We will build it.  We will build it with your input.  We will, in fact, give it away.  I just don't want to frankly, I don't want to give Twitter a bunch of traffic.  I mean, that's silly.  So we'll figure out a better way to do it.  So I apologize for anybody who unfollowed Kevin Rose.  Please follow him.  It's actually there's still time.  No, there's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's over midnight.  Besides that, you already pulled ahead by like 1500.  It's like it's too late.  You can't catch up.  Oh, I'm sorry, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, he's going to be number one tomorrow.  So it doesn't really matter.  I just wanted to make it to today.  No, no, no, he's not going to be number one tomorrow.  Enough silliness.  He's a really a very special guest.  I'm really thrilled to have him on.  Brewster Kahle is an Internet pioneer.  He was with Thinking Machines in the early days of the Internet.  MIT graduate.  He created Waze.  W-A-I-S was an early search tool, kind of pre web search tool for the Internet.  He has since gone on to create the Internet Archive.  Its goal, and I think a very laudable goal, to archive the Internet.  Terabytes a day being saved.  You may have used the Wayback Machine, which is kind of a user interface to it, but he  saves much more than you can even see on the Wayback Machine so that future generations  can know what stupid stuff we were up to, including Twitter, including surprised Hedgehog  and all the other stuff.  Brewster recently was in the news.  We're going to talk about that just a second.  Brewster, I just want to I want to I'm thrilled to welcome you to this week in tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you.  It's good to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did I get that all right?  Did I make any mistakes in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not one, not one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember we had you on the screensavers with your print mobile, which was a really  cool idea.  It was a print on demand book mobile.  So people would go in there.  They would look at books.  I guess it was from Gutenberg.  Pick a pick a public domain book and you had a very fast printer in there and you could  print it and bind it and give it to them.  Right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we've been scanning hundreds of thousands of books.  And yes, the idea of having a print on demand book mobile, they're up and running now in  Africa, Egypt, India.  They're still good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So people can get books when they want them.  What a great idea.  What a great idea.  Well, I'm going to talk about there's two books related stories, two stories related  to Brewster.  One is books.  Microsoft announced on Friday, I was kind of surprised.  Google had been announced this Google Print project to scan books in and it was very controversial.  In fact, John, you and I did a special episode talking about Google Print and the controversy  and how silly it was these publishers were trying to preserve these rights against the  overall interest of people.  And I guess Google is still doing it.  But Microsoft said, hey, if Google can do it as usual, if Google can do it, we can do  it.  And had a similar project.  And I know Brewster, how are you involved with the Microsoft scanning project?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we started a project called the Open Content Alliance and Yahoo and Microsoft as  HP and Adobe all participated to try to build a basically public access to the public domain.  And these different companies participated in different ways.  Yahoo helped kick it off and fund some of the early scanning.  And Microsoft has put in money to scan over 300,000 books to try to have basically the  public domain accessible by all as opposed to Google's project, which is in fact to lock  down the public domain.  Oh, really?  So that only it's available through their own search engine and their search engine  only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the Google Content Alliance was to build basically an open collection of library books  that are accessible to all.  And actually, my hat is off to them.  They put in millions and millions of dollars into the Internet Archive scanning system.  And we're now scanning in 13 libraries.  And when they bowed out on Friday, they released any restrictions on those books.  There's no restrictions at all.  And also any claim they had to any of the equipment that had been put in all of these  libraries, they also said, just please just keep going.  Oh, that's great.  Which actually, I think is the right thing.  Both what Yahoo started out thinking and now Microsoft is back around to is their navigation  companies.  They should basically be a navigation company as opposed to a book publisher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, Bruce, Bruce, let me just stop you there for a second.  Couple of things.  One observation is that the Microsoft scanning, which took place actually part of their big  push was over here at the University of California in Berkeley.  I thought that what they came up with as a final result was better than the Google product  by quite a bit.  You could go into their site and you could download complete PDFs of the books and you  could search them in different kinds of ways.  And you could separate them out from the public domain available to everyone and the ones  that are more restricted.  The Google thing was more kind of a mess.  You couldn't figure out what was going on.  And you'd be in some book that you'd be reading and then you just couldn't read.  You can't read this page for some unknown reason.  But they did have this disclaimer on it that you can't use these books for anything, which  I thought was kind of weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was that a sop to the publishers who hated the whole Google idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no.  When they started out, they basically went with the complete open way for the first year  and then they thought that they were leaving too much on the table.  For the second year that they did a bunch of scanning, they said that basically you  can't put it in another commercial search engine, which we all thought was kind of a  weird idea.  So you couldn't basically go and have their books in another commercial search engine.  Now you could prevent that, I'm not quite sure.  But that was what they said.  And they released any of those restrictions completely.  So the public domain is now completely the public domain.  And when you clicked on one of those downloadable PDFs, the disks that were spinning were at  archive.org.  So all those books came from archive.org, or at least all the public domain ones.  They also did deals with publishers to go and have information available from them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So those books are still going to be online though, right?  Yeah, they're at archive.org.  Well actually, I just right now went to live, I mean the URL for people out there is books.live.com.  And now when I type in the book search there, does that throw me over to your servers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, books.live.com is searching their collection, including the publisher collection, and displaying  books sort of in their on-screen Ajax-like interface.  But if you click on the download the PDF, it comes from archive.org.  And their site, they said, is going to go dark.  They're going to take that offline.  Which I think shows some of the reason why we don't really necessarily want the only  library in the world to be on a commercial company.  Even a well-funded and established company such as Microsoft, is they can make a decision  that it's not in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This actually brings me right back to software as a service and all the rest of these schemes  where people get dependent on something and then somebody somewhere in an executive suite  decides to pull the plug on it.  The next thing you know, you go in there the next day and all the stuff is gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, the idea that the intellectual discourse of humankind should be on only one or two  corporations' shoulders, I think is Orwellian.  I think what Microsoft and Yahoo have done is absolutely the right thing.  It's trying to kickstart the library system.  And frankly, it's like having millions of dollars of VC funding for us to get all of  the book scanning systems in place, debug, rolling, and gushing at a thousand books a  day.  But now it's up to the public sphere to take over the operations of this.  So it does mean that we're going to have to scurry pretty fast to go and try to fill  in the funding that's now missing from Microsoft.  But the Sloan Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation, there's libraries in the Boston area where  at the Library of Congress are all funding their own scanning into this.  But it doesn't make up the millions that Microsoft has been putting into it.  So we are absolutely going to be going out and looking for funding.  So in the short term, it's really inconvenient.  In the long term, I think it's the absolute right thing.  Let's go and have libraries supported by the public infrastructure.  And you can build any kind of search engine, all sorts of wacko, weirdo, interesting.  Let's have a Google a month come out with all sorts of different kinds of features,  all built on top of the public domain.  Let's not lock up the public domain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So when's the Microsoft site going dark, do you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't know.  Has Google picked up the slack here?  In other words, where is Google in all of this?  They're no longer keeping it as a silo, though.  They're opening it up.  Can they help out in this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're scanning on their own and they've put contractual restrictions, such as even  the copies that go back to the libraries.  The libraries can't even make those available in bulk to the public.  So if you're doing research or education, you want to download a bunch of books to do  some comparisons, the libraries are contractually restricted from keeping you from the public  domain.  So and forever.  So we see this as kind of a problem.  And so we've been really pushing on building an open system.  Microsoft has helped.  Yahoo has helped.  We're looking for others to help.  Luckily the libraries are up for it.  We've got 80 libraries that we're working with as part of the Open Content Alliance,  and we're building this collection.  So anyway, we're out to try to find more funding to fill in for where Microsoft has left off.  But we're very thankful that they've basically put the millions into getting this system  really deployed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was in Egypt in January and they were very proud of the Library of Alexandria, which  of course is the great library, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world that was  burned down.  And now they're creating a digital Library of Alexandria, which is a great idea.  They're part of this project too, is that right Brewster?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely.  We've got them through the Million Books Project, five scanners that are scanning Arabic literature.  We get all of that.  They get our books.  If you go into the Library of Alexandria, which I really recommend, it's just gorgeous,  and look to the right, on the first floor behind glass is where the Internet Archive  is.  We've put a copy of the Internet Archive there and they've paid for all of that.  And we're taking copies of their stuff.  If there's one lesson from the original Library of Alexandria, which is probably most famous  for, well, burning, is don't just have one copy.  And so we're working there.  We've got a partial replica in Amsterdam.  And if there are a couple more replicas around the world, I think we really could make it  a couple centuries before.  Basically, our library and those others all burn enough such that we lose the digital  age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Brewster, what does it cost to scan one book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It costs 10 cents a page.  If you take your average book as being 300 pages, that's $30.  That's a lot.  And what that, well...  I'm surprised, actually.  It costs more than that if you're building a library.  If you take a library building and the place to put a book costs more than $30 to put one.  And so we can go and scan that, OCR it, run it through optical character recognition so  that it's searchable, put it in lots of different formats, make it available on the net on two  continents, and it costs 10 cents a page.  So 10 cents a page, or if you want a million book library, it'd be $30 million.  That's the cost of a small city library for one year.  And you could have not only that million books for that city, but for the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Infinite perfect copies, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they're great copies.  And they're...  They're way less top-tier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Infinite perfect copies they're not.  I've looked at these books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well are you OCRing them as well, or are you just getting images of the page?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're getting images of the page and then we OCR them so that the words are there.  And if you search on them, you pull up a page and it bolds that section of the page.  It highlights that part of the page.  And there are people that are going and correcting the OCR as part of the reCAPTCHA project from  the CMU guy, Louis Van Naan.  And so anyway, it's really great to be seeing people.  It's kind of...  And we're also working with Gutenberg.  And so the Gutenberg people are taking these books and correcting them to make them into  as good ASCII representations.  And it's a commons.  We're also...  We've got OpenLibrary.org, which is an early, early beta site, but worth checking out.  OpenLibrary.org.  And it's one webpage for every book ever published.  It's a Wikipedia of books.  We think this thing is going to be absolutely killer.  We've loaded it up with 13 million library card catalog records.  And I think at this point it's got maybe 200,000 full text of books.  And the idea is to have it so people can cooperate to go and put these together.  We're linking them to reviews.  We're linking them to where you can buy them, where you can borrow them from, how you can  download, whether they're available from Google or where they're available full text so you  can actually download them without them being crippled.  All these sorts of things are coming up on the OpenLibrary site.  It's a big community site based around books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Brewster, how are you dealing with the copyright considerations and the uproar that Google  confronted when they launched their library project?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We work pretty well with, well, pretty much everybody concerned.  What we're...  Well, we got the area of book scanning going mostly based on out of copyright materials.  So there are not copyright issues.  There are owner's rights issues because these books are in people's collections and you  have to get access to them and do they want to put restrictions on them, etc., etc.  And we've worked on that pretty well through the Open Content Alliance.  So for out of copyright works, we're really on a roll.  If we can find people to pay 10 cents a page, then these libraries will allow us to scan  them and make them available on the net for free as long as there's attribution, which  fair enough.  They've spent billions of dollars building up these collections.  Then there's the out of print works.  Those sort of break up into orphan works and that sort of thing.  And we came up with the term orphan works.  And orphan works are now...  There's legislation pending in the Senate and the House in the United States to free  the orphans, make it so that the orphans are...  These are works that are under copyright.  You can't find anybody.  They're commercially unviable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is very controversial legislation.  Actually, I want to get into that subject because that's a fascinating subject.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The orphan works, we're moving along on that.  We're also on the out of print domain.  We're looking to lend books, lend books over the internet, just in the same way that libraries  have always lent books.  In print works, these are the commercially unviable...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The publishers are happier if you lend, then give.  That's to the publisher's interest.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, libraries have always lent books.  And especially the out of print works, those are the commercially unviable ones, or at  least currently unviable.  In print works, we really hope that publishers themselves are going and making them available  in some way.  They've been slow, but they're starting to do it.  So what we'd really like is having hundreds of search engines being able to provide access  to the materials that are out of copyright and out of print that are in libraries, like  Open Library, and you can get to them that way.  And the in print works are available from the publishers or from people like Amazon,  book sellers.  If we go and put those three pieces together, out of copyright, out of print, and in print  together, and a seamless system, then we've really got something.  Until then, we're just going to have lawsuits and snippets and all sorts of other bad ideas  that we'll all be thankful to pass on from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's talk a little bit about the Orphan Works Act.  Larry Lessig has gone on record saying, it solves a very real problem, but it's a very  bad law.  It's moving.  It seems to be fast-tracked.  It looks like Congress.  There are two different bills, one in the House and one in the Senate.  It looks like Congress wants to get this made law before it is adjourned.  And I know a lot of content creators, illustrators or photographers in particular,  feel that it is an onerous requirement, this diligent search.  Denise, have you been following this Orphan Works issue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, and it's been moving so rapidly.  It really has sort of slipped right by me.  Unfortunately, I need to get more up to speed on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Larry's contention is that it's going to create a whole class of, a whole new business,  essentially, of people who are there to do the, quote, diligent search.  They're going to make money on it, but it doesn't really solve the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know what speed means.  This thing was brought up years ago, and the Copyright Office, to their credit,  held hearings on Orphan Works and got input from the studios, from all sorts of photographers,  lots and lots of people.  And there are about 700 formal replies to the Copyright Office calls, and they had hearings  around the country.  Those are fascinating reading, actually.  It's, you know, it's a little dry, but there are museums, libraries,  filmmakers going and saying what the issues are around Orphan Works.  And where I think that I agree with Larry is, let's go back to Founders Copyright.  I think that Ben Franklin was actually a pretty smart guy.  He might be actually smarter, who knows, than the current lobbyists that are helping  put together these laws.  So if we go back to Founders Copyright, 14 years renewable once, then I think we'd be  in a much better shape.  Or even just give us the law before 1976, say Richard Nixon's copyright, and we'd be  much better shape in this digital era.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As opposed to Sonny Bono's copyright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the 76 Copyright Act was just a disaster.  Anyway, so the...  I agree with Larry on that.  But the Orphan Works legislation would allow at least libraries and archives to start  making these works available, we think, anyway.  It depends on what happens as it goes through the meat grinder of the House and the Senate,  to basically make bulk access to out of print material available in the net.  And basically do a notice and take down.  If somebody wants to say, hey, I still have copyright to that, take it down off your  library site, we'd be perfectly happy.  So anyway, as best I can tell, that's what's going on here.  So is it the best law?  No.  Is it better than 1976 and Sonny Bono and all those sort of lobbyist fueled works?  Yes.  So anyway, we'd be thrilled to have whatever copyright reform that we can get in these  dark days of lobbyist controlled legislation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of what you're doing is constrained by copyright law.  And in fact, you're collecting materials that are right now copyrighted.  And I presume that keeps you from putting them on the way back machine and making them  visible and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The way back machine are our web pages.  We take a snapshot of every website and every page, every image, everything on every website,  every two months.  And we have since 1996.  And that if you go to archive.org and type in a URL, you'll see all of the past versions.  And if you click on one of those, you see that and then you click around and you're  surfing the web as it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You publish everything though?  I thought you didn't publish everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, we publish everything.  There's a six month time delay on the donations of the web pages from Alexa internet.  So that you won't see the most recent, but everything we've got, we put up.  Except for those that things that have people have said they don't want to be served.  So if people put a robot exclusion up on their website, we retroactively obey that.  Or if they send their email and say, you know, that was my old blog and it's referencing  my ex partner and you know, I don't want that there.  Then we take it out of the way back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you don't worry about copyright issues then with this material?  I mean, this stuff's copyrighted material.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are the things in the way back machine?  Yeah, everything.  Yeah.  As I understand it, copyright is a little beyond me, but yeah, no, it's at least recent materials.  So a lot of it probably is.  So what we do is we basically make it available like in a library.  And we do notice and take down on it.  And so, and that's how the web is always worked in terms of the search engine, the like.  And so it's generally working.  So what we'd like to do is that in more circumstances, but different media types have different modes around them.  They have different traditions around them.  So with the books, we've been going along the lines that we already outlined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, the thing is there, Leo, is that there's also some fair use issue here.  And the other thing is that never really wants to be discussed.  And let's we might as well discuss it is the fact that Google has really archived the entire Internet,  today's Internet, on more than a few servers in a certain redundant fashion.  Yeah, you can look at the cache of any page.  They have, you can go to the Google cache right now and bring up my web page from 10 minutes ago.  And that's copyrighted.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. But the search engine litigation over the years have carved out exceptions for indexing and caching.  And there's a whole body of law that applies to search engines in that regard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So search engines are kind of exempt in that thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the Internet Archive is performing a similar function and would be treated the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The complaint people have about the Orphan Works Act, photographers, for instance, say it's such a burden for me to see if somebody's using my stuff.  The requirements for them for a, quote, diligent, reasonably diligent search are not particularly tough.  And so I've got to find it.  And then I can only collect what the use is worth.  And they're afraid that that standard for what it's worth will be set by the person who published it.  You know, this is the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the thing that really bugs me about this whole debate, which is that it's the photographers and the illustrators, both of them.  And I know a lot of these people.  I'm friends with them.  But they think it's all about them.  I've never seen anything like it.  I mean, it's like that's all anybody wants to do is they want to steal your crappy photo from God knows when.  And it's going to be and it's not going to show up and you're not going to know because nobody's looking at it.  I mean, the fact of the matter is this is not this is not about some guy's one photo that he's worried somebody's going to steal.  It's about these these libraries of weird and interesting books and and this intellectual property that is by the truckload, not by the negative that is out there.  Something has to be done about and that includes, you know, there's a lot of art, in fact, which is I would say, yeah, the photographers can fall into that category, perhaps.  But stuff that can be put in art history books and things of that nature.  Well, look at documentarians.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a great documentary called The Eyes and the Prize, which will never be aired again because of the rights issues of with all the video.  They got clearance for airings for a very limited period of time and never again will it be seen.  There's a very good example and there are lots of them in the world of documentaries of very good works that cannot be shown.  And if you can now, of course, in this case, it's things like the Martin Luther King estate, which assert the right to all the video and it's caught charge a lot of money for access to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stanford has an interesting project as part of it, part of its fair use project that's aimed just at documentary filmmakers that actually will recognizing that problem that it's nearly impossible to clear all the rights for what you need to do.  It actually provides them with a form of insurance where if they have legal problems that crop up, there's a pool of attorneys that will represent them.  And, you know, they have to follow various best practices to make sure that everything they're using is fair use.  And if they follow it, then they get legal representation after the fact if they if they have problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My general inclination is just to break the law and wait for somebody to come after me.  As you know, Denise, Larry was very clear.  I heard Larry speak and he said, don't break the law, change the law.  It does seem to be how people are responding to these draconian copyright laws as well.  Screw it. Instead, he's saying, no, we got to fix it.  We can't, you know, we're done.  We do rely on we are in a rule of law.  We do rely on effective laws.  So so it sounds like Brewster, you're in favor of this orphan works act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, we'd like some help out here.  We'd really like to get more of this to people.  And the truism, I think, is everybody can agree with is people are turning to their computer now to answer questions.  It is the library.  And if it's not on the Internet, it's as if it doesn't exist.  And what you can also find and get most people to agree with is the best we have to offer is not on the Internet yet.  So if we're raising a whole generation on materials that aren't the best we have to offer, we're going to end up with the generation we deserve.  And this really is. On its face value, obviously stupid to do, and time is ticking forward.  This is 2008. Come on, guys, we've got to get on with this.  So we have a mechanism for delivering information. Terrific.  We don't have very good business models out there.  Oops.  But we do have things that are working, such as libraries, to go and pick up some of the slack on some of this.  We've got search engines.  If we keep the search engines search engines as opposed to republishers, that in general works.  I think we've got moves we can move beyond not just having out of copyright materials out there,  but go for the orphan works and the out of print works within the library like framework.  And let's work to try to get publishers and authors paid for some of this stuff.  Let's see if we can get some business models out there that aren't just advertising driven systems from a few major media conglomerates.  Let's go and have something that is worthy of having the intellectual discourse live inside the whole web infrastructure.  So long way of saying, yes, we're in favor of the orphan works as long as it's not too onerous to try to do bulk serving on the Internet.  If they go and decide that, oh, you've got to go and do way too much to go and put each and every thing up in a digital library,  then we've got the same problem we have now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's move on to another topic that also involves you, Brewster.  You got a national security letter, something you couldn't tell anybody about.  According to the Patriot Act, you decided to fight it.  Tell us a little bit now that you can because you won and you can talk about it.  Tell us what happened.  When did you get this national security letter from the FBI?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We got this national security letter, which is this sort of extra judiciary thing.  It doesn't go through the courts, doesn't go through anything.  They served on us in November of 2007.  They demanded information about a patron of the Internet Archive.  So they wanted to know address, identity, what this person had done, all sorts of information about a patron of the Internet Archive.  And they served it on us in such a way that when our lawyers received it, they were instantly gagged.  They couldn't talk about it.  They were to tell anybody, any of their colleagues, anything that was going on, they could go to jail.  And they couldn't call me even to tell me what was going on.  They couldn't tell you?  They had to physically come over to the Internet Archive because the law enforcement folks made it as a stipulation that you couldn't discuss it on the telephone.  I guess they might have information saying that phones are bugged.  But anyway, they had to come over to the Internet Archive.  And once I was told about it, I was gagged.  I couldn't talk to my wife, couldn't talk to the board, couldn't talk to anybody else there.  Had to act completely on my own to be able to figure out what the heck we were going to do about this.  Do we sell out patrons information for a request, a demand that's done without any court review at all?  Or do we push back on the United States government?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Denise, is this NSL, is this part of the Patriot Act?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's part of the, and I'm not in front of my computer right now, but it's got an acronym, the Electronic Communications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Something or something.  Yeah.  But I thought it was the Patriot Act that allowed them to do these kind of extrajudicial things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they don't even go through FISA for this.  This is just something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you stop a second and do some definitions here?  What do you mean by patron?  Is this a user, a person who invested, some guy you know, I mean, somebody who likes you?  I don't get this.  Who is a patron?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Patrons are the users of libraries.  It's people that hold library cards.  So there's basically some user?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this guy that comes on the site once in a while?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This whole law was passed so that they could, the feds could go to a librarian and say who checked out what books.  And the librarian would be enjoined about saying anything to anybody else.  In fact, it's not just libraries.  They could go to a grocery store and say, hey, did anybody buy hummus this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but online, how are you supposed to track this stuff?  People can't keep logs that long.  They would be, they wouldn't have any, enough hard disk space.  It's a ludicrous request.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I don't think so.  Well, all right.  Well, I can't.  My guy sure don't.  It's not a ludicrous to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do you, you actually had the information on hand that was being requested, I assume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the internet archive has done something that I would suggest all libraries and actually all search engines should do.  We don't keep most of our logs in the sense the IP addresses are, which are personally identifiable in many, if not most cases on the internet.  The IP addresses which record in logs that are often kept for long periods of time are really the toxic waste of the digital age.  And so we just never record those.  So any user that comes to the internet archive site, we don't record their IP addresses.  Only if you go and request a library card, do we know anything really.  And people just type in an email address, which is an unconfirmed email address.  And that's their internet archive identity, which they only need if they're trying to post something in the forums or add something to the collections of the internet archive.  So we don't know anything about the users pretty much.  So you couldn't respond.  Somebody that came to a webpage.  We don't know who came to what webpage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You couldn't respond to this NSL anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we didn't.  Basically, the materials that we have, almost everything we've got is available on the site.  So there's nothing secret about what it is we've got.  It's all sitting out there.  So yes, there are all sorts of ways to ask a librarian a question.  And the idea of serving them a super secret gag letter is, I guess, one way to do it.  But we're in the business of answering questions.  We answer questions to hundreds of thousands of people every day.  And some people actually call us up on the phone.  We try to deal with that.  But this idea of going and serving this letter to us, there wasn't very much they were going to find out about this person that they couldn't get off of the website.  And so we decided with our lawyers from the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the ACLU to push back.  And the way you push back in this particular law is pretty pathetic, is you have to counter sue.  So we counter sued.  Well, I guess we didn't.  We sued the United States government saying that this was an unconstitutional request for information.  Wow.  And the FBI very quickly wanted to settle.  Really?  They just said, look, we don't want this to go before a judge.  And because of what we found on the East Coast where another ACLU case found that this law was unconstitutional and it's under appeal, I can understand why.  And the only way that we would settle this suit is if we could talk about it.  If they released the gag, if they took the court documents out from underneath seal, we were OK with redacting things like who the user that they were looking for was because we wouldn't tell them.  So why would we want to tell anybody else?  So they took out just the specifics of exactly the piece that, you know, who they were looking for.  But we have everything else there.  What it is they're looking for, how the whole thing worked, because what I wanted to do was be able to come on shows like yours and give a cookbook of how one responds to one of these things.  The first step is call the ACLU or the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  Because even though once you talk to them, they're gagged, they were very, very happy to deal with this.  EFF, they couldn't even talk to their colleagues.  It was under a code name within their organization.  They couldn't even say who the client was or what the general gist of what it is they're working on.  But they were thrilled to do it.  So that because there are organizations like EFF and the ACLU, and I hope all of your listeners go and contribute to these these very able and very helpful.  Lawyers, then we could respond.  Because otherwise, can you imagine my going and hiring lawyers and starting to spend tens of thousands of dollars without being able to go to the board and go and say what it is we're spending money on?  It's only because there are pro bono attorneys that are helping protect our rights that really make it possible for people to push back on these.  So I think that they're now based on a congressional audit.  They found that there are 200,000 of these letters put out during a four year period.  It's 50,000 a year, I guess, a thousand a month.  There have only been three times that people have publicly pushed back on these.  And I'm hoping by our coming out from underneath the gag, telling people about what's going on, that they'll go and follow in our footsteps and at least call the lawyers to find out what's going on and what their situation might be that's different from ours.  And make an informed decision of whether they want to push back as well.  John, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was just going to say now that it's over, Brewster, who was the guy they were looking for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't say that.  I'll tell you later.  But let me say, isn't this an important tool in the FBI's ability to fight terrorism?  Don't they need these NSL letters?  Don't they need the secrecy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, at least in our case, there are lots of legal ways to go and ask questions of libraries.  There's subpoenas, there's court, there's warrants, there's all sorts of very fast track, all these sorts of things.  And with the gag order, I don't know if they're really protecting themselves from scrutiny or are they really protecting their investigations?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think telling your board is going to give the terrorists any foot up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By their going and keeling over on this thing right away, one, not even asking for the information anymore,  much less wanting to preserve the gag, I think it's at least in this case is pretty clear what the answer to those questions are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I want to interrupt here for a second.  I mean, Leo throws the word out terrorists, assuming that this had to do with terrorism,  which I think is the real problem here is we don't know when you start doing all the secret stuff,  if you don't know if people are trying to dig up financial data on somebody who is a political enemy,  or if they're trying to look for insider information on stock market trading,  there's a million good reasons to keep these investigations secret to this degree.  And it doesn't necessarily have to do with terrorism, and that's like really the big problem here.  You can use terrorism as a guise, as an excuse.  I mean, if they're sending out tens of thousands of letters...  Hundreds of thousands.  Hundreds of thousands of letters.  I mean, how many terrorists do we have in this country?  Are they all after the same guy or are they after something else?  The problem is you don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a good little video on the archive site.  If you go to archive.org and search on national security letter,  there's a little video 25 minutes long done by this group in Connecticut,  and it's a good background.  They've got some good government lawyers, some ex-Clinton administrators  going and saying that this stuff is just not needed at all.  That this stuff is secret police stuff.  So there's...  There is other information out there, but it's so nice to be out from underneath this gag.  The idea of basically being threatened by the United States government in this way  and pushing back in such a way that there's potential criminal repercussions to all of this  and not being able to talk to anybody about it,  it's a huge relief to be out from underneath this.  I hope that future administrations don't just tweak these legislations,  they just throw it out.  This doesn't make any sense.  There's no room for this in a democracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The overreaching of this just seems so stunning because as best as I can understand it,  the Electronic Communication Privacy Act was actually a check on the Patriot Act  and put some limitations in place that it looks like,  you know, in your case, Brewster, we're just blown by.  You were supposed to be, in order to have this kind of letter issued,  some sort of electronic communications provider.  And, you know, of course, I think there's a huge question as to  whether that's what the Internet Archive is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, this doesn't make any sense at all.  Even in 2006, the Congress went and said,  you're not allowed to serve these on libraries.  And frankly, the Internet Archive had already met with the FBI and said,  we are a library.  You ever serve one of these things to us?  We're going to fight it.  And then months later, they go and serve one of these to us.  So there's six senators from the Judiciary Committee that wrote a letter  that's also posted on the archive.org site.  So if you go to archive.org, in the upper left, there's a little post about this.  And there's the actual letter that the senators sent to the FBI demanding  information from them as to why they thought, even though Congress took away  their right to go and demand these letters of libraries,  why did they do it to a library anyway?  I'd like to see what it is the FBI comes back with.  And hopefully that's not super double secret as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you have on that same page, Brewster, kind of the cookbook that you're talking  about for other people who get NSL letters and how to fight it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. And in general, there are links to the different news articles and the different  things where we put this out there.  There's links to EFF and ACLU's pages that have all of the documents.  So if you want to go and see what one of these things look like, it's up there.  If you want to see the court documents and exactly what it is we put out there.  And by the way, that's not copyrighted.  So people can cut and paste to their hearts' content.  The idea is that this is meant to be a public airing of something that has only been aired  three times since the 2001 or whenever it was the Patriot Act really jacked this whole  NSL letter thing up into a major scale manipulation tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Brewster, how big is the Internet Archive?  How many people work for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Internet Archive in San Francisco, we've got about 30, 35 people working here.  And then in the scanning centers that are turning pages, there are about 150 to 200 people,  160, 170 people that are turning pages all around the country in Canada and the UK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And how many terabytes of data are you storing every day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've got about two petabytes of disks and spinning.  And it's over that because we compress the web data.  I don't know, it's probably two, two and a half petabytes.  And it goes mega, giga, terra, peta.  That's the kind of size that it takes to be a modern major scale library at this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's called a lot of hard disks.  So now when you say people turning pages, I saw some online video showing some machines  that were like turning pages or some robots.  You actually have physical people that are sitting there with a scanner.  They flip a page and throw it on top of a scanner and push a button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, we actually have physical people.  So we've tried out the robots and we think that there will be a time that when the robots get  to be cost effective enough and reliable enough that we'll want to use them.  But what we went and found is actually people are very good and very caring about turning pages.  So they turn pages, they raise and lower glass that flattens the page, takes pictures from two  professional grade digital cameras and they press a pedal, raise the glass, turn the page.  And then take another couple pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What software are you using?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We use Linux.  We wrote all of this on top of the Linux operating system.  What about for the scanner?  We designed and built our own book scanner and all the book scanning software.  It uses mostly internet 2 to bring the books, the images back to the internet archive cluster.  And it takes about 12 hours of processing to go and take a book from the image form  till it's ready to go up on the internet archive site.  The OCR and PDFs and the like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What OCR system are you using?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We use a few different ones.  The one that we're mostly using is from LuraTech.  It's a repackaging of another third party.  All those files are actually up on the archive as well.  People want the OCR data that came out of the OCR engines, it's there.  There's word-based OCR that's in XML that's up there with position information.  There's sort of a Gutenberg looking like version of the book.  There's also the images and they're all woven together into making PDFs,  deja vu and sort of an on-screen flip book, which we really like,  that allows you to just click and win Ajax live viewer to be able to see the books.  That's neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Brewster, we really appreciate what you are doing with the internet archive.  It's so important and I'm just glad that somebody's taken this seriously and stepped up.  If people want to donate or find out more, go to archive.org.  There's a donate button there.  You could send a check or you could use Amazon Honor System or PayPal or just give and  support this important work.  Now that Microsoft has pulled out, I'm sure you could use some extra donations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We could use the money to keep the books coming through.  Thank you, John Leo.  I appreciate the attention on all of these issues.  Well, we'll get you back soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you, Brewster.  Brewster Kahle.  Again, it's archive.org.  We're going to continue on though.  There's more to talk about.  In fact, Denise has a story on her blog right now, Logarithms,  about our favorite subject, Twitter.  It's actually a much deeper subject than that.  What's going on with the Twitter Waldman discussion, as you call it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  There was a gal who's actually the community manager for Pounce,  Ariel Waldman, who has, I guess, had ongoing discussions with the folks at Twitter  about someone posting things about her on Twitter.  She's being harassed, I guess.  Yeah, basically calling her names, not nice names at all,  names that are actually quite scary and threatening.  And she's friends with the folks at Twitter.  I think she's had an open dialogue with them,  and in the past they've taken some things down.  But she reached an impasse with them where something that she wanted removed,  they decided was actually consistent with their terms.  And Twitter is, at this point, trying to amend their terms of service to make it  clearer that they're not attempting to edit or moderate the material on the site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was the stuff being sent to Ariel direct messages, or were they public tweets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think they were public tweets, but I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I was reading her, actually I got kind of involved only with her by talking about  the fact that she's got to fix this post that she has about this episode,  because it's confusing now because there's so many updates.  This thing is kind of rolling out of control.  Now I can't figure out what the heck's going on.  But it seems to me that they were doing a lot of direct posting, the at sign thing.  That's public, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I can imagine that Twitter...  Directed, though.  It's directed.  It's directed, but Twitter's point would be, well, we have a block button, push the block button,  and then you won't see anything more from that fella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but everyone else sees it, right?  I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So her goal was not merely to get him out of her hair,  but to keep others from seeing what he or she was saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. And if you follow along, Twitter's been blogging this.  Biz Stone over there has a couple of entries on their blog and on their community forum  that talk about the fact that, look, admittedly, when we put up the site,  it was all kind of quick and dirty, and we basically modeled our terms of service on those  of Flickr. And Flickr has some pretty...  I don't know if I'd call them stringent, but some definite community guidelines of things  that you can and cannot do and things that will result in your account being terminated,  which when Twitter ported those over, Twitter wound up with those same sorts of guidelines.  And I think that Twitter has decided that actually they want to be more of a communication  conduit than a community, per se. And certainly there are things that they will take down if they  feel they cross the line, but in this particular instance, it didn't rise to that level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is an important distinction between a publisher and a conduit. Can you talk about

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  what that distinction is? Well, there's this provision of the law that enables a whole lot  of the activities on social networking sites that is 47 US Code Section 230, fondly referred to as  Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. And it immunizes site owners of all kinds from  the activity that goes on on the communications platforms that they are providing. So whether  you're a blog or you're Facebook or what have you, if people are using your platform to communicate  through comments or however they're posting their text or other material, they can engage in various  illegal activities without subjecting you as the site owner to liability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if somebody's going on my blog in the comments saying,  here's how you download movies illegally, I'm not liable for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's right. And there was some suggestion made in...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, Leo, unless you're the one posting it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. And the only way you can sort of run afoul of the immunity that's provided under this  statute is if you begin monkeying around with the material or participating in it in some way.  If you endorse it, if you offer an editorial opinion that, yes, you're 100% behind what this...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, how about this? How about if I start going through my comments and deleting some  selectively but not all illegal postings?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's okay. The act actually wants to encourage... It is the Communications Decency Act,  after all. It wants to encourage website owners to police their sites. So if your editorial decision  is simply to remove something, that's not going to subject you to liability.  It's actually fairly difficult to subject yourself to liability as a site owner under  this provision, although we've seen some interesting case law come out in recent months,  particularly from our own Ninth Circuit here in California in the roommates.com case, which  found that the categories they were setting up, they had a drop-down menu  of various categories you could select from in creating your entry. Those actually violated the  Fair Employment and Housing Act because they were encouraging people to make distinctions based on  things like gender and age and sexual preference, various protected classes. So if the site owner  is actually encouraging people to make those kinds of illegal distinctions, then the site owner will  be involved in it too, says the Ninth Circuit. Now that's a pretty anomalous decision and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  out of line with the rest of... Yeah, but making a category is different than me going in and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  deleting a post. Exactly. If you're just deciding, you know what, this just strikes me as something  I don't want on my site. You're perfectly able to do that. What if I edit a post? What if I keep

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  half of it but take out the other half? Does that in some way escalate the problem? It can. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it depends on the meaning that is left. If you have somehow altered the meaning and injected  yourself into the conversation, then you might have a problem. First of all, just on a purely

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  human note, I really feel bad for Ariel and I've seen people harassed in this way before. So I'm  very sympathetic to that. Her initial complaint was that Twitter wasn't standing up to its own  terms of service, which said that harassment would not be tolerated. On the other hand,  I understand that Twitter... Is Twitter afraid of crossing this line of Section 230? Is that what

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the issue is? I don't think so. I don't think that's it. I think... I don't know. I haven't  talked to them and I don't know what legal counsel they have, but they're on solid ground under  Section 230 if they want to remove things. So they could do something about it. Yeah, they could  if they wanted to and they have in the past. Well, I understand then why Ariel would be upset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The larger issue is, and this isn't the first time that a blogger or a woman in the public  Web 2.0 social network scene has been harassed. It's a difficult thing to know how to respond to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that. I don't think it's that difficult. Just kill the guy off the site. I mean, what's the big deal?  I don't get it. I think this thing has been dragging on too long. You got somebody who's a  pest. I mean, we have these on our blog. Some guy's a pest. He comes on. He's contributing  nothing to society. He's contributing nothing to the blog. Yeah, we delete him. He's contributing...  Yeah, exactly. You just delete him and you kill his IP and that's the end of it. What difference  does it make? The guy figures it's going to happen to him anyway. The language that this guy used,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't understand why Twitter would allow it, to be honest. I'm not privy to their decision-making

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  process at all. It's pretty clear from Biz's comments that they don't want to be making  judgment calls as to what's proper and what's not. Their counsel, apparently. It doesn't take

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a genius to see what is going on here. This is not like a judgment call. This is like hardcore  porn, as it were. It's easy to spot it when you see it. Unless there's somebody on the Twitter  board of directors or somebody working at the company that's actually making these messages,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't get it. It's John Dozier who apparently is their counsel on this and he's afraid they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  going to cross the line. Is John Dozier their counsel? Oh, maybe not. No, he was quoted in a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  piece on Wired. Oh, he's not... Okay, so he's not advising them. He's just somebody... No. But

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  presumably they're getting advice like that. I don't think so. The reason I called out that  Dozier quote in my post was I found it so anomalous with my understanding-  It's wrong is what you're saying. Yeah. Of Section 230 and how it operated.  I'm not very familiar with Mr. Dozier's practice, but I think they represent a lot of people in  defamation cases trying to go after any defendants they can. I don't think he's a big fan of Section

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  230 and the way that it operates. A lot of people are on Twitter, including Kathy Sierra,  the blogger who was attacked last year. I could see this becoming an issue. You see it happen so  much in so many places on message boards and on forums. People take this kind of anonymity  that they have in these forums to sometimes act very poorly. I don't see any reason why you don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  stop it. It doesn't seem right. Yeah, John's got a good point. Every site owner has the ability to  bounce whoever they'd like basically under the way that the internet operates, which is a good  thing. So you're on your iPhone right now. I'm actually not. I'm on a landline. Oh, shoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nice try, Leo. I tried because of course we're just about a week and a half, two weeks away from  Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference at which they are perhaps going to announce a new iPhone.  Interesting story in Fortune magazine. Apple takes delivery of 188 mysterious ocean containers.  You could find out anything on the internet. There's apparently a search engine that gathers  competitive intelligence by monitoring US customs records of ocean containers entering American  ports. It's called Import Genius. And according to Import Genius, there's been a major spike  since mid-March in ocean containers marked with a mysterious new label, Electric Computers,  headed for Cupertino. Electric computers? Electric computers. As opposed to the non-electric ones.  Well, apparently this is the first time Apple's... The stuff that's come to Apple has ever been

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  labeled as electric computers. It's probably a reflection of the quality inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we'll see. But anyway, there's a lot of stock, maybe hundreds of thousands of something

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  in those 188 containers. Aren't we supposed to find out about that this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  June 9th is when Steve will go on stage. Now, it could be, in fact, that they'll announce something  first. One of the rumors is kind of interesting. That's why I asked you, because I think of the  three of us, you're the only one who has an iPhone, Denise. But the rumors are maybe not only a 3G  iPhone, but something else. Something more like a tablet. Something a little bit larger. Would you  salivate for such a thing? The Newton 2? The Newton 2 is here! Exactly the size of a Newton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was at the first D conference and listened to Steve Jobs swear up and down how Apple would

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  never have a tablet. Yeah. And he also swore they'd never put video on a screen. Right.  Steve's... I think I'm starting to think anytime Steve says we'll never do something,  it's really a sign that he's thinking of it and planning it and going to do it.  We'll see. Anyway, I'm looking forward to it. I don't have an iPhone. I love my iPhone. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love it enough that when they get the 3G, I'm going to be happy to trash it and take the 3G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, one thing you can do on your iPhone, and now we pause for a commercial break,  is listen to your Audible books. How do you like that? Am I getting smooth?  Wow.

There's a wonderful series  from the Library of Congress that I listened to about a year or two ago that I highly recommend.  I don't think I've ever recommended this before. Maybe I have. They had a speech series, some of  the really interesting people, including David Weinberg, who wrote the Clutrain Manifesto. It's  the Library of Congress series on the digital future. And it's really interesting. A couple  of years old, but I have to say the people who spoke were so forward thinking that it is in fact  very, very useful. They also have some other stuff from the LLC, including historic presidential

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  speeches. Yeah, Denise, I'm sorry. I've listened to a few of those and I agree they're wonderful.  And anytime you can hear David Weinberger speak,  I love the opportunity because he's just amazing. Yeah, it's a really good speech. He's talking

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  about the blogs, I think, in this one. The presidential speeches from Roosevelt,  Woodrow Wilson, and John F. Kennedy. This is a good time in our election cycle to listen to some great  speeches as the speech makers start to tire and lose their steam. In this Brewster Kale, by the  way, this is why I bring it up, is one of the speakers. He talks about how he created the idea  to archive the web. This is from the Library of Congress series on the digital future. Also Juan  Pablo Paz, who's a Brazilian quantum physicist. Brian Cantwell-Smith from the University of  Toronto. David Levy, who is a fascinating fellow from Xerox PARC. Larry Lessig is in this one.  It is a really good series if you haven't heard it. This could be your free book. All you got to  do is go to audible.com slash twit. Sign up today, get a credit for a free book. But I warn you,  it's going to be hard to choose. There's so many great titles here. We're really thrilled. I just,  at midnight this morning, I was at a pier in Sausalito as Roz Savage began her row across  the Pacific. She is an amazing woman. She rowed across the Atlantic solo. She does this by herself.  There's no chase boat. There's nothing solo. Now she's trying to become the first woman to row across  the Pacific. I gave her an iPod with audible permission, full of 323 audible books. She was  so happy. Wow. What's she rowing? A row boat. Oh my God. Roz, well, the reason I mentioned it,  besides the fact that I gave her these audible books, is we're going to do a podcast with her.  Rozsavage.com. She's just a really inspirational person. She left tonight. Last night I was there  at midnight. She rowed out onto the Golden Gate Bridge. It's a special boat. It's like 16 feet.  It's bigger than a regular row boat. It's made of metal, but she's rowing it. There's no motor in it.  There's no sales in it. She has five iPods. I gave her a fifth iPod. She's got solar panels  to charge them up. She's got three cameras, a MacBook. She's got a satellite phone, which we  underwrote. We gave her some money for the sat phone because she's going to call us three times

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a week and say how it's going. Oh, wonderful. Isn't that cool? Yeah. Hey, if she's by herself,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  why does she need five iPods? Because people keep giving her iPods. So the one I gave her is  Just Books. She's got one with Just Music. She's got one with Just Podcasts. I think she has the  backups. John, she's going to be three months in the middle of the ocean. What if one falls over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, and it will. You're going to the toilet for God's sake. There's no toilet? What are you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  talking about? It's a row boat. There is a toilet. It's called the Pacific. Yeah, she's got a large  toilet. If you go to her website in the blog there, she has a marine tracker and you can actually  watch her GPS position. There's a lot of swirling going on as she goes under the Golden Gate Bridge.  I missed this. I left after she left the pier, but we're doing a documentary also on her. My friend  who's doing the documentary was shooting her from the Golden Gate Bridge, filming her from the  Golden Gate Bridge. It took her eight times to try to get through the eddies. The tide was going out.  That's why she left at midnight to catch the ebb tide. But the eddies from the piers of the  Golden Gate Bridge are such stiff currents, she couldn't get through them, couldn't get through  them. And this is how dedicated, how amazing person she is. Most people would have given up  after six or seven tries. Eight tries, she finally gets through. She's well on her way.  You could follow her on Twitter. She's Roz Savage on Twitter and she is literally Twittering as she  goes. Isn't that funny? It's Roz Savage, R-O-Z-S-A-V-A-G-E. She's also texting. You can follow her via  text. I think that's what's happening is she's SMSing using the cell phone and that's going on  to Twitter as well. But we're going to do a podcast with her. I'll be talking to her Tuesday live  via sat phone and we'll be able to follow her. I'm very inspired. She was, get this,  a management consultant at Accenture. She was about 30 and she said, screw this.  I'm not having fun. She's British. And she said, I really liked rowing when I was at Oxford. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll row across the Atlantic. The Pacific. Well, first she did the Atlantic. She's already done the  Atlantic. Oh, she's okay. I'm saying now she's doing it. Now she's going to be the first, if she

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  does this, and it's tough. She tried last year and capsized, the boat capsized five or six times,  I think seven or eight times. And finally the coast guard said, we get, you know, sorry lady.  Hey lady, pull over. And they literally plucked her out of the boat. She's doing it again. I think  it's just really cool. Anyway, so. Might not be a bad time of year to do it. Well, you're very  careful about when you, she was waiting. We, the reason it kind of took me off guard, I thought she  was leaving later, so we didn't launch the podcast yet. So I'm actually a little bit backlogged. I  have interviews with her and video and all sorts of stuff. We'll put up kind of backwards because  I didn't think she was leaving yet. And all of a sudden she called me two days ago. She said,  I'm leaving tomorrow. I said, what? So it was, it's very, it's very cool. Anyway, she's got a lot of  audible books and I'm, when we talk to her, one of the things we're going to do is find out what  she's listening to. That's by way, a long way around of mentioning audible as again,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in the audible.com slash Twitter. No kidding. Those guys are getting their money's worth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And John, you will get a check any minute now. I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the, by the way, I, so nevermind. I was always going to kind of pushing for getting a comp audible

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  account so I could test out. Oh, I'm sorry. I keep forgetting that. Please, Dane, would you remind me?  We're on the list with that microphone. Come over here and now we can give you lunch and we'll give  you the mic. You don't need the microphone. You sound fantastic. By the way, Cyrus isn't open for  lunch, which is a shame. I know. Well, we'll go for dinner if you want and you could bring your  daughter and anything you want. It's yours, John. I owe you that big time. I'm just kidding. I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  kidding. You're a kid. Don't worry for the dinner. I, you know, maybe. Cyrus is great. Yeah. Well,  it's definitely one of the top five places in the country. Apparently. Well, French Laundry is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  supposed to be the place. Yeah. Yeah. But you know, it's, it's, I got an in there. You want to go  there? It's yeah, sure. All right. Let's go there too. They do lunch. We're going to be blowing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  through your part of the world soon, Leo. Will you Denise come up here? Yeah. I'd love to be able to  come in and see the new studio and stuff. I'm just going to have to see our timing works, but we're

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  going to Safari West. Have you heard of this? Yes. That's right over the hill here. Oh, it's so much  fun. Your kid, your kid will love it. It's a, it's a Safari. I mean, there's wild animals. We know the  people who own it. It's really cool. And that's on the, that's kind of in the, in the, on the hills  between Sonoma and Napa County. So you've got to come here, have some wine, spend an hour with us.  We'll do a special show. You could talk about all the things I'm doing that are illegal and wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'd love that. You think Milo and Huck could play with Tyler? Yes. We'll bring, we'll bring

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Megan and Milo and Huck. You bet. That's a deal. So as we're recording this either way, I do want  to mention in a tip of the hat to the folks at JPL and the University of Arizona, because as we  are doing this, Phoenix, any minute now, will attempt the impossible, a soft landing on Mars.  Now, by the time you hear this, you'll know whether it succeeded or not. Now, a lot of the people who  are watching this on Twitter Live are also watching NASA TV. And if I only had my TriCaster working  yet, I mean, it's working, but I haven't hooked it up. I'd have a picture in picture so you could  watch the NASA TV at the same time. But any minute now we'll get word of whether Phoenix did it. This  is a tough thing. It's got to go from 12,000 miles an hour in orbit around Mars. It hits that  atmosphere. This is all autonomous because they can't control it. It's too far away. So it's got  the computer programs running, hits the atmosphere, arrow breaks, puts it, deploys the parachutes.  It's got to get down from 12,000 miles an hour to five miles an hour before it hits the ground or  it's kablooey. The plan is for Phoenix to look for signs of life on Mars, modern or ancient,  including traces of organic compounds, including water. It's a very exciting project. And I know  a lot of people are excited about this. It's been a long time since NASA has attempted anything like  this, since the 1999 crash landing. In fact, I don't know if they've ever had the last soft landing  was Viking, I think. So it's been like 10, 15 years since they've done this. It's very exciting.  Where do you come down on this, John? Are you in favor of space exploration or are you one  of those guys who says, save the money for humans? I'm still wondering what you mean by that the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  TriCaster is working, but you haven't hooked it up yet. Well, it's a complicated story, but the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  TriCaster, we're waiting for the update in the software that will allow us to stream out to  STIC-M. This TriCaster, will you see? Well, you were a big Amiga toaster guy. Yeah. This is the  successor to that. It is, wait till you see what I can do with this, John. It's insane. Well, we got

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  one over at Cranky Geeks, you know, so it's not like I'm unfamiliar with the plot. Oh, that's right.  I forgot you use that for Cranky Geeks. So, no, I'm a big fan of space travel. I mean,  it's what he's given us the high tech age that we're in. We wouldn't have Fisher space pens if  it weren't for Apollo. You know, those things don't work by the way. Somebody gave me a Fisher space

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  pen. Okay, Velcro. Well, that's maybe better. Yeah. Hey, Denise, it's been great talking to you. I  wish you all the best. I thank you so much for joining us and especially for taking time out of

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  your Memorial Day weekend. Thank you. It was a perfect fit because I've been spending the weekend  listening to Cory Doctorow's book, Little Brother. Oh, let's give him a plug. Yes, which fits in  quite well with the whole national security letter scenario. What is the story of, because this just

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  came out and he is offering it as an unprotected download for audio. What is the story of Little

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Brother? Little Brother, well, I'm only partially through it, but it is a story aimed at young  adults. But it's just a great science fiction story for anybody. And it is kind of scary. I mean,  it's scary in the way that Harry Potter is scary too, but kids seem to be able to take it in and  not be too traumatized by it. It takes place in the Bay Area and there's a kid who's a very tech  savvy high school student. It takes place sort of in the very near future and there's a terrorist  attack on the Bay Bridge. And this kid and some of his friends get summarily rounded up and  questioned and they decide or the main character decides that the national security system is  completely out of hand and that they're going to mess with it a little bit. And so he sets up a  whole sort of underground network using Xbox universals. Oh, cool. I've been saying for years

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that the future freedom fighters will all be hackers because that's where the next invasion  of our privacy, it's not the right to bear arms, it's the right to bear technology, I think. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that's exactly what this book is all about. And about, it's very topical for today because  the systems that are in place and sort of the villains of this book are the things that we  deal with every day. The fast track things in our cars that if someone wanted to could be used to  track our every move and very interesting stuff that he sort of plays. It's a juvenile, as you said,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's not an adult novel, it's his first juvenile. Well, yeah, not to the same dot, but I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  43 and I'm enjoying the heck out of it. I can't wait. But you're a lawyer, don't forget. Now,  let's, Leo, you got the book on tape, let's just play the end of it so we can get it over with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't have the, well, I do have the end, but I'm not playing the end. Come on, play the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We really don't want to read this book. Just play the end. Hey, Corey will kill me if I do. So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Corey did give us permission to play an excerpt and I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll put about,  I'll put an excerpt of this at the end of this. I could play a little now, but I could play a much

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  longer excerpt at the end of the show. That's okay. Play it later. Play it tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is offered by Random House Audio. It's their first DRM free MP3, which that was something  Corey insisted on. $20 for the book and you can get it from zipityd.com, Z-I-P-I-D-E-E.com,  or at Corey's own site, craphound.com slash little brother. That's probably the best place to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's fun to have a book set in the Bay Area too and have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you what I'm going to play. And you may have, have you read chapter 12 yet? This is  where the huge illegal conference concert is going on in Dolores Park.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I haven't read that part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well don't listen. They get pepper gas by the San Francisco police. It's great.  I will play, he goes to Mission High School. In fact, you heard, I started playing it and you  heard the Mission Burritos. I'll play a little bit more of it at the end of the show. We'll,  we'll stick some in so you can hear it. But you know, we love Corey. And I'm really,  Corey's writing is fantastic. I'm really excited that he's done a  kids book. This would be more, more like a junior high school book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I bought it for an 11 year old good friend of mine before I'd gotten too far into it.  And just because, you know, it's dealing with some pretty heady subjects of terrorism,  et cetera. I think on balance, it would be great for anyone sort of over the age of 10, but there  is a bit of death and fear in here too. But hey, we got to, we got to let our kids know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they're going to live in an age where there's the Patriot Act and you got to fight for your

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  rights to a freedom. Yeah, that's where I come down on it too. As I said, if they can handle  Voldemort, I think they can handle this. Heck yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. All I'm hearing is that Corey Doctorow is going to get a tax audit for the next five years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, definitely. For all we know,  that's what the national security letter was all about. What is that Doctorow guy listening to?  What's he reading on the internet archive? What do you bet? I never thought of that one.  Yeah. What do you bet? Hey guys, I really want to thank you. It's been a fascinating,  more serious tweet than usual, but I think these were very serious important issues and I'm really  glad we could talk about them. John C. Dvorak gets less serious, more lighthearted. Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  wait before you end the show, Leo, you got to bring up this Twitter thing that was part of  the conversation that you dropped in favor of the, you know, hashing over this other stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I just want to say follow Kevin Rose, but also follow the real Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right now that I can do because this contest is over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's over at midnight. Now we're recording before it's over. Kevin could suddenly pull out

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  at any moment. You're way ahead of him by over a thousand, fifteen hundred people.  The thing is Kevin's decided and I think Kevin would allow me to say this and I promise not to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  say anything. Well, this is not going to go out till midnight. So it'll be over by the time people

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  hear this. He says he's going to, he's going to not, he's going to, he was just, he wanted to beat

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you badly. Did he really? Yeah. Well, he hasn't. Well. What's he going to do? Is he going to pull

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  out the stops? Is he going to do something? Well, I don't know. I sure racked his numbers up out of  the blue, out of, you know, well, how did he do that? He used Ignatian, didn't he? He used  leveraging your shows and it was like, didn't until he did. He started it. I know. It's, I know. It's  once you, once you've actually started leveraging, then you used, you pulled ahead of him again.  This is like a bunch of little kids. You guys are a bunch of little kids. It's not like I care about  getting to 20,000 to do the real Dvorak. Just go, if you're on it, by the way, I need to get to that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  number. And, but just beside the point. If everyone follows D Howell on Twitter, then this all becomes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  moot. D Howell. Absolutely. And Roz Savage and, you know, Twitter has been down so much this week. I  try to use it, you know, I've been trying to use it for the radio show because it's kind of a nice  way for people to ask questions. I got going on the air yesterday at 11 AM. When does Twitter go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  down? 11 AM. It's, it's, it's out of control crashing. What's going to happen? Well, they  got 13 more million bucks or whatever it is, 15 or something like that. And, but it breaks all the  time. They have to re-engineer it. If something's wrong with the basic architecture. But notice that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  all the other sites that do something similar, and we talked about this before, have the same  problems. I mean, Pounce is no better. Jaiku is no better. I think it's in the nature of the business.  And as you pointed out, what if Paris Hilton gets an account? It's all over. It would be over in a  minute. What do you think, Denise? You use it a lot. I do. I'm not, you know, I wouldn't say I'm  addicted to it, but I am a regular user. I think Ev and Biz have a problem. They're too sick. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  too successful. Yeah, but that was their problem with Blogger. I was an early Blogger user as well.  And Blogger used to go down all the time. And, you know, they solved that problem. Twitter, I think,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  will meet some kind of similar solution. Yeah, but well, Google will have to buy them.  All right. That would solve it. Maybe. It happened before. Maybe. Could happen. So anyway, please  don't not follow anybody on my account. I was wrong. You know, Valleywag picked up on my tweet  that said, I was drunk and out of control. I'm still drunk and I'm still out of control. And if

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you believe anything I say- You're neither drunk or out of control. It was an effort to submarine  it worked. So what were you going to reveal? That was it. Kevin, I saw him at a party like about two  or three months ago. And he says to me, I'm going to get Leo. And this one, he was like number 12.  He says, I've had it. I said, I'm going to go right past him. You watch, but don't tell him.  Because then he'll, you know, he may try to, you know- See, he didn't know. I mean, I can, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  if I want to, I haven't pulled out all the stops yet at all. And so you know what I did? I, you know  what I did that was effective? Yeah, he did creep up. He got within 50. Yeah. That scared the pants  off of me. You know what I, you know what I did that was effective? This is it. Reverse psychology.  I said, Kevin, you win. The twit army bows to the dig nation. And all that did was infuriate the  twit army. And of course they immediately came back. Well, good for them. Yeah. We're not, we don't  bow to anybody. Yeah, we don't bow to nobody. Of course, I think it might've had something to do  with the breaking Twitter, but that's another matter entirely. So follow Dee Howell, follow  TheRealDevorak. If you want to follow me, okay. Follow Rod Savage. Please follow Kevin Rose,  because he needs the followers. Poor kid. No, he doesn't. Oh, the poor guy. But Leo, what are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Aren't there a couple of Leos on Twitter? There's only one Leo Laporte. There's a phony Leo Laporte,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but you could tell it's phony because he has a big handlebar mustache. That's not me. No, Leo Laporte.  I'm just Leo. I'm the number one guy on Twitter. Who else? It's true. It's, I think it's creepy.  You know what? It is bad because now I don't, every time I tweet, I think 37,000 people are  going to get this message and it's completely blocked me. I can't do it anymore. It's scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but you gotta think that not everybody can possibly be listening at one time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No. In fact, half of those are probably spammers. Probably none of it's real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. It's all imaginary. No, no, no. I used, I had to say this. I used it  about two or three weeks ago. I had, couldn't find something on Google. I mean,  I needed a reference, a specific reference and I just asked my, you know, army for, I just,  I basically used them as Google and within five seconds I had five exact right answers.  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. It's incredible. That's where-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amazing how well that works. Yeah. It's crowdsourcing of the best kind.  Crowdsourcing. Exactly. John C. Dvorak, thank you so much.  Dvorak.org slash blog. Don't forget, of course, there is Take Five. There is Cranky Geeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tech Five. Tech Five. I'll always name that for that reason. Cranky Geeks, right?  No agenda. No agenda.  No mullet. And this show.  This thing. The mullet's gone. The mullet's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The mullet's gone. Denise Howell is Logarithms at ZDNet. It's a great column. You must read it.  Just go to blogs.zdnet.com slash Howell. And of course, Bag and Baggage is her personal blog  and she's on Twitter, DHowell. And she's the greatest. Thank you, Denise. I really appreciate  it. Thanks. It was a pleasure as always. Another twit. And thanks to Brewster Kale.  We really appreciate his time. Archive.org. Another twit.  It is in the can.  Okay. So now that everybody's gone, let's listen to a little bit of Cory Doctorow's  Little Brother. This is his newest book. It's aimed at younger people, but I think it's a great  listen for anybody. It is available DRM free for 20 bucks from Cory's site,  CrapHound.com slash Little Brother. This is a little excerpt from chapter 12.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The band had stopped playing. The noise of the crowd across the street changed. It got scared,  angry. I heard a click as the PA system of car speakers and car batteries in the tennis courts  powered up. Take it back. It was a defiant yell, like a sound shouted into the surf or  screamed off a cliff. Take it back. The crowd growled a sound that made the hairs on the back

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of my neck stand up. Take it back. They chanted. Take it back. Take it back. Take it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The police moved in in lines carrying plastic shields, wearing Darth Vader helmets that covered  their faces. Each one had a black truncheon and infrared goggles. They looked like soldiers out of  some futuristic war movie. They took a step forward in unison, and every one of them banged  his truncheon on his shield, a cracking noise like the earth splitting. Another step, another crack.  They were all around the park and closing in now. Disperse immediately, the voice of God said again.  There were helicopters overhead now. No floodlights, though. The infrared goggles,  right, of course. They'd have infrared scopes in the sky, too. I pulled Ange back against the  doorway of the church, tucking us back from the cops and the choppers. Take it back, the PA roared.  It was Trudy Dew's rebel yell, and I heard her guitar thrash out some chords, then her drummer  playing, then that big deep bass. Take it back, the crowd answered, and they boiled out of the  park at the police lines. I've never been in a war, but now I think I know what it must be like.  What it must be like when scared kids charge across a field at an opposing force, knowing what's  coming, running anyway, screaming, hollering. Disperse immediately, the voice of God said.  It was coming from trucks parked all around the park, trucks that had swung into place in the last  few seconds. That's when the mist fell. It came out of the choppers, and we just caught the edge of  it. It made the top of my head feel like it was going to come off. It made my sinuses feel like  they were being punctured with ice picks. It made my eyes swell and water and my throat close.  Pepper spray, not a hundred thousand Scovilles, a million and a half. They'd gassed the crowd.  I didn't see what happened next, but I heard it over the sound of both me and Ange choking  and holding each other. First the choking, retching sounds, the guitar and drums and bass  crashed to a halt, then coughing, then screaming. The screaming went on for a long time.  When I could see again, the cops had their scopes up on their foreheads, and the choppers were  flooding Dolores Park with so much light it looked like daylight. Everyone was looking at the park,  which was good news, because when the lights went up like that, we were totally visible.  What did we do? Ange said. Her voice was tight, scared. I didn't trust myself to speak for a  moment. I swallowed a few times. We walk away, I said. That's all we can do. Walk away like we  were just passing by. Down to Dolores and turn left and up toward 16th Street like we were just  passing by. Like this is none of our business. That'll never work, she said. It's all I've got.  You don't think we should try to run for it? No, I said. If we run, they'll chase us. Maybe if we  walk, they'll figure we haven't done anything and let us alone. They have a lot of arrests to make.  They'll be busy for a long time. The park was rolling with bodies, people and adults clawing  at their faces and gasping. The cops dragged them by the armpits, then lashed their wrists with  plastic cuffs and tossed them into the trucks like rag dolls. Okay, I said. Okay, she said.  And that's just what we did.
