Transcript:  Oh my god, champagne's all over the place. It is the sixth  anniversary episode of This Week in Tech. And you know what's so cool?  We got all of the original characters together again.  We got the old band back together again. Here, Kevin, a little champagne.  Kevin Rose, formerly CEO of Digg, host of Digg Nation,  part owner of Revision, or if I guess full owner of Revision 3, I don't know who owns Revision 3.  And,  and  what's something else? Oh, that milk thing. He's in a Belgian trance band.  That's right. Milk, Inc. Kevin Rose, great to have you back  in the studio. Thanks for coming up. I'm still here six years. That's insane. Sixth year, we're going into our seventh year and it is, I'm just really thrilled.  We should tape this with the 21st Amendment. I know. Now, I'm not counting that one. That was TWiT Zero, which you were all at. I don't know if,  Robert, were you there at the first one? No, I think I was like the second one.  I still have those MP3s we still have to record. I could play it if you want to hear them. We still have them online. If you go to twiT.tv slash one.

Start time: 163.34

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There was no video back then at all, right? No, we didn't do a video. The first video was 20, episode 23 I think.

Start time: 167.84

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You're recording on probably a $800 DAT player and you could probably buy something that does that now. That looks crappier than that.

Start time: 172.92
End time: 256.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I'll tell you. You probably do it with a cell phone. You want to hear the first, we called it Revenge of the Screenships.  Oh yeah. I had to bleep it because G4 says please don't.  David Prager is also here in the studio with us. Great to have you. Great to be back. From Revision 3, also here.  Robert Heron, Heron Fidelity. You were on the first one, weren't you? Yeah, I think it was Robert Kevin Patrick Norton.  He's in absentia. David wasn't on the first one, but he was on the zero.  Oh, okay. I wasn't on zero. I was on number one.  And I was pulling you all up on Skype on one instance of Skype. And we had the backup with the DAT recorder.  Yeah. Cheers. Cheers. Wow, what a... Robert Heron.  To ten more years. Ten, is that all I get?  We enter our seventh year of This Week in Tech. John C. DeBork, people say, well, where's John?  John C. DeBork did not join the show until episode five. You're right, Kevin. Our first video episode wasn't until 23.  We did that at the Apple Store. And I'm all sweaty in it because it was just me running around, wiring the whole thing up.  And I just worked up a hell of a sweat. I forgot it was video, I guess. That was challenging.  And Roger McGuin was with us on that one. You were there for that, right?  I think I was doing one at the Apple Store. I was definitely one at the Apple Store, yeah.  And then we started doing it in a bar for a while. Remember that? That didn't work out so well.

Start time: 256.84

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, it was up here. That was kind of fun, though. You brought all those Canon XL2?

Start time: 261.98
End time: 309.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what you got all around you. I bought those because I wasn't doing video.  So I bought these cameras, $14,000 worth of cameras, thinking we were going to do video.  And then we abandoned it because it was such a bad idea. It was so hard to do it in bars and coffee shops.  Came back here, continued to do it for audio. Just started video about three years ago.  And now we're streaming 40 hours a week. We had 55 million downloads in the last 12 months, 5 million a month now.  That is awesome. And we're building a 10,000 square foot studio, which we can barely afford.  But you need it. But you can see we're jammed in this room. I can't do any more shows.  Tom Merritt does his new show, Tech News Today, every afternoon with this many people.  And this was never set up for that. It was set up for me by myself.  So yeah, we're completely redesigning everything. And it's kind of fun.  But you've been through this a few times, Kevin. This is...

Start time: 309.86
End time: 314.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, we were in the upstairs bathroom or something.  Yeah, the world's smallest room in this country.

Start time: 314.84
End time: 317.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was when we were sitting on the floor doing the show.  I remember that.

Start time: 317.96
End time: 331.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It was about five and a half years ago. We did System Episode 4, which was about how to podcast.  And here's the best example of how to do it from the professionals you can get.  And at the time back then, I mean, there was nothing even compared to this.

Start time: 332.06
End time: 379.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, then that's why I wonder what netcasting or podcasting will look like in five years from now and 10 years from now.  I mean, I think it's... When we were at the NAB show, and Robert, next time you got to come.  I will.  I'm sorry I didn't make it this year.  What was clear was that all of this $100,000, $1 million broadcast equipment was just coming down, down, down.  More and more affordable. More and more people could do exactly what we do on a small budget.  So I think you're going to see a lot of networks like this.  I mean, right now it's Revision 3. It's us.  Callie Lewis is Livit Lobster. There's a handful.  But I think, you know, there's...  Is TriCaster still like the core for a lot of the small video podcasters?  It is for us. We couldn't do it without TriCaster.  Blackmagic showed $1,000 box. I was very impressed. Hardware, Switcher.  I saw that.  You guys, what do you use at Revision 3?  We use a Switcher.

Start time: 380.90
End time: 388.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You use a Slate, BroadcastPix Slate?  No, not BroadcastPix. Who makes the Switcher? It's... Darn it. I was going to ask Graham.  Graham is your pragnapedia. Graham...

Transcript:  Actually, yeah.

Start time: 394.01
End time: 404.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't matter. You spent a lot of money in there.  But see, you had venture capital.  And I think sometimes venture capital is bad for discipline because you have too much money you can spend.  We could only spend what we made.

Start time: 405.26
End time: 407.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. I'm going... My new startup is all about the cheap.

Start time: 408.02
End time: 409.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm so excited. Tell me about Milk.

Start time: 410.00
End time: 421.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, Milk is essentially a small group of developers.  One designer, myself as a product person.  Dan Burka.  Yeah. Daniel Burka joined us as our head designer.

Start time: 421.88
End time: 425.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He was the guy who helped you with DIG way back when, right?

Start time: 425.84
End time: 437.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. So, Daniel joined me at DIG probably two months in.  And he turned my nasty, ugly utilitarian design into something beautiful and elegant.  He's one of the best designers out there.  He's awesome.

Start time: 437.88
End time: 442.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In fact, I want to ask you about Glitch because you probably know about Glitch.  But we'll ask you in a bit.  So, this is Milk, Inc.

Start time: 443.06
End time: 451.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The company is called Milk.  Yes. It's called Milk.  The website is milkinc.com.  Yeah. We're at Milk on Twitter and facebook.com slash milk.  So, all it says on the site, we build apps.

Start time: 452.79
End time: 453.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But what does that mean?

Start time: 454.33
End time: 509.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mobile apps?  Yeah. We want to do mobile.  I think that mobile is a lot of fun right now.  It's just such a really cool space.  And there's all these new technologies like GPS and the cameras and all the stuff that...  the accelerometers that you have access to that I've never worked with.  So, I'm just excited to build some new kind of next generation apps and like quality apps.  So, you're the vision guy?  Yeah. Basically, I've always been kind of a combination of a project manager slash product guy slash marketing slash business slash designer.  So, I'll create like wireframe designs and a couple different programs I use.  Hand them off to Daniel.  It'll be all the kind of usability and flow of an application.  So, I'll say like if a user presses this, it goes to this screen.  This is how this button should function.  This is what I want to happen here.  And then I mock that all up with all the flow.  And then Daniel actually makes beautiful, you know, nice versions of that.  We debate some of the features.  And then we pass it over to the developers who then code it up.

Start time: 510.44
End time: 512.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the developers are also part of the group or are they going to be contracted?

Start time: 513.00
End time: 529.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No. They're all... So, there's a total of six of us.  We have two iOS developers.  One backend kind of utility slash iOS guy that does a little bit of everything, does all of our backend stuff.  It helps us scale.  One BD person and then myself and Daniel, the designer.

Start time: 530.35
End time: 530.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No Android guy.

Start time: 531.50
End time: 539.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No Android. But our iOS developers have done Android in the past.  So, they could.  If something hits, we're basically going to launch an Android version probably six months later.

Start time: 540.28
End time: 546.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One of the things that you said, I think it was a TechCrunch interview, you said,  we'll kill our babies fast if they don't fly.  You're not going to waste time with a dud.

Start time: 546.92
End time: 574.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, for us, we want to go after a couple of big ideas.  And we know, you know, it's...  I could go and build something that is just, I don't know,  a slightly different version of a really popular app that's out there like, say, Core or something like that.  And you can do that. And that's kind of like... It's an interesting space.  I mean, like, Yammer is a great version of a more private version of Twitter for businesses.  And that's awesome. But we want to try some bigger, bolder ideas.  And we know that some of those actually will fail.  I mean, it's just bound to happen. So...

Start time: 575.35
End time: 582.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, you're not... It's interesting because you're not an incubator.  First, I thought, oh, it's kind of like Idea Lab, Bill Gross's Idea Lab.  But you're not an incubator. People aren't going to come to you.  No, they're not.

Start time: 582.84
End time: 583.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're going to generate all the ideas.

Start time: 583.92
End time: 595.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, exactly. So we have two or three ideas on the table right now...  I love this.  ...that we want to go after. And we're going to build one first, launch it, iterate on top of it,  you know, spend a few months working with it. And if it doesn't work out,  we'll just shoot it in the head and move on to something else.

Start time: 596.18
End time: 631.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm super excited for this, knowing Kevin fairly well.  And I think, you know, some of the things that you're best at is coming up with really cool, innovative ideas.  And sometimes they're good and sometimes they might not be good.  But you always have new ideas, a lot of them, either making someone else's process better  or something that someone else hasn't tried.  I think having the kind of company that Milk is allows you the freedom to fail and think of more ideas.  Because, I mean, we're all kind of ADD to some extent.  So you might get excited about something. And if it sticks, that's great.  And you can still, even if it's doing well, go on to something else or just, you know, kill it like you said  and go on to the next thing that you're excited about.  I think it's like perfect for what Kevin excels at.

Start time: 631.98
End time: 633.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's going to be fun. I can't wait.

Start time: 634.00
End time: 643.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a great idea. And it's almost old fashioned. It's kind of like a workshop  where the whole thing gets produced, handcrafted software.  I like the idea a lot.

Start time: 643.84
End time: 690.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's cool in that we spend most of our time working on one app.  And then, you know, like last Friday, we sat down in that afternoon, had a couple of beers.  And they were like, OK, what are we going to do is cover nights and weekends project where, you know,  it's like a smaller idea. Yeah, exactly.  A 20 percent, but with our own ideas.  So we have another one that we're kind of cooking up on the side.  And it's awesome. Self-funded or are you going to?  I self-funded the first few months and now I'm about to close funding.  So that'll be done sometime in the next week or so.  Oh, great.  So the whole idea, though, like you said about venture capital, I'm really, you know,  having raised a lot of money for both Revision 3 and Dig and all these companies,  there's pluses to that. And there's also downsides to taking on a bunch of capital.  I mean, you not only dilute yourself, but take on board seats.  You're no longer in control of the company. I mean, there's just a bunch of things there.

Start time: 692.00
End time: 702.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  To me, it's about control, not so much giving up percentage of the company.  It's giving up control. Yeah.  And I have to say that probably your experience with Dig informed that a little bit.  I mean, absolutely.  It must have been a little frustrating at times.

Start time: 703.08
End time: 729.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If you wanted to, I'm sure, like say you wanted more money to build your studio,  you could probably get it in a heartbeat without losing much control.  Oh, absolutely. Well, nowadays you can, can't you?  So for you, I bet you could get the money you need to finish off the studio immediately.  Right. And I bet you'd give off five percent.  Okay. Less than that.  No, seriously. Okay. Done.  Done. You should seriously do it.  If you said I'm entertaining. I'd give up five percent.  I mean, that's not a big deal.  If you put together your financial.

Start time: 730.20
End time: 752.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We've already set up an operating structure where 30 percent of the company is set aside for that  and for employees and I still have 70 percent, so I still have absolute control.  Is that right, Kevin? Even if I, as long as I can have more than majority,  they can't take it away from me. That's what I care about, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a big piece of it.  I know so many entrepreneurs. I think of Steve Jobs, but I think of also smaller companies  where the founder gets pushed out by the board and the investors.

Start time: 752.84
End time: 787.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but there's other ways to structure it. So another way, what you can do is,  so you wonder how does Zuckerberg maintain control, right?  Yeah, no kidding.  So one of the things that he did that was really smart,  and a lot of companies are starting to do this, is where when you go in as the founder,  if you have a product that's really successful, you can demand certain rights that other people wouldn't get.  So one of the things that I believe that he did was that you tell the other employees,  sign an agreement saying that their common vote goes with the founder.  So even though you don't control the stock, you control the common stock vote.  You control the votes, which is what you want.  And as long as you control the vote, you won't get overthrown.

Start time: 787.88
End time: 798.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So we have Class A, which I, I learned this from Paul Allen.  We have Class A stock, which is mine, and then I'm giving the other stock I'm giving out as a Class B stock.  And remember, Paul did that to us.

Start time: 799.18
End time: 804.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, he was saying, look, I'm losing money here.  So some people had stock that Paul Allen gave to certain people.  I had 300-something thousand shares.

Start time: 805.84
End time: 807.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But he sold it for a massive loss.

Start time: 808.26
End time: 809.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But even like, you know, if, you know...

Start time: 809.94
End time: 815.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it implies you have a percentage of the company, but you're right, if he loses money, you don't have any money.  Well, I mean, if you run a company and you raise a million dollars,

Start time: 815.84
End time: 820.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  and the company sells years later for a million dollars,  those investors who invested the million dollars shouldn't get their money for it.

Start time: 820.84
End time: 825.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's how I've set it up, too.  I learned the hard way.

Start time: 825.96
End time: 854.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there's other things, too, that can screw you.  Like, let's say, for instance, you go and you raise a couple million bucks,  and then you sell the company for five million dollars.  You think, oh, that's great. Everyone gets paid out, right?  In some cases, the investors that you're raising the money from, they have a guaranteed outcome,  meaning that they want to see like a 5X return, whatever it may be.  And so they can go in and claw back some of the shares from you,  and then you'll end up with absolutely nothing, you know?  So that's where you can really get screwed.  So it's really tricky stuff.

Start time: 855.08
End time: 864.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, Paul Graham said, don't bootstrap your own company.  He also said you need two founders.  I'm bootstrapping with my single soul self, so I'm...  You should seriously raise some money.

Start time: 865.26
End time: 872.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like, you could go out there and do a convertible note right now  and give away just like a percent or two and put, you know,  a million and a half bucks in the bank and build out this entire thing.

Start time: 872.96
End time: 879.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I could get my boat.  So...  That's what you don't do with the money if you need a driver for the boat.

Start time: 879.84
End time: 895.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So tell me about Glitch.  So, we've got Glitch.  This is something that everybody's talking about.  It's going to go into beta, a little bit more public beta next week.  Daniel Berka, the designer, somebody...  I haven't played it, but a number of people have played it in the chat room  and said it's pretty cool.  You must have played it by now.

Start time: 895.88
End time: 897.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I've played it. So, Daniel...

Start time: 897.86
End time: 899.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a massively multiplayer online role-playing game.

Start time: 900.84
End time: 907.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's really cool.  It's like a side-scroller, 2D, really beautiful worlds.  But that's already weird,

Start time: 908.84
End time: 910.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  because I never heard of a massively multiplayer side-scroller.

Start time: 911.37
End time: 918.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's going to be a lot of fun.  They've been working on it now for about a year and a half.  It's pretty.  Yeah, it's really beautiful.

Start time: 918.84
End time: 920.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's come from some of the Flickr founders.

Start time: 920.84
End time: 925.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so the founder, Stuart Butterfield of Flickr.  This is his new thing.

Start time: 926.10
End time: 927.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's funny, Flickr was a game before it was a photo set.

Start time: 927.90
End time: 928.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the idea.

Start time: 929.84
End time: 931.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's basically what they wanted to do.

Start time: 931.84
End time: 935.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The actual thing that Flickr was supposed to be.  So, Cal, the CTO of Flickr, and Stuart joined up to create this.

Start time: 936.41
End time: 939.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's really pretty.  Are these all of Daniel's drawings?

Start time: 939.90
End time: 949.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, some of the stuff is his.  There were a couple of other illustrators that worked with him on this stuff.  He did pretty much all the UI stuff,  like that kind of stuff right there.

Start time: 950.38
End time: 960.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it seems like this is an online role-playing game  for people who don't want to do the sword and sorcery genre,  or the sci-fi genre.

Start time: 960.96
End time: 965.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is, I think, more like sword and source.  Well, it's not like sorcery.  There's fantasy.

Start time: 967.14
End time: 970.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

That's when it launched. May 11, 1998.  The day they were sold,  which I think was April 1, 2004.  April 2004.  After five years and 11 months they were sold.  They let me go.

Somebody in the chat room mentioned he's on 60 Minutes tonight.  What did he say?  I don't know. I haven't seen the 60 Minutes episode yet.  It's on tonight.  I wonder if he mentions us.  He's not going to mention us.  Just one of many bad business deals that Paul Allen made.  There's a lot to talk about in just a little bit.  We're going to talk about Portal 2 and an interesting promotion,  as long as we're talking about video games.  I preloaded.  I preloaded that game.  Did you? I'm excited.  I'm ready to go for Tuesday.  You can't run it until they release it, right?  Middle of the work week.  Good timing.  I can't wait.  I'm actually excited.  A new Nintendo at E3, perhaps?  That's the rumor.  We'll talk about it.  Is France plotting to kill the free internet?  Plus, a video recorded greeting from Patrick Norton.  He was in the desert as usual.  Patrick just can't sit still, can he?  None of that surprises me.  You know who's been with the  Twitter for longer than...  We have three sponsors  who have been with us since almost the beginning.  Citrix is one of them.  But here's a product that they did not have  or they weren't promoting, at least, when we first started.  A really great product called  GoToAssist Express.  I want you to give it a try today.  They tell me,  and I only dimly remember this,  that we used this on the screensavers  or we were trying to use this on the screensavers  to help people with their computers.  Well, it's come a long way since 1998.  GoToAssist Express uses that  Citrix Remote Access back end to make it easy  to do remote support. Stop  doing phone support.  Just reach into their computer and  fix it. It's so much easier.  And because you can do eight sessions at once,  you can do unattended sessions,  you can work with a Mac on a PC, and vice versa,  really, the sky's the limit.  We're talking about a major improvement  in productivity. If you're in the support  business, or if you just do  as I do, and I'm on the phone with my mom,  she says, I can't figure out  where my quick end data went.  GoToAssist Express.  GoToAssist.com slash  twit right now to try it free  for 30 days.  They have day passes as well as  month subscriptions, so you can  use the plan that makes sense for you.  But for now, try the month subscription  free. GoToAssist.com  slash twit. Did anybody  get invited? Did you get invited to France?  What was France?  I don't know if this is a hoax or not. I got an  email this week  from the Deputy Minister  of the Interior in France, you know, the G8  summits at the end of May.  And they're doing this thing called EG8.  I'm supposedly going to get a guilt-elged  envelope on Monday. I think it might be a hoax.  I'm not holding my breath. Although I called  LaWeek, and he said, oh no, I was invited. You're going.  So they asked internet  leaders, Amazon's Jeff Bezos,  Google's former CEO,  Eric Schmidt, I guess he's chairman of the board now, so  that counts. Mark Zuckerberg  and me.  I'm sure 500 other close friends  to go and talk  about internet  and security, internet and  economy, internet and society  with Sarkozy  and his leaders prior to the G8  summit to prepare a white paper for the G8  about the internet and how, you know,  how it should be treated.

I think they're trying. You know, Sarkozy's notorious  for kind of being anti-internet. He's the guy  who kind of formulated the three strikes  laws that are in effect in France.  You know, three accusations of  piracy and you're offline forever.

Transcript:  And other things. So he's kind of notoriously  kind of pro-business, pro-big business  in anti-internet neutrality. So I'll be curious.  It's a chance, in some ways,  it's a chance, I think,  for people like me who feel  very strong on the other side to say,  hey, wait a minute. Hey, Nick, baby.  Anyway, I don't know. So I was  just curious if anybody else's, maybe,  I think it's a hoax. I think there just needs to be  more honest discussion about the  damages that are possible.  It seems like they always overestimate or overstate  how much money is lost  when somebody pirates software or something like that.  I guess what I would say is, what is the  damage to society  if you bend over backwards to protect these  content holders?  The pendulum swings, of course.  And I believe, I mean, content holders  have rights. I'm not saying that. You create something of value.  You have the right to protect it.  I'm not saying that. But when they go  so far as to knock people off the internet for  three accusations, when they kind of  go to the point beyond  you know,  due process,  then the pendulum has swung too far.  That and internet services become something akin to,  I'd say, a utility that's almost  necessary nowadays.  Not so much as water or air, but  it's close.

Transcript:  But the story essentially says that, you know,  if you own a piece of music and you store it on the cloud,  in order to access the piece of music that you bought  that's stored on the cloud, you should not have to pay  a licensing fee. And I agree.  If you buy a piece of music, you own it.  Sony says you don't own it.  And so Amazon said back off.  They wrote and said back off, no.  They were talking about protecting their clients  who were keeping data on the cloud, among other things.

Transcript:  We talked about this last week.  It's my opinion that Apple was poised to launch this service.  They knew Amazon was getting close.  They said, okay, go ahead. You first.  Because they figured the lawsuits would all hit the first guy,  which of course they're going to.  And let Amazon defend this.  And then if it goes well for Amazon, we'll do it.  Amazon wrote, there's been speculation  that we are looking for licenses  for cloud drive and cloud player,  licenses from the record companies.  We're not looking for licenses.  No licenses are required.  Cloud player is a media management  and playback application,  not unlike Windows Media Player  and any number of other media management applications  that let customers manage and play their music.  It requires a license from content owners,  no more than those applications do.  It's really that simple.  So they're saying whether you store it on the cloud  on your hard drive, it's your music.  No one else has access to it.  It's the same thing. The cloud is the hard drive.  It's a remote hard drive over IP.

Transcript:  it doesn't mean I have to get a license from Sony  to play the music on the computer.  So I think they're in the right on this.  Of course, you never know what the courts will say.  It's kind of unpredictable.  And then you have another story about music,

Start time: 1667.18
End time: 1686.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  which is if you're not buying the music,  it's a Spotify story about whether or not  ads can support your usage of music.  So they used to be able to get a free...  If you want to be a free subscriber to Spotify  and not a paid subscriber,  you can stream so many hours of music a month.  And it's not sustaining...  You get 20 hours...  20 hours, bringing it back to 10, and other restrictions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it's not because Spotify is trying to be a-holes about it.  It's because Spotify can't recoup the cost  that it requires for them to provide that service.  So then for companies like Spotify and RDO,  or if it's called radio...  Is it RDO or radio?  Radio.  I say RDO.  There's no A in it.  It's more difficult to support it with ads.  And so, Spotify is saying that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what my favorite though, and I know how to pronounce it, is Mog.  Have you tried Mog?  It's like RDO, but it's got 320 kilobits,  and it's got twice as many songs.  How much is Mog, though?  Same price, 10 bucks.

Start time: 1725.41
End time: 1751.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh no, I was just saying that Spotify is saying  to those people that are really upset at them  that if you're someone that's going to be  impacted by these new rules, then you're obviously  a heavy enough user that maybe you should consider,  maybe you should pay for the services that are being provided.  I'm kind of a fan of...  Sometimes when you pay money for something,  you're going to get a quality product.  Like if Gmail all of a sudden had a Gmail Plus,  I'd probably sign up immediately, because I'd assume it would be that much better.  I feel like I'm paying them now.  Now I feel like it deserves something other than just the two gigs of storage.  We showed this...

Start time: 1752.84
End time: 1805.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You told me about this, and I'll show it again.  We showed it on Twitter a little while ago  from an information visualization site  called InformationIsBeautiful.net.  How much do music artists earn online?  This is a very graphic illustration.  So, as a solo artist,  to earn a minimum wage of $1,160 a month,  if you make your own CD,  you have to sell 143 of them.  That's a lot of money.  I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.  I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.  I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.  143 of them.  That's doable. So that's that dot.  CD on CD Baby,  $155, that's that dot.  Retail, $161,  download on iTunes, it gets bigger, it gets more.  If you sell it at retail,  $3,871 of them,  that's that dot.  If you sell it on Amazon or iTunes,  you need to sell $12,000. It's starting to get pretty big.  This is to make minimum wage.  Minimum wage, $1,160 a month.

Start time: 1806.86

Spotify,  $4 million plays,  to make minimum wage for that independent artist.  to make minimum wage for that independent artist.  That's the size of that dot.

Transcript:  So people complain about Demand Media,  because we've talked about that before also.  That's the idea that you create articles  in response to search terms,  so that you get more money.  And frankly, the quality of the article doesn't matter,  and that's why you could pay $5 to the artist.  and that's why you could pay $5 to the artist.  So this is from Silicon Valley Watcher.

That's the big problem I ran.  I hate to say it, but I wanted the new Rihanna album.  And it turned out that the only way I could get it unedited was to import it.  What do you mean unedited?  Not bleeping the expletives?  Yeah, there's only a couple songs that even need it.  But it turned out they didn't even sell that version in the United States.  And I was like, so then I go, okay, where can I get it?  You're the kind of guy that bought imports.  Where can I get it lossless then?  You guys are all too young to remember imports.

Transcript:  I saw people in the chat room commenting that a lot of the subscription services allow them to be able to play music that they wouldn't normally be able to afford.  It's good for discovery too.  But also, if you don't have a lot of money and you want to listen to a huge amount of stuff, you're going to be able to do that by paying a subscription version.

Transcript:  Well, I'm an old fart, so I've been collecting for years, so I have hundreds of gigs of music.  All the music I'd ever want, I actually do have on the hard drive now.  But what I don't have is the new music, and I can't make that discovery very easily.  So these services are great for discovering music.  Are you able to put these songs onto portable devices?  Uh-huh.  So that's the other thing that's weird.  As long as you keep paying the 10 bucks, you can download all of it, put it on an iPad, an Android phone, or an iPhone, and listen to it offline.  That's cool.  But periodically it has to check somehow.

Transcript:  We're living in the future, man.  The future is now.  Are you worried?  There was that one take on the future where the hard drive manufacturers, just to upsell their components, were going to just start putting every song ever encoded and produced onto the hard drive.  You could erase it if you don't want your storage, but there would at least be content already on the drive when you bought it.  Who is it?  Seagate selling 3 terabyte hard drives now?  Yeah.  3 terabytes.  I need them.  I need bigger.  Could you fit?  My ass is full.

And of course, now AT&T's saying 150 gigabyte cap.  Comcast's saying 250 gigabyte a month cap.  On wireless, it's three or five.  I ran out of 3G on my drive.  Did you see the NGAD story, though?  Comcast is announcing that new 100 megabit service, and then they calculated how long you'd burn through.  Within five days, basically, you'd go through all 250 gigabytes a year.  If you watch TwitLive every day, a few days later, you're done.  That's crazy.  And that's why...  You know, Comcast says, oh, you don't have to worry about this.  Nobody uses that much.  It's 1%.  It's the bandwidth hogs.  But what they're doing is they're being very proactive.  They're planning for a day when everybody's watching Netflix and downloading radio from RDO and all that.  And they're saying, we got to watch out, guys.  We're going to be out of business if people do that.  So I really have a feeling that...  Need more internet providers, service providers.  That's what we need.  OK, let's talk about net neutrality.

Start time: 2254.92

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can't.  And this is...  I finally came to...  Because I understand the argument.  I completely agree with that because these guys are morons.  I'm going to play a clip in a little bit that you will just not believe.  Series of tubes?  Worse.  It's actually worse than a series of tubes.  And it's bizarre, but I'm going to play it for you in a second.  But I finally realized why we do want to let the FCC protect net neutrality.  Because they made the mess in the first place.  We wouldn't have a problem if the FCC hadn't granted a duopoly to cable and phone companies saying,  No, you can put in the copper.  And as a result, you get a monopoly on internet access.  So most people only have a couple of choices, right?  And that's the reason net neutrality is an issue.  If you had 10 internet service providers, you could go to the one that gave...  One's going to give you a bandwidth, equal bandwidth for everybody.  You go to that one.  One's not going to have caps.  You go to that one.  They're going to get all the business.  But there isn't that choice.  They're effectively a monopoly.  They're colluding.  That's why it seems that the only additional choices appearing recently have been wireless solutions.  The municipal wireless being deployed in certain places.  I'm excited.  We had the guy who wrote VisiCalc in here.  I always forgotten his name.  But his new campaign, he worked at Microsoft.  He was a guy putting that routing into routers.  He said, I knew that the internet service providers would end up wanting to charge everybody online.  So nobody thought about this.  But before anybody was on anybody's radar, I told Microsoft, we should build these routers with NAT in them.  And as a result, no internet service provider can say how many people are using that single connection.  I'd like to shake that person's hand.  What's his name? Chatroom.  We just had him on our triangulation episode.  It's just... Bob Frankston. Thank you.  Thank you, Bob.  Really one of the greats of all time.  Anyway, Frankston is now big on community internet.  He says that's the solution to internet neutrality.  You buy big pools of internet for your cul-de-sac or your street or your neighborhood.  I think that's brilliant.  There are buildings in the Bay Area, apartment complexes in particular, that have 100 megabit going in.  And everyone gets that into their...  And you just pay into like the collective to have that service right in your apartment.  But it's harder to do that with individual households, unfortunately.  We got to do something.  Anyway, this is why I thought it was appropriate for the FCC.  At least Google's deploying some of that dark fiber finally.  They chose... What was it? Somewhere in Kansas.  Yeah, Kansas City. Not Topeka.  Topeka is the one that renamed itself Google Kansas.  So it's getting at that last 100 feet into somebody's house.  That's where it becomes very limited.  Okay, Patrick Norton cannot be with us.  He was, of course, one of the people on Twitter one exactly.  It's kind of interesting. It was April 17th, 2005.  Exactly six years ago.

And if you're a contractor or independent, you're sending out invoices still.  I remember that was the thing I hated the most. I loved the work.  I hated the billing. And that's where FreshBooks really changed my life.  Amber told me about FreshBooks in 2004 because they were a Toronto company.  She knew the guys and changed my life.  FreshBooks made it so easy to do my billing.  My invoices. Finally, I'd actually get paid.  I remember one time I left an invoice for nine months.  Try and get paid after not billing somebody for nine months. Nine months later.  Hey, can I have my money?

There's a button on the email that says pay it now with credit card or one of 11 services like PayPal.  So that really you get paid faster just because of that.  There's a lot of people.  It's easier for your clients to pay.  I can pay it. I'm going to pay it.  I don't know the clients. Most of the time it's not that they don't want to pay.  It's just that, you know, they put it off and it's one click process.  You can also have this is really cool.  Automated invoices and auto billing and auto payment.  If you can set up so you don't even have to think about it.  And then, yeah, there are people who don't pay.  So you've got late payment reminders. You're right.  They kind of automate this whole process.  There are old fashioned folks who still want printed invoices.  They'll do that for an additional fee.  They stamp print and mail it.  I used to do that for Rogers in Canada.  Well, they handle multiple currencies, which is really great if you do business around the world.  They've got an iPhone app that will track hours and then automatically put it in the invoice.  And this is, you know, this was one of the first Web 2.0 companies.

The cake is not a lie.  There's a Portal reference.  Oh, yeah. Will there be cake in Portal 2?  Of course, there's going to be cake.  Glad us. So they're doing a whole promotion.  I think it's very clever.  The Steam promotion where they say you you have to play this this bunch of games to power up glass.  And if you if enough people play in there enough hours, glad us will be powered up sooner.  They were we were hoping they would launch it Friday, but they didn't write.  No, it didn't happen.  So you preloaded it on Steam, though.  You can download it now.  Totally. If you have paid for the game or yes, you can download it now.  I think one of the better deals, though, is to buy it.  If you want, buy it for one of the game consoles like the PS3 or the Xbox 360.  You then if at least on the PS3, you actually get a steam login that gives you the game on Steam for the PC console and you do co-op between the PC.  Oh, I love that.  And I'm like, it's it's been a long time since I've actually did any kind of co-op with anybody.  I usually only play on PCs, but you're a troubled loner.  But I have a game console, too, that sits there relatively.  I use so it'd be fun to great.  I'm going to mix it up.  And with that game in particular, it should be a I'm looking forward to co-op.  So tell me how it's different from Portal one.  That's going to be a good question.  You know what? I've purposely not except for the commercials on TV.  I really haven't looked at it or investigated it.  But my friend who works for Sony has played through quite a bit of it and at least the first three hours of it.  And he was is it the same team that's doing it?  Yes. As far as I know, the story should be a little different, though, this time in that it's going to be apparently a couple of the robots from before.  At least I'm just basing this off of what I've seen on the commercial so far.  But we know I have to say OMG Chad, who is our newest employee and is here today, even though he's doesn't start to like July, but he decided to come give us all cupcakes, which I thought was very sweet.  Did you have you had Robert?  You ate the top off your cupcake.  The frosting fell off.  It fell off.  But I did.  And then I was like, wait a minute.  These are defective cupcakes.

This looks really good.  A lot more detail.  You know, I was saying on chat because when we were at E3 last year, last June, we were thanks to him.  He bulldozed his way into the steam presentation and got exclusive video of Portal 2.  So look how long it takes almost a year later.  The co-op side of this, too, is going to be pretty crazy in the sense that in the first game, you had to do moves that maintained your motion or momentum in order to get past certain areas.  So you'd maintain speed.  In this case, you'll be able to pair up with your partner where they'll have to fire the portal you'll go through.  So their timing will have to be concerted with.  It's going to add a whole new take to it.  And there's just not enough good co-op games out there anyway.  This is a good way to get sick this game.  Oh, look at the cubes flying around.  I find it harder to watch it being played than to actually play it.  Very nauseating.

Transcript:  I'm ignorant. I admit it.  I'm just a player.  Did you see Gary, what Gary of Gary's Mod did?  That was clever.  This is brilliant.  I don't know what Gary's Mod is. It's a steam, it's a sandbox mode for the Half-Life engine  to where you can basically go in and create any scenario, any, you know, you can hook jets onto a trash can and have it zip around.  That's cool.  You can experiment with anything you want and to play around with the game itself, the game engine.  So he wrote a bug into it that only happens if you didn't pay for it, if you're using a stolen copy.  Uh-huh.  And it's 10 bucks, I think.  I know. It's crazy.  You get the error, unable to shade polygon normals.  And so what he does is he says, just do a Google search for unable to shade polygon normals.  The error code that you get is your steam ID.  So people are going online saying, um, is there something wrong with Gary's Mod?  I get this error message when I try to shade polygon normals.

Transcript:  I hope they're true.  We're going to be at E3.  We're going to be covering it again this year.  I'm sure Brian Brushwood and I are going to go down.  The trick on E3, I learned last year, is you go down the day before it starts because the press conferences are on Monday.  So you go Monday to hit the press conferences.  That's when Nintendo will announce if they announce.  So we will if we can't get into the press conferences.  I have a bad record lately.

Same thing with Sony, right?  Sony's better.  Nintendo's the one that had to update.  They weren't even HD.  They've always had that track record though of producing hardware that from the point it's shipped, they were never losing money on anything.  It was always making money from day one.  That's true.  They were always able to, I mean, their expenses were covered almost instantly.  So what do you do?  What do you put in a new generation, second generation Nintendo?

You haven't seen the new Tron?  No, I have it on Blu-ray.  It's sitting there.  Oh my god.  I finally watched Inception the other day.  Oh really?  It tells you how far behind.  What did you think of Inception?  Eh.  Eh.  I was like, I got it.  Everyone was like, it's just going to blow your freaking mind.  I watched it and I'm like, okay, I got it.  It was good.  I'm going to watch it again.  Maybe I really missed something.  Is it out on Blu-ray yet?  Yeah.  I want to see it like that.  I picked that up.  You know what you should do?  I think Inception is reviews of the content of the Blu-ray movies and stuff.  That would be kind of cool.  Is this a good, not only is this a good master, but is it a good movie?  Totally.  We go over image quality on some of the films based on some of the guys that do this all  the time.  Right.  Because I don't sit there and stare at it for every little, I have reference content  that I pay attention to very well, but I don't go through every movie I look at and be very  critical of how it was encoded, how it sounds.  But for Tron in particular, everyone is giving it five out of five for audio and visual quality.  And I'm just like, okay.  But how's the movie?  I have no idea.

No, we have some in to review over at Review 3.  Do you like them?  I don't know.  I think that if you're sitting in a dark room by yourself, it might be worth it for the  high end movies.  And that's the only time I think I'd really want to wear glasses.  The 3D TV?  If you turn on the active 3D glasses and you turn them on, you'll start to feel the flickering  if you're not looking at just the TV, which can give you a headache.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The glasses are cheaper, which is nice.  Glasses are dirt cheap.  So Vizio includes like four pairs right in the box.  But it's not as good?  Well, it's currently half resolution.  Yeah, lower resolution.  So you're losing half the resolution on the screen.  However, a lot of people claim that they don't suffer from any of the flicker issues or other  issues where some people get headaches watching 3D content with liquid crystal shutter glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That seems to alleviate some of the issues though going to passive.  However, passive I believe also does wide viewing angles a little bit better.  You could sit further off to the side, but up and down is where it gets screwed up too.  So you're being a guinea pig for a lot of this stuff.  Yeah, that's how I feel.  We're on like basically the second gen for active shutter glasses and the second gen  I imagine for passive shutter will require a double resolution TV.  So they're going to have quad resolution soon enough.  I'll tell you, that's what I was excited about.  It's going to push it.  Of course there were all the 3D cameras and everything, but there were a lot of 4K displays,  4K cameras.  Sony showed an 8K camera, Red showed a 5K camera to me.  And James Cameron at the keynote talked about the idea of shooting 48 frames a second for  film and 60 frames a second for video.  And then what you're getting is a super hyper real image that to me is better than 3D because  it looks like real life.  Less blurring per frame too.  It's beautiful.  It's bright.  It's crisp.  And also it's a multiple of 24.  So I think it'll still retain some of that film look, that film quality, a video that  I personally like it.  So I don't want that to go away, but I wouldn't mind.  And in particular, Jackson for The Hobbit.  That's where he posted that great post in Facebook.  They're shooting those all on Epics.  Doing everything on 48 frames per second.  He claims, well, part of it's also that it'll make a better 3D presentation by improving  the detail of each frame.  When does that come out?  Do you know?  I hate Hobbits.  You hate Hobbits?  What is wrong with you?  Furry footed little...  It just, that whole movie, it didn't, it's a story.  Yes, I know it's a story, but honestly they could have just flew that eagle right to the  Mordor and dumped the damn ring in about...  Yeah, you know, that's a good point.  In about 20 minutes.

We want to put up a tech TV history site where everything would be there.  But we don't want to do it if you say, I hate the idea.  I said, I love the idea.  They own techtv.com.  I said, do it.  I haven't heard from them ever since.  So I think that's fantastic.  And I'd love it if they did that.  There's some people still within there.  You worked there for another six months or so, Kevin.  I remember you weren't real happy working there, but you stayed there for a while.

I just remember the plasma TVs we had at Tech TV.  How are they were all like 15 to $17,000 for a 42 inch panel.  And by the way, all burnt in badly.  So badly, I guess that's not a problem anymore.  But boy, no, they were badly.  You can do it if you really, really try.  You really have to pretty much have to go unconscious for about five days.  I think they all have like this screensaver.  So they might be able to move the little pixel orbiting or they slowly move the picture  around and among other stuff.  Hey, this portion of this week in tech, our sixth anniversary episode brought to you by  one of our newer sponsors, but we sure love them.  The great guys, Anthony Casalina and his crew at Squarespace.com Squarespace.com.  slash twit.  If you'd like to sign up for a free trial, I know they advertise on revision three as  well.  They're great, great little company.  Should not little anymore.  They got what do they get?  Forty eight million dollars in venture capital, something I can't remember.  They're doing all right.  Thank goodness.  Because they they offer a service that is unique.  It's hosting and content management together.  And this is the best hosting.

Transcript:  I'm being I'm being convinced.  Convinced.  Take the tour.  I tell you a couple of things about Squarespace that you'll like.  First of all, they start with some great templates, but they're very easy to customize.  So the unique you don't want heronfidelity look like everybody else.  Right.  You've got the beginning of these templates.  But then I don't know if you use CSS on your site.  If you do, you can paste the CSS in from your site and make it look exactly like your site.  Very cool.  So the design all the designs you paid for a nice design there.  They can be moved over, drag and drop.  So it makes it very easy like you know the sliders and everything to customize.  Forum tools.  Yeah, they got a forum.  Nice.  Great forum.  I'm kind of missing that I should add.  Yeah.  Well, they you know, like any good website now, they realize interactivity is the key.  So they've got a forum building and data collection.  They've got photo galleries and yes, they have forums.  Do a lot of stuff by email, but it'd be nice to have that in a forum environment.  I agree.  Everyone can look at it.  You have an iPad or an iPhone.  I have an iPhone.  Yeah, they bought an iPad.  I have a great iPhone app that lets you not only post but also moderate comments, de-spam,  look at stats.  I love doing that.  Yeah.  You need you need to have mobile access to this.  It is the stats package is fantastic.  I just go on and on.  This is hosting that will never go down on you.  This is a great content management system.  You could try it free for two weeks.  Squarespace.com slash twit click the ring button.  You don't need a credit card.  Just need the site name, hair and fidelity, the password and email address.  The email is just to let you know that your trial is about to run out and if you forget  your password, they won't use it for anything else.  Then a little capture and you're done.  They will import from your WordPress blog, WordPress type pad blogger or movable type.  That means everything.  Comments, links, everything.  Images, they all come over so that you're basically you're up and running within.  I would say if you started like the minute the show ends at by 5.30, you're done.  You got a site free for two weeks and then just play with it.  That way you don't have to.  But Robert, you know somebody in the business.  If you decide you want a Squarespace blog, I will get you a Squarespace blog at no cost  to you.  Wow.  That just happened.  That's not for everybody folks.  You have to pay so that Robert can get it for free.  Squarespace.com slash twit.  No, I think Kevin, you're on Squarespace.  I am.  They'll give prominent bloggers.  It's a good promotional vehicle.  They'll give prominent bloggers a page.  When you do the ads, you probably do some ads on HD Nation.  I do.  You could have gotten this before.  I'm not doing anything for you.  Senior Norton has been pressuring me.  Oh, Mr. Norton who never had a webpage.  We set up so many webpages for Patrick.  I love his Facebook page.  It's just a blank picture.  He posts once.

End time: 4825.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

I don't know what's going to happen with IPv6, but we're getting close to the end.  It has to be coming soon, no?  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the first big ISP to run out of IPv4.  Do you think of all the devices in a home in the next decade that will have individually  addressable devices?  Oh yeah.  You can add all those things.

Start time: 4893.60

Start time: 4896.99
End time: 4942.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's ugly.  No, it's good, but it's ugly because none of the hardware, none of the routers do it.  You can right now, you can get IPv6 from Hurricane Electric.  It's basically a tunneling through IPv4 to you.  You can have, I think a Class C. You can have 32,000 addresses for free because there's  so many.  Go ahead.  Have as many as you want.  Meanwhile, APNIC, Asia Pacific NIC has released the last block of IPv4 addresses.  They're gone.  From this day onwards, according to APNIC Director General Paul Wilson, if you want  to build new internet networks and services in Asia Pacific, you have to use IPv6.  That'll speed things along.

Start time: 4944.14
End time: 4951.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm surprised that with 4.2 billion, I don't know what the third world has, but I'm surprised  it took this long to run out because of the fact that half of every device that gets made  now that has ability to connect to the internet has to have a designation.

Start time: 4974.32
End time: 4997.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  A lot of NAT addressing.  NAT addressing, exactly what saved it.  We had Dane Jasper in here on our triangulation show, which is our interview show.  He's a SonicNet founder and runs it.  It's a great independent ISP.  You may never see IPv6 because what you'll see is NAT-ing from ISP-level NAT-ing to handle  this.

Start time: 5037.08

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hindsight is always 20-20, but I remember when they bought this.  It wasn't that long ago.  No, we were all saying, what the hell are they thinking?  I didn't know all the variables, but I thought, huh, maybe Cisco is going to go even more  consumer.  I thought, is Cisco going to make a phone?  I thought that because phones have video cameras.  I thought, wow, they're a big enough company.  When Apple decided we're going to make a phone, people at first were like, really?  Apple is going to get in the phone business?  Of course they did.  Cisco is a big enough company.  They could have probably designed a pretty amazing phone.

Start time: 5066.08
End time: 5079.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cisco said they wanted to understand the consumer space.  They didn't have any sense of it.  They were near a networking company.  They said, we're going to learn about the consumer space.  I guess what they learned is they didn't want to be in the consumer space because they could  have spun it out.  They could have sold it.

Start time: 5079.66
End time: 5134.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had a buddy of mine that knows some folks over in the M&A department at Cisco.  One of the things that he told me is that Cisco, what they like to see is anything out  there, any technology that's out there that pushes more bandwidth.  They want more and more bandwidth being pushed.  People invest in that technology.  It's like they just want people to upgrade their routers.  They want big service providers to buy more and more expensive routers.  That's their business.  That's their business.  It reminds me of when HP came to us one time.  I don't know if I should say this.  I don't want to get in trouble.  Well, yeah, I'll say it.  HP came to us one time and said that they wanted to put an icon on a website that I  was working at at the time.  I won't say which one.  That said, print this article.  They were going to pay us like a million dollars.  Because they knew they'd make big bucks.  Because they know about the ink cartridges and all that stuff.  I was like, we're not taking that money.  That's just killing the environment.  But they wanted to put this like print this with HP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It triggers the actual print process.  So where it would bring up that thing to print.  They wanted you to actually go and print more articles.  And you didn't do that?  It's just a horrible thing.  One, it makes the site look crappy.  Why would you have a huge like, the ad was not like this little tiny print icon.  It had to be big.  It was like a decent size like print this.  I'm like, really?

And he gave a bunch.  Yeah, sell it, spin it off or harvest it for what it's worth.  I mean, that's better than just killing it and firing people.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I was surprised by the acquisition and I'm surprised by the way it ended.

Transcript:  Yeah, but you have like a $700 replacement for a cell phone compared to say like a $200 flip camera.  And judging by Christmas sales alone, I know so many people that bought that camera to give as a gift.  Were they losing money on this?  I don't know.  I could have seen them maybe moving into more create network cameras, create ad cameras into routers, you know, things like that.

Transcript:  I bet you they did some of the harvesting type of thing.  I mean, a lot of the technology.  What do you mean by harvesting?  Well, like you take existing processes of making some of the hardware that's in the flip into doing.  So they bought it for the IP.  Yeah, I don't know.  I mean, even the man.  They made $400 million last year.  That's a lot of flips.  Even the brand name is worth at least $5 million.

Download your newspaper.  Download your magazine.  Chicago State University in my congressional district, in freshman class,  they're not being given textbooks any longer.  They're all being given iPads as they enter school.  President Wayne Watson hopes to have a text bookless campus within four years,  where at this state university, they no longer have textbooks.  Well, what becomes of publishing companies that can publish jobs?  What becomes of bookstores and librarians and all of the jobs associated with paper?  Well, in the not-too-distant future, such jobs simply will not exist.  Steve Jobs is doing pretty well.  He's created the iPad.  Certainly, it's made life more efficient for Americans, but the iPad is produced in China.  It's not produced here in the United States.  So the Chinese get to take advantage of our First Amendment value.  That is, to provide freedom of speech through the iPad to the American people.  But there is no protection for jobs here in America to ensure that the American people are being put to work.

It gets worse because one month ago, the same guy, Jesse Jackson Jr.,  and he got a lot of heat for it, said the federal government should buy an iPad for every student in America  because it was the future of America.  Not intended to be a factual statement.  Apparently, he's very confused.  He says the problem in America is that the iPad is eliminating thousands of American jobs.  Now, he does have a point.  I mean, it is being made in China, but come on.  It's like saying, you know, oh, the buggy whipmakers are all out of work now.  What are we going to do?  That was the only point that he had was...  What about the students who can have books that cost, say, one-tenth of what the president's cost?  That's a scam in and of itself.

Transcript:  Well, I mean, there's a lot of people that are trying to stifle innovation.  I mean, there's a couple of examples.  One of them...  There's two examples.  One of them, Kevin can speak to more in a second.  One of them was like there's a company called Uber that does basically private car dispatching.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They had all the petty cabs in South by Southwest.  And part of the cease and desist was not only like the way it's legally supposed to work,  but the fact that they might be competing with the jobs that are provided to the people  that have the materials to drive the cabs.  Now, the example that Kevin's going to give here, if he doesn't know what I'm talking about...  I have no idea.  The example that Kevin's going to give is the people that do Square.  Oh, yes.  They were being sued by...

Start time: 5467.80
End time: 5489.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  VeriPhone, right?  VeriPhone.  And what they wanted to do is saying that instead of like Square, who made this great technology  where you can interface with an iPad and an iPhone,  and you can scan the credit card across the top,  they're saying that that's going to propagate fraud.  And basically what they're doing is they're trying to protect their business, number one,  and two, they're trying to take away the threat that this company provided to what their core business was.

Start time: 5489.70

Start time: 5494.26

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the sad thing is that you can buy a credit card reader for like $30 off the internet.  Any blank credit card reader.  I can put any sticker I want on the outside and walk up to someone and say,  hey, I'm going to sell these flowers to you.  Let me swipe your card.  And then I have their credit card.  Or I'm a waiter and I can take it in the back room  and take a picture of the front and the back and I have the credit card.  What's also interesting is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I mean, in another way you can put it is that if you're worried that like the...  If we're falling behind to other countries who are in the technology sector,  who are innovating on things,  if we stop the ability of a Steve Jobs to take his team at Apple on creating something like an iPhone,  on Jeff Bezos on creating the Kindle,  you're going to fall that much further behind to other companies,  I mean other countries that are allowed to do those things.  Well, the thing is, if there was an option...

Start time: 5545.62

For instance, you don't need to ever own a car.  I need to go home.  On my iPhone, I go Uber.  I say Uber, I'm going to need a car to get home.  He says, you don't drive an RV anywhere.  You drive your car and you have the option to drive a car.  I'm going to need a car to get home.  He says, you don't drive an RV anywhere.  You drive your car and you have the RV meet you there.
