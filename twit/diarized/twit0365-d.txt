Transcript:  But before we get into the meat  of the matter, I wanted to  introduce Matt Honan.  I've known Matt for quite some  time. You might remember him  from Gizmodo. And are you  working for Wired now or are  you just freelancer?

Start time: 274.60
End time: 276.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am. I'm a full time at Wired

Start time: 276.30
End time: 302.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for time at Wired.  And he I read an article that  just terrified me a blog post  that you wrote on your blog  about getting hacked.  And it's if you can read it at  emptyage.com if you if you want  to read the story.  But I thought we'd get Matt on  because I think it's a I don't  know. I think it's a kind of  morality tale for the cloud  generation.

Start time: 303.24
End time: 323.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What happened?  I think that there are several  things that are interesting  about it.  I think it can it you know it  can we were all sort of  increasingly relying on cloud  services and a lot of us myself  at least tend to link accounts  together. And both of those  things when combined can make  for some really dangerous  situations.

Start time: 324.28
End time: 344.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you had an iCloud account  right.  And you turned on a feature of  iCloud which I think is actually  a useful feature is the remote  wipe feature.  So they've had for a while with  the find my iPhone you could  remote wipe lost iPhone.  And they now have I think this  is new in mountain lion.  I don't remember it before.  The ability to remote wipe a  laptop.

Start time: 345.80
End time: 425.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's it was certainly a lion  feature because I haven't  upgraded to lion on my on my  MacBook yet.  Yeah. And so what happened if  you read it to me to get into  it what happened was Friday I  left work early and was home  just before five o'clock and  started playing with my daughter  and my phone died or it looks  like it died and I went to go  plug it in.  And when I plugged it in it  started up to the screen the  start screen like the initial  start screen that you get when  you first get a new iPhone.  This is plug into iTunes.  I thought that's weird but you  know things happen.  And I went downstairs to  connect it to my Mac because I  backed up really recently to my  desktop and restore from that  backup.  I'm sorry I should say when I  tried to log into iCloud it  said my password is wrong.  And again I just I didn't think  that much of it.  I went downstairs flipped up my  MacBook and it almost instantly  went to a gray screen and asked  for a pin to log in a four  digit pin.  And at that point I knew I had  real problems.  And what turned out that happened  was that someone hacked into my  iCloud account using basically  social engineering techniques  and they were able to remove  wipe my iPhone iPad and MacBook  and because I'm a terrible  computer user I hadn't backed up  my MacBook in a really long time.

Start time: 425.94
End time: 436.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well you did something else bad  which was you had iCloud as your  password recovery for both Gmail  and Twitter.

Start time: 437.68
End time: 510.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually just Gmail.  So that was yeah that really  exasperated thing.  So what happened next was that  the apology offense was  basically and I've been in touch  with the person who hacked into  my account.  They were ultimately trying just  to get my Twitter.  They just wanted my.  Because you had you had the  Gizmodo Twitter account.  They weren't even trying to get  to the Gizmodo Twitter account.  They just wanted Matt.  They just wanted Matt.  The Gizmodo Twitter account was  just a bonus.  They didn't even realize it was  connected until they got into  mine.  At some point you can link  Twitter accounts and so at some  point when I worked at Gizmodo I  had linked my Twitter account  with Gizmodo's Twitter account so  I could not have to log in and  log out every time from the web.  And that hadn't been undone since  I left.  Even though you had left Twitter.  I mean Gizmodo.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  So I was still linked.  They didn't actually have  password level access to the  Gizmodo Twitter account.  They just had password level  access to my Twitter account.  So what they did was they they  used a social engineering  technique to get to my iCloud  account.  They used my dot Mac email as  the backup email for Gmail.  Got into my Gmail and used Gmail.  That's the account verification  for Twitter and got into my  Twitter account.

Start time: 511.87
End time: 529.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  Now you did a few things wrong  and there's going to be pedantic  people I know in our chat room  who said well if you had only  done this, this and this.  And of course.  But this is the kind of thing  we're all doing.  And this is kind of the reason  I think it's a morality tale.  You at first thought your  password maybe had been hacked  or brute forced.

Start time: 529.68
End time: 615.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah. That was my initial  suspicion.  I mean I just thought that you  know I had a seven digit  alphanumeric password.  And that's pretty weak.  I've had it for years.  And like I just haven't changed  it.  I don't use it anywhere else.  But that's not a good password.  I mean most of my passwords.  I use one password and most of  my passwords now the new  password generator you know 15  characters 16 characters.  And so I thought OK well  someone you know use some sort  of technique to crack my  password.  speculating that you know  someone had set up some sort of  intercept to you know a key  stroke logger or something.  But as it turned out both the  hacker told me and Apple  subsequently verified Apple  tech support verified with me  someone called Apple tech  support at 430 on Friday  or out 430 on Friday claimed  to be me knew some details  knew enough details and was  able to have a temporary  password issued.  When the temporary password is  issued they are able to log in  to iCloud and completely change  the password.  That was kind of step one.  Step two was wiping all my  stuff so that I couldn't go in  and stop them.  Step three was going into my  Gmail and my Twitter.  Step four was they deleted my  Google account and then they  just went crazy on my Twitter  account for several hours  Friday.

Transcript:  You say the hacker contacted you.  How do you know it's him or her?

Start time: 621.31
End time: 638.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I should say I'm not positive  that it's him or her but they've  given me details that allow them  that they give me enough details  including some account details  that I know that if it wasn't  the person who actually did it  that the person was certainly  involved in it.  They know stuff that something  that someone else wouldn't be  able to tell me.

Start time: 639.11
End time: 644.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they were targeting your  Twitter account.  That was what this whole thing  was about was so they could put  stuff on your Twitter account.

Start time: 645.47
End time: 670.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The guy said we just want your  Twitter account.  We just did it.  If not, he said we didn't have  anything personal against you.  You've got that account back.  I do have that account.  I've got now all my accounts  back and Apple has my book.  The big priority for me is  recovering my data.  I've got a young child and I just  hate thinking of all the pictures  that I would use if I lost all  my data.

Transcript:  Links to some YouTube videos  links to some other exports  they'd done, some racist  homophobic statements.  Just, you know, just...  So you were just someone with a

Start time: 698.98
End time: 705.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  bunch of followers and they  wanted a platform to yell and  scream like idiots?  I think basically, yeah, and

Start time: 706.93
End time: 709.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they liked that it was a three  letter Twitter account.  It's my account.

Start time: 710.30
End time: 720.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's at M-A-T, which means you  joined Twitter very, very, very,  very early.  And made yourself a target.  I've got a question here.

Start time: 720.26
End time: 745.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, Ed.  Matt, do you feel in some sense,  I know this might be a slightly  insensitive question to ask, but  do you feel lucky in a way that  these guys weren't evil and  malicious and skillful enough to  hide their tracks for days or  weeks while they mined your  information and maybe tried to  social engineer some of your  contacts?  Certainly, absolutely, 100%.

Start time: 746.52
End time: 779.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, the first thing I did was  call, before I even realized that  my Gmail had gotten hacked, the  first thing I did was call Apple  and I was on the phone with their  tech support for a very long time  and I kept telling them I got to  get off the phone and call my  bank because I was really worried  that they were immediately going  to go into my online bank.  Once you get into somebody's  email, you can get everything and  I was worried they were going to  go into my online banking, go  into any number of other  accounts and just clean me out.  That was my big concern at the

Start time: 779.20
End time: 786.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  time.  But you also have, I mean, you  have, I'm sure, a very impressive  address book.  Patrick just changed his Twitter

Start time: 788.20
End time: 802.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  password for the second time in  24 hours.  I think you're not alone.  I think there's people listening  right now who are all furiously,  first thing I did when I heard  this is I put turn on two factor  authentication on my Google  account.  But go ahead, I'm sorry, I didn't

Start time: 802.20
End time: 841.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  mean to interrupt you, Ed.  That's okay.  I have a pretty impressive  address book with, you know,  contacts that if somebody wanted  to social engineer, you know,  people you know, people at Apple,  people at Google, people who are  your sources, they could do a  fair amount of damage and they  could actually use exploits and  install key loggers on those  people's machines.  So in a sense, I mean, as a wake  up call goes, this is a very  painful and ugly one.  But the damage is hopefully  contained in a way that it  wouldn't have been if somebody  had been truly malicious and  evil.

Start time: 843.39
End time: 869.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it was certainly a wake  up call to me.  To be honest with you, I hadn't  considered, you know, using  social exploits to get to other  people from my account.  It was, it could, I mean, I hate  to say it, but I just keep  thinking I'm kind of lucky  because it really could have been  a lot worse.  I'm really distraught about my  data possibly being lost, but in  the grand scheme of things, it  was not, I mean, it could have  been so, so, so much worse.  I'm just puzzled that Apple, I

Start time: 870.28
End time: 872.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  don't understand how Apple could  have been tricked.

Start time: 874.25
End time: 895.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They, there's, I'm not quite  ready to, I'm probably going to  reveal this in the Wired story  tomorrow.  I've got an email into Apple  about this and I want to give  them both a chance to respond  and to fix this, but there's  some information that you can  know about someone's account  that lets you know what's going  on, that lets you bypass having  to answer the security questions.  So there's a flaw in their

Start time: 895.92
End time: 896.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  system?

Start time: 897.81
End time: 902.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I think so, yeah, I think  so.  I mean, it's not information that's  easy to get.  I mean, I don't think I could

Start time: 903.32
End time: 909.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  have gotten it.  I got the impression from the  message the hacker sent you that  he knew of this flaw, that he was  exploiting a known flaw.

Start time: 910.17
End time: 927.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the impression that  I have as well.  I mean, I have the impression  that this was, there were, my  understanding is that there were  multiple people involved in this  and they had multiple areas of  expertise.  The guy who I've been in touch  with, and I've only been in touch  with one person, this apparently  was his area of expertise.

Start time: 928.20
End time: 933.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Matt, did you get a sense that  beyond just being a person with a  three-letter Twitter account that  they knew who you were?

Start time: 935.22
End time: 938.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got actually the sense that they  did not know who I was.  So you were, it was just, it could

Start time: 939.78
End time: 945.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  be Ray or Joe on Twitter.  It was just three letters.  That's why they targeted you.  That's my impression.

Start time: 946.22
End time: 953.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, that's what I've, that's  what they have said to me.  I mean, you know, I don't know.  How do you know?

Start time: 954.97
End time: 959.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you, and what are you doing  now to protect, obviously you've  got backup from now on.

Start time: 959.80
End time: 962.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I disabled find my iPhone  and find my iPad.

Start time: 965.93
End time: 981.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm looking at my iCloud.  You can erase my desktop  computer.  You can erase my computer at home.  You can remote wipe any of these  computers that are on currently.  Just press that remote wipe  button.  If you got in my iCloud, you  could wipe.  Don't click that pad.  Leo, something that happens when

Start time: 982.68
End time: 1033.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you do that is that it initiates  a four digit pin, okay?  And only the person who presses  that button gets to see that  four digit pin.  So if I'm on the other end, if  you're on the other end and  someone does that, you don't  really have any way to stop it.  And this is one of the things  that I think really ought to be  fixed about that situation is  that, you know, if there's going  to be a pin code ought to be  something that you set up or  there ought to be a second  password, there ought to be  something that lets the person  basically stop this in their  tracks or that at least,  you know, has some sort of,  you know, secondary level of  authentication before you can  pull a trigger and remotely  wipe a hard drive.  I mean, it's wiping a Mac.  You know, I kind of gradually  got into this.  First I had to find my iPhone  set up and then I was like,  oh, well, I can do the same for  my Mac.  And that's actually quite  different than wiping an  iPhone.  Oh, yeah.  I feel like that ought to have  better security.  That would be harder to do.  Matt, I'm sorry this happened

Start time: 1034.08
End time: 1054.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to you, but in a way I'm really  glad that it happened to you  and I'm glad that you're  happy that it happened to you  and that the world now knows  because of who you are.  And I think this is, it's a  wake-up call.  I think Ed, you said it right.  It's a wake-up call for  everybody.  And I hope that watching this  everybody is now going to  secure their systems as best  you can.

Start time: 1054.96
End time: 1063.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I mean, would you turn  off the iCloud?  Would you turn off the, I mean,  obviously you've turned off  the find my iPhone or wipe my  computer.  Would you suggest everyone do  that at this point?

Start time: 1067.69
End time: 1085.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you're backing everything up,  I mean, see, this is somewhere  where I really screwed up,  right?  I mean, so I wasn't backing up  my Mac.  And I back up my desktop Mac  every day.  But I had not backed up my  Macbook in a long, long time.  That's interesting.  So you were backing up.

Start time: 1085.84
End time: 1091.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just that one you didn't  back.  And I think a lot of us who have  multiple computers kind of assume  well, everything's propagating.  I'm fine.

Start time: 1091.92
End time: 1127.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that was sort of what I  mean, you know, I just got  lazy.  And I, you know, so would I  recommend that everybody turn  off find my iPhone?  No, but find my Mac?  I mean, I actually probably  would turn that off.  You know where your Mac is.  I know, you know where it is.  Yeah.  You know, it's like somebody  asked me, like, what's the  greater risk?  Is it actually having your, you  know, your Mac physically taken  from your possession or having  someone be able to get into it  electronically?  And I think it's probably the  greater risk, the more likely  risk for a lot of people with a  Mac.  It's not a phone.  It's, you know, is having it  broken into electronically.

Start time: 1127.70
End time: 1130.03

Start time: 1130.60
End time: 1151.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I understand maybe you thought  it got stolen, blah, blah,  blah, but that's not that like.  I also think that we learned a  lesson about where to send  password recovery emails and to  have kind of a rotating set of  emails and not have them all  sent to one place.

And I gather they sort of  backtracked, like they started  with Twitter and found, okay,  well, my Twitter is linked to my  Gmail, and then when they  realized that my Gmail was  linked to .Mac as the backup  there, as the verification  there, it was sort of like a  jackpot moment for them.  And, you know, having that all  linked together was also a bad  idea, and it's also something  I've changed.  I've set up two-factor  authentication on my desktop  and Gmail.

You just add that second factor,  but then apps that don't know  about two-factor authentication,  you have to get a special  password generated from Google  and enter both passwords.  Well, look, it's a tradeoff.

Think about that.  Apple's got more money than just  about any corporation in North  America, and they allowed  somebody to social engineer  their way into locking you out  of your digital life.  That's bad.  Whether that was a failure  between the keyboard and the  chair by whoever was answering  the phone or whether that was a  massive flaw in the way they  institute the system, which I  think we'll probably find more  out in your Wired article,  tomorrow.  I can't wait, yeah.  That scares the Delete  Expletive out of me.  That sucks, dude, and I'm sorry  you went through this.  I, for a long time, I used to

I mean, just using passwords are  a terrible system.  I know there are a lot of smart  people working on other options.  We don't have them yet.  And, you know, I mean, the  ultimate failure point here was  this temporary password that was  issued.  And I just, I mean, this is  reinforced every bad feeling I  have about our password-based  authentication systems.  What would you suggest?

I know that the president has  actually set up a special  office where they're looking at  sort of working on next  generation password things, but  you know, one of the big  problems with the web is that  Microsoft is working on one  thing and Google is working on  another and Apple is working on  another and Facebook is working  on another and everybody sort of  has a vested interest in being  identity providers, and that  means that, you know, you don't  get some sort of top-down  standard.  It gets really important, too,  as we start doing virtual money

And if you don't have good  authentication systems, then  you're going to have to have  a lot of problems with the  digital world.  And if you don't have good  authentication systems, and we  are moving full speed ahead  towards digital financial  transfers.

Don't say that.  But no, seriously,  there's been plenty of exploits  with many other  remote access products  but never with GoToMyPC  and that's because  these guys do it right.  It uses NAT traversal,  uses SSL.  It's a firewall  that eliminates a whole category  of security issues.  If you've not used GoToMyPC,  this is a great time to try it.  Hey, it's vacation time.  Kids are out of school.  The weather's great.  You want to go to the pool.  You don't want to be at work.  Leave.  But before you do,  get on your Mac or your PC,  install GoToMyPC.  You can do it free for 30 days.  And then take your iPad  or even your iPhone with you  and you can access  that office computer  and do anything you could do  if you were at work.  You could send or receive email,  run any program,  access any network resource.  It's all there.  And on these Retina displays,  I have to say,  and sometimes your iPad  has more resolution  than your computer at work.  You could do it all.  It's fast.  It's easy.  It's secure.  And it's free for 30 days.  Visit GoToMyPC.com.  That orange Try It Free button,  that's the one you want to hit  right there.  And then you're going to need  a promo code.  If you click that,  see that promo code there?  It's Twit.  It's easy.  Four letters.  T-W-I-T.  That's all you need.  30 days free.  Go to MyPC.  The folks at Citrix  are more than anybody else.

Transcript:  It's a big business.  That's not absolutely true.  It's very profitable.  It's not as profitable as it was.  It's not as growing as it was,  but it's good God doing better  than most startups  that are selling for a billion dollars.  It's doing well.

End time: 2039.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why it's interesting,  because there's value,  but you've got to figure out  some way to capitalize on it.  What a lot of people have said  is that she needs to make a decision  between being a content company  or a web services company.  I think the second

Start time: 2039.84
End time: 2041.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  is what she'll do.  I think there's no question.

Start time: 2041.88

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  She's going to double down

Start time: 2043.80
End time: 2090.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  on advertising tech, I think,  which is completely opposite direction  for what Ross Levinson was going to do,  the proposal he made to the board.  She's going to expand  and compete with Google.  They were very close to a deal with Google  to sort of offload Ad Tech to them,  or they were talking to Microsoft.  And so I think what's interesting  is that I don't think she's going to do that.  I think she's going to try  to build it up herself  and see if she can compete in other ways  and differentiating ways, presumably,  because going straight at Google  is kind of a loser proposition  for anybody at this moment.  But she knows Google inside and out,  so she certainly was not as involved  in that part of the business,  the ad business,  that's Susan Wojcicki and others,  but she certainly has a familiarity  with the company.  And when Microsoft and Yahoo

Start time: 2091.86
End time: 2107.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  made the deal,  Microsoft Bing became Yahoo's search engine,  but Yahoo, as I remember it,  correct me if I'm wrong,  continued to run the ad business, right, Ed?  Isn't that how it worked?  I believe that's right, yes.  So they are well positioned to be an ad company.  Well, they are one.

Start time: 2107.95
End time: 2124.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They are an ad company.  It's ad tech.  And Google essentially is the best,  has the most powerful ad serving technology around now.  And so the question,  Yahoo used to, but doesn't anymore,  so it's a lot of investment  she's going to have to make to make it so a lot.

Start time: 2125.91
End time: 2139.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So like Google, they may offer some services  like Flickr or Yahoo Finance,  but really their backbone of the company  is the ads they serve on their sites  and other sites?  Others.  Yes, yes, part of it,

Start time: 2139.64
End time: 2161.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but a lot of it is premium ad sales  on their major content sites  like Yahoo Finance, the HomePay.  They have three businesses  and it's just the way it is.  They've got Search,  which has been a big moneymaker for them,  and now they've got guaranteed income  from Microsoft through that deal,  even though it's not performing well,  they have a guaranteed deal.  The second thing is the HomePage,  which makes,  that's where they make most of their money.  People go to Yahoo.com?

Start time: 2162.34
End time: 2164.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They make a lot of money on that HomePage.

Start time: 2164.32
End time: 2205.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, there's 700 million people  go through there a month.  That's a lot of people.  And then thirdly, through mail.  They make quite a bit of money  through their mail,  but it's declining.  Both the Search and the mail are declining  and so is HomePage.  And so that's really the problem is,  can they make new services  that are so common?  That's the problem.  And so, I think,  there's a lot of companies  that are so compelling  that advertisers want to be on them.  And that's hard.  What is she going to,  I mean, there's not a magical unicorn  in a lot of the innovations going on at startups.  And so, can she bring that into Yahoo?  She's certainly an exciting choice  to a lot of people  and certainly at Yahoo, she is.  I mean, she gave away free food,  which was like,  that story went crazy,  except I tried to point out,  by the way, every web company

Start time: 2205.24
End time: 2206.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  gives away free food.  Yahoo was the whole...

Start time: 2207.20
End time: 2226.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We give away free food for crying out loud.  And I kept pointing out to them,  like, you know,  everyone else gets it already.  You're getting things.  But, you know,  they didn't have it.  And, you know, this week,  I'll be writing about  what she's done this week.  But she's doing things  that other web companies  had been doing  and they hadn't...  Yahoo's like caught in a time warp  or something  that didn't get these things.  And so, we'll see how...

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Kara, can I ask you this?  Kara.  You said that she was looking  to leave.  Do you get the sense  from talking to principal people  in this move  that there is any bad blood  or that sticking it to Google  is part of the challenge  for Marissa?

Start time: 2253.75
End time: 2276.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I don't think it was bad blood.  I just think, you know,  it's just people...  There's ten people that start together,  eight get promoted,  and two don't.  Whatever, it happens all the time.  It's nothing...  That's nothing.  I don't think there was bad blood.  I think she, you know,  she had some challenges.  You could say that  about any executive at Google.  You know what I mean?  Like, every one of them  has their pluses and minuses.  So I think it's not like  I'm going to get them.  I don't think that's  not her personality.

Start time: 2277.14
End time: 2279.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_11

Transcript:  There's no getting Google.  I mean...  I don't know.  There is...

Start time: 2284.08
End time: 2322.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does raise the question, though.  I mean, there's two ways  it seems that she could go.  She could...  You know, Yahoo's already in partnership  with Facebook and Microsoft.  Yeah.  And she could kind of create a...  I always say access,  but it could be the allies.  But she could create  the allies against Google.  Yes.  Microsoft, Yahoo, Apple,  Facebook versus Google.  Or she could partner with Google.  I mean, the same kinds  of partnerships she's doing  right now with Microsoft,  she could instead do with Google.  She has inside knowledge.  She knows people at Google.  Do you think she'll choose  one of those two paths,  or is she...  I don't know.

Start time: 2322.96
End time: 2343.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, the search one is interesting  because, you know,  they have this deal with Microsoft  and, you know, there's...  Microsoft has failed  at a number of performance metrics  from what I understand.  And so they certainly could  move it over to Google.  In that case,  there's some regulatory issues,  which I think Google's aware of  and they're aware about Google  owning pretty much all of Search  around the world.  So that's problematic.  Google needs Microsoft  like Microsoft needed Apple

Start time: 2343.96
End time: 2346.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for many years.  Right.  I think Yahoo going with Google

Start time: 2346.96
End time: 2401.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  would be a tough row.  I think everyone will get  their backs up in Search,  especially in ad serving.  There are a number of different  ads that are available  and there are a number of different  ad serving things.  Nonetheless, Google does  dominate that area again,  but they don't dominate it  like they do Search, I think.  So it's a question.  She has a lot of choices  and certainly people want Yahoo  to succeed.  I think that's one of the parts  that is...  It's just a question  of whether they can make  great products that people  want to use  and they really haven't done...  That's really at the heart  of what the problem is,  is they have not made...  They've missed pretty much  every single trend.  Like a Pinterest would be  a very Yahoo-like thing  to have done.  So was Instagram.  They had Flickr.  So it just goes on  and on and on  about things they didn't take.  So the question is,  will she be able to inspire,  bring in engineers  and that can create things  or are those people  very happy at startups?  That's the difficult part for her.

Start time: 2401.72
End time: 2410.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you think of that idea,  Ed?  You cover Microsoft.  Would it be an interesting thing  for Yahoo to team with Microsoft,  Facebook and Apple  as an anti-Google allies?

Start time: 2411.72
End time: 2420.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think Microsoft  is feeling pretty...  Glum about that prospect.  Now, I think they feel like  they dodged a bullet.  Didn't they try to buy...  What was it?

Start time: 2420.76

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  $31 billion?

Start time: 2421.92
End time: 2443.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  $31 billion they would have paid  for Yahoo  and that would have made  the aquantive right down  look like just a chain.  That was a mere $6.2 billion.  Right.  So I think any kind of tie-up  with Yahoo beyond  what they've got right now  would be a really,  really difficult sell.  I agree.

Start time: 2443.68
End time: 2460.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think they haven't been able  to make the search partnership work.  Right.  And there's all kinds  of reasons for that.  They've been spending what,  I think, at $750 million losses  in that online services division  every quarter.  That's $750 million.  That's a lot.

Start time: 2460.60
End time: 2504.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, you can argue, though,  that Microsoft has a need  to take that money  and treat it as an investment,  not as a defensive play.  They can't afford  to live in a world  where they don't control search  on their devices  and where they're at the mercy  of Google or someone else.  Right.  The new devices, phones  and tablets and stuff,  have to have robust search  built into them.  And if you have a new device  platform coming out  and you have to depend  on Google for it,  you're in a very,  very weak position.  So in that sense,  the money that they spend in Bing  is sort of reinforcing  a core aspect of the winter  mobile platforms for them.  Yes, absolutely.

Start time: 2504.36
End time: 2519.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think they can't not be in it.  It's just a very pricey  investment for them.  And I think losing Yahoo  would be something.  I don't think they want  that to happen,  although they still  haven't fixed the problem  with the performance.  And then those guarantees  do run out at some point.  So Yahoo's got to think about  what it wants to do.  It's very interesting.

Start time: 2521.50
End time: 2531.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you're right, Kara.  I think we're all rooting  for Yahoo.  Because they were  an Internet pioneer,  we all have fond memories  of them.  But also, it's good to have  some competition for Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Let me just ask you  and Ed one more thing.  Sure.  From a consumer end,  I mean, I know from me,  following these kind of things,  it very much seemed  that with Marissa coming in  that Yahoo was overnight  looked at differently  than what it was before.  That it was a possibility  that it could be again  a company that was on the rise  from its current trajectory.  From you guys talking  to your sources,  is that the same  inside the tech community,  people that are making decisions  that also just are informed  in running businesses?  Is that the same idea  that it is from me  on the consumer level?  Well, they love

Start time: 2589.20
End time: 2616.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  everybody loves one of these stories.  You know, this sort of young,  exciting computer scientist  who happens to be a woman too  and a very interesting person comes in.  And so they like these stories.  I think it's a bigger job than that,  but it's certainly  an exciting story.  And so it adds a little bit  of excitement to the situation.  I think that within Yahoo,  they're thrilled.  The techies are at least.  They're thrilled with her.  They think it's fantastic  that someone is...  You like somebody

Start time: 2620.14
End time: 2689.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's interesting is that  if you think about it,  she is the first executive  who is an Internet executive  running this company  who's an actual native born  Internet executive.  Because Tim Coogle,  there really wasn't an Internet...  There really wasn't...  He was the first  and so he had come  from other places.  Terry Semel was a Hollywood executive.  Jerry was certainly  an Internet executive.  But again, not like her.  You know what I mean?  She's a native.  This is her first job was at Google,  which is really interesting  if you think about it.  Scott Thompson was from  a different payment background.  So she's really the first  100% Internet savvy  executive running this company.  So that's an interesting...  I think about that a lot.  So we'll see.  I don't think one person  can change things  unless you're Steve Jobs.  And you know what?  She's not Steve Jobs.  Nobody's Steve Jobs.  So that's the problem.  And so I think they're looking  for that story to happen again.  And I don't know if that's going to...  I think if she's judged on that basis,  she'll disappoint.  If she's judged on getting back  some level of innovation  and promise there,  she'll do well.  We'll see.  It's a tough job.  Believe me.  She doesn't succeed.  I won't be surprised  because it's so hard.  But if she does,  it'll be a real coup.

It's got a bad reputation  among as an employer  in Silicon Valley.  Engineers stare at it  and quake with fear,  but it's still racking up  $5 billion a year in revenue.  Oh, that.

Transcript:  But that's what's unusual  about Yahoo.  Right now,  you've got three major  platform companies.  You've got Apple, Google,  and Microsoft,  all of whom are sort of  building walls and fences  and toll gates around  their platforms.  And then you've got  a gazillion startups,  all of whom either want to find  a little tiny niche  within one or more of those platforms  or where their exit strategy  is getting purchased  by one of those.  And to have a company  the size of Yahoo  that is neither a small startup  with an exit strategy  or owns its own platform  is like, how are they...  What's their route out of this?  How do they grow?  How do they become something?  That's where I don't see  much prospect of success  for Yahoo.

Start time: 2764.96
End time: 2789.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, she's talked platform a lot  internally this past couple of weeks.  I'll tell you that.  She's certainly said  the word platform a lot.  So, you know, I think she feels...  That's services, right?  That's web services.  Yeah.  I'm not sure what she's talking about.  But I mean, I think the idea is...  I don't know.  You know, I think that she's  thinking much more heavily  that Yahoo's got...  has some differentiating qualities  above those other ones  that Ed was talking about.  So we'll see.

Transcript:  One of the things that Microsoft did  with Outlook.com this week  was to try and take  a tarnished brand, Hotmail,  which may have a ton of users,  but it has very little credibility  among the people on this panel,  among the people who are watching  this show.  Nobody says,  I'm going to go out and get  a new Hotmail account  and use it to run my business  with Gmail.  And I think Yahoo has kind of  the same problem,  whether it's Yahoo.com Mail  or Ymail or whatever you call it.  You've really got a brand there  that doesn't have a lot of credibility  in either business  or among the tech elite.  So they may have to do something  like what Microsoft is trying to do  with Hotmail,  which is to completely rebrand it  and completely change the service  on the back end.  But that is really, really hard to do.

She's been given a big,  long amount of time by this board  to do these things  and spending some money.  So I think she's not going to be  thinking about Wall Street  going forward.

Start time: 2966.83
End time: 2999.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and they've surfaced it  in Outlook.com and made it  more obvious.  In fact, I was going through  my old Hotmail account,  which is now Outlook.com,  and cleaning it up today  and I was able to get rid of  several hundred CRUD messages  just sitting there in the inbox  and simultaneously set up rules  to make sure that the CRUD  doesn't come back.

Transcript:  that right-hand panel contains,  it contains chat  or it contains  social networking information  about the contact that you have.  It only contains ads  if you're looking at  a piece of mail from a contact  who's not in your address book,  not in one of your  social networks...  Oh, that's interesting.  ...or such.  So if it's,  you know, Leo,  if you sent me a message  to my Outlook.com address,  as soon as I open that,  the thing on the side  would show me  our social connections  and then I could also  click the chat button  up at the top  and make a chat  directly there  without having to  leave the mail environment.  Yeah, that is useful.  So there is some smarts  in that right panel,  but you've just identified  the problem,  which is there is some  very, very intelligent design  and very cool new features  in there,  but somebody like you,  you're not going to notice it  because you're not going to use it  because you already have...  You're in the Gmail world.  Right.  You have a tremendous  investment there,  and I think the only people  that Microsoft can put  away from Gmail  are those who have it  as kind of a secondary address  that they use for the things  where they don't want  to use their real address.  You know, what's really sad  is a lot of these features.

Transcript:  Years ago,  I saw Brad Garlinghouse,  who used to be  Head of Communications  at Yahoo for many years,  showed me a lot of this  kind of thing years ago,  and it just never got  productized at Yahoo.  You know,  you'd see a lot of things,  like a lot of stuff  that's showing up today  Yahoo had many years ago,  but it never made its way  into the product,  and that was the problem.  I do think, though,  if they create a better product,  people will go to it.  I don't agree with you.  I've switched a million times  emails, and I think  it's a quantumly better...  The question is,  it's got to be quantumly better,  but I think people will switch  if it's a better product,  it seems to me.  Yeah, I agree.  If there's some...

So we'll talk about that  in just a little bit.  Great panel.  Boy, this is just...

And I'll never forget  John Hendricks, the founder  of Discovery many years ago.  It started to explode  a little bit, but it was still  tiny and it got lucky  because it got on Liberty Media's  stations and stuff.  And I said,  what's the secret of your success?  It's the best quote I've ever had  in a story ever in my whole life.  But I said to Hendricks,  who's a quirky guy,  the guy who founded Discovery,  I said, what's the big secret  to your success?  Kind of like softball.  And he said,  Kara, sharks and Nazis.  Nazis and sharks.  And it still is!

Transcript:  That wasn't so good.  No.  We're brought to you today  and of course,  Kara Schwisher is here  from all things deep.  What a great panel.  So, so much fun.  So much insight.  I'm just dripping with insight.  I should have worn my insight deodorant.  Brought to you today  by freshbooks.com.  FreshBooks is the ultimate solution  for small business owners  who don't...  Who does?  Who don't like doing invoicing.  FreshBooks does it  and makes it easy.  In fact, I was a FreshBooks user  for a long time.  Amber MacArthur  introduced it to me in 2004.  And now, I think it's  three and a half million users later.  FreshBooks is just the way  to send and pay invoices.  Focus on your work,  not your paperwork,  with freshbooks.com.  They get...  I mean, it's wonderful.  I'll give you a little tour here  if you go to the freshbooks.com website.  The invoice creation is very simple.  They email invoices.  They will print out an invoice,  stamp it, mail it as well  for an additional fee.  But what I love is  they integrate payments  into that email.  And believe it or not,  your clients do want to pay you.  It's just as much of a pain  in the butt for them  as making the invoice  was in the first place.  So if you make it easy for them,  they pay you faster.  And they literally...  You will speed up  the time it takes to get paid.  If they don't pay you,  they've got hassle-free  invoice follow-up.  90, 30, 90, 60 days,  you set that up.  Make sure that the client's reminded  you owe me some money.  It's very professional looking.  If you do time and expenses,  it's really easy.  They have an app for the iPhone  or there's a web app  so you can just start and stop,  start and stop.  If you're an attorney  or you do billable hours,  and then it automatically  goes right into the invoice.  They do multiple currencies.  This was great for me  because I was working in Canada  and the US  and so I could bill  in the appropriate currency.  In fact, this is the kind of  the stealth feature.  We don't mention it all.  You can set up recurring invoices  because your invoice is always  the same over and over again.  But you can also,  if your client goes for it,  set up recurring payments.  So once you get that set up,  it's just kind of like  friction-free e-commerce.  It's so awesome.  I want you to try it right now.  30 days free,  you get all the features  of FreshBooks, everything.  The multiple clients,  multiple users,  as many invoices as you want  for 30 days absolutely free.  All you have to do is  go to freshbooks.com.  If you're in business for yourself,  if you're a small business,  you want to get paid,  this is the easy way to do it.  You got to send those invoices.  Oh, by the way,  your accountant will love you at tax time  because it's all collated  and makes it very easy.  Freshbooks.com.  I don't think they ask,  but if they do,  just say you heard it on Twitter.  I don't think they ask,  but if they do,  freshbooks.com.

Transcript:  So I think this has been fascinating.  You know, I'm not normally  into these patent lawsuits.  They just seem interminable.  They go on and on and on.  But occasionally we'll get a judge  like in the Oracle Google lawsuit  who's just a character.  Or you'll get some very interesting revelations,  and that's what we're getting this week  in the Samsung Apple lawsuit.

Start time: 3538.97
End time: 3548.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Nothing says party like a company  that is unbelievably secret  and vindictive towards reporters  having to give all the information  in public.  Well, and Apple did go to the judges

Start time: 3548.50
End time: 3594.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and say, look,  we do not want to give out sales numbers.  You know, they give out kind of  overall sales numbers.  Overall sales numbers  at their quarterly analyst reports.  But they said, we don't...  We're not going to...  And the judge, I think, agreed to that.  The judge was mad,  a little bit mad at the Samsung lawyers  because she told Samsung,  you cannot introduce into evidence  your ideas that the iPhone  was copied from Sony.  We're not going to let you introduce...  So the lawyers apparently, I guess,  just went to the press and said,  well, just in case.  And Judge Koh literally polled  each juror individually.  Did you see these stories in the press?  This is one of them from The Verge.  Is that about the Joni phone?  The Joni phone, yeah.  You call it the Joni?

Start time: 3620.26
End time: 3624.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think sometimes some stories  are more important,  and they don't get enough attention.  Well, that I agree with.  This one did.  This one did.  This one was interesting,  and she did a great job  putting a slideshow together,  which is people want to see.

Start time: 3649.51
End time: 3654.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  You know, I have to say,  I was watching an Olympic slideshow.  I was kind of curious.  I just want to see some pictures,  because I had missed  most of the beach volleyball.  Oh, okay.  So I found somewhere  a slideshow of beach volleyball.  Very nice images,  but every fourth or fifth image,  they would put an ad up  for a testosterone supplement.  And I just thought,  you know, this is annoying.  Wow.

Start time: 3689.43
End time: 3691.82

Start time: 3692.00
End time: 3694.88

Start time: 3695.35
End time: 3698.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 3699.00
End time: 3724.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it worked out fine.  Because, you know,  you're watching and you know  that they're billing the advertiser  for each time that ad flashes up,  even though I'm pressing quit  as quick as I can to go to the next picture  of Missy May Trainer.  Anyway, so yeah,  I don't like slideshows.  I think it's kind of a cheap thing  that a lot of blogs do.  Yeah.  To build page views.  But this was quite interesting.  So what else did we learn?  Do you pay attention to this, Ed Bott?

Start time: 3725.06
End time: 3779.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean...  I do.  In fact, one of the things  that I thought was really interesting,  one of the revelations that came out  from that trial was that  Steve Jobs had been publicly saying  a seven inch tablet is stupid,  stupid, stupid.  You can't do anything on it.  And very publicly saying this.  And then there was an email  that was introduced into evidence  from Eddie Kew at Apple  linking to an article from GigaOM  by Kevin Toffle, who had said,  you know, I think I've been playing  with the Samsung seven inch tablet  and it's really awesome.  And Eddie Kew said,  I agree with this.  It's really good for reading,  for Facebook, for mail,  not so good for web browsing,  but there's a strong case  to be made for this.  And I talked to Steve,  this was from February of 2011,  and he said,  I talked to Steve about this  around Thanksgiving  and he agreed with that.  So here you have...  Both!

Start time: 3780.35

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're kidding.  I mean, he did it a D every year.  I mean, he'd say,  I'm never going to get into phones  and then they'd be introducing  the iPhone the next year.  And one year finally,  I said, what are you not doing  this year?  But he did that all the time.  That was like classic.

Start time: 3794.41
End time: 3807.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that was kind of a big one  because he called,  he appeared on an analyst call,  which he rarely did in 2010  and kind of went off the seven inches  and terrible idea.  It's half the screen real estate  of the iPad.  It's a terrible idea.

Start time: 3807.88
End time: 3809.72

Start time: 3809.96
End time: 3819.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe...  Their seven inches were terrible,  not his.  Not his.  And by the way,  it was 7.467 or whatever.  You know what I mean?  I think it's a slightly different...  It's almost 8.

Start time: 3819.76
End time: 3839.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's 7.85, I think.  Yeah, right.  Well, the rumors,  no one knows.  It's bigger.  But this does,  you're right, Edbot,  this does kind of make one think  that this is probably going to be  announced in September  as some had speculated.  I think absolutely.  I don't know what Eddie Q  sounds like.  I don't remember.  But it seems like  you should talk like this.

Start time: 3840.14
End time: 3849.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 3849.86
End time: 3854.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  Well, for those of us  who cover Microsoft  for a living,  we hit that problem  this week  with the whole Metro.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.

Start time: 4128.21
End time: 4130.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So tell us what happened, Ed.  That was bizarre.

Start time: 4132.49
End time: 4246.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, bizarre and  I want to choose my words  carefully on this one.  Don't.  Drop bombs, Ed.  My understanding is  that Metro AG,  a German company  that I guess runs  Ah.  Grocery stores  and also stores  that sell technology.  So they're kind of like  maybe a Costco or a Walmart thing  where they have  both food and stuff.  And they lodged a copyright complaint  against Microsoft.  Now, the interesting thing is  that Metro apps  does not appear anywhere in  Windows 8.  Microsoft says it's a code name.  Yeah, right.  They, in 2009,  it was a code name.  In 2010, 11 and 12,  it was a product name  and in fact,  it's in developer agreements.  Today, if you sign  a developer agreement  to build an app  for Windows 8 today,  the agreement says  and your Metro style apps  will have the following features  and they will be priced  such and such.  And so Metro style app  has been the official name  of the part of Windows 8  that describes these new featured apps  that use the WinRT API.  And so now, all of a sudden,  boom, with no notice,  Microsoft began telling developers  and partners  and its own employees  do not use the word Metro at all.  Period.  Stop using it.  And so last week when  Mary Jo Foley  and I think Tom Warren  and a couple other people  found out about this,  wrote stories about it,  Microsoft responded to it  with this boilerplate  that says this is a code name  and we often use code names  when we're in development  and as we go forward,  we're going to use  the commercial names,  which is just complete crap.  No, they have ads.

Start time: 4246.80

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  with a replacement name for it,  but they've spent since  at least the Build Conference  when Microsoft unveiled  Windows 8 September 2011,  they have been heavily invested  in the messaging around  Metro-style apps  and for them to throw away  that investment in messaging is...  It's just the...  I don't know.  If that's why

Start time: 4303.60
End time: 4346.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I looked up the Metro trademark  on the U.S. Patent  and Trademark website.  There are literally thousands  and the way trademarks work,  it's my understanding,  I'm not a lawyer,  I'm just a police officer,  but the way I understand  these things,  you have a trademark  in a specific...  You can have conflicting trademarks  if you're in different categories.  For instance,  when I went to Twitter  and I said,  hey dude, I'm working here,  this is called Twitter,  and they said,  well no, but you have a trademark  in online entertainment  and video  and we have a trademark  in microblogging  and so that's two separate trademarks.  My lawyer agreed  and so Evan and I said,  well if you don't do television,  I won't do a microblogging.  Of course, I've done microblogging  and now they're going to do TV.  They're partnered with  NBC Universal.

But it does seem as if  they had thought they could use Metro.  Why they didn't fight this?  This isn't, it's,  what did you say?  It's a cafe, Ed?  The only thing that I know,

Is that right?  The only thing that I can think of  is, you know,  Microsoft has been involved  in patent litigation  around the Xbox  and in Germany.  And they've also been involved  in a lot of antitrust stuff  in the EU.  And I can just imagine  Steve Ballmer throwing a chair  and saying,  I do not want to pay  another goddamn dollar  to another goddamn German lawyer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that actually is relevant  because you don't want to be,  Germany is notoriously kind of  anti-corporation.  Exactly.  So you could lose in court in Germany  just because you're Microsoft.

Start time: 4493.96
End time: 4553.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Microsoft has lost  a number of very high profile,  very high priced legal cases  in the EU.  And so they might have said,  you know,  but I don't know.  They're not talking about it  and the public statement  that they made  was so transparently untrue.  Right.  I think they could actually  have won some sympathy  if they had told  at least a retracted version  of the truth here  and said,  you know,  somebody has confronted us  with a trademark allegation here  and we don't think it's warranted,  but given our history in the EU,  we don't feel that it's worth it  to potentially risk delaying  this product  and throwing our...  There you go.  ...to a situate.  That's the statement  that they should have made  and why they came out  with this nonsense statement  that they did beyond me.  And nobody will talk to it.  Microsoft and their people  have basically gone dark on this stuff.

End time: 4601.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in some high profile litigation  as well over their trade.  They're trademarks.  But if they won't talk to anyone about it...  Now, this could also be a bluff.  This could also be a negotiating tactic  where maybe Metro wanted some money  for a settlement of this thing,  but the money that they asked for  was too much.  I don't know.  We could speculate.  It would be irresponsible  not to speculate.

You go back and look at those 2010 reviews  and you can go back and look at the...  You know, so just from the product point of view  but also from the advertising point of view,  I'm also sure that they've done plenty of research  and maybe even some focus groups to get these ads...

Transcript:  But it's beautiful.  Exactly.  We'll take a break.  We'll come back in just a bit  and talk about the iPhone 5.  There's a ton of news this week.  We'll get to it all.  I promise you.  The Olympics and Twitter and NBC.  And oh there's more.  The new dig.  We'll talk.  The new cloud player from Amazon.  But first let me take you on a little visit  to something.  I want to do a Steve Martin here  and say the new Squarespace is here.  The new Squarespace is here.  The new Squarespace is here.  Very exciting.  Squarespace 6 has launched.  Now you know we talk about Squarespace  all the time.  These simply put the best hosting  for your site ever.  Fantastic.  But now, now it's even better  because the new Squarespace  content management system has launched.  Squarespace 6.  That just makes it, it's very modern.  The templates are gorgeous.  They're using, they're doing something  now called responsive design.  Responsive design, which we spent  on our new site over $100,000 to do.  You can get this for $8 a month.  So the idea of responsive design  and it makes sense in this world  where everybody's mobile,  is that your page looks the same  no matter what the device is.  It responds, it resizes appropriately.  That's why, for instance,  when you drag an image to Squarespace,  it generates seven different sizes.  One for every appropriate device.  So it looks great.  Your site will look great on everything  from a 27-inch screen  to a 3.5-inch iPhone.  The ability to drag and drop and design.  I know you guys on NSFW use,  I love this, you let one-shot  Squarespace sites all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, well because Squarespace offers  the free trial.  You get two weeks free  with no credit card or anything.  Yeah, so on our show we have people make  funny websites all the time.  I love it.  And really, I think Squarespace,  we've talked to them and they love.  They don't mind.  Yeah, well because they love people  getting to use the tools.  So when they know that they want to go  and have a serious project,  that they want to use this product,  they know how to use it.  They're familiar with everything  that they can do.  And let me tell you this,  that responsive design stuff,  this is only like maybe two years ago,  my friends at UpStatement,  which is a fantastic design firm  out in Boston,  very good friends of mine,  just did the Boston Globe redesign  that introduced that idea.  Oh really, is that where that came from?  Yeah, and now this is available  at a consumer level.  Yeah.  And that's insane.  That's great.  Because it's hard.  It is extraordinarily hard  and it is so well done  on the new Squarespace.

Start time: 5252.64

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's nice,  no two Squarespace sites look alike.  You can't tell it's a Squarespace site,  that you have the 300 plus Google type fonts,  the really easy customization,  but also if you know CSS,  they've got a pop out CSS editor  with the code coloring and all that stuff.  So it's really,  this is an entirely new product,  completely rewritten,  brand new code base,  HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript foundations.  This is the best.  And it's hosting plus the software,  so you're going to get  an incredible site.  And the best part is the pricing.  So let me exit out of this video.  And by the way,  workshops.squarespace.com,  they've got training free for you  so you can take webinars  and learn how to use this.  But if you go to squarespace.com right now,  you can sign up for a free account  for a free account,  two weeks free,  do everything,  all the features,  import your blog from WordPress,  type pad or blogger and all that.  But then if you decide you like it,  the pricing is phenomenal.  And I don't know how they're doing this.  They have yearly plans,  they have month to month plans.  The best deal of course  is the yearly plan.  In fact, it's an extra special good deal  if you use the offer code  twit8, T-W-I-T-8 for the month of August,  the eighth month,  twit8 because we'll give you  10% off your first purchase.  So if you buy a yearly plan,  that's 10% off for the whole year.  And look at these prices,  the basic plan $8 a month.  But the deal really here to me is $16 a month.  You get unlimited pages,  galleries and blogs,  unlimited bandwidth,  unlimited storage,  unlimited contributors.  It is a pro site for $16 a month.  And then apply the twit8 offer code  and you can take 10% off of that.  They'll also hook you up automatically  with your custom domain  so you can have that domain name  that goes that you pick,  they'll register it for you,  they'll hook it up and make it all at no charge.  Squarespace.com, the new Squarespace is here  and you've got to try this.  You've got to try this.  Squarespace.com, if you decide to buy,  just do me a favor,  use the offer code twit8  and you'll save 10%.  Love it.  Facebook stock down to under 20 bucks now.

If you're looking at it as a growth stock,  it's not very good price.  If you're looking at it as maybe there's some problems,  it's perfectly priced.  I think we'll see.  I think they've got to start showing some real growth  in their revenue, like heavy growth.  And users is harder  because they've sort of reached almost as many users  as they can get to probably.

Transcript:  and it kind of matched with something  that I had just read about,  which I found fascinating,  which was back in 1969,  Mike McGrady of the Newsday,  the paper Newsday, released a...  teamed with 18 other writers  to each separately write a chapter  of a romance novel  Naked came the stranger.  Naked came the stranger.  That was the name of the book.  It's a huge hit.  A huge thing in and of its own right.  I remember this very well.

So instead of having the staff of a newspaper write it,  we'll have our listeners write it,  our NSFW listeners write it.

Yeah, until they revealed it in this big  talk show kind of thing.  We decided we're just going to...  Secrets are public.  We can yell and scream about this all we want  and nobody will really know  because no one will really care.  And so we eventually...  We released this on Monday.  This is all user created.

It's starting to be a lot of money.  It's my point.  Yeah.  And so when people asked us initially,  It's like, what do you mean,  what are we going to do with $500?  We'll have a party.  We're going to make some books for the people  that wrote it, maybe get some T-shirts  and throw a party for people  that contributed and want to come.  Now you're talking Kickstarter money.  It has since become significantly more than $500.  So on the NSFW Show this week,  we're going to talk about it,  we're going to figure it out,  but it's been incredibly humbling and amazing  because people wanted to kind of get in on this silly thing.  And basically the idea was,  what would happen if you made a erotic fiction novel  in a post-50 Shades of Grey world  that very specifically and stringently  eliminated plot and character development  and just added nothing but three scoops of sex?

I've noticed, I've just recently,  because of these iBooks and reading of these things,  I've had a friend of mine who had no idea  read romance novels, had hundreds of them on the iBooks.  You know what I mean?  And this is something they don't want to read  in public necessarily on a plane,  but when they're on the iBooks  or whatever they're reading, the Kindles,  they like to read them.  So you'll see a lot more of this kind of...  It just is a really interesting trend,  because you can sort of read what you want to read.  But I was shocked this person had so many romance novels.  I had no idea this was an interest or whatever,  but how, like, you know,  the heaves or breasts or whatever the names  of those things are.  It's insane.  It's really interesting.  iBooks changes everything,  because you can actually enjoy these.

And we've seen some backlash of people  that, you know, are giving it one star reviews  that this is not what their kind of book is.  They like more character development  and plot in their romance novels.  But compared to what we are selling  and compared to what books like  Fifty Shades of Grey get in one star reviews,  we're really not all that abnormal  for other low-cost e-books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's interesting here,  I think Henry likes to write those kind of headlines.  I know it's blinking.  What's interesting here is that these new,  especially the Samsung phones, are really good.  Yes.  They're not as glitchy and they're not as wonky.  I mean, a lot of the problem with early Android phones  is they were incredibly wonky.  They'd crash all the time.  And so I think these are...  I mean, the challenge for Apple is that they don't change a lot.  I mean, for the first time I saw, I think, one of the Samsung phones,  and I'm an Apple user for years and years  in terms of the iPhone and stuff like that.  I just happen to like it better.  But for the first time, I was a little bit jealous  and it never happens, I have to say.  It was the first time I was like,  oh, that's kind of cool what was on it.  And I thought, I doubt I will switch,  but it definitely...  They'll have to do something special  in this new version for me to buy it.  And I definitely...  It definitely was the first time I thought,  well, they somehow have hidden the wonkiness of Android  in a good way.  So that's really the point,  is that they really have to up the game this time  rather than just make small changes.

Transcript:  Yeah.  But isn't it what is happening inside the iPhone  that is kind of the edge there,  that even if they have a minimalist and familiar design,  that that means less than what is in their ecosystem  with the App Store and with iOS 6?  But is it always going to work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think the iPhone is looking a little older.  That's all.  It just is looking a little less slick  than it was when it first came out.  And I think because phones are so interchangeable now,  as Leo is probably the most used of them,  but I think people want something fresh.  And so fresh doesn't mean a totally different thing,  but something that's not maybe a little thinner.  I would prefer a thinner phone, maybe a bigger screen.  I think it's kind of table-

And probably thinner and no matter what's inside,  I think people want slightly different form factor.  Just not tons, but just you want something fresh.  It hasn't been freshened up since it was...  Since a long time.  Well, maybe we do agree with Henry

Start time: 6773.04

But I don't think that's going to stop people from buying this  is a question of there's a lot of very fresh,  exciting phones from using the Android system.  And so that's...  And they will be from Windows.  And so the question is, not from RAM, obviously,  this Christmas again,  but it's a question of whether the regular users  want something fresher.  I know I do.

Transcript:  Microsoft has announced a new mouse  that's just really interesting.  What do you think about the Wedge Touch mouse there, Ed Bott?

Start time: 6874.53
End time: 6954.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like it.  It's interesting.  And that's one of the things in terms of hardware design  that they've done really, really well through the years.  I've got a couple of the Arc Touch mouses here,  and they're really neat.  So they have a good history with multi-touch technology.  But I'm actually more interested in that keyboard,  especially for Windows 8,  because I know a lot of the complaints that people have had  about Windows 8 is that the interface  with a mouse and a keyboard is somewhat awkward.  And even when you learn it, it just doesn't sort of sink in.  But this one will have dedicated keys on it  that are mapped to the Windows 8 interface.  And so instead of having to move your mouse up into a corner  and make the menu appear,  you'll just be able to hit one of those dedicated keys  and either go to the start screen or share something  or search.  And so that, I think, is something that might take care  of some of the objections that people have  to the Windows 8 interface.  But Microsoft has been doing great keyboards and mice  for a long time, almost unheralded.

Transcript:  So this has a regular Windows key on it  with the new Windows logo, but there's another keyboard,  I think, that has a key for the Charms, for instance,  which would be very nice.  It's kind of hard to navigate to the Charms.

Start time: 6969.24
End time: 7004.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. I thought, and I suggested this at one point,  that instead of, right now it's Windows key plus C  is how you make the Charms menu appear.  And I thought, and I still think,  that tapping the Windows key should just make that menu appear  and then if you tap it again, it'll take you to the start screen.  That's a nice idea.  And in fact, I'm hoping if anyone's listening  and you're out there, a developer,  that utility to be available so that I could remap those keys  on the Windows 8 interface and collectively,  together we will make a small fortune.

Transcript:  No, I think it has probably more to do with power management.  The new, there's probably some custom circuitry that's going in there.  They have a lot that they need to do with the x86, x64 versions of Windows 8  and hardware to get them so that you can truly get all day battery life with them  and that's the real challenge.  You know, putting it into that form factor isn't difficult.  I've got a Samsung Series 7 here that's perfectly,  you know, makes a perfectly good tablet,  but it heats up and the fan comes on  and the battery life is five hours when you really need eight hours.  And so that's, I wonder if that's where the challenge is,  where they're working with Intel and some of the chip makers  to get that circuitry so that the Windows 8 Pro version  will have the performance that they need.

The best place to get audiobooks.  100,000 titles, fiction, nonfiction.  You know, we're all busy these days. Who has time to read?  And yet reading is, to me, one of my great joys in life.  That's when I found Audible, and I found it literally 10, 11 years ago now.  It just changed my life because suddenly, you know, that time I spent in the car on the commute,  the time I spent at the gym, the time I spent cleaning house and walking the dog  could now be part of my reading time.  And I just have to say, I'm so happy.  The new read, and I actually, I hear this is an excellent audiobook,  and I will be reading this because Wednesday, Daniel Suarez is going to be on triangulation.  We're going to interview him.  He's the guy who wrote The Amazing Demon and Freedom TM, which were gripping,  and I listen to them on Audible.  Kill Decision, his new one just came out, is of course on Audible.  And I hear a must listen.  So I'm going to tell you how you can get this and maybe get Demon, too, for free.  I'm going to get you two, not one, but two books at audible.com.  Here's the deal. Go to audible.com slash twit2.  You'll be signing up for the Platinum account.  That's the one I use. That's two books a month.  I think that's just about right.  If you're a heavy listener, it's perfect.  Your first month's free.  Your first two credits are free, and you can apply them to any of the books  in the 100,000-strong Audible bookstore.  But this would be a great one.  Kill Decision from Daniel Suarez or his first book, Demon.  If you had one more credit, you could do all three.  But next month.  Yeah.  Next month.  You can't quit any time.  The books are yours to keep.  You pay nothing if you don't want to.  But I think you're going to want to.  It's just, to me, anytime you spend in the car, in the plane, traveling,  it's just such a relief to have Audible.  In fact, for me, it's a security blanket.  I don't travel anywhere without Audible.  Yes, they do have 50 shades.  Of course they do.  That's what I'm saying.  They've got, and it's the number one download.

Start time: 7510.06
End time: 7538.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So here's the deal.  So Guy Adams was, as many of us are, annoyed at NBC  and how it was handling particularly the opening ceremonies,  published the business email address of an NBC executive,  an address that he says was easily discernible.  He also quotes in his letter to Twitter the terms of service that say  if what you're publishing is already on the internet,  you're off the hook.  That's why it wasn't a violation of the terms of service.

Start time: 7539.67
End time: 7555.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's interesting is that NBC sent in a complaint  and then it automatically, it does that on YouTube too  if you have, there's a question over your video.  So I think it was, I was told by someone on Twitter  it was very automated initially,  but I think even they think it was a mistake to take him down.  Yeah, well Twitter.

Start time: 7555.80
End time: 7600.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My understanding is that it went the other way around.  Exactly.  That Twitter is the one who notified NBC  and Twitter, and in fact the blog post and apology from Twitter  was written by Twitter's general counsel,  which suggests that they realized that they stepped in a big pile  of legal mess.  Twitter's.  Because what they've done is the same thing as a publisher.  If you start paying attention to the content of things  that people are posting on your service,  then you start becoming responsible  for other things that people post.  You lose your safe harbor.  Which is going to be tough on Twitter, for goodness sake.

Start time: 7601.00
End time: 7622.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, the stuff that goes on on there is much more liable,  I would assume, some of the things that are said back and forth.  But, you know, I'm sorry for getting the right things wrong.  I again was away last week, but I think it borked.  I mean, that's pretty much how I looked at it.  And I think that they understand that,  but it was perfectly fine what he did.  He was expressing an opinion about really bad coverage.

Start time: 7622.52
End time: 7626.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and some of the concern was that NBC is kind of hand in pocket  with Twitter.

Start time: 7627.40
End time: 7665.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, yeah, and that's what it's funny.  When you get down to the second to last paragraph  on Twitter's blog, it's like,  the team working closely with NBC around our Olympics partnership  with NBC did proactively identify a tweet  that was in violation of Twitter rules  and encouraged NBC to file a support ticket  with our trust and safety team to report the violation.  And I can hear this conversation and it's like,  this guy's hammering us.  What are you going to do about him?  It's like, well, you could do this.  And then once this is filed,  once the support ticket with trust and safety has been filed,  trust and safety is obligated to basically hammer the account  with a stick.  Yeah.  You know, and...

Start time: 7665.28
End time: 7695.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I think they weren't understanding the difference  between editorial and their business relationships,  which I think is hard for a company like that.  I mean, they are a publisher and they also are a business,  and so I think that's not very clear at that company  that they are, that there are two.  Possibly there should be a wall of some sort  between what's on Twitter and what the business relationships are.  So that'll be an interesting question for them going forward.  But I mean, the guy had every right to do that,  every single right.  Well, I mean, the question was the email, right?

Start time: 7695.16
End time: 7720.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It wasn't necessarily that he was saying that everything  stank on ICE.  It was that he gave away this dude's email  that I'm sure people at NBC thought was less cool  than he defined it as, that, you know,  that it was easy to find on the Internet.  They consider that more private than they probably realize  it is publicly available.  And so that's why they came at it in like a,  we were injured kind of sense.  Oh, don't you think that was just the excuse?

Start time: 7721.04
End time: 7777.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The guy was doing something.  Exactly.  I mean, I was involved in that  because I was, happened to be in Israel  and I got to watch the whole thing and I was tweeting,  like, what the hell's going on with these,  this Baltimore detacking the Mary Poppins thing?  I was like, excuse me.  And so everyone was like, how are you watching it, Kara?  And I said, I'm watching it in Israel.  You know what I mean?  And so it was, you know, and then I started insulting it  and then all these British people were like,  started insulting me and it went down.  Wow.  It was, you know, I was like, okay, they're like,  oh, it's British humor.  You don't get it.  I'm like, fine.  It's not good.  But anyway, so, but it was interesting  because the, I think then I started to notice  all the Americans were like, why are you watching it?  You know, and so I think that it was justifiable  in terms of what he was saying.  And he definitely was, I was reading him  and thought he was the most effective Twitter  on this issue in terms of jamming at home  that NBC had screwed up.  And I thought that it might've been that he was so effective  that they decided to slow him down a little bit.  Yeah, I guess I just...

There is kind of this interesting, you know,  I've been following a guy named Dalton Caldwell.  He started iMeme and Pick Please  and he started a new radio show  and he started a new response to...  He feels that a lot of people,  especially third-party developers,  feel like Twitter's turned their back  on the people who created Twitter,  the third-party developers, the apps.  They want people to go to the website  because they want to make the money on the ads.  They've become an ad company  and there are a number of people who say  that was a kind of a mistake.  Apparently it was an internal battle at Twitter  some years ago.  Yeah, there was...  It's like what's going on at Yahoo.  Should we be a platform or should we be an ad company?

Start time: 7826.82
End time: 7862.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but Twitter,  this has gone on before with developers.  That's a problem.  People are really eating off their ecosystem a lot.  There's a lot of businesses  that have been formed off the back  of what Twitter's doing  and now they've been tried at different times  to put a stop to it  and now they're really putting a stop to it.  And so they've made the decision.  I mean, I don't think there's a debate any longer.  No.  They're not allowing people  to suck all this data out of their system.  And the question is how important is this developer  ecosystem to them or not?  It's definitely a fantastic story  and we had published some of the...

Transcript:  If he's promising that he's not going to...  I mean, the classic problem with Facebook is  where is my information going?  Why do they keep confusing this?  Why do they make privacy complicated?  Why do I feel dirty every time I go there  because I feel like all this information about life  has been sucked out?  If the idea is that we're not going to have ads  and we're not going to data mine  and we're going to keep things...  We're basically going to give you...  For everybody who thinks they're actually going to Facebook  to show up and hang out with their friends,  we're going to give you an environment  where you can go to Facebook  and show up and hang out with their friends  because it's interesting watching some people  who are extraordinarily savvy about entrepreneurship  and business and the big things we don't talk about,  which is that the big money is mining the information  on the backside, that if they're promising that,  it makes it kind of really compelling.

Transcript:  So this is, but there have been in the space program,  there have been so many more really uplifting, noble, wonderful moments.  And I think this is going to be one of them,  especially given the sort of abandonment that we've had  of the manned space program, that this is something to at least see,  you know, the possibility of something we've never seen before.  I agree. It's very exciting.  I'll tell you what.

Transcript:  Space to me is on a roll.  Yeah.  I'm a huge SpaceX fan.  I actually drove up.  Did you?  Yeah.  I saw the Dragon capsule that docked with the ISS launch from Canaveral.  Cool.  I'm so thrilled.  It's just such a great time to come back.  We care about space.  And I think the reason why we've cared less about it  is because there hasn't been a lot of punch in the gut,  relevant kind of space explorations over the last 30 years.  And now we are entering, in my opinion, a golden age for that.  I hope you're right.  You know, we are going to see with companies like SpaceX and cheaper,  and hopefully if Elon Musk is correct, reusable rockets,  this is going to be a more regular part of our lives.  And we can push the exploration for the human race  into just fantastic, amazing places in our lifetime,  which is something that's fascinating and super cool.
