We're gonna, we're gonna put you all in like a Hollywood Squares  thing this time, which is kind of fun. Jonathan Colton on the left there and in  the lower right hand corner.

These  are brought to me from Holland. These are wooden shoe slippers. They're not wood.  But no, well they're slippers. They're comfy. Yeah. They look like they look  like they're made from Pikachu's. They are. I think they're made from Big Bird. They're  soft as peeps and and they're just very comfortable. So happy holidays you guys.

Start time: 225.70
End time: 241.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Late January, extremely late January. So tell us about that from last year.  How did it go? Was it fun? It was a pretty much an unmitigated disaster. Was it Poseidon Adventure

Start time: 241.28
End time: 272.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  number two? No, it was, it was, it was pretty great actually. It was the first one we'd ever  done so we didn't know how things were gonna go. But I don't know, you know, the, the, our crowd  is just such a fun bunch of people. They, you know, we planned a bunch of stuff and then they  planned a bunch more stuff and they made it a lot more fun. And it was just a blast. I mean,  you're on a cruise ship. You can't really go wrong when you're on a cruise ship. Even if you didn't  do anything on a cruise ship, which is kind of what you're supposed to do on a cruise ship,

Start time: 272.48
End time: 276.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  you would have a great time. That was Twitter's business plan. We planned a bunch of stuff and

Start time: 276.00
End time: 282.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  then they planned a bunch more stuff. Exactly. That's the, that's the internet way. Yeah,

Start time: 282.16
End time: 290.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it is. You never know what your users are gonna do. So there's still room on the February cruise.  You're gonna be on the Western dam, which I've been on as a very nice boat, really nice.

Start time: 291.78
End time: 332.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  May I just jump in for a second? Yes, Mr. Hodgman. Well, you know, Jonathan Colvin and I have been  friends for a long time. And so I don't mean to criticize him in any way, but he just did a very  terrible job selling this cruise. Here's the thing. This is his business enterprise. He is the only  one who makes money off of this thing. I'm paying money to go on it. Okay. Now, partly that's because  I'm a deranged millionaire and I can afford to do that. But it's also because I want to be there.  And you do too, internet. No, it's really, I went into that thing with a lot of skepticism, a lot of

Start time: 335.66
End time: 343.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  concerns. Wait, how is this better? How is this better than what I did? Wait for the other Dutch

Start time: 343.96
End time: 348.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  slipper to fall. I came out of this with slightly fewer misc...

Start time: 351.21
End time: 355.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Were you worried that like for instance the boat would sink? Is that, was that one of the issues?

Start time: 355.46
End time: 455.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I believe in science. I was concerned because I had read the David  Foster Wallace piece in Harper's years ago in which David Foster Wallace said riding on a cruise  ship is depressing. He killed himself, I think, right? I think it may have been the case that he  was depressed while he was on the boat. Right. Also because the ship itself could go either way.  He described it as an act of disgusting gross consumerism that filled him with ennui. And because  I was in my 20s at the time that I read this article, I presumed it would also fill me with  horrible ennui. But it turns out if you're in your 30s and you don't care anymore about anything,  there's not much time we left. You have no ideals left. It's actually fun to drink a martini at 10 a.m.  poolside next to a frozen dolphin ice sculpture. And then I was concerned also that as much as I  love Jonathan's music and as much as I adore his fans from afar, I was concerned that we were all  going to be consumed alive by code monkey fans. But they couldn't have been the nicer people,  honestly. And of course, I was obviously concerned because Paul and Storm were going to be there,  but they were going to. They weren't so bad. And the feeling, the feeling of it was one of the most  remarkable weeks that I've ever experienced to the point where now I'm not just telling you,  I'm going around to legitimate famous people that I know and actually and telling them you  should pay money to come on this boat and experience this because it's a lot of fun.

Start time: 456.79
End time: 459.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you think having Paul and Storm soaked up a lot of the ennui?

Start time: 462.54
End time: 509.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We laid down a base of ennui that sort of muted everyone else's.  So yes. So you know what? It's February 19th through the 26th. And it's on my consumer season  gift gage to be sure. I think whatever amount of money you spend to get on this thing, you're  going to have the time of your life. It is really a good time. And the performers who are on this,  you got Jonathan Colton with his amazing new album, Artificial Heart. You got Paul and Storm. You've  got John Roderick of the Long Winters, the famous comedian Paul F. Tompkins, MC Front a lot.  Not a little.  Front a lot.

Start time: 510.30
End time: 513.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Will Wheaton. Will Wheaton's going to be there.  A lot.

Start time: 514.49
End time: 532.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Will Wheaton is going to be there.  Yes.  For heaven's sakes. It's just going to be and lots and lots more to come. And if you're curious  who else could be on this boat, it's a big boat. The Westerdam is a beautiful boat. And so I think  you should go to the website, check it out, count your pennies, say cash in your gift cards,  and go on this thing.

Start time: 532.40

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 543.46
End time: 547.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Great performers that I talked about. None of us are going to do anything on the boat.  They pretty much stay in their cabins.

Start time: 548.02
End time: 575.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I went on the Giants cruise. I went on a cruise with the San Francisco Giants when they won the  pennant in 1989. And that's what they did. They stayed in their cabin. We knew they were on the  boat, but that's all we really knew.  Did you expect them to play a game?  No. Something. Come out. Kevin Mitchell came out once and he was a very large man, former convict.  You know, lots of tattoos. And big. He got in the hot tub. All the water came out and that was it.  And that was like the event of the whole cruise.  So you guys come out of your cabins?

Start time: 575.82

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, look, it's Jonathan. I don't want to speak about numbers here because it's gauche.  Yeah, I know.  I think I, Jonathan, you correct me if I'm wrong. A human could go on this boat for a week  at a basic level cabin, which means to say it's underwater.

Start time: 619.96
End time: 623.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's in the boat, though. It's not under outside underwater. You're in the boat.

Start time: 624.70
End time: 628.35

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not submersible. Yeah.

Start time: 630.68
End time: 644.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're on the boat at a basic level cabin, a week's worth of entertainment and a week's  worth of food and non-alcoholic drink included in your price.  Could you get that for under $1,000, Jonathan?

Start time: 647.18
End time: 674.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could get it for just under $1,000. That's right.  It's a pretty good deal for a week-long vacation with all food included. All food.  Plus, you know, it's not a restaurant. You could call them. This is the craziest thing.  This is the awesome thing about the cruise ship. Any time of day, you call them up and you say,  I would like a club sandwich and a plate of cookies delivered to my room.  And somebody arrives.  I want a club sandwich and a plate of cookies.  That's exactly right. No matter how drunk you are or what time it is.

Start time: 676.00
End time: 684.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 686.96
End time: 699.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All room services included. It's a week's long vacation.  And if you get a friend to go with you, Jonathan, don't they get a deal on the cabin?  If you're sharing a cabin with a friend, it averages out a little bit less than that per person, right?

Start time: 744.84
End time: 782.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did find that was one thing. And I know Holland America, I've been on many Holland America cruises.  They really love the hand sanitizer. So much so that when you go...  This is not going to help sell it either. But when you go into the dining room,  there's a very nice Filipino guy standing there with a...  Always? Am I wrong? Yes. Am I wrong? You tell me, guys. You've been there.  He's got a large kind of amorphous bag. It could be a giant breast implant.  That's hard to say. But there's a spout on it.  And he has it under his arm. And you come in and you hold out your hands and he goes...  And that's hand sanitizer.  Am I wrong? Is that not wrong?

Start time: 783.24

Start time: 796.82
End time: 807.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, let me make sure that it was going to be a quality experience.  You can't just hold a cruise and take it on faith.  And indeed, the guys with the hand sanitizer...  You didn't ask either.

Start time: 807.80
End time: 812.69

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, what they do is for a group such as ours, they provide what is called a site inspection,  which involves, in this case, four of us to go on the boat and follow the same exact itinerary  and pretend to work for a week.

Start time: 845.96
End time: 849.90

Start time: 889.74
End time: 905.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they're jolly and it's really kind of neat because the cruise staff, despite the fact that  there's deck like kindling below decks most of the time, are really very happy and festive,  and I think they enjoy their jobs.  No one we.  No one we there.

Start time: 906.18

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there are seats left still for this jaunt?  Seats?  Or births?  Births, is that what they call them?  They're only seats.  It's not like a train where you have to pay more if you want to sleep.  You could just have you go on the cruise in a chair like this and it would recline.

Start time: 934.34
End time: 935.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 937.32

Transcript:  But you'll be having too much fun to sleep.  That's right.

Start time: 941.14
End time: 965.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The reality is that I had a very nice cabin last year with a beautiful view of the ocean,  but I spent two seconds in it the entire time.  Cabin doesn't matter.  It's too much fun.  No.  Drinking martinis and playing Scrabble and listening to funny jokes told by people that  I didn't know and listening to beautiful music played by people that I didn't know.  It was the greatest.  They do some wonderful things.  I'm taking a loss on this and I'm still talking.

Start time: 965.94
End time: 1002.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it's wonderful.  It's wonderful.  I do this at least yearly.  I go on a geek cruise.  The same group puts it together that puts yours together.  Neil Bauman and his wonderful company.  And these are great fun.  And they have, I think this, I remember this also, they have a midnight buffet.  Do they not?  People have eaten already seven or eight meals through the day.  Every 15 or 17 minutes they feed you.  And nevertheless, for some reason at midnight they're starving.  And they have a midnight buffet that they lay out.  Just beautiful ice sculpture and stuff.  And people like Buffalo come running in and trample it all.  No extra charge.  And there's no extra charge for that.

Start time: 1002.90
End time: 1005.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So to be fair, it's a cruise.  So they're very old Buffalo.

Start time: 1007.26
End time: 1009.10

Start time: 1010.54

Start time: 1016.66
End time: 1032.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to destroy that stereotype right now.  There were some elderly people on the cruise, but in all, I felt every cliche that I understood  about a cruise was destroyed, was sunk, shall we say.  Lots of chic young European people on this thing.

Start time: 1034.16
End time: 1037.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 1088.94
End time: 1156.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, it is.  Along with my friend, Jonathan Colton.  He performs?  He performs throughout, as is the second book, which was called More Information Than You Require.  Wonderful performance there.  And the third will be as well.  That was my question.  As soon as I, yes.  Believe me, lots of people are asking.  So the books, if there are people out there who don't, have never read a word that I've written,  these are books of fake trivia.  They're made up.  What facts?  So like the old book of lists where it would give a list of the nine US presidents who  love to smoke cigars, mine is the nine US presidents who had hooks for hands and the  stories behind them.  And the three books are separate.  You can read them together or you can read them individually.  And the third, that is all, is the one that has just been published.  And as with all of them, I will eventually get together, I hope, with my friend Jonathan  Colton and maybe even my friends Paul and Storm and some other special guests and get  into a studio and record it for audio book on tape, as I used to call it.  But that will probably happen next year.

Start time: 1156.88

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's put on second helicopter.  Of course.  Yeah.  Back in the time of luxury Atlantic crossing, there's a story that the term Posh derived  from a sea lining acronym, port outward Starboard home, which is to say your cabin would move back  and forth depending on where you were.  And that's benefit from the sun and the best views of the endless life deadening ocean.  But that is in fact apocryphal.  It actually stands for put on second helicopter because, you know, during the time during the  in the in the in the first decade of the last century, you know, during the Titanic time,  this was a very, very much regimented class system.  So you would have first class and then you would have steerage and then you would have the place  where the Irish hung around.  Right.  So and what was not known because it was kept secret was that for the best class of passengers,  they had escape helicopters.  They were obviously very rudimentary helicopters.  They only went about a foot off the surface of the water, but it was better than sitting in a boat  with someone who was beneath you.  And they had to keep the helicopters a secret from the rest of the ship.  That's why this is not largely reported because they were very, very fragile.  And there was concern that if an ethnic person touched their membranous wings,  they would just fall apart like an Irish.  So they couldn't they couldn't tell the Irish or the Italian people that  there was a chance to survive should the ship sink.  But the second helicopters were very common.  There actually was another class of the P.O.F.H. put on first helicopter.  But that was that was very, very, very super exclusive.  And that's why there's usually only one one there.

Ragnarok, as we call it.  And it will not, you know, we can't have an electronic edition.  That'll just be wiped out by the by the Omega.  And so I would I would encourage people right now.

Transcript:  And but it's a remarkable deal for complete world knowledge.  And and it is my life's work.  And it's the last one of these books that I'll ever write.  And I think the best of the three.  So I don't.  Yeah.  Can I can I say something about your book, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, sure.  Please.  Because I think, you know, you you and I have been friends for for a long time.  And so I'm a little biased.  I admit that.  But I do think that this is the best book of the three.  And I'll tell you why.  All these books.  And if you haven't read them, you should read them all because they're all great.  But they start from this this funny place of ridiculousness, the facts that are not real facts.  And somehow impossibly.  And this is the thing that is so amazing about John.  Somehow, impossibly, they come around to a kind of truth and a kind of a moving  a piece of human experience that I don't think you could get to, except through ridiculous fake facts.  It's very hard thing to explain.  But this this book, this third book, by far, I think is the is the most successful at doing that.  It makes you laugh, but it's also incredibly sad at the same time, which, as you know,  is my favorite, my favorite thing in the world.

Transcript:  You know, I'll tell you what happened when I first moved to New York City  and was trying to figure out how to be a rock star.  I thought it'd be a good idea to get a job at a record company just to get involved with the business.  So I got a job as the assistant to somebody at this record company called Angel Records.  Which is a very good company.

Start time: 2297.12

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a big company.  At the time that I was working for them, it was a division of EMI.  And they did classical music and crossover, adult contemporary.  They did all sorts of stuff.  But when I arrived, they were riding the wave of this incredible phenomenon called Chant.  Which was essentially a 20-year-old recording of some Spanish monks singing plain chant.  They had re-released as a single disc.  It was a double album.  They re-released it as a single disc with that fancy cover of the monks floating in the blue sky.  And it sold two million copies and nobody really knew why.  And it was the kind of crazy...  It was the craziest introduction to the record business because it was like,  hey, hey, you wrote some pop songs.  Great.  Well, here's this 20-year-old recording of some Spanish monks that accidentally sold two million copies.  See what you can do, kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Amazon.com description says, thanks to good marketing, good cover art, and good luck,  this disc has probably sold more copies than most other recordings of Gregorian chant put together.  It is often quipped that most of these discs have been listened to exactly once and put away  to the puzzlement of many musicians and critics who point out there are more beautiful,  there are more varied performances by professional singers available.  If this recording, ahem, I don't know.  Ahem is written in there?  Ahem is, I don't know, I've never heard Amazon editorialize like this.  If this recording, ahem, enchants you at first, wonderful.  If you get bored with it later, don't give up.  There have been an extraordinary variety of styles and sounds over the 1500-year history  of plain chant, so go listen to some other stuff.  You won't be sorry.

He went to check out, you know, where it was placed in the store and sort of see what was  happening. And he was just sort of loitering around and he saw somebody go up to the counter  and ask the person, hey, do you have, do you have that record chant?  And the person behind the counter said, we're actually, we're sold out right now,  but we'll be getting some in a couple of days.  And the guy said, oh, fantastic, because I really need it.

Transcript:  Well, Jonathan Cullen does have a new album. We're going to talk about that in just a little bit  and where to get it. As the plug fest continues.  And maybe a little later on, we'll get to the spirit of Christmas.  Just, you know, probably not. It's a thought. We're aimed at that.  But I do want to talk a little bit about Ford Motor Company and something that, you know,  it's hard to take seriously with these guys back here behind me making faces,  but especially since your fire seems to have suddenly been reduced to the size of a YouTube  video. But it's still warm though.  We're going to restart the fire. Can we restart the fire?  I think he didn't restart the fire.  That's Billy Joel. Yeah. Wait a minute, here comes a super eight bit fireplace.  This will be nice. Well, there you go. Look at that.  That's better.  That is warming. Warming, warming. Meanwhile, let's take a ride in the Ford vehicles. I think  this was the focus that we had last week and show you a little bit about how Wi-Fi  works in these new 2012 Ford Focuses. Take a look.  So we're back at the Twit Brick House and I have a volunteer. Michael here is going to,  well, Michael here is, Michael, Michael, see when you go on a long car trip,  nice to have something for the kids to do. I brought a little laptop. I got my iPhone.  He's got his iPad. But what about the Wi-Fi? Oh, no problem. I brought along my Wi-Fi access spot  AKA my Ford Focus. So Michael hop in here. You get in that side. I'm going to get in this side.  I'm going to show you how I can use this USB Wi-Fi dongle or a 3G dongle to turn this into a Wi-Fi  access spot. When you travel with kids, as you know, it's really nice to have some entertainment  for them. They like to get online. Maybe they want to surf the web or do a little email,  play some games. Ford's realized that getting connected inside your car is a big deal. That's  why they have added Wi-Fi access capability to the 2012 Ford Focus. Let me show you how it works.  I take this. This is a Virgin mobile, but a lot of companies make these. It's a USB 3G transmitter.  Now, normally you plug this into the computer and the computer's online. But what if we have  more than one device? We can get up to five devices online. But plugging this into the Focus,  that is going to turn the whole car into an access spot. So now Michael can put his iPad on  the Wi-Fi in the car. I can put my iPhone on the Wi-Fi in the car. Up to five devices. I even have  one of these Google Chromebooks, which likes having a little Wi-Fi so it can get online.  And here I go. I just connect it up, find the Wi-Fi access spot, pick it, put in the password,  and I'm online. I love this. As we drive down the highway, everybody's happy. Thank you, Ford.  One of the many nice features in the Ford Focus for 2012, and of course, available on other Ford  vehicles. Why don't you go to your Ford dealer and drive one today? Or visit the website,  ford.com slash technology. You ready to go? All right, let's hit the road.  Michael never said one word that whole time.

End time: 2790.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They Might Be Giants, yes. I've been a fan of theirs for a long time. I met them in person  a couple of times, probably through John Hodgman, who of course was the deranged millionaire  when they did the venue songs thing. And I had been the guy creepily hanging around backstage  at a couple of shows. And then Paul and Storm and I did the show in Chicago that was scheduled  opposite. They Might Be Giants show also in Chicago the same night, and they were doing Flood.  And we thought it would be fun to do our own Flood show. So we actually learned the entire album.  Oh my God.  The three of us played it. And I emailed Flansburg to make sure they weren't going to be angry at us.  Like you're trying to steal all their fans.  Yeah, exactly. And at some point after that, they asked me to open for them,  which I did for a few shows. And at the end of that run, John Flansburg approached me and said,  hey, what are you doing right now? And maybe we should make an album together. So he was  the producer on this record. And yeah, it was great. It was a great experience and  it's kind of a dream come true. I keep having to pinch myself.

Start time: 2791.30

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have done it all myself in my home studio. And it was so great because I'd been rattling around  inside my own head for so long that it was really nice to share some of the burden with somebody  else and to collaborate with somebody and to be able to say yes to other people's ideas instead  of just my ideas. So it was a really, really fulfilling experience and a lot of fun. And

Yeah, well, I'm sure because they are  different versions. They're fans. Yeah.  And they're fans, exactly. They know. They understand the transaction. They understand that  if they spend money on the music, it makes it more likely for me to have money to make the next  batch of music that I need to make. It just makes sense. And artificial artificial heart-

Start time: 3062.40
End time: 3134.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Eventually you reach an audience that is so large, Jonathan, that they're not going to have that  direct connection with you anymore. And that's when they start stealing from you, when they don't  understand that their money is going directly to you and they just pretend, oh yeah, he's going  to be successful no matter what. Is that what's happened to you, John Hodgman?  No, I never had the first thing, so I don't know what happened.  Actually, you know what? I don't mean to accuse Jonathan of anything. I think that it's really  interesting how scalable it is. I may have been more skeptical, but Jonathan's audience is getting  larger and larger. I think it's scalable. And I think what happens is that while you can't  necessarily keep the direct kind of like I'm answering every email relationship that you have  with fans at the beginning of a career that really gets them invested in the career and gets them  feeling connected, there is something that's great about independent music and writing and  other distribution on the internet, which is that people are beginning to get savvy and understand  that the dollar that they spend on that piece of work that you have put out yourself is going to  go to you. And the place where they get callous is when they realize that 90% of that dollar is  going to go to an international corporation that doesn't care about you. And at that point, they're

Start time: 3134.32
End time: 3155.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  like, I might as well steal this. That's right. I mean, you look at the example of Louis C.K.  He's got a massive audience and he just did this $5 comedy special that was also available for  people to get for free. And so he posted the numbers and they were enormous. They're up even

Start time: 3155.94
End time: 3178.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  more now. There's $750,000 he's made so far. I would argue that people actually don't even see  it as stealing. It's not a vengeful thing in a lot of cases. It's just the way the internet works.  That's where it is. And so if they have a direct connection, they're like, oh, well, hey, I want  Jonathan to make more stuff. So how can I, I'm going to investigate how to support him. But if  it's other people that they see as millionaires or part of the system, they don't feel a responsibility

Start time: 3178.70
End time: 3192.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to have to dig in. That's stealing. I mean, let's be fair. If someone thinks that they're too rich  to not notice what you're taking from them, that's stealing. Well, I'm saying that they're not doing

Start time: 3192.72
End time: 3202.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it vengefully. You can argue the semantics of whether it's stealing or not, but I don't think  people think of it as stealing. They just go do it. Yeah. Somebody, I can't remember who it was

Start time: 3202.88
End time: 3228.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  who posted this, but somebody posted something interesting about a comment that you see a lot  on YouTube. And you can kind of tell it's like 12 and 13 year old kids who are writing this.  They'll post a video that's a static photo of an album cover with a song. And they'll say  in the description, they'll say, no copyright infringement intended.  Which is like, we did it.

Start time: 3230.28
End time: 3239.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 3239.48
End time: 3251.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Except the interesting thing about it is that's how people think of it.  Right.  When they say that, what they mean is this is not really infringing anything. This is totally cool.  This happens all the time.  And they're kind of right.

Start time: 3251.82
End time: 3255.02

Start time: 3255.22
End time: 3272.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's very likely that nobody would listen to that in lieu of, if they wanted the track,  buying the track. Now, I do have to say one of the negatives of artificial artificial heart,  the fan bootleg, is it is missing the critical Just We Rick Springfield cut.  So you have to buy the actual album.

Start time: 3274.00
End time: 3284.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 3285.20
End time: 3293.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what I'd be more offended by? And actually, I want to ask you about this, Jonathan,  is that I don't have to buy it. I listen to it on Spotify.  You get anything if I listen to it on Spotify?

Start time: 3295.58
End time: 3332.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Spotify is a... Spotify is a terrible side effect of enormous labels.  What has happened is that Spotify negotiated with the big labels because they need that content in  their library and they were sort of over a barrel. And so they had to give a specific decent rate  to those big labels at the expense of everybody else in the world.  So when you listen to my music on Spotify...  And almost all of it's there.

Start time: 3332.66
End time: 3333.42

Start time: 3334.60
End time: 3358.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Almost all of it's there. If you one spin of one of my songs on Spotify, I think earns me 0.007  cents. Whereas if you're on a major label, I think you get three cents. It's an enormous disparity.  So yeah, Spotify is not great for the entire ecosystem of independent musicians.

Start time: 3359.00
End time: 3387.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think people need to know that because I think that people believe that or understand  that if I listen to Jonathan Colton on YouTube with a still of him, okay, he's not getting any  money out of that. That's not really supporting Jonathan. But I'm listening to it on a legitimate  service like Spotify. There it is, Artificial Heart, including Je Suis Rick Springfield.  Well, that must be legitimate. It's got the album art. It's got his name.  So I think people need to get the word out.

Start time: 3389.14
End time: 3445.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is legitimate. It's my decision whether or not to have it there.  And I choose to have it there.  Oh, well, that's interesting. Why?  Well, I think that... Well, first of all, I'm always willing to experiment with these things.  Nobody knows how long services like Spotify are going to last. I mean, it's still unclear  if they're going to be a viable business, if they can actually make money doing this.  But it's also, I recognize that it's a big place that people go to  discover music as well as listen to music. And so I operate under the theory that if you listen to  my music for free, it can only benefit me down the line because you'll come to a show,  you'll buy a t-shirt, you'll buy the fancy super fancy box that Tom Merritt bought,  somewhere down the road.

Start time: 3447.02
End time: 3481.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To some degree, I don't mean to interrupt you, Jonathan, but I feel like you've discovered  another thing that I never would have been able to predict, which is if you are a sole proprietor  putting your stuff out there, you, like an old fashioned record album, are going to have to  presume a certain amount of theft, of loss, of people taking it for free who aren't going to  give you the money. And therefore you give an opportunity to people who are really committed  to your career to buy something premium that you're willing to give them. In this case,  the box of stuff and everything else. And that's, I think, part of the system as well,  or part of the new math as well, is that there's...

Transcript:  Tom is a comic genius who hosts this amazing call-in show where people call in, and every night he  interacts with people in the most amazing, hilarious way, and characters emerge. It's terrific.  He sells comedy albums with his partner, John Worster, who is the drummer in the band Super  Chunk under the label Sharpling and Worster, and he also is a director of music videos.  I had this idea to do a video using this song by They Might Be Giants based on this character  that we created for one of their previous projects, The Deranged Millionaire. Tom was  the director, and he had this idea since celebrity cameos are becoming so common in music videos and  book trailers and that sort of thing, he said we should get everyone we know. Just reach out  and ask every favor we've ever, you know, cash in on every favor we've ever done and get as many  famous people as possible and put them in one room and just have the camera scanned by them,  such that your character, The Deranged Millionaire, doesn't even care  that Brooke Shields and Jack McBrayer and Scott Adzit and John Lutz from 30 Rock and  Questlove from The Roots and Vernon Reed from Living Color and Dick Cavett and Justin Long  and all sorts of other incredible people who gave their time up to just sit there and have the camera  just waft over them briefly. It was the greatest, it was one of the most amazing things of my life.

Transcript:  It has. I did the presales thing with the box and the special editions and the signed copies  and everything. So before it was even released, I sold enough to cover the expenses of the album  and make a little bit of a profit. And then it's been selling really well. I hired a publicist and  some more traditional stuff this time around just to see what would happen.  Oh, interesting.  I'm a scientist.  Right.  And one of the interesting things that happened was my team said, hey, how come you don't have  big numbers on SoundScan? And I said, yeah, I never report to SoundScan. SoundScan is the  Nielsen company where the numbers come from for the Billboard charts. And they said, well,  you should maybe report just to see what would happen. Because if things line up with the touring  and the shipping of presales and the release, you could get a relatively big number. And  we did that. And it ended up actually charting on Billboard, which was crazy.  You made like three different charts.  Well, yeah, it was the number one heat seeker one week.

I mean, I really just never had reported before because I figured,  I wasn't going to make a dent there. But it just goes to show you how much the music industry is

Start time: 4230.80
End time: 4256.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  kind of in the toilet right now. No, I don't think so at all. When you said the newsletter  explaining that, I had a revelation. I'm like, I wonder how many other successful independent  musicians are out there that aren't reporting to SoundScan and what that would do to the total  digital music number. Everybody says, oh, digital music's in the toilet. It's not making up  the difference. I still don't think it would make up all the difference.  But I think the sales would appear stronger if we had better reporting.

Start time: 4257.66

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree with you. I think there's a lot of dark matter out there in terms of the economy of  the music business. It's like, who knows what's really happening? And that Spotify,  the numbers in Spotify are a great example. I think that right now there's an overemphasis  on the mainstream acts and the big label acts, whereas there's a lot of actual  economy happening in the independent space and we just don't see all of it, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, I was going to say the point was trying to make it because, you know,  it would have been an OK song, but it would have been a very trite song if it just said,  stop screwing because you're, you know, molesting my childhood.  Whatever it is, people always sound internet comment sections. But the greater point I thought  was that, as it says in the song, in its own way, it's just a snapshot of the time in which it was  made. And as you say, it's one thing to try and change it after the fact, but you shouldn't do that  and then completely ignore the existence of the original version because that original version  obviously meant something to a great many people. And you should honor that fact and keep that  version available. As we say in the song, there's lots of lyrics on a lot of songs that we've  written that listening to after the fact, you wish you could change. I'm betting Jonathan probably  feels the same way, but it's not like we go back to the Masters and then, you know, it's a lyric  or re-record a line and eliminate all evidence of the original recording of it. It's just,  it was there and it was what we at the time and you have to just, I think, step that fact and move on.
