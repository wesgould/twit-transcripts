Yeah, he didn't like this guy at all really  Well, he's not liked what's going on y'all for a while and you can't really blame him right because the stock has been dead money  And this guy's got a lot of it. So he now was the one who said you got to get rid of Thompson  He's won and in fact, he gets three board seats  He had proposed as part of a proxy fight he had proposed three new board seats  One of his selections Jeff sucker actually he proposed for one of them Jeff sucker from NBC former NBC  Had will not take that seat but media executive Michael wolf and turnaround specialist Harry Wilson will join the board  The interesting thing to me is that Thompson?  You know he was part of this big restructuring fired what a couple of thousand Yahoo employees and was really refocusing Yahoo to be more  less about a media content company more about commerce and data and  Now you got the new CEO as a media guy again, so we're whip  I think we're gonna be whipsawed again back to Terry Semmel.

He's actually showing investors. He doesn't care that much  He's going to be him, but I think that's a mark of immaturity  I think he has to realize he's bringing investors in as a new constituency right now  And and this is where he goes deadly wrong.

They go on their Facebook comm they pay for Facebook credits with words with friends and  Let's say you were able to log into your Facebook account on the iPhone app and it says oh you've already paid for this

Start time: 2497.56
End time: 2517.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's several things that Facebook they might get pure revenue  They encourage people to use Facebook connect developers to use Facebook connect which puts people in the fake-ass book ecosystem  And they may even make money on in-app  Credits or purchases through some sense. They take very people and get the 30% there now  You said there's two ways that they're monetizing. What was the other way that they announced?

Start time: 2518.63

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is this paid to promote?  Back to the app center. I mean, okay Apple has taken you know since  Our ported story that Apple has gotten  1.7 billion dollars in revenue from the app store. So if there's an obvious business there  And that's something, you know investors might be excited about with Facebook launching this last week  Or you know talking about it last week and about that's why they do all this stuff right running up to the IPO  And and another you know potential revenue stream is they're testing  this ability to  You know write a status update and then pay to have it  highlighted featured highly in your friends  That is so annoying

Start time: 2565.56
End time: 2575.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Start time: 2606.08
End time: 2633.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so you these are an auction kind of a thing or I'm not totally familiar with it  But I I believe it works that way now the issue the other issue is that we just learned that for the first time ever  Most Facebook users more than half are now using it on mobile not on the desktop  Mm-hmm, which is more difficult to monetize  So Facebook does have to turn on things like this, right?  Because this is a way to make money without an ad a display ad, right?

Start time: 2633.30
End time: 2651.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean it looks a lot more like Twitter's advertising and Twitter has  Almost always been Twitter's got the same company. Yeah, and so they you know, they need to think about ways ad units that will translate  to small screens and  I think Facebook is starting to identify that

Start time: 2672.92
End time: 2706.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So these are the negatives in the in the IPO. Yeah, potential  I think that it would be foolish for Facebook to rely on advertising for its revenue  There's a lot of ways they can monetize all this information that they have about us that there's a lot of ways that I think  This pay to promote is a very interesting idea. We can expect them to try a lot of stuff. Look at beacon  they try stuff and  Beacon was a horrible failure and  They pulled it out and they apologize they paid a fine and moved on and I'm sure that we'll see a lot more things like  That some of them may go over the line as beacon did.

Start time: 4093.60
End time: 4127.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just I searched for Justin Bieber and this is what I got which is exactly what you'd want  I presume on Facebook, but I know exactly we were talking about Joanna which and partly that's because  Facebook is in this weird position where a lot of this data was supposed to be private and  So I don't know how they search because they they can see they could see everything but you are not supposed to see everything  So I guess they would condition the search results with okay. What's public? What's not public?  What's what's Leo allowed to see what's Joanna allowed to see and I don't know  I think I'd see their problem there, right? They don't have an open database. They want an open database

Start time: 4127.56
End time: 4167.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They don't have one Microsoft is facing that. I mean I talked some of their engineers  They're facing that same problem  Yeah  trying to personalize search and and  Being partnered so closely with Facebook being able to use their data  But only being able to use what Facebook says they can use and it's you know  You can only get access to what?  you would have access to on Facebook in terms of what you can see from your friends, but  Microsoft can't get access to  Say the newsfeed rankings, so it doesn't know who your closest friends are as Facebook has ranked them  And in that respect Facebook would have a pretty significant advantage if they were to do a search and that's by the way

I guess it's called so  Cl or social which was Microsoft's like  Research project on on search like they were trying to make search social and sharing your searches  And I don't know if anything ever happened with that like they did open it up  But I live in there if there's gonna be some sort of tie-in with that as well

Start time: 4227.22
End time: 4259.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is a difficult  problem to solve right because  It's clear that search alone is less valuable than it used to be that more and more if you could if you could massage it with  Location if you're searching for a restaurant locations useful  And maybe some social signals if you're searching for restaurant  Maybe what your friends think about the restaurant is useful  But I hear people complain people bitch about it all the time saying  I don't want to know what John thinks about a restaurant see I would want to know what John thinks about wine  About wine, but I might not want to know what John thinks about high life front ons so those

Transcript:  Do well I guess it also it's an issue of trust isn't do we trust being  No, do we trust any new companies?  Well that you know that's an inch Neil I Patel writes a very interesting article on the verge about all of this and  in the context of the new g-drive terms of service because Google did this is a little bit of an old story, but I think  It's kind of germane to all of this Google did  You know what every company does when they write a terms of service  They say we reserve the rights to copy modify distribute in any form your data  But they also said right before that, but we're not asserting a right to own it  we just say in order to give you what you want like document sharing we have to put this legal ease in here and  Neel I writes a very you know there as a result of course everybody's freaking out saying I'm not gonna use  Google Drive because they want it they're gonna publish my data publicly even though Google's very clear  We can't we don't want to that's not the point  We just have to put this language in  Neel I then analyzes what Dropbox says what Microsoft says for sky drive and for all these other services  They all say pretty much the same thing he says it's interesting Dropbox attempts to make it friendly  They use the word stuff where what are we gonna do with your stuff?  And he says because it's friendly and vague it may actually be more risky because they're not as clear not as precise in their language  But what they can and cannot do it may be in fact even though you get scared by this Google agreement that it's a better  Agreement for you than the Dropbox agreement, but he finally goes on to say  Ultimately doesn't matter. What's in the terms of service. It's who do you trust and if you're gonna use cloud services?  And I would submit the same thing if you're gonna use search  Who do you trust is what really comes down to it because you don't want search results polluted by you know  Maybe I you gave him a couple of bucks so his results a little bit higher

I'll sign up  It I mean this is exactly this is how it but you know  I don't know if that's a bad thing because I think for the most part they're fairly trustworthy  And certainly people are paying attention in terms of trust Dropbox got in a lot of trouble when people realized that they they had the keys  to the encrypted data on your on your Dropbox, so there's two companies that do the

Do I hold it on my arm?  That's my that's my point and my point is that it's going to get very confusing I think for  What is supported on these arm tablets these RT tablets versus?  Windows Intel tablets right because there are certain things that will not work right well and

Start time: 5103.68
End time: 5133.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Explaining that becomes very hard that and that's exactly the issue  Which is that Microsoft says if you're going to put apps on our tablets the windows on arm tablets  You have to use Metro only as your interface there will not be you will not be able to use a desktop app  You will not be able to sell a desktop app  We will not put a desktop app on our tablets so Mozilla and Chrome are saying but wait a minute  How am I gonna do Firefox you have act and this is where the anti-competitive issue is you have this is where the really?  Big debate goes

Start time: 5143.40
End time: 5192.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly and if you have a desktop you can use desktop apps. You know if you have Windows 8 on a desktop  You're not stuck with Metro  It's only on Windows on arm, but it but it's gonna get back to this Department of Justice action in  1998 against Microsoft  Where they got to get in trouble because they bundled the browser remember and they said no no you have to make sure that there's  A competitive landscape for other browsers and here Microsoft is shipping a tablet that in fact  Will only run Internet Explorer now Microsoft's point of view on this is well. We don't have monopolies  Status in the tablet and they never will and they never will at this rate  But I think that that's not what that's not what the the whole issue is the issue of monopolies  Are you using your monopoly in one market to give you other you know to give you leverage in other markets?
