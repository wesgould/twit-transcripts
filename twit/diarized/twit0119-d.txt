Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Every few minutes I try to connect to him.  OK.  Well he'll come on later.  So let's get to the news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The news of course one of the big stories which happened on Friday Apple puts Leopard on sale  OS 10 10.5 6 o'clock.  And believe it or not once again lines at the Apple store not necessary.  Anybody could walk in at any time and get a copy of Leopard still.  In fact if you go to Copy USA I'm told it's 99 bucks instead of 129 bucks.  I installed it as soon as I was able to get a copy from Apple on Thursday and I've been  loving it.  I have to say this is right.  I think Leopard is what Vista auto have been.  It's reliable.  The upgrade is very smooth.  Some people have been reporting problems with the upgrade.  If you do the default just upgrade on top of the old operating system but an archive  and install fixes that.  It has some nice new features.  It's the time machine backup is very impressive.  Don and I were talking before we began about spaces which is their workspace which I'm  not a big fan of workspaces but it but it works doesn't it Don.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you know it is really you know it's a multiple workspaces where you you know your  screen can you have as many screens as you want and you just go from one screen to the  other.  And so I'll have my for instance I'll have all my Internet stuff on one screen my my  screen shades of tasks switching.  It's kind of it is basically it is but it's somehow this works in ways that I don't think  it did work.  I've tried many different workspace programs on OS 10 and this is the one first time I've  ever really liked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah you know and one of the nicest features that I found was when it let's say you click  on something on your desktop and you can even do it in cover flow you can do it in cover  flow but you click on it and hit the spacebar and it shows you a nice little picture of  it in full screen and it's really nice.  That's a quick look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact not only do you see the first page but you'll see if you have a presentation  a Microsoft Office document you can see all the subsequent pages you get a preview of  the whole document.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll tell you what they did a nice job at this operating system space like you said  spaces is great.  I use I see you know you can go up to 16 spaces but to be honest I think it's a little little  hairy after 10.  How many do you use 10?  No I tried 10 and it didn't work out too well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm using the default four and I guess I could use six maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What would you need all those spaces?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what's most useful on a laptop where you don't have a lot of screen real estate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly yeah I put on my iMac my 24 inch iMac so on that one I have I think four or six  but yeah you know like you said in small a small MacBook or something like that I can  see you using eight easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other thing that I think makes a big difference is you can assign applications to a space  so they automatically go there when you launch them and that was the problem I've had with  other multi-screen interfaces before is that you kind of had to do a lot of organization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This way how many applications would you have running in each of these spaces that they  couldn't just be standalone apps running in one space and and reduced in size minimized  as it were and you click through them that way I don't see what the advantage of this  is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could do that it's just kind of a little faster to have it already open and running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now is it running in the background can I have like two compilers going back there?  Yeah.  On two different spaces?  In fact that's one thing that-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought the same thing.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry I thought the same thing and as soon as I started using it I just loved it.  I thought what am I going to use this for?  Yeah it just works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree I agree.  The new Leopard is 64-bit and does a much better job with multi-processing the finder  is much faster everything seems a lot snappier I think that's really it's things like that  really that are more significant in an OS upgrade but the I think the thing that-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's snappier than the old-  Oh yeah.  Let me get this straight hold on a second stop everything.  So you're telling me it's snappier than the old version?  You bet.  Well you know what I think Microsoft could learn from them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No kidding.  On a power PC with less than a gig it will be slower but on any Intel Mac and I include  my original core single core Macbook it runs very well I have to say it's much faster than  it was before.  It also has really great remote access features the file sharing and the back to my Mac which  allows you if you're on a Mac to connect to other Macs across the internet works very  well I think they're using VNC I was told they're using IPsec so it's a very secure  tunnel be good for VPNing the only thing I don't like about that is that they require  you either have NAT PMP installed or use UPNP because it has to do a lot of router configuration  to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah there goes half the audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well no it does it automatically but it's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm talking about this discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No people love this stuff the more geeky we get John the more they love it don't you know  that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think we should you know why don't we do the following let's just say if you have a  Mac or if you're thinking to get a Mac you should get this operating system no questions  asked there's nothing more we can say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's go even further and say if you have a Windows box it's time to get a Mac it's  really that nice.  I hate to say it but it's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right now that's what I recommend to people.  People ask me what should I get and I always say I tell them right now I mean I hate to  even I use PCs mostly myself but I say get a Mac.  I mean why go through the aggravation it's kind of silly at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a few reasons you might want to use a PC it's better for gaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't think of more than maybe I can't think of one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's better for gaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gaming.  Oh yeah no for gaming yeah sure but that's a specialized machine that's a different story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's business apps you need but of course you could run those on Windows in emulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can run all the business apps on the Mac.  Only games the only thing the only gotcha is the game thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd say and maybe you're right I should be more forward I say Windows for business Mac  for the home in general.  Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No you don't even say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No.  You say all business should be going.  The other day I was giving a talk and a guy says what should I you know what should I  guess why you should probably get a Mac.  He said I got to upgrade all my machines in my company.  I said how many workstations you guys has 10 I said just go with a Mac.  Why go through the aggravation.  He says oh my god this is my wife will be giving me nothing but crap because she's been  recommending this for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's really why the switching hasn't happened is because people don't want to admit that  they've been wrong all this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now if you're like you know myself and I got a lot of PC gear I write for PC magazine I  talk about PC stuff and I like to moan and groan about Microsoft and everybody else by  that.  I mean there's no reason not you know if you're if you're if you have any skills like you  like we all do.  Yeah PC is not a big deal.  We know how to run virus scanners and all the rest of it.  I'm talking about the guy on the street the average new guy or some guy who's a bonehead  which is 99 percent of the users.  They don't read computer magazines.  They don't get virus scanners.  They don't get you're right.  They just get a Mac and get it over with until somebody attacks that platform and then it's  a different story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well you know according to by the way Apple and Microsoft had great results but let me  just focus real quickly on Apple's quarterly results.  They sold more Macs last quarter than they've ever sold 400000 more Macs than they'd ever  sold something like two and a half million Macs.  Their profits were through the roof.  But here's the interesting stat from this quarterly report.  They're a couple actually I thought they were quite interesting.  One is that half of the new buyers at the Apple stores half of the people going in there  to buy Macs not the new buyers all buyers are new to Mac.  They're either coming from the Windows platform or have never owned a computer half.  So I think the switch is starting to happen.  The other thing I thought was very interesting is they admitted that about a quarter million  of the iPhones sold 1.6 iPhone sold million iPhones sold about a quarter million of them  were never activated and are very likely unlocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah well at least some people have some brains which brings us to another story.  Eight hundred thirty one bucks.  Yeah why don't you tell us this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think this is this is from an analyst to Piper Jaffray published in the New York Times  So I give it some credence.  He says the deal Apple made with AT&T gives them 18 bucks a month from the AT&T fees.  That means that Apple besides making the 400 bucks up front on the iPhone makes another  431 dollars over the two year contract.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No 831 over two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's 831 bucks over two years including the 400 bucks in the iPhones or the 399 in the  iPhone purchase.  So Apple those quarter million unlocked phones are costing Apple a pretty penny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So basically the dummies who buy these iPhones are spending twelve hundred dollars for the  phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now wait a minute any phone you buy you're going to have a two year activation and you're  going to be spending that kind of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No not the phones I buy.  Yeah because you buy burners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're like a drug dealer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No I'm like a sensible person.  The only reason the drug dealers buy these things is because they can't afford to have  phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No because they for security so they're not being they can afford phones.  I think they can afford phones Josh.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So avoid wire tabs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't you watch the wire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was misled but whatever the case is they.  Well that's another good reason to have these things if you can't be traced.  I mean who wants somebody dogging your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just go down to the streets of Oakland and you'll see cell phones on the gutters everywhere.  Just thrown away burners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what these phones are worth.  They're cheap and they but sure is a lot cheaper than paying twelve hundred bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  I think this seems awful.  That's what those service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think 18 bucks a month is not what Apple's getting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No you know there's no way anyone knows to be honest with you but you know I may be in  the beginning but over time are they really paying 18 dollars per per over the course  of a two year agreement.  This analyst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  24 months.  Gene Munster this analyst says he's he's pored over Apple's financial statements gone over  it with a fine tooth comb and he believes he's got the smoking gun that proves it's  18 dollars a month.  I'm no CPA.  I can't I can't tell but I'm sure he's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well that's why Verizon turned their backs on Apple.  And you know what it's been to AT&T's benefit.  It's their number one selling phone.  I think they estimated about a third of all the people who buy iPhones are new customers  to AT&T.  So remember Apple's getting 18 bucks but AT&T is getting 42 bucks at least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah so we're not only like getting ripped off on the phones but we're also supporting  a crummy company.  Unresponsive company like AT&T.  Good work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you see the story.  It's a great story.  Unfortunately it's it's it's not a real story anymore.  But during the fires in the Southland a couple was on their honeymoon the house burned down  terrible.  They got a bill from AT&T for the cable box or the dish saying you know it's pay up immediately

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  because you lost the day or else they asked them if they could wait for their insurance  to pay for it.  And the AT&T spokesperson said no pay now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now AT&T's backpedaled a little bit.  They said oh that was a customer service rep who didn't know what he was doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But oh yeah they backpedaled because it got on the news.  Yeah that's exactly right.  That's the only reason they backpedaled.  Give me a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The customer service rep was reading right out of the book I guarantee it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah that's all they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He made it up.  Oh no let me make up a policy.  Yeah give it to us.  We want the money.  They're not they're not freelancing like that I don't think.  So Apple's great results very good results.  Microsoft excellent results.  In fact the Microsoft stock both Apple and Microsoft stock at new highs.  It was a good quarter for PC manufacturers.  Why was Microsoft stock up John?  You've been you've been harping on the weakness of Microsoft stock for years now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No I've been harping on the weakness of Microsoft.  I actually think I actually think that the stock is undervalued because it hasn't moved  for the last five years.  It's probably not a bad bad thing to buy.  And I've also changed my tune on what I think Microsoft's going to become.  I'm thinking because you know they're so derivative.  I wrote this column for MarketWatch describing this.  They're so derivative that they're always trying to copy somebody else and who is Bill  Gates' best friend?  Warren Buffett.  And what does Warren Buffett do?  He's basically just a full time investor with Berkshire Hathaway.  They just buy the companies and sell companies.  Essentially a giant holding company.  And Microsoft can do this just as easily as Buffett.  And there's no reason that they won't.  And that's what I think they're going to end up becoming.  And that's why I say some of the stuff you've been hearing with Balmer and some of these  other guys talking about making more money in advertising 50 percent of their revenues  could come from advertising.  It sounds like they're already starting to downplay their core business and they're  starting to think about other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Get out of operating systems and get into Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's what they keep saying.  I'm just listening to what he says and this is what he's going on about.  They want to become another Google and I think they're going to become another Berkshire  Hathaway.  And look at this Vista thing.  Although they say they've done well, they got sued by that big chain in England for  40 million dollars saying that nobody's buying Vista.  And yeah, Microsoft sells a lot of Vistas because people have to put it on, they bundle  it.  But for the most part, this operating system is a joke compared to what Apple just came  out with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'll like this news story that just came out of The Independent in the UK, which is  a reliable newspaper.  The British Educational and Technological Agency, Becta, is warning schools, don't buy  Microsoft software because of Microsoft's anti-competitive practices.  They're concerned the talks are going so badly with the Office of Fair Trade that these programs  may be pulled.  They're saying also the interoperability with existing software is going to be a problem.  The Watchdog reminded schools they must by law have licenses for software but urged them  to look for a perpetual deal that did not involve extra costs.  In the interim, our advice to schools considering moving to Microsoft's school agreement subscription  licensing model is they should not do so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I've never...  Microsoft's been hated for years now.  But in the last five years, and especially even this year, I've never seen anything so  bad, such a PR nightmare for one company.  First you have Vista and it's a flop.  Not necessarily a flop yet, but it's a disaster like John said.  Then you have this issue.  Like you said, the left side's not talking to the right.  Half of the time they're talking about how wonderful Vista is, how wonderful the company's  doing.  The other time they're talking about, oh, the next Windows is going to be great, Windows  7, blah, blah, blah, blah.  What's going on?  It's just falling apart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't you think, though, it's just pile on?  Everybody hates a winner.  We build you up, then we knock you down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't think it's that?  Well, I mean, Google's a winner.  No one hates them yet.  They will.  It's just a matter of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's not...  Now, Microsoft's winning days are over.  It's not that everyone hates a winner.  Everybody hates a company that's unresponsive and then they're arrogant and they have all  these issues.  It's not just being a winner.  Everybody hates a winner.  I think that's true.  People love winners.  I mean, the Dallas Cowboys were America's team.  People love the Boston Red Sox.  These are winners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, and I think if anything speaks to that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, go Sox, go Sox.  We're recording this before the game, but I would love to see the Sox sweep.  I think, you know, it's going to be hard for them not to sweep.  No?  Don, you're not a Sox fan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, I'm from New York.  I'm a Yankees fan.  Come on.  Oh, I'm so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Yankees, are they still have a baseball team?  Barely.  Oh, I think they do.  Hey, I got a question for you, Mr. Yankees fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, here we go.  I'm going to get dinged again.  You should never have said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, I mean, some years ago, there was a team in Florida that got into the World Series  and then they won.  The Marlins.  The Marlins.  Yeah, that's the name of them.  And they had a big pitcher named Josh Beckett, who was just a total stopper in two games.  There was nobody could touch him.  Beckett, of course, they broke up the team and Beckett went elsewhere and started floating  around.  Over some years later, the Boston Red Sox picked him up and now he's the stud of the  year.  Why didn't the Yankees in all those years notice this guy and put him on their staff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're too busy spending money on garbage is what the problem is.  They're spending money on Kevin Brown and Drainie Johnson and the rest of those losers.  And I'll be honest with you, I just don't understand it.  They're just a bunch of...  I just don't know where that team's going, but I'm still going to love them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How can you...  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody loves a winner.  How can you love the Yankees?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They bought in all of these World Series, one after the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Most of the time they wasted their money, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then half the time they do it stupidly.  Exactly.  How could you love the Yankees?  I don't get it.  He's a local boy.  I got to do what I got to do.  Love the Mets.  They're the underdogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In the 90s, it wasn't like that.  That's where I was really...  Oh, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So did you like that thing that was done on ESPN with the Yankees story from the 70s with  the Reggie Jackson character and the rest of them?  Yeah, I watched that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was interesting.  After October.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Did you watch it?  Yeah, he said he did.  I haven't seen it, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought it was just hilarious because I was...  What happened?  What's the gist of it?  Oh, is that Billy Martin was a psychopath?  He was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He beat up a toilet.  Beat it into submission.  Just killed it.  Dead.  Actually, it was the little urinal in the dugout, right?  Yeah.  Anyway, back to Microsoft.  They did have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look, they had a good quarter.  They had a very good quarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They always have a good quarter.  They're in really good shape and the Xbox is doing well.  They are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Xbox is making money for the first time ever.  $300 million worldwide for Halo in its opening week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Their revenues for the quarter, $1.93 billion on Xbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think Microsoft really gets gaming.  More than anything else, what we've learned is they know how to win at gaming because  they go after software developers.  They don't ostracize them like Nintendo does.  They know what they're doing in gaming.  If they can do that everywhere else, then they'd be okay.  But obviously...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they can't obviously do it anywhere else at all because that's not the way the  company operates.  But let's bring up one point that you make.  It wasn't until last week, because I was like a big Xbox supporter and I've been following  the Xbox story from the get-go.  And so the Xbox 360 arcade comes out, right?  To be honest about it, until I was reading an article mid last week, I didn't realize  that this was a little box.  I thought it was a game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's not a game for the Xbox 360?  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's an old...  Oh, see, you're in the same boat I am.  This is how bad they're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought it was something I could buy for my...  It's a Wii clone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a bad name then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a totally bad name.  It's a completely bad name because when I first heard it, I thought Xbox 360 arcade.  Oh, okay.  It's going to be some sort of a game package with a bunch of arcades.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I can play Pac-Man on my Xbox 360.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  See, you were thinking the same thing I was thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a separate console?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, I'm pretty sure it replaced the core bundle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's still an Xbox 360.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's a little Wii.  It's designed for the Wii market.  Well, it's a cheap Xbox 360.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think it goes for like $279 or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a cheap little machine designed to attack the Wii market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, somebody's got to.  Nintendo is just on fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Microsoft doesn't...  They've already made noise about the fact that they're not going to compete with the  creative gaming, new gaming ideas of Nintendo.  And instead they're going to license a bunch of...  Pac-Man will save us.  They're going to license a bunch of cartoon characters from Disney and elsewhere and think  that's going to draw the kids in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, licensing has been the death of gaming time and time again.  The only licensing that's ever worked in gaming has been Major League Sports.  Every time they license a...  I mean, look at James Bond.  None of this stuff is any good.  Harry Potter maybe.  All right, Harry Potter might have been a little bit of a success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what else was...  Knights of the Old Republic was big at that time.  What was that based on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that a movie?  No, was it Star Wars?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  Oh, Star Wars.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the Star Wars stuff hasn't been too bad.  All right, I take it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's not that good either, not compared to the original games.  It's not Halo 3.  It's not Halo 3.  Yeah, Halo 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  Yeah.  Nothing's Halo 3.  So let's see.  Moving on.  The U.S. tops the list, Mr. I Get No Spam, of spam offending countries according to  which Friday released its quarterly report on the dirty dozen, the countries that send  the most spam.  The U.S. is responsible for 28.4% of all spam, then South Korea 5%, China 4%, Russia 4%, and  Brazil 3.7%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but you got to remember for people out there.  It's not coming from us.  This doesn't mean that we're the guys that are...  Right.  That doesn't mean we're the originators of the spam.  the fact that these are the zombie bot machines that have infected the...  That's worse.  That's why I tell people to buy a Macintosh.  It's worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're not making any money on it.  They're just using us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  So these are the people that have their machines robotized by these spam guys because they're  stupidly downloaded of Trojan Horse and clicked on yes to install.  And the next thing you know, their machine at night...  By the way, people, turn your machines off at night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, really?  Is that the key?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that going to solve it all?  I think that's the main key, yeah.  If you keep the machine off when you're not using it, it's not going to start sending  spam out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you guys see the guy...  I think he's worth 47% of the Viagra spam in the world.  He was killed by the Russian mafia.  Good.  Yeah.  Because he'd had an erection for four years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Call his doctor.  That'll do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That'll do it.  It's like the joke I heard a comedian says.  He says, if you have an erection lasting for more than four hours, call your doctor.  And the guy says, call my doctor?  I'm going to call everybody I know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they killed him for what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.  They never really got into it.  I guess it was some spat with the Russian mafia, and I guess they're really into cyber  crimes the Russian mafia is.  And he did something to piss them off.  The next thing he knows, he had a bullet lodged in the back of his brain.  I guess that's the calling card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The guys you don't want to mess with are the Chechens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Those guys.  I don't think I want to mess with any of them.  I don't think you want to mess with any of them.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not so worried about the Russian mafia.  It's the Chechens that worry me.  Hey, ladies and gentlemen.  Yeah.  I didn't say that.  That was Will Harris talking.  Will Harris joining us from Oxford, England.  I'm sorry.  Did I wake you, Will?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  You know what?  The time difference just changed.  Oh, I forgot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Our clocks don't go back.  Yours do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ours do.  So I completely got the timing wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thanks to the genius of the US government who is trying to save energy, we don't set  our clocks back till next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  So we can have a nice Halloween night where all the kids, it's daylight.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  It's dark at three in the afternoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, that's after.  No, Halloween is going to be before we switch the clocks.  Right.  Oh, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what?  I think the fact that nobody ever understands the time change signals the fact that maybe  we should do something about it.  Totally.  The thing is, you never learned, do you?  I mean, how old are you guys?  I'm trying to figure this out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Every year you do it and every year you don't know.  So you're right, John.  They would have more darkness because it's instead of six o'clock, it's five o'clock  and it's pitch black.  I get it.  So it would be better for Halloween, except we don't really want Halloween to be longer  and darker, do we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's always been traditionally.  I mean, there's only this year that it's going to be one hour more of sunlight.  Right.  So I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  More daily use, you're just egging your house.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Will, you missed our discussion of Leopard just at the early part, but I just out of  curiosity, was there a big line in Britain at Leopard Popular?  Did you install it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they had the Apple Store closed down and then reopened at six o'clock and there  was a bit of a queue outside.  What is that about?  Do you know what I have?  I even had a chance to install it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you haven't?  Well, Don and I have both concluded we love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but is there that much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, no, we're not starting the discussion over.  Hey, but there is something, Will.  What was the story we talked about earlier, Leo, where something is going on in England?  Oh, yeah, the schools and Microsoft.  Are you following?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Bekta has told the schools in Britain, don't buy the Microsoft education subscription  package.  We're not sure we're even going to be able to support Microsoft if this adding Microsoft  to the prosecution goes forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They really don't like here in Europe, you know, Microsoft get a kicking, don't they?  A lot of American companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's funny because in America, we've gone through this since 1998 and it's kind  of all been settled.  And now it's just started up again for Microsoft with the EU.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's pretty harsh.  I think these guys should be looking at Google closer than Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why?  I have to say, Microsoft is not the evil giant that it was in 1998.  I mean, they're they're they're less of a monopoly.  They're they're monopolistic practices seem to have gone away.  Ha ha.  They're not doing those evil OEM deals anymore.  Oh, they can't.  They're more like the Russians and Google's like the Chechens now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is Google doing bad that you think they should be watched closely?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, what's Google doing?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ha ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, don't get me wrong.  I love Google.  I drink the Kool-Aid like everybody else.  But it does seem like the privacy stuff is is something to keep an eye on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The problem I have with Google is they are so good at offering us stuff we want that  we just go like lambs to the slaughter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Google, I'll put I'll give you all my data.  Just give me IMAP.  I'm a Gmail account.  Anything you want.  I love you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You guys will get upgraded this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't.  I keep waiting.  I'm excited.  I want IMAP.  What?  Google has added IMAP to Gmail.  Yeah, I know.  Who cares?  That is the most geeky.  People kept saying in the chat room on the radio show and the radio show is a general  purpose show for everybody.  They keep saying when you're going to talk about IMAP on Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I said, I don't think anybody even knows what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the Twitter audience does.  And I think it's you know, I pay right now.  I pay fast mail.  What do I pay?  Like 30 or 40 bucks a month.  No, I'm sorry.  A year.  A year.  I'm sorry for IMAP.  And I would love to have it on on Gmail.  Plus for things like the iPhone, it'll be a real boom.  Hey Leo?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  Why?  Why are you paying for any email?  You never answer your email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like a storage locker.  You just pay 30 bucks and you tidy it away.  And let me tell you something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If the new mail on Leopard, you know, it has a bunch of new features.  One of the things is it allows you to make notes as your, and really the notes are basically  I think draft messages.  But if you're on an IMAP account, it stores them on IMAP.  So they're available everywhere.  I love that.  And the to do lists.  I like the new mail a lot actually.  But I know I don't have it.  Do you have IMAP on your Gmail, Will?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I put it on my iPhone and it's rocking.  Brilliant.  No complaints.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like IMAP.  How about you, Don?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just forward my mail from Gmail to my real account and then let that be an IMAP account  run by somebody privately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you're using POP.  But see, now you can use IMAP.  You wouldn't have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I'm not using POP.  I don't use POP.  I use IMAP.  And I use Squirrel Mail to get my mail 90% of the time on the web.  And I do it through Mark Perkel's computer time down here.  And he's the one who keeps me from getting spam.  I use Pine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's how I do it.  Mark Perkel, you get no spam.  See, maybe if I got no spam, I'd answer my email.  I actually wrote a I wrote a big page on my blog that explains why you shouldn't send  me an email.  Emailing it pretty much resolves down to because I'm not going to read it and I'm not going  to answer it.  Hasn't you know what's weird?  People still see they read that and they still send me mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's weird.  Is it true that you don't read your email?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't read it and I don't answer it.  So don't send me email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did anyone else get inundated with PayPal messages?  Yesterday, I got 500 PayPal messages to my account and I was wondering what is going  on here?  Has anyone else get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you know, it's funny how spam goes in waves like that.  And I don't know.  It's like you got on a list all of a sudden.  All of a sudden, I'm getting a lot of Nigerian 419 scams, but they're I love those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I get those too a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But these are these are new ones.  They're actually.  Yeah, no, save them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Save them. Save them.  I'm collecting them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'll send them to you.  Yeah, I mean, they're clever.  Now they're coming from Canada and they sound more reasonable.  You know, you know, you almost want to you almost want to fall for them.  You almost almost.  But I but I could make a lot of money.  If only it was a thousand dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I won the lottery.  Unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who'd have sunk it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I also believe she might stay with me if my member gets larger.  So there you go. I don't know.  And.  I'm just looking, I'm looking right now through my email.  That's where that came from.  Let me see if I can find you some of these 419s.  Actually, why is Symantec getting in my spam bucket?  I think Google does a pretty good job with spam, but for some reason,  the the 419 scams seem to get through a lot.  Is the PayPal stuff on your Google account, Don, or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, yeah, Gmail. Yeah, there you go.  There you have it. So much for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Next.  I'm looking through it here.  Trying to find some good 419s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll save them for next time.  I'll save them for next time.  You're going to like this.  Well, first of all, we talked about the Internet tax and good news.  The House of Representatives, it down to the wire at the last minute.  They extended the Internet tax moratorium in the US for seven years,  which is kind of a good compromise.  So seven more years, no tax.  John, you'll be happy about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm happy. I'm sure you're disappointed, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think we need more taxation. Right.  Because it builds roads.  It protects our society.  It helps pay our elective officials who work so hard for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got a pot.  A bottle out in front of my house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, John, can you convince me last week, or two weeks ago, John,  I am now anti-tax.  That and the fact that I had to write a massive check to the federal government  on October 15th.  The Court of Appeals, get this, get this.  The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit  issued a ruling last week approving the FCC's new order  eliminating the requirement  that large phone companies provide access to independent  ISPs at set nondiscriminatory rates.  It's the end of the independent ISP in the US.  Essentially, the FCC ruled and the court upheld  unbelievably that the big telcos could just say to an independent ISP,  no, it's going to cost you three times more to offer DSL  than we have to, than we charge.  That's it for the independent ISPs.  I'm just devastated.  I don't know why this didn't get more coverage.  I'm actually reading this in the register, which is a British website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't hear about it until today myself.  Somehow it got under the radar.  It should be people should be squawking like there's no tomorrow about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I use an independent ISP.  I use, in fact, two different independent ISPs at home.  I have sonic.net, I have DSL Extreme here.  That's what we're using in the office.  Both these guys are going to be in big trouble because up to now,  they've been protected by the FCC, the phone company  who provides the copper into the house has had to give them access  to the central office, allow them to put their DSL switches in there  and had and given them a reasonable cost so that they could provide  competitive services.  But now there's nothing to make the phone company  give them competitive prices.  And they could say, well, no, if you want to put your switch in our office,  it's going to cost you, you know, 180 bucks a customer.  And this means we're all going to our choices are going to dwindle.  And by the way, this works really nicely with the whole move by big ISPs  towards blocking things like BitTorrent.  Folks, pay attention to this stuff.  If all of a sudden you can't download Leopard via BitTorrent next month,  you'll know why it's the FCC.  Wait a minute, that didn't come out right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it is the FCC. They suck.  This FCC combined with the public utilities  commissions that don't do anything is a disaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What about Oink? Now, this is a this guy's a Brit, right, Will?  Yeah. Alan Ellis, he's 24 years old.  When he was 21, he created a invite only file sharing site called Oink.  That might have been his mistake, the name.  That's maybe where he went wrong.  He's been shut down.  He has 180,000 members are shut down on Tuesday  and is being prosecuted.  It's part of an Interpol led investigation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, come on, hasn't Interpol got something better to do?  Well, they're doing their track down 20 somethings, you know, sharing TV shows.  What about white slavery or something like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That might be more interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's really it's IFPA that's doing it, of course, the International Federation  of the Photographic Industry,  because it's the record companies are trying to get these  and the movie companies trying to get this guy shut down.  He says, I haven't done anything wrong.  I don't believe my website breaks the law.  They don't understand how it works.  It's a BitTorrent tracker.  The website is very different from how the police are making it out to be.  There are there is no music sold on the site.  I'm doing nothing wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's the same argument that, you know, people like the Pirate Bay  or anybody else use, which is we're not hosting downloadable content.  We're not hosting anything illegal.  We are pointing links to stuff.  It's a file finder.  The argument is that it's the same as Google.  You know, why not go after Google, which provides far more links to illegal content?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because Google's not named Oink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think there's more to the name.  Google's used for other things.  This is only used for that.  And I think that's how there's some point of law that that that applies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. In fact, remember the decision against I think it was Grokster and E-Donkey  where the US Supreme Court said it's in sentencing to piracy is illegal.  In other words, encouraging piracy is illegal.  You don't have to provide the file.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And let's not forget, I mean,  to a large extent, does it even matter if it was legal or not?  And in that, you know, they have these high power lawyers  that they can pay millions of dollars and he's just one guy.  Exactly. I mean, also, they shut him down.  What's he going to do? He's going to go out and just pay thousands,  hundreds of thousands of dollars to get his site back up for,  you know, for nothing, pretty much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got to like like the Pirate Bay guys, because of course, they come right in  and they say, OK, we'll take it over from here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're in sea. You can't get us here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is more of their war on the IFPI, isn't it?  After they hijacked their domain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These guys, you have to love Pirate Bay because they miss no opportunity  to immediately stick it to the guy.  They've renamed it Boink for Boink.  And it's Boink.CD, if you want to go there. Boink.CD.  I haven't gone there yet.  Now, I think if you are a Boink member, you might be a little nervous  because, of course, he's got logs of all one hundred eighty thousand members  and what they downloaded.  And that's kind of silly.  I'd be a little nervous if I were a Boink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you actually track what they downloaded or what they looked for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. That's a good question.  I don't know.  I think people who are only members are a little nervous,  but it's unknown.  It's unknown what's going to happen.  Have you gone to Boink.CD?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I can't get it up.  It doesn't come up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute. I've got an idea.  Spam just for you.  You're right. It doesn't come up.  Maybe that's an error.  Is there even a .CD domain?  I never heard of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go to Google and ask for Boink site.  Nowadays, everyone just goes to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  College sex by the people having it.  No, that's Boink.  Boink is a magazine of erotica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, Boink.  College sex by people having it.  Yeah, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute. Here it is.  Riding attire for women.  No, that can't be it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Boink Equestrian.  That's what you're looking at.  Yeah. Boink catalog dot com.  Celebrity pictures.  Progressive Boink at Sesame Street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess they haven't got Boink up yet.  Let me look at this.  It doesn't look like it's running.  You know, there is a there is a delay  between the time a new site pops up  and how quickly Google gets it, though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, that's not true.  Yeah, it is true.  But it's within hours, generally speaking,  if things start to hit it.  So it would be here if it was running.  I guarantee Google, unless they put a  unless they put a block on it, which could be,  which could be, you know, you can have a little  message to the robot saying, no, I don't want to be  tracked by Google and Google won't look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the robots dot text.  It's not up yet, Leo.  Yeah, it's just not up yet.  There is a dot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Log wire. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, there is a dot CD domain.  It's the it's the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow, this is interesting.  I use every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a very there's a there's a like a newspaper  for P2P people called  WWW P2P net dot net.  And they have all the information about this,  along with other stuff, it's actually quite a nice site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what do you think?  Did the does the guy deserve to be prosecuted?  He all he did is provide a tracker, a bit torrent.  Exactly.  But you know, you're going to be doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He doesn't deserve it.  But if you're going to be doing this stuff, he knows.  You're going to. Yeah, he knows what he's doing.  You know, unless you're in Sweden, you know, you're just asking for trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And also, you should know better than to keep logs of everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And people will use these things.  I want to say right now, if you're going to use these things,  unless you're just, you know, doing some like research for whatever reason,  like for whatever reason, if you're going to use these things,  find some systems out there that are anonymizing  that gets your IP and all the rest of it buried somewhere.  You know what I use? Or go to a friend's house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go to a friend's house. I do. I use my neighbors.  It's open Wi-Fi. I use my neighbors open Wi-Fi.  But I will point out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No one will ever figure that out, Leo.  You're safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what I do? I use the newsgroups.  The newsgroups are great.  And I use a newsgroup server, Easy News, that keeps no logs.  The problem with BitTorrent is it's you have a connection  IP to IP connection.  Your IP is perfectly visible to the person you're downloading from.  But the newsgroups know people post that stuff up there.  You download it as long as the newsgroup site does not keep logs.  You're safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, that reminds me of a lot of people still pirate music through the IRC.  The IRC has a number of like a number.  They have hundreds of music chat rooms, and everyone's populated  by maybe 50 to 100 or 200 people and people freely exchange music.  And I asked an IRC administrator once about this.  I said, you know, and this was during the heyday  where everyone's really freaked out about this.  Has anyone ever said anything to you about all these  chat rooms that are just for music swapping?  And he said, no, never.  No one's ever said anything to anybody.  We don't know about that.  And he says, yeah.  And he says, you know, if they'd say something, we'd probably take them down.  But nobody seems to care.  I guess the numbers are just too small because they're looking for the thousands  of, you know, rather than a few dozen jokers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're looking for the Jami Thomas's of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Or somebody.  I don't know what it does.  I don't quite get it. Or maybe there's maybe they have looked into it.  And then IRC users tend to be some of them tend to be, you know,  they they hide behind firewalls.  And so I don't know. I think with IRC, your IP address is known.  Yeah, yeah, I know IP address real easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Someone I know, I don't know if I should say it for fear of just don't say

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  don't say his name or her name. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, he runs one of those IRC file swapping or music swapping.  And he's been doing it for, I don't even know how long, five, six, seven years.  And it's thinking he has like a thousand followers and stuff.  They're all swapping stuff.  I'm just thinking to myself, where the hell does this go on?  Just one day I met his house and he goes, look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I I maybe the issue is this is more like the old school, you know,  hey, I've got some music you want to listen to it kind of swapping.  And not the wholesale.  I'm going to put a song on my hard drive and make it available  to everybody in the world kind of piracy.  And that may be a distinction.  The record companies are willing to live with, you know, this is just one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Be honest about it, Leo.  I don't think they're willing to live with anything.  But I think it's a prioritizing thing.  It's obvious that if you have a list of everything you want to crack down on,  the IRC is probably at the bottom of the current list.  It's to it's one. It's one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And how is it from bringing a CD over and sharing with your friend?  It is right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think that's less of an issue.  But you're right, John, they don't like that either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They shut it down.  They could.  And they don't want you bringing a disc over and sharing it with your friends  either, except that's got to be at the dead bottom of the list.  But they crack down on that if they could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If they would, they could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, you guys have the same thing over here this week.  There was an announcement that  the record companies are going to sell music on USB sticks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but they're not doing it in the States.  They're only doing it in the UK because apparently,  the UK teenagers are stupid enough to buy this.  Absolutely stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So probably, right.  I mean, it used to be the CD singles cost, what, like £4?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How much do these bracelets with the USB keys on them cost?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they've gone up to £10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my God. And you don't even get a whole CD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could buy a gigabyte for like ten bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You get a CD singles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and you get like the music video and some screensavers.  And a ringle, a ringtone.  And so you think, well, why would you ever pay like up to £10 for a single?  When you buy it on iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's $20 US for people out there who want to do the calculation.  That's 20 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mummy, mummy, I'd like to buy this new Madonna single on a USB key, OK?  Smack. What are you stupid?  Mummy! Don't you love me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is dumb and it's going to be a flop and it's going to go away in about three seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I think they're going to they're going to find a price point for it.  It's going to be a huge success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if they put them in cereal boxes, if the price point's low enough, sure.  Not 20 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, 20 bucks is out of control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Take time out of control.  Microsoft buys a one point six percent stake in Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Unbelievable for 200.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  240 million dollars  valuing the three year old company started by the Harvard Junior  at 15 billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Please. I don't know.  Go ahead, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did all the math on this in a column that I just ran in Market Watch.  I think it's either on a Friday or Monday.  Anyway, it's I started to do some of the numbers and what it says is basically  what you buy when you buy a company, typically you you know,  and if we're going to value it at 15 billion dollars,  if you buy a company and we know that they probably do about 150  million dollars in revenues and typically you'll buy a company at one time revenue,  maybe 10 times revenues, not profits, but revenues.  And that's the most you'd pay.  They are paying 100 times revenues.  And it also values each customer, each individual customer.  It's not really a customer.  They're just somebody who uses the website, not somebody buying anything.  And they're valuing those people at three hundred dollars a head,  which is completely out of control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's interesting math.  Wow. Three hundred bucks per user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This, you know, two two parts of this are the most ludicrous things  I've ever heard in my life.  Number one, like John said, 15 billion dollars.  I just don't see it.  Number one, he's in a business where the users are fickle.  I mean, this will be popular.  To be honest with you, I don't see this ever.  You know, it's not going to be something he said in the story.  Oh, we're going to go public.  We're going to do this and that.  Number one, he's not going to go public.  Number two, you know, to be honest with you, sell now.  You know, I mean, this these things have a shelf life of, say,  you know, maybe five years, you know, because my space was big.  Now Facebook is big.  You know, years ago, LiveJournal was big. Now it's a nothing.  I mean, these people, they find new things.  They say, wow, this is cool.  This is better than Facebook. I'm going to leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I've got a USB key with Madonna on it.  I think you're absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although from Microsoft's point of view, 240 million chump change. Right.  Absolutely. And I mean, and it gets them maybe some cache.  I mean, does it? Here's the question.  Is there anything it clearly it's overvaluing Facebook?  I was when he turned down one point six billion from Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But there was obviously a deal done that gives Microsoft.  They're getting some.  Now, yeah, no, they get the it looks like the sole rights  to buy, sell, broker, do whatever they have to do for all the advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is what you were talking about, John.  They're moving into the ad business.  Microsoft's got this new ad platform.  They got Dig, remember that Dig's got a Kevin's got to be kicking himself  because really, that's what they're buying on Facebook.  They're buying the exclusive rights to do the advertising on Facebook.  Yeah, it's a bribe. That's well worth 240 million.  And Mark Zuckerberg's going, yeah, I'm worth 15 billion.  No, it's just they're buying the rights to that's what they're buying.  They're not buying a stake in Facebook.  They couldn't care less about the stake.  And, you know, you got to wonder, they did the same thing with Dig.  They they they ousted Dig's.  I guess it was Google and FM or whoever, but they bought Mike.  They bought into Dig. The same thing.  I don't think they gave him as much money.  It's a way of Microsoft making themselves the kind of cool, hip advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, Microsoft, I think the number was and I don't have this one  accurate, but it's worth looking into Microsoft.  I think they lost something like seventy seven million dollars  last year selling ads.  And I think they're just a big loser for them because they don't know what  they hope to turn it around, right?  Well, yeah, but we're in it.  This is a software company, for God's sake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How do you lose money selling ads?  I don't understand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're spending too much money marketing themselves to sell the ads, I guess.  I don't know. We've got four thousand salesmen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What? What could you what could how could you lose money selling ads?  I don't understand. You could lose money running a business, running a company,  but selling ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I'm just saying this is a number I ran into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I believe you know, if Microsoft could lose money at it, they will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's just it's just constant Google envy is what it is.  I mean, just because of Google, just because the success of Google  and what they've been able to accomplish.  It's they don't even care about being a software company.  They want to be the biggest, the baddest, the worst company, not worst,  but, you know, the baddest company in the world.  And because of Google, they just don't seem they feel like they can't do it  because Google has my space. Right.  So now they need Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When Google bought DoubleClick, they bought some unknown  DoubleClick clone, right?  Just because we have to have it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know, the thing is, I'm convinced and I think I've heard this  from other people that Google actually suckered Microsoft  into this Facebook deal by showing interest,  bidding it up like a shill at a crappy auction and then pulling out,  laughing at themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You go, Eric. I like that. I like that story.  Now, remember, Microsoft's got a lot of money.  I love this quote from Charles de Bonheur.  He's an analyst at Stanford C.  Bernstein. He says Microsoft sneezes that much up in a day.  It's not a big, big money for Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they used to be pretty tight with their money,  but now they're throwing it away. This is not a good sign.  I don't care how much money they've got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, the thing is, you know, everyone says, you know, Microsoft's  oh, you know, 100 million here and 200 million there.  But you do enough of these deals, you know, to try and get hip.  And suddenly you're looking at a billion dollars that you've just thrown it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, you know what you're looking at?  You're suddenly looking at being Yahoo.  But it didn't work for Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can I can I give you a Yahoo story?  I had just one of these bizarre Yahoo things this week.  Where I was sat in Starbucks, right?  And there's this guy next to me and he's he's yammering on to this girl  who's sitting opposite him, who's clearly bored.  And he's saying, so so I had all my photos on on Yahoo.  And then Yahoo said, well, we're closing down the photos.  You have to go to this site called FlickR.  I don't know what FlickR is.  What the heck is this FlickR?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want to get a FlickR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I transferred my photos, but but now it says I can only look at 200 photos every month.  And if I if I want to look at all my photos that I have to pay 12 pounds a year.  Well, I don't want to pay 12 pounds.  Who is this FlickR?  And why did Yahoo close their photo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all right, dear.  Let's go to the record store and buy a USB key.  It'll be OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just all begs the question of why are you putting these photos on some online?  Anyway, don't you have you can buy a terabyte at Costco for 150 bucks.  Put the photos on your own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You want everybody to see pictures of your breakfast.  That's why. Yeah.  Well, I'm just everybody cares.  I'm sharing my photos with the world.  I say this, by the way, as somebody who pays 12 pounds a year  to post more than 200 pictures a month on FlickR.  You have a bunch of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. You have a lot of but they're mostly pictures of you, Leo.  That's what's kind of weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know I'm pretty good looking.  I like that one.  Here's here's another one.  Let me upload another one.  You know, I'm streaming video of this podcast today.  They can't hear you, but they can hear me.  That's all they want to hear.  They're happy.  That's a new voice for you.  You think I'm mocking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think I'm not telling the truth.  It's actually true. We are streaming this on Stickham.  And I couldn't figure out how to get your audio on it.  So all they're doing is they're sitting and listening to me listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Video on the Internet, they say it's the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the future.  So you're on Stickham. Let me check that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm probably on the front page.  This is the most excitement Stickham's had since that 12 year old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  From what I can tell, there's a lot of excitement on Stickham,  but it's mostly in private rooms, if you know what I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like it. This is good.  This is good.  This is good podcasting.  And now we listen to Dvorak type.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There it is. You're featured.  You have 350 viewers watching you  listen to you guys.  Yeah. Watch you listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm not listening that much.  That's probably why it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're slightly ahead of Show and Tell and Smacky Shack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  John Hawk, who I believe puts on a porn show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't want to watch a show by called Show and Tell by a guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't see Show and Tell on my thing.  Maybe maybe it's a I'm getting Leo Laporte, John Hawk, NHB Radio.  I have no idea what that is.  Elliott's been but it drops off is like you're 350.  John Hawk is 235 and then 34, 31 and 27.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the sad state of video on the Internet.  So what about this story?  Apple is this has decided that if you bring cash to the iTunes  to the Apple Store to buy an iPhone, they're going to turn you away.  You can only buy with a credit card.  No, that sucks.  No, you're kidding me.  They say because they're afraid people are buying it.  Also, you can buy no more than two phones.  They say the problem is they're worried about people coming in  and buying phones and reselling them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, what's that got to do with cash buying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I guess these people don't want to be on record.  If you use a credit card, then at least they kind of know it's you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is there any?  Oh, that's imponerous.  This is 1984.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What are we talking about here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry, your cash is no good here.  Go down the street and buy a USB key.  Apparently, it's legal to do this.  I actually had somebody send me an email  explaining that it is legal to do this.  You can't turn down cash in payment of a debt,  but you can turn down cash to buy a new article.  So I thank Storm Jenkins for filling me in on the law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As far as I wonder when that law, I mean, that's interesting, isn't it?  Cash is no good anymore in this country because because we can't track you  like a dog. Isn't that interesting? Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I mean, there's nothing illegal about buying something and selling it on.  Right. No, it's just because Apple doesn't like you doing it.  So they just sort of you laughing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't believe all of you Apple fans that just  praise this company when there's one thing after another, it seems to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're getting worse and worse.  But what I mean, it's very clear as a company becomes more and more successful,  they have to turn to more and more.  And then I think the real problem with Apple and Don, you said this on  and on your column is that they did a deal with AT&T.  You do a deal with the devil.  You're in bed with exactly you're going to have to act like the devil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. I mean, I mean, just all these moves are just so on Apple like.  If that's that's a word.  It's just so on Apple that it's just what's going on.  There has to be a reason for it.  And all of it is stems from the deal with AT&T.  And that's why I said it.  I mean, you know, I just hey, yeah, they've bricked iPhones.  They've not they've they've turned you away if you try to pay cash.  They're only letting you do to buy two iPhones.  It has to do with AT&T.  They never did this before. It was never like this before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is an appalling precedent.  I mean, what if you were acquired, you know, what if the Patriot Act  starts requiring you to pay by charge card at the grocery store  so they could track your hummus purchases?  I mean, I think this is really scary, frankly.  Not that I care whether Apple knows what I'm buying an iPhone or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, can you there's no limits to buying it at the AT&T store, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's a good question.  When I bought it at the AT&T store, they but that was on the first day.  They only you could only buy one.  I don't know what the limits are now.  And I don't know whether you could pay cash or not. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, if there's no limits,  and you want to just go out and sell 20 of them, just go down to the AT&T store.  And if there's no limits there, go buy them there.  If not, go drive a mile down the road to find another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've come to a strange state of affairs that where a company will turn down  a customer who wants to buy too many of their products or pay cash for it.  Sorry, we don't.  You want to buy too much of what we sell.  Sorry, you want to pay cash? Can't do it.  That's just bizarre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was actually reading a fantastic  a fantastic sort of sort of mini profile of Steve Jobs  in a book by Felix Dennis, of all people.  Who's Felix Dennis?  Felix Dennis wrote a book.  Yeah, he's a he's a British magazine publisher.  He started out like Mac user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He used to be my publisher. Oh, OK.  Yeah. Felix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so and so they had.  So one of the quotes out of it is it's not true that there is a large sign  on Steve Jobs's desk at Apple, which reads my way or the highway.  But the fact that so many people believe there is tells its own story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't need the sign.  You need no sign to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's just the way it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's just a fascinating look at how Steve Jobs, you know, saved the company.  Steve Jobs is Apple's sort of savior, but he's also his arrogance  and his is his sort of one way.  This is also its major downfall. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I read a great icon, I think it's called, that I don't think he likes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, no, that's the one he pulled from the stories. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That one talks all that's all he spends half the book talking about how  how he acts and how he is and how arrogant he is and how people don't like him.  They're scared of him and nobody disputes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not it's true. Nobody disputes this.  He's the kind of boss effect I've heard from an Apple employee  who was in an elevator.  Steve Jobs gets in the elevator.  People are quail when Steve Jobs gets in the elevator, looks at a guy, fires him  in the elevator for something.  I can't remember what it was, but some, you know, on the spot, fires him, walks out.  The guy standing there in a puddle in the elevator.  Steve's I guess he's got a handler with him at all times, comes back in the elevator  says, no, no, don't worry about that.  Steve does that all the time and they leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What a guy.  And he's like he's like the people genuflected his altar every every week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But he is a brilliant. He's a brilliant guy.  He's got a great design sense.  He's taken that company and turned it around.  Apple was dead.  Apple was out of business, although, you know, was was is interesting  because was while he's cagey about talking about Steve,  was knows Steve's flaws and was actually said that it was his opinion.  Gil Emilio had already turned the company around when was when Jobs came back.  I'm not sure if that's the case.  That's pretty wild.  Isn't that an interesting theory?  He says Gil had put into place all of the things that, you know, like that IMAX  and the move to OS 10, they didn't have an operating system yet.  Steve brought it with him when he rejoined from next.  But the move to replace OS nine, I guess, all of these things  were already in process through Gil Emilio when Steve comes comes in.  And, you know, that is true at Pixar.  Steve, Steve bought into Pixar and ignored the company  until it had a hit called Toy Story.  And all of a sudden, he's the genius behind Pixar.  I'm sure you read that in icon.  It's yeah, yeah, it's very interesting story.  And I've actually spent I spent a weekend some years ago  when Steve was not back at Apple yet with Steve and was, you know, as a human being,  he's not an awful human being, but he certainly has.  A high opinion of his own judgment.  I think he thinks no matter what, he's always the smartest guy in the room.  But doesn't Bill Gates feel the same way and isn't Bill Gates  and aren't Steve Jobs and Bill Gates usually right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, the thing is, most of the great CEOs in history,  I mean, if you look back, a lot of them are like that and dictators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Stalin and, you know, Hitler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There you are. Finally.  I had this chat.  It took me forever to sign in this.  I have an account there.  I see you now. You're smiling.  Hey, how you doing?  And you got a tweet, a tweet logo there, which is showing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got a fake tweet logo because really underneath here, it says KFI.  And I didn't really think that was appropriate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I'm great. Now I'm hearing it five different ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don, turn the audio off on stick.  This isn't going to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's going to work. It sounds good. Say something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hello. How are you, John?  Hello. How are you, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, just turn it off. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And now page two, Sprint, an interesting deal.  They settled a class action lawsuit  that alleged the company was anti-competitive by locking handsets.  Sprint agreed to provide unlock codes to current and former customers  so they can use their Sprint phones with other CDMA carriers,  either upon deactivation or after deactivation of the account.  And they're going to train customer service personnel on how to do it.  Furthermore, they've agreed to prorate the cancellation fees.  This is great news.  I mean, finally, some consumers, some good news for consumers  in the cell phone industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So who are these poor souls, these 362 people that are actually watching you?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'll ask them right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, guys, John wants to know, who are you and why are you watching?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What I find amazing is that is that, you know,  this is such big news to you guys to see a whole, oh,  you can take your cell phone and do something with it,  because that's just been the way over here for almost ever since.  Right. Yeah.  You buy your phone and you do your contract.  And when your contract is up, you say to the company, right,  I'm taking my phone, I'm taking my phone number,  I'm taking my business to another network,  and they are legally obligated to give you a code to let you do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And we have no consumer protection in this country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of well, especially in the telecom area.  And it's just we're like in the gulag here.  It's very strange. Is it for historic reasons?  Is it something we inherited?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, the thing is, you guys inherited like the monopoly of the bell  and then the bell got sped up.  And then it seems like nobody really did much to try and.  It's corruption is what it is.  Let's get a clear view.  Because over here we had British Telecom, which was the same thing.  British Telecom got privatized, split up.  But the competition commission over here has just been really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't you have the lobbyists in Britain?  Don't you? Don't don't.  I mean, that's what's gone wrong here is that the election system is dominated  by dirty money. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the problem.  So the thing over here is that  the amount or rather the amount that you can spend on political campaigns  are political parties is severely limited by the fact  that you can't advertise on television.  And so because there is far less money needed to be spent on political campaigns,  lobbyists have far less influence because that money is less needed.  I think that's it.  And that's just what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's not going to change because these broadcast networks, if they ever,  you know, I always get the biggest kick and I've written about this.  In fact, there's an essay on the Dvorak dot org slash blog about this,  which is, you know, people always say there's always.  Yes, plug.  And anyway, people are always saying the, you know, that all this didn't campaign  finance reform, campaign finance reform.  And they don't understand that.  Yeah, both parties talk a big game about it, but it's actually the TV networks,  the magazines, the newspapers and everybody else would be the ones  who really suffer from it because they count on all that cash coming in.  So they want more, less campaign finance reform because they make a ton of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And of course, all the people who would vote for camp and finance reform  are being paid for by.  Illegal or legal, but inappropriate campaign donations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the beauty of the beauty of this is for the telecom industry is,  you know, nine out of ten people probably aren't even going to pay attention  to unlocking and all this going on.  And so what they'll do is, you know, the so the politicians will say, well,  I'll take the money because no one really knows.  Nobody cares. My constituents knows or cares. Exactly.  So I'll take the money and I'll be fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Who's going to say anything? Nothing.  It's just a few guys on an old podcast somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, there was somebody pointed something out that was interesting to me  in some political either as a political blog or as on TV,  which is that when did we start analyzing the campaigns?  Like, for example, you have Obama versus Hillary.  It's not about the issues anymore.  It's about how much money they've collected.  It's a horse race. This guy's ahead of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's got another mentality and that's exactly what's wrong with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's unbelievable.  It's like whoever collects the most money wins. Who's winning? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's absolutely true.  What can we do about it?  Let's all move to Britain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, right. Where there's a camera on every corner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, at least we have I have good dental care here.  So so a little Austin Powers dig.  Halloween is coming up. Yes. Yes. I got it. You got it.  I think we're done.  I don't have any other stories. Anybody have any other stories?  I think that's about it.  Oh, yeah. Any more indignation, any more righteous indignation to tap?  Have we eschewed as we have we eschewed enough pretense, John C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dvorak? I don't know.  I think I've already burned out on screaming and yelling.  John, did anybody?  Well, I can I can complain about the University of California Golden Bears.  Oh, bears. That's another story.  Go ahead, Will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did anybody see the the crisis demo that just came out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody's talking about downloading crisis.  I have to tell me it's CRY SIS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. And what is it?  Sweet. Sweet.  It's just it's just the new  first person shooter from the guys that made Far Cry.  Oh, far cry is beautiful.  It's got all the latest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it World War War or is it sci fi? Right. This time, it's sci fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And it's it's got the most advanced graphics engine  basically in a first person shooter ever.  It just looks insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fire up your BitTorrent kids.  And if you're not on AT&T, you should have no trouble getting it  the next four or five days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I well, I waiting for Duke Nukem forever.  I'm not planning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I might be a long way, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll download. Have you played it yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, it's cool.  I mean, the demo is just that you just go and get it from like File Planet or wherever.  And so you don't need to be taught how big it is.  It's pretty big.  I think it's like, you know, a bit over a gig or something. Wow.  But you do need a pretty stonking PC to get the most out of it.  I have a stonking PC right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, then you'll enjoy it.  I have to do something with it. God knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's never been able to get into computer gaming.  I don't know what it is. I just PC gaming. I can't do it.  I've never been able to do it.  And I don't know, maybe this will be it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you an Xbox guy, a PlayStation guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, I've always been a console guy.  You know, it's just the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to say, you know, for instance, Bioshock choice between Xbox 360 and the PC  looks better on the PC, but it's also got secure ROM on it in the PC.  And I don't want to put all that copy protection on my PC.  So you kind of, you know, it's so much easier to just put the disk into the console.  And it always works.  You don't have to update your drivers.  You don't have to worry about DRM. It just works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course, my PlayStation 3 died.  So that's a story for another day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But, oh, boy. Hey, when it dies, what does it do?  I mean, we've got the three rings of death for the Xbox.  What does the PS3 do when it dies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what the weird thing is? Nothing.  I try to put in a disk and you hear it start whirring and then it just stops.  Stop spinning. And then I'm out of luck.  So I have to call up Sony and see what they have to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That thing gets so hot.  I, you know, we put it in.  I shouldn't have, but we have put the TVs in a cabinet.  So we put the PlayStation 3 above it in the cabinet.  And my wife closed the cabinet with the thing on.  And it sounded like there was a jet engine in the cabinet.  And I opened it up and it was like 110 degrees.  There was like a blast of heat comes out of the cabinet.  The thing is hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. You know what? Right now, right now I'm doing a  I do a monthly feature for Information Week and this this next feature  is going to be about projectors, super high end consumer projectors.  And there's one from Optima.  I was sitting next to it, trying to fix it, you know, get it right on the on the  on the screen. And I burned my hand.  It was so hot and I couldn't believe how hot it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a nice projector.  Those, you know, these high lumen bulbs get extremely hot.  You need a fan.  The overlooked feature about these, I love projectors, by the way.  But you got to find one with a very with the most  probably the most expensive item in the thing should be a really high end,  super quiet fan, because those things are just noisy.  I don't get one with a nice, quiet fan.  And nothing worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. You're in a home theater and you hear, whoo.  It's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the one like it is in the Optima.  It's unbelievably loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So follow up on a sprint story, by the way, Verizon is  settling one million dollars for people who had their broadband service  disconnected, wrongfully disconnected.  Verizon, of course, has been saying unlimited broadband.  Turns out it was limited.  Five gigs and disconnected people for over going over the limit.  The five gigs, five gigabytes a month.  That's nothing. Yeah, it's not unlimited.  That's for sure.  You're right.  So the New York attorney general, your guy, Andrew Cuomo,  he's been, you know, I have to say he's been pretty good  at pursuing this kind of stuff.  It's obviously for the for the headlines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that same thing Spitzer did when he got that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Spitzer was great that way.  Yep. He was.  Spitzer was all about getting in the papers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And of course, now he's in trouble. Big trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But is he what happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was a whole trooper scandal with state troopers, and he did this, did that.  And the Republicans are going, it's a whole it's a whole thing.  It's not every night in the news.  Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, Verizon will halt the deceptive marketing of its broadband  as unlimited because it ain't took nine months of investigation by Cuomo.  And it really it, you know, we've always said, oh, come on,  it's not unlimited. All these companies are doing.  No, I have to say, though, in their defense, and this is the same.  This is also about that story with Comcast blocking Bittorrent.  You can't build a physical plant large enough to handle all of this traffic  all at the same time.  You have to kind of estimate, you know, how many people are going to be online  and how much they're going to use.  There it never really has been unlimited,  because if everybody got online at once and used it unlimited,  it just wouldn't work, which is fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they don't call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sorry. Is that Comcast thing ever been proven because they keep denying it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They keep no. You know, what's happened is now  we talked about last week, you weren't here.  It's pretty clear they're using a service out of Canada  that a lot of ISPs use that, you know, promise to reduce  bandwidth consumption, to control, to monitor, to optimize bandwidth consumption.  Sandvine is the name of it.  And this is how Sandvine works.  The AP story, I think, is held up.  Comcast is they're doing a lawyer's denial.  They're saying we're not doing anything.  We do, however, use services to optimize bandwidth consumption.  So it's pretty clear they're using Sandvine.  But again, you know, I mean, I'm playing devil's advocate here  because I don't want to be limited and so forth.  But at the same time, it is hard for them to build an unlimited plant.  What were you going to say about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, well, just that I think everybody understands that you possibly can't,  you know, have all of all the bandwidth all the time.  And everybody is fine with that.  But OK, but then don't call it unlimited.  Call it virtually unlimited or massive capacity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody pointed out that you can't really do an ad that says  guaranteed 26 kilobits.  You know, it doesn't sell very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's just, you know, the trouble is if everyone was forced into the same  baskets because, you know, everyone wants to be unlimited,  everyone wants to be the biggest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the problem is there, let's face it, there are bandwidth hogs  and probably all of us on the panel count as bandwidth hogs.  And, you know, if you're not one, you want to have access to the Internet.  You know, you don't want it to be slow because some guys  torrenting the last, you know, six episodes of of the office.  They do the new ads now say they don't say anything about unlimited.  They just say broadband access.  I'm looking at the new Verizon ad.  They've actually completely eliminated the unlimited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They had to. Can you hear me now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Speed claim based on our new on our network test with five megabit  FTP data files without compression, actual throughput speed varies.  Broadband access is available, but they don't say anything about unlimited.  Yeah. Can you hear him now?  Can you hear Cuomo now? Verizon?  I use Comcast. Good.  How's your BitTorrent been?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't use BitTorrent. I don't download stuff like that.  I just don't do it. I don't have time for it.  I mean, I've got a dish network thing.  I get all the media. I want to get over the satellite dish.  I don't see why I have to overdo it. Right.  I mean, I suppose it's handy.  I mean, some people like I think most people just collect stuff.  I don't think it's practical, to be honest about it, to download movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's practical. You just start the download and you go to bed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I'm saying. But then you watch the movie.  I mean, you can watch the movie on the dish network.  Is this I mean, unless there's some thing you really have to see immediately.  Eventually, it's all the IPTV and you'll be able to get everything you want quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. And that's what we're doing, which kind of trying to make pretend IPTV.  But I mean, I'll give you an example.  I can't buy The Office anymore on iTunes and I love watching The Office,  but I don't want to see all the commercials.  I'd be willing to pay for it if NBC had let me.  I'm not going to use Hulu.  Is Hulu up yet, Don?  I don't think so.  I think it's got a few more brilliant nitwit thought that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's Hulu? They said it's it's because it says, you know,  the beats are coming in October, so they've got like three more days to get it going.  Oh, yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And what he said, ladies and gentlemen, is what Americans would say is beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I thought it was like a beet farm or something.  No, the Hulu is NBC's ill advised idea to instead of letting YouTube  and iTunes put their videos up, they're going to sell them themselves  on a website with the stupidest name in the world.  And by the way, they've they've now pulled them off of  all of those clips off of YouTube, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't get this thing.  No, I wrote it. I wrote it on CNN.  This thing is going to be a flood.  It's be over in a year. It's simple as that.  You have they're going to start touting.  This is the most wonderful thing in the world.  Look at what you can do. You can watch all of your favorite shows.  You exactly know it's going to use it.  And then they're going to say, they see this is the problem with this company  and these companies, News Corp and NBC, they have this mentality  that they need to commercialize everything.  They need to find ways to make money.  They need to end it.  Data's with advertisements and everything else.  So within six months, that'll happen.  People will get even more upset.  A few people are going to use it.  And then in a year, they'll go back to Apple and beg them to take them back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's simple. And they'll be losing money on it, too.  Let's don't forget that part of it. Oh, you're a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. Think of all I mean, I literally bought the first three seasons of The Office.  I want to buy The Office, even though and this is what they forget.  I can easily get it for free in higher quality.  And I am because they're not offering it.  They're not letting me buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And can someone please explain to me why?  I see Hulu because of the reason, but why in the year in your wildest dreams  would you want to pull your programming off of YouTube,  the most popular video sharing site where people are going to go, oh, wow,  it's a great clip. This is pretty nice show.  It's a funny show. I like the clip.  Maybe I'll go down to iTunes. I'll buy it.  Or maybe tonight I'll watch it on TV.  I just don't understand the mentality.  It's just we own everything.  We have to keep it. We have to maintain it.  And as simple as that. And it's just it's awful. It's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amen. Once again, we have a shooed obfuscation, but we've  ended up the show with a downer.  I'm sorry. I'm happy.  As usual, I'm happy to share with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've got to have something up, surely.  No, we don't.  We.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chad C.  Dvorak says, no, we don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't care. I think it's a fun show anyway.  John C.  Dvorak is at Dvorak.org slash blog.  Of course, take a drink and you'll find all of his rantings there as well as on CBS.  It's not CBS anymore as it's just Market Watch.  Dow Jones, Dow Jones, Market Watch, also Cranky Geeks at Cranky Geeks dot TV.  And what's this new one you were just talking about this new podcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a five minute daily podcast called Tech Five.  You can find it.  You can link to all this stuff from my blog, Dvorak dot org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cool. I have to start listening to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just daily rant is a day.  I can only do five minutes of this screaming and yelling every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love it. So I have to find out what he's saying about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, it was I think it was like last Tuesday.  I'm not sure. He's a loser.  It was something about something you wrote that really ticked me off.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, once you've been ranted about by Dvorak, you've been ranted about by the best.  Don Risinger writes for CNET at the digital home column and a whole lot more.  Just Google Don Risinger.  That's what he said to say. I'm not kidding.  Do you think you're like easy?  And I got the daily done, but you're not posting nothing on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I know someone's someone's building a site for me.  So I'm happy to see that because I just don't have time nor the nor the skills to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's too busy playing crisis.  Oh, no, that's not you.  That's that's Will Harris.  Digital home is at CNET.com blogs that CNET.com.  They should really get your blogs at CNET.com slash Don.  Can you arrange that?  Make it so much easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, every week they change the URL less.  They usually works generally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can go both ways and it tends to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The problem is they've got this weird CMS that gives you this.  Oh, eighty three hundred dash thirteen five.  Oh, six dash one underscore seventeen stroke B seventy one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that CMS is an old throwback to Vignette or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It looks like Vignette. Remember, that's what we used to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you know, it's Halsey that that was the original investor in Vignette.  Well, there it is. So it is Vignette. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This if I ever saw Vignette URL, it is this is so 90s, Don. Stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, it used to be blogs.  That's CNET.com slash digital home.  And that where I think it still works.  But now it's W.W.W. CNET.  Whatever the hell they put at the end.  So, you know, just I think it's blogs.  The CNET.com digital works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That still works. Blogs.CNET.com slash digital home.  There you go. That's Don Risinger's digital home on the information superhighway.  He rides the tubes.  He also writes for information week.  We'll look forward to that new product review on that projector.  That sounds cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And as you know, think this is I mean, it seems a little bit harsh on the bottom  of your blog post, it says Don Risinger is a freelance technology journalist.  He is not an employee of CNET.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's called that's because the CMS you can't dis the CMS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whatever you do, don't make him an employee.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We are not responsible for anything Don might say.  That's the stupidest thing to put there.  Oh, you can catch Mr.  Will Harris at Channel Flip TV.  That's his new IPTV play.  And I think that's going to be a big one.  In fact, I just got a shot of the calm.  The calm, I'm sorry.  Just got an email from him and he said he loves it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Love it. Well, we had we had a crazy episode this week  where the girl Catherine that does our video game reviews  did a review of the new Zelda game on the DS.  So she made this little Link costume and she dressed up  so cute, so cute.
