Transcript:  I'm talking about about this about gestures and of course one of the things about gestures  It's cool is it can extend the vocabulary that you interact with your device  But it's a tricky balance because you want the gesture to be somewhat intuitive for instance the pinch gesture  Which Apple introduced but the Carnegie Mellon created at first and I you know  I'm using my surface and that that seems pretty intuitive you pinch it and it zooms in right  And then Google's phones have a shake gesture  Which is completely intuitive if something crashes or you don't or you're just not happy with it  And then it immediately pops up a little would you like to send a bug report which I love  That's intuitive and yet there are a lot of kind of non into Motorola  We're the Moto X yeah do this to activate the camera the camera this but but we came to like it, right?

Start time: 1839.80
End time: 1862.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, so the squeeze I don't know I think the problem with it is that very oftentimes  We don't have our phone in our hand. It's in our pocket or it's on the table or whatever  I think that the superior method is is the air pod thing where you just double tap  On your air pods and Siri pops up and then unfortunately  Siri pops up and that's a problem. I wish the Google Assistant would pop up

Transcript:  So I have so I have a theory in the world in this world of appliances  So the rumor is that Facebook is working on an appliance like the echo that they have at least two one with the screen  It's gonna be a ripoff of the of the Amazon lineup to a certain extent yes, but  My prediction is that it will have what I call suggestions, so if you use Facebook Messenger right now  There's something called M suggestions, so you're sitting there having a conversation and we'll chime in and say hey well  Why don't you go to this restaurant?  Why don't you listen to this song or would you tap here to listen to this music on Spotify?  Imagine that with a voice assistant that means it'd be listening to you all the time  It has to be super calm exactly it'll be super controversial, but I think that's where we're headed  inevitably anyway and  So there are only two products to do that right now one is Google assistant on aloe  Or as we refer to it on twig Google silo  I  Love that and and Facebook M suggestions  Those are the only two places that will where listen to conversations won't listen  They'd watching text which makes it a little better, and then it chimes in and say hey what about this?  But I think that's where we're going with all these assistants

Start time: 1951.72
End time: 1975.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's an interesting thing of course because it's also a great way to gather data right I mean  Gmail was brilliant because you get this great free mail  Client and it can in the process of just being gmail read all your mail  So wouldn't it be smart for Facebook to say hey sorry, but we have to listen all the time the question is whether consumers  Are going to accept that right you don't want to be a backlash

Start time: 1978.34
End time: 2019.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The larger perspective is that this will happen  Absolutely will happen where consumers will happily accept having our assistants listening to us all the time because the benefits will be enormous  It'll happen in two years, or it'll happen in five years, or it'll happen in ten years, but it will happen  it's just how fast can we get there and  It's also there's also a philosophical question about whether something's listening if somebody isn't listening is anybody listening no not really  It's data that is being referred to  And as long as it's can't be hacked and whatever people people are going to accept this even you will accept this  I'm maybe we'll see you got a long life ahead of you born after  1979 so  Decades

Yes, so you did the beta I did I did I did  But I think I'll get to the point where no phone no laptop  100% iPad and I think that'll be great and but wait Mike you might say but that's ridiculous  That's insane. What about what about you know checking Facebook? What about doing?  You can do it. I'm trying to I'm trying. I think we've reached the point where we're too addicted  we're too distracted our phones are actually problematic for us now and  Using a cell phone the way we use them is like is like driving to the store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Yes, right, and there's not much more. They haven't even updated your beautiful  Air it would be so nice if they put a retina screen on the MacBook Air  But they don't even bother and instead they put the stupid touch bar yeah  I  Feel like they they've they've given up what they really hope is exactly your vision of the future  Which is that everybody will stop buying those darn Macintoshes and start buying more iPads?  They're I'm sure the margins better on those

You're nodding as if this is something you you do well Chromebook Linux  The Chromebook is very similar  Chromebook is Linux. It's just a kind of locked down, but very secure very robust very reliable version  Do you use a crop, but you know do you must use a real computer at work, right?  We have real computers for web design required you really wouldn't want to use a Chromebook for web design  You wouldn't want to use I guess somebody called me the other day. She said on web designer  I love coda to panic software is really pretty cool web design software for the iPad  She says is there anything like that on a Mac?  Well, we've come a long way where you're looking for software in your Mac  That is as good for web designing as the tool you're using on your eye

We're building 10 billion dollar fabs  We're creating a 10 nanometer process. We're all in are they nuts  Given what you just said isn't everything gonna go arm not everything

Yeah, yeah, and and and you know, they're there so that's Intel's futures servers  Yeah, I think I think that the average consumer  I don't think the average consumer is gonna do I you know phones are gonna be with us for a long long time  But these phones are gonna have to get super processor intensive and I'm not sure that what you're talking about here with Intel  That's not something that's gonna affect mobile. They have never been able to do mobile successfully

It's gonna change absolutely everything. It's gonna change how we perceive the world  It's gonna change everything and these and and no processor is fast enough for this stuff. You we're gonna have to be  pumping so much raw graphics  compute power into all of our devices because we're always gonna want more of this stuff and  You know again, this is gonna start with AR kit  Shortly, I'm surprised you're so sold on AR

It doesn't actually place it in a specific place in space. It's like GPS, right?  so  The first thing to understand is that for a while it's gonna be on tablets and phones  That's where AR is gonna live for for a year or two on the iPhone the next generation iPhone primarily exactly

End time: 3347.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Transcript:  They have a camera that points that way right but but MacBooks don't they only have a camera that points that way and you can't do it  You can't do augmented reality with that not even on the table  So it's gonna really be a big big deal, but all of that work that's gonna be done on again  What's the application the application is glasses Leo glasses are gonna is good are gonna replace?  We're a long way from that. We're five six seven years. Yeah, okay problems  You got battery you got processor iPhone itself is ten years old Leo  It's five or six or seven years is not very far into the future  Yeah, it's coming. It's gonna.

Here's another one get ready  This is Ridgeline Labs creators of Rover the AR VR dog game  Can you have sound on me?  Not hearing it  Maybe there's no sound. So this is your virtual pet. Look, I'm gonna throw a virtual stick  Rover will go catch the virtual. Oh my god, is this stupid?  You know if you're gonna make a virtual reality dog make it run faster for crying out loud.

All right  I have to admit the last home loan I got three four almost four years ago was not from quick and loans  it was from that big bank, you know when the stagecoach bank the one and  That was it was a terrible experience. So it took us almost four months to get a loan. They kept coming back  They wanted more paperwork. I thought this was I don't know what this was  I thought it was because the 2008 collapse or whatever, but they wanted more document  It was a we almost lost the house because it took so long  Fast forward the year is 2017  Then the best lender in the country quick and loans and I can say that because if you go to their website  They win every year for the last seven years number one in JD powers customer satisfaction  Survey for primary mortgage origination. I mean they really are the best and for mortgage servicing. So they really are the best  These guys have created a product for geeks that lets you apply for a loan entirely online  You can do it on your phone  You don't have to go through any paperwork or anything because they have trusted relationships at all with all the financial institutions  So you just they say is it they literally it's kind of wild if you do it they say, okay  Well, this is your bank account, right?  You say yeah because that you know, they have all that information once you give them the the basics  They fill in all the blanks for you. You don't have to fill in the form  They just do it for you and then they say okay based on all this and they do this in a minute  Based on all your income your assets your credits here the loan options for you. You can choose the term  You can choose the rate. This is what we offer you.

I think eventually they're gonna have to go public  But it might be a down round IPO which is what we're seeing now when they go public beneath their last market  Valuation their market cap will be likely smaller, but but we'll see I mean these days  You know companies like square did that and then they eventually did well in the stock market  So it's not it's no longer considered the end of the world if you do a down round IPO as long as you build a great

That's often rounded up to 70  It's really hard to justify that right now  I mean I personally thought it was always hard to justify that valuation  Especially with all of this happening  So if they went public today  I mean there's almost no way that they would be valued at that  But maybe if they wait a couple years they'll grow into it  I mean really it has to do with the public investors their runway now

Transcript:  It's a couple of years three years something like that. Yeah, I'd have to take a look  I mean they've shared some of their financial numbers, but but not all of them  I mean I think there are people who will still continue to invest in uber  I mean reports have said that soft bank which has a hundred billion dollar fund  Interested in investing and so they have money to keep uber alive, so I'm not worried about uber going out of business  I don't even think that's close to a possibility, but  Whether it's going to achieve its private market valuation will be a big deal for the whole industry  Because a lot of LPs the investors who get where VCs get their money from are in multiple venture funds  And if a lot of those venture funds were counting on uber  And it's not as good of an outcome as they thought it would be then that's gonna be a problem  I mean particularly for the investors who got in later  I mean the investors who got in early they're gonna have a wonderful outcome really no matter what it's just a matter of  How many billions will be worth but um Calacanis is gonna be

I said well have you ever heard the word generic side  Turns out  When the mark becomes like Kleenex like Xerox a generic name for the goods now Xerox for a long time really fought that spam  It's interesting Hormel for a long time fought eventually gave up. Does that mean they lost the trademark to spam?

He did not invent email when he was 12 years old and emailed been around for a decade or two  He's probably he was alleged. Oh  It's alleged  Isn't that sad that we were all because he sued tech dirt Mike Masnick  The good news is Mike now has a quarter of a million dollar defense fund  Thanks to some big companies that stood step forward and said this is the story of a guy  Who has for years asserted he invented email even though it's it's demonstrable the email existed before he invented it  Sure, but he said I think he says he invented it independently as a high school kid  It's a strange story and and for and unfortunately for him.

Transcript:  Everybody has the right to say exactly if somebody in fact did invent something and they can take the biggest  Company to court and there's a chance that they could win a settlement where they'll get it  It's one of the strengths of this nation  Yeah, and we you know one of the things that's unusual about the United States is we're we've always been a very diverse society  And this is a great strength and the majority Americans love our diversity in a diverse society  You have to have different norms. For example Americans smile a lot when I travel around the world. I see people smiling  Americans I can tell from oh really across the street everybody else. They're not frowning  They just smile and the reason for it  Recently is in a multicultural society where people come different languages stuff like that  Smiling is the easiest thing that's universal that everybody understands. We've gotten this habit culturally centuries ago to do that  Another one is litigiousness. We all have different values. We come from different places  We have different opinions and so a courtroom is is a the closest you have to an objective place to determine these things  And so it's a good thing  Ridiculous lawsuits like this notwithstanding it's gonna happen.

Transcript:  You know, there's a lot of money lost to patent trolls. I think that's gotten better. Thank goodness  But for years and we were talking about billions of dollars lost to patent trolls and yet I think it is so important that everybody  Oh have the right to go to the to petition the court and say I've been wronged and I would like you to rule on that  I agree with you. I think that and the rule of law and that notion is so important in the United States  I remember traveling in Egypt on the same trip  I was going down the Nile and  There's a country where the rule of law has kind of lost ground and it's very corrupt  mm-hmm, and there's a lot of backsheesh and and you get a job because your brother-in-law were and and  What happens is people start to lose faith in that and then the whole thing kind of collapses you  you once you lose faith in that shared myth of a  Government of a common cause. Yeah  It's very hard to hold a country together and I knew and it was obvious that Egypt was gonna go through some troubles  This is 2009 because not merely because that because a big population growth and other things  But that when you lose the rule of law  You've lost something really important people have to have some faith that no matter what they can get redress  But it's not who you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I think that's why we're very we're gonna talk about this in a second  But I think that's why in this country we're a little worried right now  Because it feels a little shakier that maybe that rule of law, but I think everybody who's listening  You I really believe this strongly that is if you pick one strength of this country. It's not our military strength  it's this faith in  The Constitution and the rule of law and that you can go and you can get redress  So I'm glad you brought that up because I think we often talk about every day sue sue happy and it's litigious and trial lawyers  But no, there are some negatives. I'm not saying it's perfect  But but on the on the on the balance it really is what makes this country. I think a great country

That's changing though. Exactly

We had a sponsor cloud flare  That got a lot of heat because they said  We will continue to protect them as we do everybody including Isis  because we provide a DDoS service that is  Ecumenical it doesn't it we don't it's not about protecting the cotton  It's just about and there's a big debate in the EFF waiting in on cloud flares side  Which is interest and against Google and go daddy  Yeah, and I have got I since we have such a great panel here and smart group here  I kind of want to know what you all think about that because this is I think it's related. Yeah, we have said free speech  with very few exceptions  And yet now we have big companies deciding who gets to speak. Yep. Is that right? Is that okay? We'll talk about it

I  This is a great example  When we started twit 15 almost well, that was it 2005. That's 12 years ago  I talked to Kevin Rose. He said oh you got to do an LLC go to legal zoom  You don't need a lawyer. They can do all you do all the paperwork.

We have we have we have pursued that trademark and  Various places cost a lot more than legal zoom did  legal zoom comm slash prepare  All right  So did I describe this situation accurately, you know, I if I may Leo

Start time: 6503.02
End time: 6534.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'd like to describe what the real issue is because there's a lot of people talking about lots of different things  so companies like Google or cloud flair or  Other companies go daddy do censor whatever they do. For example, best example is child pornography  Everybody condemns it right? It's this is not something that should be allowed to flourish on on the public internet  Isis is another case now cloud flip flare you said  Does support I've been told I don't know and I haven't talked to cloud flare alleged if they don't support women

Start time: 6534.48
End time: 6565.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's really important. They don't support it. And I think the important except it  Distinction is cloud flare provides DDoS service to all and sundry  Just like your electric company doesn't ask you  What's your politics before they sign you up for electricity or the phone company says?  Well, you can use this phone, but you can't use it describe Nazi activities  Those are utilities the difference that traditional  Utilities prove are completely agnostic about the bits carried on there, but they don't trade in content. That's the difference Google

Start time: 6567.68
End time: 6602.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  People communicate there's content their sites  They're the web pages involved that have content and so they're in different classes  the FF is coming out against the Google's and the Facebook's and and so on for  for shutting down  Nazi groups alt-right, etc, etc  So to me the question is we so we understand intuitively that you can't provide and we are we don't provide  access for Isis or child pornographers to have  Groups on Facebook or to have that seems reasonable, right? That's really I think most people agree with that seems reasonable

Start time: 6602.64

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right and the reason degree they're able I mean when you've got a billion and a half or two and the reason isn't speech

Start time: 6607.68
End time: 6652.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's not opinions about child pornography is that we feel that that actually creates a harm  To real people physical harm and Isis is the same case. So the question is do do do Nazi and white supremacy sites  Lead to harm now a lot of the speech that takes place on the storm. Whatever they are is  Innocuous they're actually talking about policies immigration policies  They have their opinion and that kind of speech should be protected  But question is is when they say let's go and like crosses let's go intimidate so-and-so  Let's shut down other people's free speech. Let's go kill people. Let's go do this that the other thing  That seems to me to cross into that territory if you the speech is actually yelling fire in a theater  You're you're threatening harm to real people  Physically and that's the line

Start time: 6652.72
End time: 6714.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm Jewish so this Nazi stuff is is kind of personal and I've read all about the history of the Holocaust  I don't get into that  but I mean it definitely this kind of speech definitely led to a lot of violence clearly and  I think that the meaning of free spit speech has been distorted again and again  It's supposed to mean that you legally can say whatever you want to say  It doesn't mean people have to like what you say doesn't mean companies have to do business with you  but instead it's been used in a way that  It's just not accurately portrayed  No company should have to allow a Nazi site unless they have I guess a monopoly  I don't think these people should go to jail for saying their hateful thoughts because I do believe in in free speech in America  But I don't think that they should I don't think Google should have to do business with them  I don't think cloud fair should have to do business with them  I don't see why free speech has been equated to mean something just entirely different than what it's supposed to be

Start time: 6714.28
End time: 6823.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Should cloud flare be let me read let me I  Actually am torn  But let me read what the EFF said and I am a strong supporter of the EFF and they are strong supporter free speech now  I should point out the ACLU just recently said we are not going to defend Nazis if they bear arms or advocate violence  We don't that's a change in the ACLU's policy, by the way  This is what the EFF says. We strongly believe what go daddy Google and cloud flare did here was dangerous. That's because  Even when the facts are the most vile we must remain vigilant  when platforms exercise these rights because internet even your intermediaries  Especially those with few competitors control so much online speech the consequences of the decisions have far-reaching  impacts on speech around the world and  In the EFF we see the consequences firsthand every time a company throws a vile neo-nazi site off the net  Thousands of less visible decisions are made by companies with little oversight or transparency  Precedent they worry that precedents are being set that can shift the justice of these removals. So I  Do think Google and go daddy are in a different situation than cloud flare. Yes, they are  I think cloud flare can very reasonably argue and I and I supported them in this although we decided to decline their  advertising at the time  They can argue we're a utility like an electric company  I would not think the electric company should decide who gets electricity or the phone company should decide who gets phone service  And I feel like that's kind of more what cloud flares doing Google on the other hand and go daddy. I  Don't know. What do you think Matt?  you have to do you used to when you worked at Google dealt with this all the time well and

Start time: 6823.98

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Certainly from the time at Google  There's a bunch of folks who are not free speech absolutists  But who think about the power of free speech and think about the power of the platform somewhere like Google  So having worked on the first version of safe search, for example, it was only dedicated to  Pornography family safe content, but you would see people come in and say, okay, that's great  But what about you know the anarchist cookbook? It's always where do you draw the line?  What about a witchcraft or a Wiccan site?  What about pro anorexia sites and you could just see the slippery slope down there?  And so it was easier to just say okay  Safe search would only be about this topic and over time we could all agree on or mostly agree on

Transcript:  So I know that there are debates happening happening internally at Google where people say okay  But where exactly does this line happen?  Because if you if you locate your website on blogspot or WordPress, then you're not surprised if WordPress takes you down  But they're hosting the car hosting the content, but if you have your own domain name  It's it's really interesting to think about can I be yeah as a register?

Start time: 6890.32
End time: 6919.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The internet what is a register are doing when they they're not really saying we're hosting the content. They're not endorsing the content  They just allow you to register the name  I don't know if a domain registrar should be able to do that and I think clouds are going even a step further  I don't know. It's very difficult because at the same time the Daily Stormer is  Reprehensible and the thing that got them in the most trouble was true. I don't even want to repeat it was truly  Beyond the pale and any right-minded society would reject it, right?

Transcript:  So so my my view is that that the First Amendment doesn't give anybody any rights at all  What it does is says the government cannot  Pass the Congress cannot pass a law any company can do it. There's not even a question  Doesn't mention companies it doesn't mention citizens  It doesn't it says Congress cannot pass a law that infringes free speech  And if there's no law then that the executive branch can enforce such a law etc  And so the way to deal so yesterday was an amazing event that took place in Boston amazing  So a small number of people were there to ostensibly  promote free speech and they were sort of alt-right types and there was like  50 75 I don't know how many there were fewer than a hundred of they fit in the bandstand  They fit in the bandstand and then 40 thousand big group and then 40,000 people  marched to oppose  You know Nazi types and that sort of thing that happened in Charlottesville  Everybody was exercising free speech. It was a thing of beauty  But but the point I'm getting to is that it takes a village to to to  Destroy the Nazi movement, right? I mean and and so part of that village  I think is Google and Facebook and these other companies they are  companies that are owned then you know, they're not privately owned they're publicly owned but they're publicly owned by lots of individual people and  and we as  you know shareholders as customers of these companies I think  Have a duty to examine these things as we're doing on the show right now and think where is that line?  I think the line is physical violence  This is the this is the line that Twitter uses to determine who they boot off the site if you threaten physical harm  Then you're out if you say all kinds of horrible horrible anti-semitic things  You're not out because that's speech you haven't threatened anybody's physical life  So I think that physical harm is really the line that most societies can accept as the line  Does it lead to physical harm? We agree?

Transcript:  I just think people should be or companies should be able to do business with whoever they want to do business with I mean  Generally, it's best for business to do business with a lot of people if you're consumer facing business  but I don't see why there should be any sort of  Regulation or any sort of rule that requires them to do business with Nazis  It's not they're not preventing free speech unless they actually have a monopoly because someone else can take their business in theory

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And yet Google and Facebook  Not go daddy Google and Facebook wield a lot of power a lot  I mean not monopoly power admittedly but close  so much so that there is some concern that if they were to especially in search results if  Google were to decide well  We're just not going to show this stuff up  It wouldn't exist in effect that you wouldn't have to get the host to take it down  In fact, that's what the right to be forgotten is in Europe  They don't go you don't go to the host to say take it down you go to Google and say  Could you delete that from your search results in effect that deletes it from the internet?  I admit it's not but it does in effect, right?

Transcript:  Well, and at least a lot of the people at Google tend to have the philosophy or had the philosophy of the answer to bad  Speech is more speech, you know, I believe that better idea. I believe that but I don't know  Changed like when you're dealing with Nazis

Transcript:  I used to say that when the internet started I said this is gonna be great because we're gonna  expose everything to the light and  And in the light bad stuff will die and and good stuff will survive and prosper  And what is the what is the reality? What if we learned in fact, we gave a megaphone to I think these are small groups  I think these neo-nazi groups are actually fairly small groups  But we gave them a megaphone that gave them an outsized voice and it didn't have the effect that I thought it would which is  We would all go see how dopey they are  I remember we've had clan marches my whole life and they usually were small dopey groups that everybody would go  Yeah, the clan  But it doesn't feel that way anymore, especially with the death of a young woman. That's right Charlottesville. They somehow crossed the line and  Now the look at Spotify's removing hate bands from its library Squarespace says it's removing sites from Squarespace  Increasingly the internet is stepping forward saying you cross the line

Transcript:  Final straw that that knocked him off of cloudflare and I think of other places was in fact a really horrific  Article about the woman who was killed afterwards. Yeah afterwards. Yeah, so there was that line in that sense. They were absolute  So we've seen now the effect of trolling the effect of I think to some degree both I hate to say it  It sounds like I'm very Trumpian here  but both the the alt-right and the antifa the  Anti-fascist League are I sometimes I feel like  Opposite coins are the same kind of 4chan  lulls  Groups the difference the difference they like to fight each other

It definitely galvanized  Yeah, yeah, and everybody said no you went you went too far  We believe in free speech  See, I think free speeches was free speech has been well served  We believed in free speech, but the minute you cross that line.

Yeah, so we talked about alt-right white supremacy and neo-nazi  Okay, let's look at those alt-right. There are a lot of alt-right people who are just extremely conservative dick Cheney is probably all right, right?  White supremacists, okay. This is an objectionable set of ideas, but probably you know, it's just they are ideas  They're talking about policy. They're talking about you know, they they tend to take the victim  Approach saying oh we we need to protect our own people stuff like that when you get into neo-nazis  So there's a history with Nazis  You know, it's like when you when you have Nazi symbols and doing Nazi salutes and have swastikas on your shirt and stuff like that  You're talking about you're talking about supporting genocide

Transcript:  there's this I don't know I  Well, actually that this whole that event to me is is a reason why you don't want to kick them off too much  You want to know who they are? Well, you want them to interact with other people?  so one of the things that I feel that happen is these these these  A-holes have been talking to each other and nobody else in a few years in a vacuum and they went out into the real world  With with their with their worldview and they just got trashed especially in Boston yesterday  They just got just their butts handed to them because the real world isn't like their little message boards  And that's a good thing exactly  So, you know to a certain extent you don't want them on the dark web where nobody can challenge them

I I was talking to some people from the team earlier this week and  There is one part of the process where someone who is a veteran and doing a disability claims appeal  Can get stuck in a queue that lasts nine to twelve months and just by writing some code to do some checking  There's the possibility to shave that nine to twelve months for people who really need it like you're over  85 years old or you have a life-threatening illness where that really makes the difference between when you might be able to you know  Get through a difficult situation versus be homeless  So if if that's the sort of thing where you might be interested in somewhere that renews your spirit and has a really big impact  Come check us out.
