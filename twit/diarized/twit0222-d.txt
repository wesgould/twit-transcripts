She's their, what are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Technology contributor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but you really focus on like the, like slankets and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.  I've become infomercial savings wench.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And now you're working on the Zynga story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I try to do some consumer stuff and actually I'm all Black Friday all the time  and boy do I have exciting deal news for you dudes today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Alright, this will be our Black Friday edition, ladies and gentlemen.  How exciting!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know, actual information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hello here, speaking of Black Friday.  Hey!  He's in a black mood.  He's wearing his Black Watch sweater.  It is John C. Dvorak in Plaid.  ChannelDvorak.com.  There you go.  Nice to see you.  We're all in studio today.  When I get Becky and John in one room together, I feel like I've, you know, this is magic.  And then when you pour a little alcohol on it, it bursts into flames.  If you insist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, and we actually have some, or Leo, where did you get this by the way?  Whole Foods.  The newest, I've been wondering.  It's the Georges de Buff.  Yeah, well it's one of the better ones, but it's a Beaujolais Nouveau, which is typically  Drek unless they have a really great year and this 2009 is notorious for being maybe  perhaps the greatest year in Beaujolais since the 40s.  I was surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We always get it for Thanksgiving, you know, it's kind of the tradition because it's a  very light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This would be an outstanding turkey wine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a very light wine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what you want to look for is the magnums of it.  They usually.  And put it aside.  But see this doesn't keep, you've got to drink it.  No, no, no, you don't want to put it aside.  The funny thing is some of these are made in such a way that they actually do keep because  they're not made in the true Beaujolais Nouveau style.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So a true Beaujolais might keep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, a true Beaujolais Nouveau won't keep.  Would not keep.  Got it.  It turns into foamy root beer by March.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's terrible.  Yeah, you have to drink it.  Yeah, this one here probably won't do that.  Is it any measure, I don't know why we're going in this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In tech, not in wine.  This week in tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The technology of wine.  Is it any measure of how good the general vintage will be if the Beaujolais Nouveau  is good or is that just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, no, no, they already know this is a great year.  This is going to be a good year.  Was it because of the rains, the weather?  Well, it wouldn't be because of the rains, that's for sure.  It's a confluence of events, gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I meant lack of rain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's just a combination of ingredients.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is going to be a good year.  This is, you heard it here first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, 2009 Beaujolais.  And their Beaujolais are great, a little wine they drink.  And when they taste this good.  This is a remarkably good Beaujolais.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a drinkable Beaujolais.  It's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, there is a lot of technology in the old wine sector.  Ground penetrating radar.  Forget it, forget it, Worley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The question in my mind is since you don't like Beaujolais from the sounds of it, why  do you have this wine here at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I drink traditionally, I do try the Beaujolais Nouveau.  We always have it for Thanksgiving.  It's a Thanksgiving treat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Plus, Leo Lepore wanted to show us that he could say de Beuf.  De Beuf, Georges de Beuf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It means I am the man of beef.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am.  I hear everybody's thanking Becky for trying to get us back on the tech track, which is  probably a good thing.  Although, you know, the problem, I'm very susceptible, like you are with Twitter, to go into the wine  track.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mr. Viniculture over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think wine is fascinating.  People always like it when you talk wine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And now we've covered it.  Next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Becky doesn't like wine.  She's a tea totaler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'm a beer drinker.  I wouldn't say that's what's going on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you're a beer drinker.  If we did beer, would you get all excited?  Oh, yeah.  So let's talk about Zynga.  I'm sorry.  Well, let's talk about Zynga later, but let's talk about Vertrue and what is it?  InvisiVilabon.  Invinion.  These are the web affinity companies that are being investigated right now by the US Senate  and Tuesday they had hearings and rightly so these companies are appalling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is a pretty interesting consumer story.  Basically, on certain websites during the checkout portion of your purchasing, a popup  window comes up and it's very confusing for some consumers where this popup comes from.  And if you enter certain amounts of information, your credit card, certain amounts, your email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's all you need to do.  I've had this happen.  So you go to orbits.com, 800 Flowers, they've all stopped it because of the heat.  Continental, they said, I think.  Continental Airlines.  There are companies that made more than $10 million.  Of course, they share with these so-called affinity, web affinity companies.  So what happens is you buy something.  I've had it happen at buy.com.  And before the checkout is done, it says, hey, great, thank you so much.  Would you like a coupon for your next purchase?  Enter your email address.  They don't say clearly anything else.  They don't say by entering your email address, you're doing anything.  But in the fine print, if you were to read it, it says, by giving us your email address,  you are signing up for a monthly charge to our loyalty program.  You get nothing for it.  They charge you between $9 and $12 a month on your credit card.  They know most people don't read their credit card statement.  And this is the creepy part.  You've only given them the email address.  Buy.com gives them the credit card information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the kicker for me because the token piece of advice for anyone purchasing online  is so long as you don't give your credit card information, you won't be charged.  And so that violates that singular premise of safety, that your credit card number is  invalid and that as the consumer, you can assume that upstanding companies will protect  that.  But the fact that real, legitimate companies are sharing your credit card number with a  scammy loyalty program is-  It's appalling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, not everybody in bed with each other, but don't forget the banks are part of this  scam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because they make a percentage too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but if you try to take this charge off your account, you can't get rid of it.  It's recurring.  You can't get rid of it.  You say, hey, I want to stop this.  Well, you can't really do that because when it comes in, we have to pay it.  And the banks will not actually help you at all.  The banks are the lowest form of scum when it comes to this sort of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that has not been, I didn't have one of these particular recurring charges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The recurring ones are impossible to get rid of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you say cancel from now on, it's not so hard.  If you say, I didn't know about this.  I don't want to pay for this.  I've been doing this for a year without my knowledge.  Good luck because you're not going to get that money back.  That's really hard to get back.  And I think you're right.  But they know what's going on.  They know what's going on.  Everybody knows what's going on.  In fact, in this Senate investigation, it was very clear that this worked because the  Web loyalty companies knew that no one knew they were getting charged and sad to say the  merchants did.  They're scamming to begin with.  I'm not going back to it.  These are the sites.  I will never do business.  So let's name them.  800flowers.com, buy.com, classmates.com, Columbia House, confa check.  Get ready for this one.  This makes me sad because I use them all the time.  Expedia.com and hotels.com, Fandango, FTD, Hotwire, Inque, Atelius, movie tickets.com,  Orbitz, Priceline, Redcats, Shutterfly, Travelocity, US Airways and Vistaprint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hello, Kayak.  They're gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's nobody else.  Kayak.  Now, those are the companies that made over 10 million bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Companies, it's even worse.  I hate to tell you.  The companies that are doing it or did it, they have partnered with Affinion, Web loyalty  or Vertru and they made between one and $10 million include Yahoo, Victoria's Secret,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tiger Direct, Pizza Hut, Lily and Vermin.  Everybody knows I buy stuff at discount houses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  eHarmony, Barnes and Noble, Bizrate.com.  These guys are all complicit.  That's just the bees.  So there's a link.  CNET did a great article on this and there's a link at the bottom.  We'll put it in our show notes.  I've got to pitch this story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a great, this is a classic consumer story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think a better thing to list, who's not part of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No kidding, because that's where I'm shopping from now and now.  Who?  Well, I don't, Amazon is not.  Thank you Amazon.  Thank you Jeff Bezos for having a little bit of cojones and not, you know.  Well, he probably knows what's going on.  He knows.  Well, this is the point is that Priceline, all these companies know exactly why it works  because you didn't know you were given the credit card and you didn't check your bill.  But let's stop for a second and just back out of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's Web loyalty?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's nothing.  What do you get?  You don't get, you know, maybe you'll get some scam, some spam.  Scam spam.  Scam spam.  Maybe you'll get a coupon code at some point.  Nothing worth $9 to $12 a month, that's for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just what would you possibly, there's so little I would pay $9 to $10 a month for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and they know that you don't think you're paying that money.  They know that, you know, what's really going on is they know that, well, I'm giving my  email address so I can get a coupon.  Right.  They know that you are being scammed.  Everybody knows that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, so let's transition to this other scammy story that Michael Arrington is really hot  on about Zynga.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we've talked a little bit about this before and this is similar.  I was explaining to Becky before the show how this, you know, this is the Farmville  thing we've been talking about, John.  Zynga's Farmville, Yo-ville, they do some online poker.  Mafia Wars.  Mafia Wars.  And it's, they're very smart.  They really know how to make addictive products that you just can't stop playing.  Have you played, have you fallen for this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is one of those things like smoking pot.  I never did it because I was afraid I would really like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're really smart.  Why did you drink Knob Creek then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was the other reason.  I like alcohol so much so why bother with illicit drugs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is mean.  I shouldn't really bring back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you have to mention the bourbon days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have some history together, you and I.  Stars.  But, it's all gone out of my head.  Wow.  So the way this works on these is you're at Farmville.  First of all, the whole notion of Farmville is virtual goods, right?  So you build this farm, but if you really want to have a nice farm...  You have to pay.  You have to have Farmville greenbacks and you cannot accumulate enough by playing the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the government's not subsidizing this type of farming, right?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, just joking.  Okay.  So, in order to enhance your farming, you get so hooked into this that you're really  willing at some point to give them real money.  And it's like real money for these virtual bucks which you then buy a virtual fence with.  However, I think the big bucks for them, and these companies, you know, it's estimated  that Zynga makes anywhere from 150 to 250 million last year.  The money comes from not that so much as people say, well, and this is why, it's the whole  thing is a tease.  Oh, you could give us real money or, hey, we'll give you bucks for free if you just  take these quizzes.  I did it once.  And you take an IQ test.  By the way, I think I scored very high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, good to know.  Good to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They hinted that I scored very, very well.  They said, if you'd like your score, give us your phone number.  That's when I stopped.  At that point, you either will get a very expensive SMS message.  That's one way these companies make money or they'll sign you up for stuff and they'll  send it to your cell phone bill.  So you'll see it on your cell phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is passive charging.  So they send you a text and it charges you 20 bucks on your phone bill which goes to  that company.  So scammy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's terrible.  Somebody's pointing out in the chat room that I do exactly the same thing.  Why?  But I don't.  You can subscribe.  If you want to support the show, you can donate.  It says on the button, recurring donation.  It says you get an email.  It says we're going to charge you every month two bucks.  Big deal, right?  But I'll admit the reason I do it is the same reason these guys do it is because if it's  a small recurring donation, I know I forget to cancel.  I'm still paying for Vonage service I haven't used in two years because it's a pain to  cancel.  But folks, if you do have a recurring donation and you decide that after this show you would  like to never send me any money again, just you go to your PayPal account and you cancel  it from there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very easy to do.  And this is part of the bigger issue of advertising, new media, business model.  How do people who create content make a living?  And this is a huge wider issue that is fundamentally answered with one word.  What's that?  Disclosure.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, at the same time, and you could disclose and find print.  I mean, there's disclosure and there's disclosure.  And I think you should try to act above board with people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, transparency and disclosure.  I mean, you have to have a non-shmarmy approach to this if you want people to trust you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been actually actively considering whether to discontinue the donations.  The donations made it possible for us to get started.  My original thought was we would only be on donations and it wasn't enough to run the  network to grow in the way we wanted to grow.  So we started taking advertising.  I probably should cancel the donations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you are one of the very few people in this business who could possibly use that  model.  The donation model or the advertising model?  When you did it to begin with, I was flabbergasted that you thought it would work and I was gobsmacked  that it did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It worked well enough.  From the 30s?  Gobsmacked is a good word.  It's one of my favorites.  It's a great word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I thought it was a good...  What does it mean?  You know, literally?  Yeah.  I would assume that it's of the same ilk as...  You got hit in your gob.  Yeah, your gob is your mouth, your kisser.  You got hit in your mouth.  Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what does that got to do with him asking for donations?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She was gobsmacked.  She was stunned.  Stunned?  Well, that's a different word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nonplussed?  What, tasered?  No, nonplussed.  Yes, nonplussed does mean that.  It's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's one of those...  Nonplussed is a weird word.  It's such a bad word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What does nonplussed plus mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It means impressed.  It doesn't mean what you think it means.  Look it up.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It means...  It means something weird.  No, you think nonplussed means I was bored by it.  I was like, oh, big whoops.  I think it means stunned.  That's what I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It means impressed, stunned.  Wow, I'm nonplussed.  Impressed doesn't mean stunned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can be impressed but I'm not stunned.  Okay, nonplussed.  What is this week in semantics?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Give me a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nonplussed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To be put at a loss as to what to think, say or do.  Bewildered.  That's a good way.  A state of perplexity, confusion or bewilderment.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not the same as impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But is it the same as gobsmacked?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what gobsmacked means.  Are you getting a little warm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was a little warm.  Yeah, she's had a strip down a little.  She's eaten up, ladies and gentlemen.  It was.  It's called strip twit.  It's a new show.  I like the idea.  This week in stripping.  I like the idea.  Strip twit.  We're going to play strip twit a little later on in the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But anyways, I think the bottom line is this also goes to transitioning to the interesting  Chris Perillo little slap fight that's going on about advertising in Twitter feeds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, we're all friends with Chris Perillo.  So we should...  No.  You're not a friend of Chris Perillo's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I just almost knocked the table over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was brilliant.  It really did sound funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It would have gone to you, by the way.  All the wine would have landed on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know, but I'm laughing because Leo says, we're all friends with Perillo.  And then he goes, no.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, not I.  No.  So what is...  Is this something on Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this a Twitter thing that's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I think this is that thing you responded to about Brooke Burke, which is...  So I think it's...  Was it...  No, it was Scoble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry, sorry, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was Scoble.  Not Perillo?  It was Perillo and Scoble, not Perillo and Erin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Scoble talked about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  He said Perillo was being a little bit on the devious side by not disclosing his...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, frankly, if you follow Perillo on Twitter, it's just nonstop coupons, right?  Really?  I don't.  Presumably because he's making money off of this.  It's advertising, although it doesn't say advertisement.  So is he complaining?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What would the guy...  Scoble's saying that there's...  Somebody give me the position, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That basically Perillo is promoting things in Twitter that he's getting paid for that  are basically advertisements without disclosing...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But isn't he subject to the fine from the FTC?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's not Twitter-based.  It's blogging.  So how does...  This is blogging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is blogging.  It's micro-blogging, is what they say it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, does the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So is Perillo susceptible to $10,000 fines every time he tweets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently, he says, I can't sell a sponsorship without using the pound ad tag.  But I'm looking here at, have fun with the Sony WX1.  This is an amazing indoor light, low-light point-and-shoot camera.  I see a link.  I don't see an ad tag.  And I think this is the problem with these is, is it an ad or does he like the Sony?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't tell.  I can.  It must be an ad because who can like a Sony?  I think it's an ad, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and he also says, show me one person who's promoting or positive about something  who's not getting paid for it.  That's another one of his recent tweets, which is not true, and that's his perception.  Well, look, I...  You know, I have to sign a contract that says, I will not cross that line.  Now, that's one of the benefits of working for old media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But do you do satellite media tours?  No.  So when you went to work for ABC, you had to stop doing SMTs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did them only when I wasn't doing any journalism.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why, by the way, you weren't on Twitter for a long time is because I didn't want to  have somebody who was working for companies that we covered.  No, that's not it.  You guys had to love those lovers quarrel.  That's what it was.  It was the knob creek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Blame it on the knob creek, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, and you know what?  I actually respect that because you shouldn't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why is he looking at me like that?  It's the word knob.  It's really disturbing in this context.  He's trying to see...  You know what he just did?  You know what he just did?  He floated something and he looked really carefully at me to see if I flinched.  He's checking me out.  He's saying, hmm, is there something going on here?  Did I flinch?  Did I pass the test?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You never flinch.  It's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd also like to point out that Dvorak is the one who had all the hot, cheeky friends  who he'd go to lunch with like Victoria Bacanio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She showed up again on the TV.  She's back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  She's on the insider.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's at KTLA.  She's working where Mikayla is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She finally got rousted from the insider, which is a tough gig for her.  She had to travel around the world and stay in first class hotels.  I don't know how she did that.  I don't know.  Actually, it was over the top in terms of harsh.  Was it?  I don't know.  What was the deal?  She had a radical schedule.  I mean, she was living it up.  She was basically staying at George Sank and flying first class around the world following  these various celebrities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's a player.  I love her.  I think Victoria is a very nice girl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She has a baby, so she settles in.  She had a baby?  Really?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Becky knows more about what's happening with Ashton Kutcher than she does with Victoria.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rumor scout?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  She has a baby, a cute little baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was talking to a producer at ABC News the other day, and Leo's going to love this.  He's a big fan of Twitter, and he was saying how Leo is a good example of someone who's  an old media guy who's reinvented himself in the new media format.  I think that this has been a very tricky negotiation of ethics, of maintaining a relationship of  trust with your viewers and your listeners.  I think ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think it's more important in new media or less?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's almost non-existent.  It seems to be.  Totally disagree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With people like Perillo, it seems to be.  Totally disagree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not just Chris isn't even.  He's the tip of the iceberg.  I mean, just the whole thing is a mess.  Well ...  And Chris has always been kind of a promoter, even in old media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But okay, so let me query this.  Who do you find influential?  This was the whole point of Scoble's thing, is he said that Leo's influence rates, he  may have a smaller audience than people who have more followers or ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He compared me to somebody named Brooke Burke.  Who's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't even know who that is.  She was kind of a model-y, beauty-queeny chick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's got like two million followers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She hosted a show of like Hot Babes Traveled the World kind of thing.  It wasn't exactly like that, but it was.  Now she has three kids, and she pitches for Skechers, and she's sort of this hot new mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But she was on Twitter's suggested user list, so she benefited with millions of followers.  Now, what he's mentioning is a service called Adly, A-D dot L-Y.  What Adly's doing, their other one's doing the same thing, is inserting ads into people's  Twitter streams and paying them.  They're claiming they're people making tens of thousands of dollars a week.  Well I thought I'd test this theory.  So I signed up.  Oh really?  Well, what the heck?  I'm not going to do it, but I signed up.  They said your price ...  You should test it.  Well, we'll see.  They said your price should be something like $2,830.  Per what?  Per week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Per post.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, per week.  They post several times a week.  Not every day, but I think several times a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Looks like these guys who put those little underlines all over your ...  Yes, B.S.  It's bogosity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't have any advertisers.  I can't believe anybody's doing this.  I mean, that's the key.  It's not so much getting Twitterers to sign up.  That's easy.  You get Brooke Burke to sign up.  Big deal, right?  She's got nothing to preserve.  But is an advertiser going to spend that kind of money?  But you can set your rate.  So now, $2,000's way low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was going to say that's $100K a year, and if that's the goose that ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That ain't going to put me ...  ... that's the goose that laid the golden egg.  So I said, I'll do it.  $10,000 a week, half a million a year.  We'll see.  If anybody ... And you know what?  That's a lot of money.  Okay, well, what if you took ...  They're not going to say okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well ...  Like ...  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I mean, that's just an ... And my point about the donation button is more that it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a transition because I think you made the point that that's how you got started, but  the media is changing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we're ad-supported now, and the amount of money we make in advertising ... Eclipse  is the amount on the donations, but I still do the donations not for the money, although  it's well appreciated.  It pays the rent.  It pays the ...  I do it for the money.  No, no, I do this for the money.  Believe me, I do this for the money.  It's a job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  I mean, seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  No, I do it for the money.  I'm not saying that, but I'm saying the donations are not a significant revenue source.  But I do like the idea that people do a buy-in.  I think I kind of like the idea that for two bucks a month you have an investment in Twitter,  and it's a way of saying ... Of giving people a way to participate and of buying in ... I  don't know.  I'm considering getting rid of it.  I'll give you a second at Scobleizer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're a walking billboard for Rackspace.  This is Chris's post somebody sent us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's true.  Oh, no, he did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your way of slash pound sign ad is superior to everyone else's.  I don't buy it, says Chris Perillo.  Now, we all do ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody said to me, well, what's the difference between inserting an ad that says ad into  your Twitter stream and what I'm about to do, which is an ad for Forza?  You're doing real ads.  I got a very ...  That's an ad.  It's a break-up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's very clearly an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I get up and walk out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is good.  I refuse.  I think advertising is evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, the true commie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How much do I send you every month?  I forgot.  Whatever the case is.  The answer is ...  John gets paid to do this show.  I just want you to know.  And he gets paid money from the ad revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that one of the points here is that it has to do with the medium.  So the biggest difference between when you do an ad and on Twitter is tone of voice.  Your tone of voice when you do an ad is completely different from when you're doing the show.  Not really.  No.  Yes, it is.  You become Radio Dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But he does that most ... He'll drop in the Radio Dude constantly.  But those are social cues.  For any reason whatsoever.  If possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Especially if he can do WKRP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think here's what I would say.  I agree with you.  Not so much the Radio Dude, but I say very clearly this is the ad.  I think the problem with the Twitter stream and the reason advertisers would buy a Twitter  stream is because it's not clear that it's an ad.  It mixes advertisement with editorial.  And that's valuable to an advertiser because it confuses the viewer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're trying to confuse people into buying your product.  By the way, how can you trust ... This reminds me of the spammers.  They trick you into opening email with a phony baloney ... I don't see too much of this needless  to say, but I do see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because he gets no spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You get a little thing that's saying, you know, I'm going to be here this weekend and  it's the name and you just don't get ... I don't know who is this.  And you click on it and it's like some bogus ad.  It's a Cialis ad.  I get this all the time.  So you say to yourself, could you trust these people to even ship you a product if you bought  it?  When they've obviously tricked you already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're liars.  Yeah, they're liars.  I think that ... Where's your pop filter, by the way?  I don't pop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, I do.  But I donated my pop filter to you guys.  Leo the Port does pop his peas.  I don't pop my peas.  I'm waiting for one that matches the gold mic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you better get a whole aisle.  Tell him, look, I couldn't use the pop filter because ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have a titanium pop filter.  I need a golden pop filter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You guys, we're getting to Inside Baseball and you've unwittingly transitioned me to  my next comment unless Leo needs to make an advertising break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am going to take a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  I'll tease you with this.  What is it?  I think that movie theaters are dead and digital movie downloads are going to live forever  because of news about popcorn.  That's a tease.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This doesn't have to do with the Eggo Waffle shortage, does it?  No, but you're close.  Is it related?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a tease.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go forth and advertise.  So that has to do with Archard Daniels Midland.  Did you see my red Mustang out there in the front?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that pretty?  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I paid full ... I just want to know you.  I paid full list for that.  I did not get a deal from Ford.  Why?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I tried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I tried to get a friends and family discount, but apparently I'm neither.  So I paid list.  But that's okay because I needed a new car.  I liked the car and what I really wanted to do is try the Ford SYNC because I knew we'd  be doing ads and I don't like to do ads for anything that I don't like and use.  I think that's one of the reasons the ads work here is because people know that I'm  not advertising something I don't use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you blow your nose?  That was disgusting.  Replace nose blow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I have the Ford SYNC in my car.  I'll take you for a ride, John.  You want the keys here?  Wait a minute.  Let me give you the keys.  Can you drive a stick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh.  Real funny.  It's got five speeds, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if you can handle that.  It's clearly marked.  First is forward, second, third, fourth, fifth, reverse.  And don't forget the clutch pedal.  Anyway, it has the Ford SYNC in it.  One of the cool things is Ford SYNC, let me just give you a synopsis of what Ford SYNC  is.  The hands-free Bluetooth connection that lets you control your car via your voice.  The whole point is you do not take your eye off the road or your hands off the wheel.  Anything you'd want to do, you can tell your car to do and it does.  Well, not anything, but for instance, I could say dial Becary Warley at home and it'll dial  you.  The voice recognition is excellent.  It doesn't have my number.  I don't have your number.  How did that happen?  Have you been hiding from me?  It will allow me to say read the front page of the New York Times.  I can get sports scores.  I can get weather reports.  I can even get, and this is kind of interesting, turn-by-turn directions.  I think there's a reason for this.  You have to license the maps.  They're expensive on the screens and that's why those GPS devices are so expensive.  And when you get in the in-car, it's really expensive.  This way you get turn-by-turn.  There's no visual.  It's talking to you.  It says turn left here, turn left, turn right.  It walks you through it.  It does a great job.  It knows your routes.  You can teach it your home, school, work routes.  It will check the traffic and say, oh, we got a traffic problem.  It'll reroute you.  I mean, it's super smart.  Ford Sync is, I'm telling you, the best I've ever used.  I get in the car and it automatically starts playing my books on tape.  I just love it.  I want you to find out more about it.  Now, unfortunately, you can't buy it aftermarket.  You have to buy a new Ford Lincoln or Mercury vehicle, I'm sorry to say.  That's the bad news, but you can go to SyncMyRidePodcast.com right now.  And take a look at the Ford Sync.  And in fact, while you're there, SyncMyRidePodcast.com, you can find out how you can win a Nano or  a Zune.  They're giving away 15 iPods, 15 Zunes, your choice.  Now through December 8th, all you have to do is tweet with the pound tag, the hashtag  SyncMyRidePodcast.  I guess that's in a way that's in tweet advertising, or is it?  I guess it is.  I mean, Twitter's smart.  They won't make that a trending topic, even though we get thousands of these tweets every  time I say this.  Pound SyncMyRidePodcast, that's the way to win.  And it's a way of their, for Ford to tell you that it works with the iPod Zoom, but  it also works with the Android, it works with everything.  Anything with a USB connection.  If you've got MP3s in there that are properly tagged, that knows the names of the songs,  you say play the Beatles, it plays the Beatles, play similar, play next track.  Give it a try.  SyncMyRidePodcast.com.  We do thank Ford for their support.  John!

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  John!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh my God, the humanity!  I don't think I can go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think I can go on.  Oh my God.  Guys, don't worry.  He's trashed my car.  It was just a wave file.  And I just got it waxed.  It did sound a little bit like a wave file.  It is really slick stuff, but enough of that.  So why am I not going to go to the movies anymore because of the great popcorn shortage  of 2010?  Yeah, do this.  What is going on here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, the thing that keeps me going to the movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, did you have a nice ride?  That was quick.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We just drove up and down the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I played the crash sound effect and it really got me up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Appeal that would be fun.  I have to learn how to drift and all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That thing definitely will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that when you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you start it up?  I drove it down to the end of the block and back.  You really did?  That's a longer ad than I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't realize I was talking so long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We drove really fast.  Yeah.  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doesn't it have that nice sound?  Yeah, it's a nice little car.  You guys have driven the Tesla, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, it's dead silent.  I have not driven it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's weird because it's so silent.  It is terrifying.  The acceleration in that car is scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It will pin your head back.  This will do it too, but it does it with noise.  I mean, you hear the engine doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's a little less scary when it's silent.  It goes, it's a little, you know, boom.  Right, G-Force.  Yeah.  No, I like the Tesla.  I like the Tesla.  I like the Tesla.  I like the Tesla.  I like the Tesla.  I think that's a very cool car.  If I could afford it, I would have bought one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It scared me to death driving it.  I almost crashed it in the first hundred yards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I could afford it and it had Ford Sync, I would have bought it.  They got to do a deal with Ford.  So we're talking about popcorn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John, what a face.  Did you see the face?  John goes, oh, we can talk about wine for five minutes, but oh no, Gufferman, we talk  about the popcorn.  I go to the movies exclusively for the popcorn.  I'm sorry.  Bull.  True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the Diet Coke.  Bull.  Do you know that a movie popcorn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is my point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you know how many calories?  How many grams?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, 100 calories in a medium bag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like three Big Macs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's 60.  Yeah, probably.  It's 60 grams of saturated fat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now is that if you don't, if I say no butter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It has nothing to do.  This is a no butter.  It's that they pop it in coconut oil.  It's got the equivalent of 36 strips of bacon.  I put it that way.  It sounds good.  I think I'll take it.  Plus eight pats of butter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Eight pats of butter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The equivalent saturated fat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, this is not possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's true.  I saw the same same report.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I mean, for me, 36 pieces of bacon and eight pats of butter.  Yeah.  I wonder the public is dropping dead.  Oh yeah.  And then you have that with a real Coke.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my God.  Get some sugar in there with your fat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Giant Coke with a big giant thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I know this sounds kind of creepy, but like that was a huge part of my experience  and it's hard to smuggle in popcorn.  No wonder you lost so much weight.  I know, right?  Wait, no, wait.  Huh?  This is not a, what are they called?  Pro, pro-anus side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a story from the New York Times.  The nutritional value of popcorn at the largest movie chains has changed a little.  It's been this way for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, what is a long time to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  15 years, it says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The last study.  That's not long at all.  That's 1985.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's not even that.  What was the dominant computer operating system?  Oh no, is this old guys in tech again?  DOS 5.  That was last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was last week.  That's from the early 90s in other words.  That's not that long.  When I was a kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was worse because they put butter on it.  Well, maybe it wasn't.  I know, but they did it in coconut oil.  A medium sized popcorn and medium soda, the nation's largest movie chains, packs the nutritional  equivalent of three quarter pounders topped with 12 pats of butter.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You were right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You were right.  So my point is, you know, all these experiential factors of the movie are disappointing.  That sounds exaggerated to me.  When you do the science, then you come back to me, Mr. DeVore.  Not that I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not that hard to imagine really.  You don't have to do the science.  You just make it up as you go along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, that's news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now this is medium.  Right, that's 20 cups.  It's 20 cups.  It's early 90s I said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But like the handfuls, a half a cup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's 40 handfuls of popcorn.  So anyways.  1200 calories.  It's only 30 calories per handful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all about digital downloads.  Do you not make...  In other words, you can't even have popcorn now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You guys are just buzzkills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I can make it worse if you'd like me to.  Do you know the plastics in the microwave popcorn you're having at home when you eat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I only have Air Pop.  I bought an Air Popper on Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're talking about Orville Redenbacher's microwave popcorn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The carcinogens in the microwave popcorn are scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of debatable which will kill you faster to be honest.  The fat or the carcinogens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Air Pop, baby.  And actually Regal Theaters, I have to give them a plug.  They said they tried to institute Air Pop.  Oh, it's tasteless.  But people were...  That's the problem.  I know.  But I think it's just sort of pathological.  The way you just kind of feed your face unconsciously.  That's what I love about popcorn.  Anyways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  According to Good Morning America, I never heard of them.  Are they good?  Where do you think I heard this story?  I still like...  I did it the other day.  My kids who had never had it before kind of fell over in a faint.  I popped the popcorn in a pan.  You go shhhhhh.  Right, right, right.  And I put real butter on it and they had this.  And they said, wow, what is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that funny?  They'd never had it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What have you been doing with your kids all these years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Microwave.  Which is a big mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So do you guys want to talk Black Friday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have some really good info for you.  Can I ask you one question though?  Why do they call it Black Friday?  Because it's really not...  Talk about marketing.  And by the way, isn't this a new term?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you remember this when you were a kid?  No, no, no.  I only remember Black Friday from about ten years ago to the current.  If you're in the red, you're not in the red.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're in the red, you're not making a profit.  You're in debt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but this is a new term that we're all of a sudden accepting as an old term when I don't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The black being in the black, it's an accounting term.  You change pens and you work in Black Pen.  And that means you're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then what's in the blue?  I don't know.  Same thing as black.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good to know.  Profitable.  So this is the day every year when certain retailers go into the profitable space.  Alright, enough said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we got the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually think though that it...  We were talking earlier about, not on the show, but before the show began, about spin  and how they call prunes dried plums and call dried cranberries craisins.  Craisins.  They, they.  They.  Well, they should change their name for Black Friday because it sounds like, frankly, it  sounds like a holocaust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, a guy at Walmart, a temporary worker, got trampled to death last year, so I think  it's appropriate.  Now, mind you, Walmart is instituting new policies.  What are they doing?  I don't quite understand what this means, but they've said that they're placing...  24-7, I thought.  No, no.  Well, some stores are, but some stores are placing waiting pods throughout the store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's a waiting pod?  I have...  It's like metering traffic on the freeway.  I don't know the rules.  I'm just reporting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're going to have lights that say, stop, go?  I don't know.  Maybe...  Do you think the people who trample this worker are going to follow the lights?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I go every year to Best Buy and do this live shot, and the people lined up around the  blocks.  That's amazing.  And when they leave, the detritus of alcohol is insane.  Oh, they're boozed up.  It's no offense to Best Buy.  They do a really good job with security, and they work really hard on it.  But if you're going to be in line from midnight Thanksgiving till 5 a.m. the next morning...  It's a party.  It's a total party.  It sounds like fun.  Yeah.  Actually, it's a social event.  I want to go now.  Yeah.  And that's the other thing about Black Friday.  It's a group think.  It's a social event in a world where we're all sort of spread out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we should go with a hot dog stand.  That's a great idea.  Well, think of the money you could make.  Jello's shots.  Start about...  Knob Creek.  Hey.  Yeah, but the hot dogs stand, we need a license for that too.  But not as bad as a liquor store.  You could just keep them under your coat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So some Walmart stores are going 24-7.  Hot dogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Get your hot dogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Toys R Us is opening at midnight on Thanksgiving night.  And a lot of stores have tickets that they give out.  Why don't you just go shopping tomorrow?  Why is there the point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The prices can be insane.  I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, prices.  For instance, Walmart, Blu-ray DVD player from Magnavox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Seventy-eight bucks.  Seventy-eight bucks.  The next best deal is $149 for the Sony Blu-ray player, which is pretty much everywhere at  Target, Walmart, Kmart.  I think.  It's pretty ubiquitous.  $149 is the next step up, and that's a Sony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Would you run out and buy a Blu-ray player though?  I mean, for 78 bucks?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'll tell you why.  Why?  It depends on what your time is worth.  You're going to have to wait in a long line.  It's going to be a hassle.  It's going to be two or three hours out of your day.  It's people like you that make Best Buy work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because they go, well, we don't have to charge that great deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My whole point was the thing I just said, which is for many people it's a social event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see what Amazon.  Wait, I'm going to go to Amazon.  Now, they won't have the Black Friday deals up though.  It's a social event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, Amazon.  Amazon actually doesn't have a Black Friday.  Have you seen that website that has all the-  They do a gold box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you seen the website that has all those pictures of those people in Walmart, you know,  wearing weird clothes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  Oh, you sent it to me, that person who had that bike shorts with the-  Oh, and it's beyond that.  Oh, I love that.  I love that.  There's a website dedicated to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  This is your social event you're talking about.  Oh, so brilliant.  I'm going to put it on the PeopleOfWalmart.com.  Oh, you sent it to me.  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thanks, Dan.  Okay, so that's Blu-ray players, $79 for the Magnavox, $150 for the Sony.  Those are the two variables.  What Blu-ray brand is it?  Magnavox.  Yeah, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, my gosh.  Guys wearing a G-string.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, scary.  Oh, that's attractive.  Wow.  Yeah, I would wear a bikini top.  People of Walmart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That being said, Walmart has, I would have to say if I was going to pick one store to  go to for Black Friday, it would be Walmart.  And Walmart's the only store that will match Black Friday deals.  All the other stores who have a price matching policy have an exemption for Black Friday  or time specific deals.  So Walmart's the only one that will match if it's the exact same item.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you get a deal somewhere, just bring it to Walmart and say, hey, look, the newspaper  or whatever and they'll match.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Now, interestingly enough, let me hit a couple other categories because I think this is important.  GPS.  GPS is 4.3 inches or better are where the Sweet Point.  I got a Ford Sync.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't really need that.  You got a Ford Sync.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  4.3 inches, 99 bucks.  Radio Shack for the TomTom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow, that's a big screen.  99 bucks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Down from 249 bucks at Target.  Staples has a 7 inch Magellan for 199.  Walmart has a 3.5 inch TomTom for 59 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, are you getting this from like BlackFridayInfo.com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  BFads.net.  BFads.  It is the best.  Is that the best one?  Because what's great is you can search by category, by product name or by store and  it'll pull up all examples.  So if you know that you want a 7 inch GPS, it'll pull it up.  You and Walmart.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  This is bad.  I shouldn't be doing this.  You can go on for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You cannot bring up the one with the bike shorts.  Look at this one.  Oh!  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that really back fat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's back fat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know what's great about back fat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It looks like front something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know what's great about back fat?  You don't really need to cover it up like you would the front fat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How does she like bifurcate it that way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's wearing, the top is too tight.  That is impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm so sorry.  Wow.  I have to apologize, Becky.  That's an image I'll never get rid of.  I'm sorry.  I burned that into your brain.  And for those of you not watching on video, just say thank God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hot toys, no Black Friday deals.  What?  Juju hamsters, no Black Friday deals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that the hot toy this year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a scarcity issue and this is something that's really interesting to consider.  Wait a minute, say this again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Juju hamsters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Juju pets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Juju?  Z-H-U.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Juju.  Juju.  I'm sure there's a proper Mandarin pronunciation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What about it?  Who buys this stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who buys this crap?  It's a sub $10 kind of interactive pet thing that you would get for about a five-year-old.  And they've been under $10, but this is an issue this Black Friday, scarcity, because  a lot of these retailers have been so bearish about what the holiday buying season is going  to be like that they've understocked.  And so these really hot items, Juju pets, Mattel Mindflex, Barbie Fashionista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Every year this happens, right?  There's the Tickle Me Elmo.  There's something that you can't keep in stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think in years prior it's been more of a collective desire for a certain pet,  I mean a certain toy.  And this year I feel like it may have more to do with forecasting and inventories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The good news is there is a Juju Pet iPhone app.  Oh, thank God.  So if you can't, if you get home.  Who needs this crap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Parents who promised it to their kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You saw the Office episode where Dwight buys out every Barbie at some sort of weird doll  in town.  Yeah, I remember that.  Last year I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what's interesting about this from a sort of a technology perspective is they've  taken these really popular items off of the websites.  So I can't find these items on the websites for Toys R Us or Walmart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're not doing this for your kids, are you?  Oh, heck no.  They're too young.  They're not old enough yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what they're getting this year?  Duplo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How old are your girls?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Boy and girl.  They are going to be two in January.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So can you get us a Slanket?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know I brought some infomercial products.  One.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you didn't bring a Slanket.  She's the queen of Slankets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I brought some jammies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like little kid jammies because you never know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I can give them as a good gift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.  Just a couple other interesting questions I have for you guys.  Oh, one other thing.  Target.  Target has a $3 coffee maker, $3 Tarjay, $3 toaster, $3...  I'm giving everybody in my family a $3 toaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, Happy Christmas.  $3 toaster for you.  Enjoy.  Such a deal.  Such a deal.  Oh, you want more?  I got $3 coffee maker.  You love it.  That's $6 I give you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are so many things wrong with that.  I like that voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's kind of a Miss Swan as a male.  I never use it.  It's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It could be Sub-Saharan.  It could be Asian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know when I was in Dubai, the funniest thing happened.  A bunch of Arabs came up to me and said, how come you never do Arab accent?  I said, what do you mean?  I mean, people hate it when I do the accent.  They think I'm mocking them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just on the street, people came up and said this to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm huge in Dubai.  You don't know.  Oh, I'm huge in Dubai.  They came up and said, I can't do it because I can't do it.  What is an Arab accent?  I don't even know what it sounds like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's something like one of the accents.  It's an accent.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I could see you working on that from now on.  I'll work on it.  I'm going to work on it.  Did you know that one of those fake islands that they're creating is actually in the  shape of Leo's head?  He's so big in Dubai.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm huge in Dubai.  Actually, that was one of the islands that canceled.  It was kind of sad.  So there's just the nose.  I saw it.  They brought me out there in the boat and there's just a nose hanging in the water there.  It's really kind of depressing, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's so sad.  I think it's thanks to Dubai.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think 14 Chinese people died to make that nose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's basically something like a Middle Eastern accent in general.  But what is a Middle Eastern accent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't do that.  It's got to be like a...  I can't...  That's Russian.  It's a problem for me.  It keeps changing to other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's good.  So I have to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the family guy has Arabs occasionally.  Do they have Arabs on the family?  I'll steal it from him.  Yeah, I'll steal it from him.  He's Seth MacFarlane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you see that comedy show he did?  No.  Where him and what's her name, the woman who also used to be with the...  She's great.  She's the one who dismissed Swan, that crazy character.  And the two of them were live on stage doing a song and dance.  I'll bring you a DVD of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it must be on YouTube by now.  So here's where I need your advice.  Yeah, just go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because you are two sages, aka old dudes, who've been in this business for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One...  Ask for more money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's my advice.  One, netbooks.  So we're in this transitional period where what we've got is I, as...  I can't recommend in good faith to people who are watching Good Morning America to buy  the Linux netbook.  So the problem is that you've either got Vista or you've got Windows 7 Home Edition Starter  Edition.  Yeah.  So it's $80 to upgrade.  Starter's okay.  It's okay?  Yeah, Starter's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's okay?  For a while, Microsoft made noise about...  Press there's a button on the right.  For a while, they made noise about Starter only allowing three applications and the hardware  guys said, you can't do that.  Starter's fine.  I mean, for a netbook, it's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, so they should do that instead of Vista for sure.  It's worth the extra.  It's about $40 more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And now we can do another story.  It should be the same price.  Google Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, all netbook all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is going to be not only netbook but require an SSD.  Google's going to hold very tightly to what hardware you get it on and the only way you  can get it if you don't buy it on a netbook...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For those who aren't sure, Solid State you're talking about, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Solid State, right.  And it will only be available next fall for the next holiday buying season.  But if you don't want to get a Google approved netbook and they're working with all the big  netbook companies, you'll have to build it yourself from scratch.  Now you can do that right now.  I've talked to people who have already installed Google Chrome OS.  Interesting choice though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so that was my question again is because we're transitioning, let's say in six...  Well, they say it's going to come out in a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  September, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So at that point, if you could wait a year, is that going to be a radical drop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't recommend netbooks to people in general.  I think that they are so low and slow that they're painful.  This is a nice one.  I gave you the Samsung NC20 which has almost a full size keyboard, a large screen, I think  it's a 10 inch, it's a big screen, it's a very nice screen.  I think that's usable.  But it's the least I would recommend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But see, this is where I sometimes think you guys are in the bubble.  This is a price point...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not in the bubble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't recommend it.  No, no, she says you don't recommend it because you don't realize how price sensitive people  are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, this is the price point and this is for people who have good jobs but...  I know.  You know, they've already made that investment and they're down to the bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if all you want to do is get email and surf, this is fine.  I think what happens is they start to say, but then now I'd like to edit some video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or they want to do this or they want to do that.  So they have to buy two machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, but let's say 15% of the population wants more.  This is still a good deal.  So that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm against this kind of thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is what the criticisms of Google Chrome OS were is that it locks you into this kind  of inflexible system where you're offline and you can't do anything.  You can only run applications in the browser.  And a number of people like us, PC World editors and so forth, have said, well, aren't people  going to want to do more?  They're going to start wanting to run applications.  I don't know.  Do you think that's the case?  You're not a cloud fan, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, not really.  I mean, I am.  I mean, I think the cloud has its own...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chrome OS only makes sense in the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I think the Chrome OS is something of a red herring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a gift for you and I forgot to give it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, Sergey himself just off the record made a comment that, you know, well, yeah,  eventually Chrome and Android will be the same thing.  Well, that's interesting.  And so this whole thing, I think, is just a way to jack around Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It puzzled me because they do have...  I mean, Android is a very good OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they're putting it on netbooks.  They're doing this and that and the other thing with it.  So I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the whole thing's a scam.  We talked about SSD drives, right?  Yeah.  And were you happy with your SSD or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You didn't notice a huge improvement.  I guess it was Gibson that was saying...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, I didn't have the huge improvement because they didn't have the motherboard to  support the absolute max speed.  But the point is it's expensive.  What was the capacity?  There's still an 85.  Well, I was going to give...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have, you know, a new egg had...  Gigs?  I...  I just bought a new egg.  Yeah, I have 85 gigs.  New egg had a deal, 160 gig Intel X25, which is the one you want for under 500 bucks.  They had a big deal and I bought one for you, John, but I forgot to bring it, but I'm going  to give it to you, be your Christmas present.  But you need a machine to put it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got a new machine I'm building right now with an i7 in it.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Perfect.  So pull out the hard drive.  160 gigs is enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's plenty, really.  OPS, one quick thing to last Black Friday deal.  Yeah.  Terabyte, 59 bucks.  That's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We buy...  Yeah, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Terabyte, 59 bucks.  I'm buying...  We buy Caviar Green drives, a new egg, a terabyte and a half for 100 bucks.  The prices have tumbled.  Insane.  Tumbled for hard drives.  Of course, I go through quite a few.  You see we have them all up there.  That's our storage.  Wow.  Wow.  I'll have to take you upstairs and visit the sand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, so you ready for my next trend question?  Yes.  California says that by 2011, energy consumption on television sets that need to be sold in  California need to be reduced by 30%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did they approve that rule?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Five to zero.  And then by 2013, energy consumption down by 50% on television sets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  50% from what?  Today's average?  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The specifics here, I don't know.  Yeah, there you go.  50% from what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this car...  That was my question.  Buy now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Buy now.  Yeah, but is this even a usable 50?  Plasma, is it any good?  I get the Samsung.  Yeah, it's 100 bucks better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.  I think so.  I think so.  I think so.  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's stupid.  So the legislature has now said you can't buy an inefficient TV... actually, not legislature,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  as you said, regulators is the CEC.  Starting in 2011...  I want to see these criteria because I wonder what it's based on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's 30% reduction against current standards.  Standards.  So what that means is uncertain, but let me give you an example.  So an LCD compared to a plasma is supposed to be a 30% reduction in energy.  Already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Minimal.  Yep.  And the new LED backlit TVs are even more efficient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I've heard those are like 30% even more.  And you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're not plasma, but they're very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think that this is the year to buy the plasma because as California goes...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because we want to consume more energy.  I think if you really want to consume more energy, you should buy now.  That's why I bought the Mustang.  I feel that it's my right...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To get a V8 finally, Leo.  How long does it take for you to get a clue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what I figured out?  I don't drive much.  I drive a few miles to and fro work if I drive.  Rationalization.  I figured this is the last time I'm going to ever be able to buy a gas car like this.  A V8.  A V8 gas car.  Make sure you mention that part.  But historically, do regulations like this work where the California Energy Board says  you can't buy this TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everyone's creating a parallel to the Air Resource Board's mandate about the emissions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fluorocarbons or emissions, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so in California, our emission standards are very different, but here's the difference.  Basically, let me give the back story.  When California changed the emission standards on cars, many car manufacturers...  Was that a cow farting?  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to play it a little bit.  It's an Arab accent somebody said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh no, I'm sending you a note to another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's so interesting because I was doing this really fascinating dissertation on EPA

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  standards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Keep going because we've got this all on tape.  I'll review it later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Car manufacturers basically said, well, if we got to do it in California, we might as  well do it everywhere.  And cars became lower emitters.  But the difference is in California, we have to have a small check every year.  We actually have a regulatory board...  Which is a total scam, by the way.  Right.  But it enforces this.  What?  It's a scam?  Well, this is yet again another Dvorak conspiracy.  Why is it a scam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a total scam.  You ever sit down when you go to one of these places?  For one thing, there's two kinds of car checks.  You can go to the check only or you can go to the check it and fix.  And the two of them, one of them, you have to go one year to one the other year.  And it's like a hundred bucks just for having to stick a thing up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Every year I have to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep.  And so you ask the guy...  Next time you go and talk to the owner and he's going to go on and on about, oh, they  make us buy this equipment and then they discontinue it and then the maintenance on this thing,  we barely make any money.  The whole thing is a ripoff.  The car check thing is a ripoff, a time waster.  The smog check thing is a fraud.  The whole thing is just a bad...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, ask me what this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you...  Is that the world's smallest violin?  She thinks it's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We just need more ripoff.  Oh, it's so terrible living in California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, wait a minute, let me ask you this.  Well, wait a minute, let me ask you this.  California, we got 10% personal income tax sales tax in San Francisco is 10...  But isn't the air quality better?  Look it, go to LA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's much better.  that forces people to be in compliance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That ain't going to happen with Plasmas.  Okay, so I live in California.  I buy a plastic car.  I buy a plastic car.  This is the real deal.  Okay, so I live in California.  I buy a energy hog plasma from a company that's in Virginia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the unintended consequences that you're going to get a lot of people buying  energy hog TVs as we ramp up to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What does energy hog mean to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My plasma.  What?  Give me the numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They use a lot of power.  Yeah, I know they do.  But what's the number compared to an old tube?  Let's start with that.  Give me some numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want some numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's 500 watts, something like that.  Five?  You think it's 500 watts to run a plasma?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's older plasma.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Do we know or we're just making it up?  I made that up at a thin air.  Anybody know in the chat room, 600 watts according to CNET.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just had looked at a chart on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the chart from CNET.  Let's look at the power consumption chart.  This is actually great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's considerable, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a lot.  It's not insignificant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it as much as your 1,000 watt i7 PC sitting on your desktop?  Is it that much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's, I'm afraid, next, to be honest.  If they're doing this to TVs, how long before they say you can't buy a power hog computer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's going to be a gamer's tax.  It'll totally be on big towers.  A gamer's tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, when you buy a car, I looked at the Shelby, $1,000 gas guzzler tax, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not to mention what's on your insurance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm on this chart here.  Where does it say 600 watts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was paraphrasing what I'd read, which was it was a 30% decrease from plasma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The largest is a Panasonic TH65VS, a 65 inch plasma, 575 watts.  That's a big monster.  The 50 inch, 535 watts.  So Leo Laporte's guess was dead accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you get a 30% decrease.  So the LCDs are chewing it up too.  It's the plasmas that are really bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The plasmas are the hogs.  The old LCDs are...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The old LCD is a Sony 52 inches, 285 watts, but most LCDs are lower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then when you go to these LEDs, it's much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's really where we're going.  The truth is, an LED backlit LCD is a better TV anyway.  Well, and that's the bottom line.  Maybe not the plasma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like, okay, we're going there anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did we do a calculation on the watts, the number of hours of television you watch, the  price of a backlit LCD, which is not cheap, compared to a $600 plasma over a two year  period?  That's the calculation.  Someone in the chat room, quick.  Number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are you reading?  Freakonomics again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is the deal here?  Way to go, Levitt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got a statistic for you.  I got a statistic right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Driving my Mustang is more efficient if you're a beef eater.  Oh yeah, yeah.  Ten miles to the gallon you get.  Oh, this is ridiculous.  Walking.  Ten miles to the gallon if you lived on beef.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's even, you really save a lot of money if you're a Mustang owner and you're  dead.  That's where you get the maximum benefit.  You do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's such a good point.  I'm the little old lady from Petaluma.  The whole little old podcaster from Petaluma.  I just arrived at a church on Sunday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The super freakonomics thing about cows, cars and canoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's a 196 watt plasma from Panasonic, 58 inches.  That's better than the LCDs.  That's pretty impressive.  How many 50-inch?  What, what?  A Vizio plasma, 32 inch, which I didn't know they made them that small.  Oh yeah, I have one.  122 watts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you don't want a 32 inch TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, but LCDs are plasma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Plasma is right here.  Oh no, mine's LCD.  I'm looking at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Listen, there are low power plasma.  You greatly improved the power consumption of plasmas.  Maybe that's what this regulation is intended to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's fine.  I'm just saying that you're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's an RP TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rear projection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, duh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my God.  That was so exciting for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was sure she was going to say rear penetration, but that's another matter for our day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, let's take a little break before Leo...  There's a 50-inch Hitachi with 236.  You know about Squarespace?  You ever use Squarespace?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll put a link to that chart in the...  It is a good chart.  Mr. Anomaly.

Transcript:  I'm from country, you know, and I got the taxi and the taxi have like the second messenger  behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The taxi has about the second, but it sounds...  No, it's not working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You cannot do an example of an Arab accent that has to be about taxis.  You are wrong.  You are not a progressive.  $3 coffee pot!  I'm taking your liberal sticker away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the $3 coffee thing you do is good.  $3 coffee pot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The secret behind exceptional websites is squarespace.com.  This is hosting, yes, but software, incredible software.  We use it for our inside twit page.  You're seeing people...

Take a look at the examples if you want to just get a sense of what you can do.  You know, when you go to a WordPress site, you know it's a WordPress site.  When you go to a Squarespace site, it looks just like a great site.  Here's Dane Cook's site, danecook.com.  Take a look at that.  Squarespace.  Squarespace.  You wouldn't know, but it's beautiful.  And I'll have to tell you, it's so easy to maintain, so easy to post on.  It's the best.  And you never go down because Squarespace uses virtualization technology.

Becky, it's so nice to see you.  I'm so glad you're here.  Is this your full time job doing the ABC thing?  Pretty much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm working on a documentary right now about how geeks are coming to the rescue on global  warming and climate change.  Oh, that's neat.  Doing it with Morgan from Tech TV.  Morgan Webb?  Morgan, no, Morgan Fang Schmidt.  Remember Morgan Fang Schmidt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought Morgan Webb married you, sir.  Oh, oh, oh.  Morgan Webb Fang Schmidt.  I'm sorry.  Oh, the Morgan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, not Morgan Webb.  What is she on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Morgan Fang Schmidt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember he was a shooter for news?  Good guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyways, I thought you would know him.  Hi, Morgan.  Sorry, I forgot you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, he didn't work on screen savers or anything.  He was on tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, there were a lot of people towards the end at Tech TV.  I'm often embarrassed by meeting people who say, oh, you remember me?  I was at Tech TV.  And I go, no, I don't remember you.  I stuck to myself pretty much towards the end.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You were a loner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was a loner.  You were a loner, dude.  I was a troubled loner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You were not a loner.  He was a troubled loner.  I was a troubled loner.  I'm just going to intersperse some great deals as we go along.  Sure, please.  At Costco on Black Friday and going forward, you can get $60 worth of iTunes gift cards  for $48.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And after I go to the taxi, one lady, she smells very bad.  I look at the driver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And a $3 coffee pot at Target.  $3 coffee pot!  Yep.  Don't worry, it'll come back.  I'll come back and throw some deals out there and see how fast you can get your Arab accent  going, which I do not find even remotely appropriate, Leopold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is not even close.  I know.  You know what?  That $3 toaster thing you do where that voice is.  $3 toaster!  It's close enough.  You think?  You can use it, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I could just say it's an Arab accent.  Here, by the way, I went to Yahoo Answers.  Question, how do I speak with an Arab Middle Eastern accent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there's an answer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the answer is a bit of a tricky one.  Arabic is spoken right across from the Atlantic coast of Africa to the Persian Gulf.  And classical Quranic Arabic is learned and quoted by Muslims in places like Sub-Saharan Africa and the Himalayas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, that's an Arab who was educated in London.  That is very good.  You're like Henry Higgins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that sounds more like a Pakistani.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That pretty much makes you some strange girl from the street in Northern London.  I don't know.  Oh, I'm so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This show is degenerating.  There's another 100.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple One for sale on the eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple One, yeah.  And I wonder whose it is because there's only...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some dude in...  It's a second generation owner who wasn't the original.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because Waz has a couple.  I know Waz.  Is it the wooden Apple One?  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It has to be just a bag of parts with the original label.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You had to build it yourself, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It comes with a signed letter from Steven Jobs explaining how to connect up a monitor and keyboard.  That's pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Steven.  Steven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's pretty funny.  Is that on eBay?  What's the current price?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's 50K.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Which is funny to me because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  Well, I want you to...  Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here we go.  This is what the numbers I'm looking for.  They're the same chart.  They have cost per year.  Okay.  You've completely...  Now, if you take...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just give yourself a minor transition instead of just going off on your wacky tangent.  This is how he is.  The nice one to finish this.  What?  What is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's sold.  It's causing you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's sold for 50,000.  It's sold.  No, he's talking about the Plasmas again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, jeez.  The cost per year at the most expensive Plasma is 82 bucks compared to like 40 bucks or 27.  And the point is if you're getting the thing for 595 bucks, it's going to take you 10 years  of having the more cheap one.  John, John, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but I think John makes a really good point is if you're a savvy consumer and cost is  everything, buy the Plasma now because it's quite possible that these uber-cheap Plasmas  will not exist in the very near future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The California Energy Commission is not trying to save you money, John.  They're trying to save the planet.  Excuse me?  Hello?  Hello?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Al Gore is here with a whip on your back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Earth to no agenda.  Mr. Tinfoil had here.  The Apple One computer sold for 50,000, but you know, I think this is kind of like when  we sold the screensaver's refrigerator for like 10,000.  Yeah, did you ever get the 10 grand?  No.  Well, it's a scam.  It's so easy on eBay to bid and not pay, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you have to pay him a commission though, commission on...  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's charging an additional $3,000 for shipping?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Shipping.  What?  For shipping?  It's a bag of parts.  It weighs less than a pound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's say he actually gets paid.  You know who's really, really mad?  Who?  Ron Wayne.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The third guy.  Ron Wayne was one of the people who started Apple with Jobs, Woz, and Wayne.  And it got to a point where they needed some money and Jobs sold his VW bug.  Steve Wozniak sold his HP calculator to raise enough money to buy parts for the Apple One.  And Ron Wayne said, I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  His risk tolerance was a little limited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't...  I...  This isn't ever going...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he quit.  He quit his stake, his 10% stake for $800.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Worth billions now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Billions!  So this guy's ticked.  It's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's like the Pete Best of the computer world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he's the guitarist from...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pete Best was the fifth Beatle.  Right, right, right, right, right.  He's the guy they replaced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Best was fired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he was replaced.  Yeah.  So Ron Wayne was actually volitional.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He just...  This is a great parable in risk tolerance.  The guy...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but how do you know?  There's a million guys...  It happens all the time.  More importantly...  My theory is the dude had a kid.  The guy who sold his 10% share in Pets.com for $1000 made the right choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fair enough.  So Drew NL, I guess from the Netherlands, he says the savvy consumer is going to say  the heck with the crappy LCD and go with the plasma quality that blows the doors off the  LCDs.  Thank you, Drew NL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And 90% of consumers think that LCDs are much, much, much better than the plasma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Most people prefer LCDs.  They don't get it.  They don't know how.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a bad reaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you know why it is?  Because you go in the store and the LCD is brighter in a bright store and it looks good  and people are gravitating toward bright pictures.  They're overly bright pictures.  But if they were to get at home and put it in a home theater environment, the plasma  is blacker better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, that was my...  I bought the plasma when I had the dark room.  Now I have a room with 183 windows.  It's no good.  It's brutal to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You need an LCD.  It's too reflective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now I'm getting people complaining about my discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Samsung 50-inch LED backlit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's okay.  I'm done.  What discussion?  Not the plasma.  This guy says he's complaining.  He says, you know, this is not interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is news you can use people.  Nobody goes after my John.  We have some guys who say LCD is better than LED.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is he even talking about?  Maybe he prefers $6 coffee pot.  Three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Three.  Three dollar coffee pot.  No, you're yuleting in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a yuleting free quit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now you're getting us in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are you afraid of, Eric?  Bomb the cottage.  No, they're kind, loving people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Will you get to another story?  I'm trying to move the show along.  Wow, you made John uncomfortable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dell's profit.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Share.  I think this is the end of Dell's fall.  I think they're going to snap out of it.  Is it going to turn around?  Have you seen that new Dell?  Have you actually seen one of that Dell that's super flat thing that's even thinner than  anything?  I have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I own one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Dell Latitude Z. Love it.  No, no, the new one.  The crazy one.  It's not out yet.  Oh, the Adamo.  Yeah, the Adamo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Z is as thin.  The Z is a USB plug.  Do you have one?  It's not here.  It's at home.  Yeah.  It has the, you know what I like?  It has the inductance charging.  So you have a little stand you can put on there.  And it has a wireless.  And there's more.  Ultra wide band.  Yeah, for a four grand.  It has the ultra wide band dock.  It's kind of expensive.  It's very expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this other thing is kind of, it's awkward.  The Adamo is.  Because when you open this thing, the thing lifts up.  It's got that old fashioned style.  I can't see using it in an airplane.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Probably not.  The greatest point about the Adamo, it had the worst timing of any release ever.  Just as the market completely tanked and people were getting laid off left, right, center.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And just as the Battlestar Galactica show ended.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is so true.  It was ridiculously expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why did they name it after Admiral Adamo?  I have no idea.  Makes no sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really like the Z. I have to say I really like the Z.  What's the Z?  That's the Latitude Z.  It's as thin as the Adamo.  It's got a 16 inch screen.  But is it open normally?  Yeah.  Doesn't have that slip slide in the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The elite ones open backwards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the standard ones are clamshell.  And the elite models, they started with the XPS.  Wasn't it when they first did this where it opens so that it slides out and it's up like  this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is talking about that weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, it stinks.  Why?  Because you can't use it on an airplane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You should fly up front.  I think you'd have a better experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I try to fly up front, but their seats are always hogged by a bunch of people with upgrades.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that a computer you take on an airplane?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't you take a computer on an airplane?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How much does that thing weigh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mine weighs four and a half pounds.  It's kind of heavy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Heavy?  Well, I use a two and a half pound portage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you have that little portage.  Do you like that?  Is it too small?  No.  It's basically a netbook.  But it's got power.  Yeah, because it's got real power.  Dell's quarterly report reported a 54% drop in net income in the third quarter, 15% decline  in revenue.  I mean, it's not good.  You look at Apple reporting huge, $4.7 billion in revenue.  47% increase.  47% increase, yeah.  So what does that mean?  Does it mean PCs are not doing as well as Macs?  Does it mean that Macs are less economy sensitive?  I think that must be what it means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where's Dell's competitive smartphone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're doing one.  They did one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Going to China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It looks so ugly.  Have you seen their smartphone?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, multi-platform has to be huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you played with the Android?  I'm liking the Android.  Yeah, I've got to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I don't like the keyboard.  Sitting in my house, I've got to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't like the keyboard.  The keyboard's too flat.  I'm really liking it, I have to say.  And I do think that Google is going to win.  Is this the Verizon Droid or is this the...  Yes, the Droid.  Google is going to win.  Who's been saying that all along?  You were right.  Well, it's kind of hard to bet against Google, to be honest, but Google is going to win.  I'm convinced now because it's an open platform.  Developers are moving to it.  This week, we saw two big Apple developers say enough.  App developers.  It's heavy.  It's six ounces heavier than the iPhone, but it's solid, so it feels like it's heavier.  Not Apple developers.  Here, compare it to the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  iPhone app developers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The guy who did the Facebook app for the iPhone said, I'm never developing for the iPhone  again.  He's made it for the Android and likes it better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The screen's a little better with the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I'll tell you, the really big defection is Rogue Amoeba.  Rogue Amoeba is one of Apple's premier developers.  They do really incredible audio software for OS X.  For Rogue Amoeba to say, we're not going to develop for the iPhone anymore.  By the way, this is turning away a lot of money.  These iPhone apps make a lot of money, but I can understand why developers are saying,  but we'll spend a lot of time, energy, and money developing a product, and we don't know  if Apple, for bizarre reasons, is going to say, sorry, you can't sell it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I give you a 30% downgrade on veracity when it comes to open source issues because I think  your values are so skewed in that department that your judgment is about 30% overly...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you criticizing Leo?  I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I decided to take my searchlight off of Dvorak and put it out on Leo.  You are really just a problem.  I think it's an interesting point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree with you.  I totally agree with you.  I think you want it to win.  Yes, I do.  The average person is going to say, the iPhone, I'm gravitating towards it, it's got the apps  I want, it's got a simple interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I broke your password to get in the mint.  You broke it because you couldn't get in the mint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I got in.  I'm in.  That's in.  No.  Do you know the email and password?  Go ahead.  No, but I got past the first street.  Tell me what my net worth is.  No, you gave it the wrong thing.  Now it will force me to re-log in.  He's trying to find out my net worth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know what it is.  I already know what your net worth is.  You do?  Yes, $5.6 million.  How did you know that?  I found out.  You dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dog.  I wish I were worth $5.6 million.  In my dreams.  Rogamiba says it no longer has any plans to release new iPhone applications.  The reason is a four-month delay in getting a bug fix release.  They already have an application, Airfoil, which is incredible.  They've got a bug fix.  They sent it to Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This bug fixing is a disaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On Android, I get updates on some applications every few days because there's no process.  It just updates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, but that's the difference between turning a Zodiac and turning the Titanic.  Don't you think?  No.  When you're talking about Android apps, the volume has to be so much lower than I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How many Android apps do you think there are?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Take a guess.  Tell me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Take a guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, God.  Is that enough for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That seems small.  Well, it's small compared to 100,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's my point.  It's a Zodiac compared to the Titanic.  When you're looking at the volume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, first of all, there's no approval process.  You can put it...  You want to update?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You update.  Put it on your own website.  You can't do that with Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's a problem because I don't trust people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you.  I'll give you this.  On the Droid, for instance, because it has multitasking, something Apple has resolutely...  So, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hold on a second.  Stop.  Wait a minute.  We just let this comment of her slide.  She doesn't trust people.  She doesn't trust people.  That means if you buy something from Microsoft, you don't...  No matter who you buy from, it has to go through some trusted source.  Is that what you're saying?  In other words, everything has to go through Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who do you trust more, Google or Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but she's saying I have a...  You're kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I would rather have a strict parent who's paying attention...  Apple's not a strict parent.  ...than a parent who's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's an ogre.  Ogre.  Apple is...  I'll tell you who Apple is.  ...than a parent who is not home.  Apple is the drunk parent who you don't know...  Abusive.  ...if he's going to come home and yell at you and say you're a complete fool or say,  I love you, I love you, I love you.  That's who Apple is.  Really?  Yes.  You really...  They're unpredictable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true.  I'm willing to learn, but my perception, because I'm not as inside baseball as you guys...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, and I agree with you.  We are too inside baseball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think this applies to the general public, is that we trust Apple and we trust Steve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  No one trusts Steve anymore.  This is the real truth of it.  Not the general public.  The general public might, but that's going to...  One thing I will say, I admit that I have a different perspective, but I think I'm only  ahead of the curve.  I think the curve will catch up.  And I think that the trust level on Apple is going to go down.  True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It can only go down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's kind of crazy right now, but it's already...  I'm starting to see erosion.  I really am.  And I think that what's going to happen...  I think Google's the next Apple.  And at some point, we will stop trusting Google as well.  I think Google's the next Microsoft.  Or maybe they're the next Microsoft.  I agree with you.  They're the next big player, aren't they?  They're the guys who are going to take over at this point.  They haven't already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How are they not already the biggest player?  I think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I think this is...  But then the trust level is very high for Google.  Do you not agree?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do.  I do.  A...  A...  A...  A...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A...  A...  A...  A...  A...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A...  A...  A...  A...  A...  A...  A...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A...  A...  Huh...  Huh...  Huh...  That's how...  That's how Google plays today.  Okay, that's pretty good.  Ah...  Okay...  Okay...  Ooh.  All right.  Let's go inside the home.  Let's go inside the salad小時 now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Everybody is gonna get nervous, right?  So...  Quite frankly look at this.  But give it some thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The average賺 tax in a one by one app is better  than whatever you have in a closed app  in a secure app.  In most apps, this additional company  was starting to pull in almost on an open app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was pressing the bathroom door,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right?  No?  No?  Because of all the different distros,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think that's true.  Yeah, I'm not sure that that's true.  Okay, fair enough.  It's the best platform for a certain kind of developer.  A developer who is more motivated by ego than money.  But I think Google's smart.  Google understands that it has to be both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google may benefit from being the second player in...  Second big player in the app market  because it seems like Apple in some senses  is experiencing an awkward adolescence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They are.  That's exactly...  Maybe...  Yeah, well that's a good question.  What does that mean?  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you so much for not making me the only blonde in the room.  That's a polysyllabic word that just went right over my forehead.  Senescence.  You know, it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, there it is on his calendar.  March 6th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Come on, you know it's senescence.  I like this reader on here.  It's senescence.  This one?  Oh, is that Shazam?  Oh, that's the classics.  Yeah, that's from the same guys who do...  Looks like a page turning.  Check it out.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's a drawback to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a very extensive process to making a book compatible with it,  so they only have a few books on it.  You can't just download anything.  Oh, that's cool.  You know what?  The reader on the iPhone that really is the one is Stanza,  which Amazon now owns,  and eventually I think will become the Kindle app.  So what do you guys think?  Now we have three e-book readers.  We have Barnes and Noble, we have Nook,  or the Nook e-book reader, as I like to call it.  And the next one, the cranny.  The cranny.  And we have Kindle.  Guy called me on the radio show today, said.  He knew about Sony, he didn't know about Barnes and Noble  because Barnes and Noble is a great book.  And then we have the upcoming Slate,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  which apparently is the Apple Slate,  which may be delayed according to the rumor sites.  Right.  And then we also have the Microsoft product,  which is going to be a dog.  And Microsoft's doing a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's that Gizmodo video that nobody ever confirmed.  We don't know.  We don't know.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You just glossed over the whole tablet thing.  We have a delay on an unconfirmed, totally rumored product.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A product that was never announced,  and now a delay doesn't exist.  Okay, good to know.  I'm glad we're...  We're right on top of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So based in fact around here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is an example of the Apple distortion field.  I mean, you can say anything about Apple.  You know the Nook is sold out, right?  The Nook is not available till January 4th.  I can't get my hands on a review unit.  It's not available.  I thought it was sold out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they're having production problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't get my hands on a review unit for Good Morning America.  Well, that shows you.  Oh, then there you go.  And which means they're going to miss the big Christmas buying season,  so that's not so hot.  But remember, Amazon did as well.  The Kindle didn't come out until after Christmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, next Christmas is good.  There's one other that we're missing.  There's MIBOOK.  And there's a third one, a fifth one that begins with C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there's some third party from strange companies.  I think that it's got to be from Sony, Barnes & Noble, Amazon.  It's got to be somebody who can make the deals for content, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think it all goes back to the iTunes model.  It's about the content, stupid.  It exactly is.  If you don't have an easy distribution model,  nobody gives a rip if it's open.  They want the Patterson book.  They want the Ivanovitch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to unilaterally knock the Sony out  because it doesn't have wireless.  They want to connect it to a computer.  They do have a lot of deals.  There's a lot of titles, but you have to download them on a PC  and then connect the e-book reader.  The Nook will have Barnes & Noble behind it.  They claim a million titles because the Nook will support  Google's book scanning efforts.  And it's got wireless.  So I think it's really down to the Kindle and the Nook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what's funky about the Sony, though?  So here's the company known for its proprietary memory sticks.  But they have started a deal where they're doing  the big library loaners through the Sony e-reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good deal.  That's smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So basically the library buys it and you can borrow it  all via computer and then give it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you have to bring the...  How does that work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you create a digital account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I've heard about this.  I think this is sketchy.  Who owns the reader?  The library?  No, you do.  You take your reader in, load it up at the library.  The library owns the e-books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not going to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you can borrow them.  That's absurd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are they free?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  It's a library book, dude.  It's free.  I guess if you're in the library, you've got to figure out

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  some way to survive in this digital content world, right?  And what if you could do it remotely?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What if you didn't have to go to the library?  Well, that's the problem.  It's called a download.  It's called a download and suddenly the library  is disintermediated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't need them.  Yeah, but again, I go back to that's what...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's what Stanza looks like.  ...tops 15% of the population.  Stanza's not as pretty, but the underlying technology

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is good.  And you know what?  That page turn, that's an easy thing to do.  I was going to say...  Well, this still turns page, but it's a flat page.  It's a solid rock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't flip.  It's not as good.  No, they did a great job with classics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a beautiful reader.  What do you guys think?  So I got to do this segment about how the trend of e-books

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is affecting people.  And the obvious stuff is the business story and how many  units are selling.  What do you think about long-term effects on literacy?  I think it's positive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I think that I've always thought that a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the electronic stuff that's going on, I said, all people  don't write letters to their readers.  They send emails though.  But they write a lot more emails than they ever wrote letters.  And a lot of these people, my son for example, writes these  emails that are as long as war and peace.  They're just these huge long emails because he types very  fast.  I think there's a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm completely with you.  I think that e-books will have the same effect on literacy.  But is it a digital divide issue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think so.  Well, look, if you're going to talk literacy, there's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  digital divide.  But that's my point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't it self-selecting at that point where if we're talking  about increasing the amount of digital divide, it's going to  increase the amount that people are reading if they're...  that the elite who can afford...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's always been the elite who have read.  I mean, it's only elite that read.  98% of the public of Vietnam is literate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the highest literacy rate in the world.  Wow.  Why is that, you think?  They decided to make it that way.  I don't know.  That's a pretty reason.  Half of the people speak English.  It's a great place to go visit.  They have good public education, apparently.  I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Something that America seems to have turned its back on.  No, we don't want good public education.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why not?  We want to keep the people dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Aside from the digital divide issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They riot if they know too much.  We've got the populations too greatly.  So you're of the bread and circuses...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about those rioters at your alma mater?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What, the five guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Took over the something-holed cow.  They took over the wrong building.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What happened?  This is at University of California, Berkeley?  They took over like the auditorium.  They didn't go to Sproul like they used to do in the olden days.  Did you see?  He almost said like we did.  Like we did.  I didn't say anything.  I'm not that...  I caught him.  He was a takeover dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The guys at SAVIA were like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They increased the fees at Cal by 33%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For no apparent reason and they won't cut costs at this joint.  They just basically...  The professors make $200,000 and $300,000 a year.  They won't cut any costs whatsoever and then they're sticking to students with a 30% increase  in an economy that's in the tank.  They should burn down the place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hasn't it always been one of the best deals in education?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not as of about 20 years ago.  Yeah, it used to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It used to be $600 to go to the University of California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Trust me.  I want it to be one of the best deals.  I'm five miles from my house.  My kids aren't getting any farther than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're not getting in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is why I had to spare public education.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It costs more than a private school now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why...  I mean Sweden guaranteed college education.  And I think that that's...  I worry about our level of innovation, our ability to stay ahead.  Most of the students now at colleges, at good schools like Cal are not American.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Especially with the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's mostly Asians actually.  But there are a lot of Indians too.  Mostly Asians.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that wouldn't count.  The Asians and they mix them up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're all the same.  But I'm saying that I think there's a lot of...  I'm not saying American Chinese or American Indians.  I'm saying...  Yeah, from overseas.  From overseas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they're going to go back.  That's because they make the most money.  I mean, the university makes a ton of money off these foreign students because they have  to pay all these extra fees.  So we're educating them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're going to go back to their countries.  And the innovation now is going to happen there.  What happens to us?  We get screwed.  What do you think?  But can I still buy an American car?  You just did.  You just did.  You bought a Ford.  Thank God.  Somebody is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was just going to say the H1N1 V6.  By the way, I was in the car.  It's got a gorgeous interior.  It's a really nice car.  It's very solidly built.  Doesn't it feel solid?  Doesn't it have that...  Solidly built.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We'll see after you buy one pothole.  We'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a solid car and it's got a lot of pep.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pep is a good word for it.  Yeah.  It's called a V8 engine and a tiny chassis.  Let me break in that we're going to talk about Go To My PC real quickly so I can pay for  that American-made car.  It actually is very affordable compared to say like a Lexus or a...  What is it called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A Malback?  My back.  Mayback.  I don't know what it's called.  Get a Bentley Continental.  That's the car for you.  That's your next car, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you think?  It's time to party.  I got picati.  I'm getting in my Bentley and I'm going to ride representing Oak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now if you can do that with the airbags, you've got something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  Let's talk a little bit real quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's become so painful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you mocking me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why do you have your Zagat guide on your iPhone set to Las Vegas?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why do I have the Zagat guides on my iPhone set to Las Vegas?  The last time I used it, I was probably in Vegas.  I love the Zagat guide.  That thing is well worth it.  You have to pay monthly for it.  I'm going to have to buy the new...  Or yearly, I'm going to have to buy the new 2010 edition, but that's great.  Have I talked about Audible yet today?  No.  What about them?  They're fantastic.  They have a special deal right now.  Free books for you even if you are not an Audible member.  No credit card needed.  You do not have to join.  I have been trying to get Audible to do this for some time.  I'm really thrilled they're doing it.  They call it...  What is the name of it?  The Big Listen.  Now Audible is the leading provider of audiobooks.  I've told you about them before.  60,000 titles in every category, fiction, comedy, suspense.  I listen all the time.  In fact, if you had brought my iPhone into the car with you, you would have started playing  automatically.  I'm listening to a Jerry Pornell book.  Yeah.  Lucifer's Hammer is great.  Yeah, no, that's a good book.  It's a little dated though.  It's funny because you hear Jerry's...  He's not reading it.  No, no, no.  Larry Niven and Jerry.  But you hear Jerry's politics come through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Yeah, no, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's a little dated.  Like for instance, the guy's in a waiting room and there's some young girl in there  talking about the whole in the ozone layer.  We've got to ban spray cans.  And he's like, oh, you idiot, don't get me started.  And it's like, you know, she actually was right.  But it's a little later.  I don't know.  Maybe Jerry would still say she was wrong.  He probably would.  Isn't it accepted now that the...  Well, anyway, we won't go into it.  It's funny though.  It's a wonderful book.  Lucifer's Hammer.  That would be my Audible recommendation.  But I'm going to do you one better.  I'm going to get you a free book.  If you're not a member, you don't even need a credit card.  Now through November 26th, go to audible.com slash Thanksgiving.

That's a great book.  Classic.  Really wonderful.  That's a sad story too.  You know, the author of that never got it published.  He committed suicide.  Kennedy O'Toole?  Yeah, O'Toole.  Yeah.  And his mom found the manuscript and she went to publisher after publisher, got it published.  And it was...  Didn't he went to Pulitzer?  I think he went to Pulitzer.  Could be.  It was a huge success posthumously.  Alice in Wonderland, the book I read as a kid over and over again that kind of informs  all of my political beliefs.  I Am Legend.  Fahrenheit 451, The Great Gatsby.  There's a...  Boy, there's a bunch of stuff to choose from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Five foot?  That's badass!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like holding me, toe to head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like using you, like using you Becky Worley to cut through the battle.  How about, I like this guy's name, Wolf the Quarrelsome.  A mysterious barbarian leader who only appears in history twice.  And both times he's kicking someone's ass.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.  He's a badass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Banbagutagurung, a fearless gurkha who won the Victoria Cross by clearing out six Japanese  foxholes with nothing more than his teeth, a knife and hand grenades.  Wow.  Anyway, that's free.  All of these are free.  But you know, you got to pick one.  You can't get them all.  So pick one.  This is a way of Audible saying-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can get all the badasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But one book.  One, yeah.  Yeah.  It's all in one book.  Go to audible.com slash thanksgiving for your chance to listen to an Audible book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You go to the front page and you pick a town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say it's very well done.  It's very well produced.  That app.  So you go to Zagatogo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's an app for that.  Okay.  See we're on Zagatogo, the front page.  You tap here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, speaking of which app map for Salvo.  What?  Goes to the map.  So Verizon VAT&T.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And both are probably right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Both might be right.  This is the main reason to get a droid is because of the, you don't have the Zagat book  on there though.  See the app you give up the application rich richness of applications but a wonderful network

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, the screen is much better on the on the drive.  So oh it's much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The germ count.  You.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't let anybody use it but me.  Okay.  You know why it's smudge to crap?  Went to KFC last night.  Really?  I made a mistake.  Don't eat fried food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or movie popcorn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Movie popcorn and fried food.  I, Henry made me do it.  Took him there.  He's a nice kid.  I took him there.  And this doesn't sound right to me.  They said we're all out of the crispy fried chicken.  Would you like broiled chicken instead?  It doesn't sound right.  It's Kentucky fried.  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're under serious pressure to go less fat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  But there's really you don't get a lot of fat with their food.  The original frying technique that Kentucky fried chicken had, which was invented by some  black guy, I believe, who was a was a show is so no, I know this is a fact.  I think the guy was the inventor.  It was a Colonel Sanders is white.  It was a deep fat fryer.  This guy licensed it.  It was a high pressure deep fat fire.  So you weren't frying on a normal deep fat fire like every restaurant.  It was like sealed.  And then the pressure went up and it created a unusual cooking style, which actually when  you pull the food out, it wasn't all greasy.  No, I think you're right.  Yeah.  And I don't know if they still even use these things.  Oh, I think they do.  OK.  Well, then that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, then I heard an interview with Coolio actually was talking about this.  You know, Coolio is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He was saying it's OK to eat fried chicken as long as you drain it.  Yeah.  And I think I think it's well, there's some fat in the in the little residual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But generally speaking, if you put 10 cups of fat into the broiler and you pull out the  chicken, there should be almost 10 cups left, which means so.  So what?  You're not drinking this stuff.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  But I'm not going to eat a lot of fried chicken.  So it's a technique.  Anyway, I got the broiled chicken.  Do not get the Kentucky broiled chicken.  KBC.  Oh, it's a fail.  Oh, yeah.  Fail blog.  It's tough.  It's chewy.  It's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had a bad day the other day and fail blog turned the whole day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fail blog is the best.  That and the people at Walmart.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People at Walmart.  That is like the best.  That's cherry springer for people on the web.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so great.  Yeah, because I mentioned a black man who may have invented the device.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're supposed to be race blind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it just happens to be a character.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It might not be black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Failblog.org.  .org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  And it catalogs failures on the web.  It's so fantastic.  Dan says we jumped the shark.  We did?  Oh, we jumped it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me tell you something.  If the show, if they don't say, if the chat room doesn't say the Joe show jumped the  shark, I figure we're not going to release it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, thank God we've hit that metric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at the pretty princess starlet makeup kit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love Failblog.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like I was having a bad day because I thought we jumped the blog.  Jumped the shark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I went to Failblog.  And you feel better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the magic mouse.  What do you think of that?  I just got mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Take a look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really like.  Now, the interesting thing about.  It looks like a Dove bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's like Apple doesn't get mice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think it's fantastic, but I love gestures.  Once you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it doesn't even do pinch and squeeze.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't do pinch and squeeze, but it does do up down.  It does do side to side.  And interestingly enough, they've had some trouble with installs.  So I had to do a big driver download.  Like it's the first time I've ever had to do a driver download.  Oh yeah, you need a magic mouse driver.  That's exactly right.  For any product that I've really installed on a Mac.  And it's so ironic.  There's glue on the bottom of the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That it's a Mac.  I had Kentucky Fried Chicken last night.  Oh, it's everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was like licorice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you know what?  The packaging.  Did you have this problem with the packaging?  I opened it on the show we did an unboxing.  And there is a sticker across the bottom which you remove.  And it leaves residue on the bottom of the mouse.  Which is the last thing you want on the bottom of the mouse is gooey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what it's amazing in?  Is editing tools.  It's great for fun.  Because it goes, you can gesture laterally and it'll take you along the timeline.  So like in, what do you use here to record your video?  Any mouse should be able to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We just got nothing to do with this mouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  You stroke the mouse sideways like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You just stroke the surface of the mouse without physically moving it across your desk.  And it'll take you laterally in your timeline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You stroke the mouse?  Yeah, like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's smoke coming out of John's ears.  For so many reasons right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can have it all the life's gone out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that it's okay.  It feels a little funny in my hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll be interested to see how long the bad has lasted.  This is so wrong.  I'm so proud.  Dad, you weren't here today.  But it was these two old farts who took it south.  Not me.  Proud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook was hit on Tuesday by a well-meaning intruder.  It's always a bad start.  By a well-meaning intruder who took over some of the site's online groups as a way of sending a message.  The message was, quote, think about the safety in your social media to the same extent you do in your real life.  Thousands of different groups from college alumni groups to those who support causes were taken over by an organization called Control Your Info.  Not me.  Facebook said there's been no hacking and there's no confidential information at risk.  But we're still investigating the situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you went to the group, you wouldn't find the group.  You'd find a message.  Hello.  We hereby announce we have officially hijacked your Facebook group.  This means we control a certain part of the information about you on Facebook.  We control the horizontal and the vertical.  Name the show.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Outer Limits, baby.  Never even heard of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's because you're young.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you remember the show, Outer Limits?  There was a series of these shows.  They're all clones of Twilight Zone.  Do you remember Way Out?  That was actually a clone of a clone.  It was creepy.  I liked those creepy shows.  Yeah, Way Out was wow.  And I've never seen it reprised anywhere.  That'd be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder if it's on YouTube.  Stuff like that makes its way to YouTube until the rights holders pull it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Creepy guy on the wing of the airplane is still one of the scariest things.  Is that Night Gallery or Twilight Zone?  That was Twilight Zone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was Shatner.  Oh, yeah, it was Shatner.  Oh, shoot.  That was going to be my trivia question.  Who was in the airplane?  Who was sitting on the seat?  We all know.  Everybody knows that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wouldn't have remembered.  I just remember that scared me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  William Shatner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that was one of his very first ...  My other favorite Shatner one was the one where he was stuck in the restaurant with  the little devil machine predicting everything he was going to do.  Remember that one?  No, that sounds great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a great one.  It sounds class.  Can you buy those on anywhere, iTunes or anywhere?  I'd love to look at those old episodes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To be honest, I don't get people who buy shows.  I've never bought a DVD in my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look, she's still stroking the mouse.  She just keeps stroking the mouse.  Look at that.  That is libel.  She just keeps stroking the mouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that hurt.  That's she.  You're refusing to refer to me.  I stopped stroking the mouse long ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where is my mouse?  Oh, there it is.  Thank you.  This is disgusting to see.  This is the preference pain for it.  She just keeps stroking it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Side, side, side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what Becky likes is a side, side.  Stop, Mayo.  Are you prefer up and down now?  The reason I don't like the Apple device is because it doesn't have two buttons.  To do a right click, you have to lift your left finger and then click.  It's too much work.  Dumb.  It's just too much work.  Moving on, Google Books.  Finally, we've got kind of a settlement.  A judge has now set February 18th for a hearing on this revised settlement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hate to be such a blonde, but can you synopsize this whole issue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How much time you got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's synopsize.  This is the key verb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll see if I can.  John, correct me.  Let me see if I can do this because I actually have been working on this to see if I can  synopsize it.  Google would like to scan print books and have it in its database searchable and maybe  even offer those books.  Of course, immediately, and by the way, without getting permission, just Google started doing  it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  This is the key.  They just started doing it.  They would sell the books and then sell them, but we will give the publishers a piece of  the action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Immediately, of course, the Authors Guild and the publishers went to Google and said,  they sued them.  They said, stop.  Google made a deal in which they would put, I think it was $175 million into a clearinghouse,  a rights clearinghouse.  The setup included a way for rights authors to assert their right to the content, but  there were some things other people, including the EU, complained about.  For instance, Google retained the rights to the scanned books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there any DRM on them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Essentially, there was because you could only buy them from Google.  That's a good question is how they would protect that, but I think you'd have to have some  sort of DRM in it.  Google had the rights.  Librarians were understandably concerned because it would undermine a free library, the whole  notion of a free library.  On the other hand, there are people who said, well, look, if Google doesn't do it, who is  going to do it?  These books were going to lose these books.  Many of them were already falling apart.  Some, like Jeffrey Nunberg, who is the linguist at Stanford you hear on NPR, said that you  should look at the metadata.  This stuff is being very poorly scanned in.  The dates on it, for instance, there's a whole series of books that come out with one year,  even though they come from a huge variety of years.  Was this right?  Yeah, there's very bad metadata.  Google's attitude is, look, we're scanning it in.  We'll use crowd sourcing at some point to fix it, but the point is to get the content in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they're being scanned in by robots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, not so well by robots, apparently.  So the settlement really kind of went on the rocks when the U.S.  Department of Justice said, look, this is effectively, this litigation is making copyright law.  This is not what we would like to see.  We don't think copyright law should be made by litigation.  This changes Section 23.  So the DOJ brief really kind of made the, you know, was the cause of the settlement  foundering.  So Google, the authors and the publishers went back to the negotiation table, made a revised  settlement, which they submitted to the judge last week.  Under the settlement, I'm sorry, it's $125 million.  I'm looking now at some notes here.  They agreed to pay $125 million to resolve outstanding claims and establish this independent  book rights registry.  France, Germany and others objected.  So now the books covered under the settlement only are those published in Australia, Britain,  Canada or the U.S.  We just won't do the international books.  The modified settlement addresses charges that Google would have sole authority over these  orphan works, the out of print books whose copyright holders cannot be found.  It sets up an independent body which be used to try to locate rights holders and look after  their interests.  I think that's a good potential solution.  Rival technology companies, privacy advocates and consumer watchdog groups, according to  the AFP.  And the French and German governments are among those who filed objections to the original  settlement and the revised agreement has also come under fire.  For instance, the Open Book Alliance, which includes Microsoft, Yahoo and Amazon, hired  Gary Reback, the lawyer.  The well-known lawyer who spearheaded the charge against, was it Microsoft?  Yeah, I think so.  And the Internet Archive.  We tried to get Brewster Kahle from the Internet Archive on Twig, our Google show.  We continue to try to get him.  The Internet Archive maintains a digital library of websites and its own book scanning project  says, still fundamental flaws despite Google's effort to spin this deal.  It does nothing to promote competition.  In other words, let other folks do this.  Nor does it reform Google's exclusive access and monopoly hold on the digital database.  So that's really going to be the kind of the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So synopsis, this is a cluster in progress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I don't think so.  I think this is...  I would interpret differently.  You're right.  A lot of people interpret it that way.  I would interpret this as a process that needs to happen to satisfy all the stakeholders  in this so that we can go forward with some form of preserving these books digitally so  they're digitally searchable.  Admittedly, there's a lot of players in this.  So it looks like a cluster just because there's so many people.  But I think that's how you do it.  You propose a settlement.  You say, I think what Google's doing is probably the right thing to do, which they were just  going to go ahead and do it.  We're going to start.  Sue us.  Let's figure it out.  Let's talk.  Let's negotiate.  And I think they seem to be doing that.  They can afford to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They can afford it.  And I think they're doing this in good faith.  Yeah, there's still this issue of ownership.  They're scanning in a lot of public domain works and then claiming that they own these  things.  Yeah, that I don't understand.  Cory Doctorow is the guy to talk to about this because he's kind of a copyright maven.  I'm sure he hates this.  Yeah.  And he says that when a book goes public domain, it's public domain.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't revert into, and that's, I think, what the DOJ was saying.  It's public domain.  It's not yours now because you scanned it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you're providing a service by making it accessible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The scan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  But the content is still public domain.  So if you essentially take the public domain scan that Google did and essentially reproduce  it as a book that you sell for $1.95.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which, by the way, The Barnes and Noble Reader, for instance, might be one of the markets  for that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have a deal with Google.  Or 99 cents.  Google can't make a claim on that.  No.  But they claim that they can.  Of course, the author has it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but I think this revised settlement does try to address that by saying, all right,  we're going to create a rights group that will look for these people, that will protect  their rights.  I mean, I'd have to look at the settlement to see how much.  Anyway, a judge will be looking at this in January.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, as a derivative work, somebody's mentioning this.  It's a derivative work of a public domain book.  There's no such thing.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can I sidebar us on something else?  Can you, in just a second?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Because I have one more ad to do.  I just want to tell everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, you're really good.  This is all ads nowadays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know what?  I screwed up.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I did an extra ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's all right.  We can have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's okay.  Go ahead.  I've got good stuff coming up.  I've got a regular TV radio show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, then it'll be two minutes of content and one minute of advertising.  That's what it is.  That's the number.  Yeah.  So we're a little bit better than that.  Yeah, you're three minutes of content and a minute of ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Three to one.  Can I just mention Carbonite?  Look, folks, I'm going to make this simple.  Go to carbonite.com.  You could try it for free.  You don't need a credit card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you a user of Carbonite?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know when I started using it, this is actually one of the reasons I got into Carbonite.  I lost 10 GizWiz episodes.  And then we interviewed a guy named Brian Aker who is a MySQL guy on Floss.  I lost the interview.  I accidentally erased it.  Actually, Microsoft erased it because it's a Windows media error.  And then we did the interview again and it got erased again.  Oh, that hurts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had to send the guy out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The guy must think that you just hate him.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I felt so bad.  He's such a nice guy.  I sent him a coffee gift basket.  For three bucks though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Three dollars coffee basket!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I sent him that and I said, I'm so sorry, can we do it one more time?  We did it one more time.  But after that, I vowed I've got to have a backup strategy.  And so, yeah, we back up locally, but we also now back up online.  And it's gigabytes.  But as long as it's on that hard drive, it's gigabytes.  It doesn't matter.  And Carbonite's always backing up the podcast.  That's why I haven't lost a podcast since.  Thank you, Carbonite.  So thank you for asking that, John, because it's a true story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think this is cool and I want to see if you guys think it's cool.  MassAnimation.com.  Is it illustrations of Massachusetts life?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is not, shockingly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they create this Facebook app and they solicit animators across the planet to do a crowd sourced animation project.  I love this crowd sourced stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they give them a free download of Maya, which is a pretty nice tool for animating.  You submit your three seconds, four seconds.  They've got sort of a wire frame.  What's the name of the website?  MassAnimation.com.  They've got a wire frame and they give you sort of a palette and tell you, OK, now you make these characters move in a way that you think is cool.  That's neat.  Animators go out and do it.  They submit.  And then the community on Facebook votes as to which are the best versions of that three second portion of the short.  Then they consolidate all of them and create the first crowd sourced animation project.  It's airing in theaters.  I think it starts this weekend.  It's going to be on theaters?  It's the front end of Planet 51, Sony's new animation project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I've got to see this.  Who gets all the money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's done with, I think that the guy...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've got 56,000 people involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's a pretty cool community and there were animators from...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anybody in our chat room doing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's a pretty cool kind of a subgroup of people, participants in 101 countries, 51 finalists from 17 different countries.  I think it's really cool because how's a kid from Brazil or Kazakhstan who can't come live in the U.S., he gets a free download of Maya, whether he wins or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. So who was it founded by?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The guy who started... who was with Sony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Former Sony Pictures Vice Chairman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, but get this.  So he was in on the deal with Paul Allen when Paul Allen was thinking about selling tech TV to Sony.  Really? Oh, he was what? Yair Londo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yair.  Oh my goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So he tells me that... I went down there and I shot this story for GMA about this.  Paul Allen flies down to LA, meets with Sony honchos, and they just have this meeting in the hangar, you know, general aviation, where Paul Allen has flown his plane down.  He doesn't want to leave the hangar.  Right? And Sony is really interested, but they just can't quite pull the trigger.  You know, sort of that American head of a Japanese company, is this a good risk, risk tolerance issues, tech TV, and they let it die on the vine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is the best thing that ever happened to you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is. Thank you. By the way, our best wishes for whatever you feel about Paul Allen. I have to admit, I was never a Paul Allen fan, but I understand he's once again diagnosed with cancer and is not doing well.  So our best wishes to Paul Allen, because after all, he's one of the guys who started Microsoft and a very important person in this industry.  He's not been having a good year. Charter goes bankrupt. He filed bankruptcy with a company that bought Moxie. And of course, Leo hates him.  So between all of that, I'm not surprised he's got cancer. You know, I blame myself. That's terrible. Because I was the guy who kept saying, I hope you get cancer, Paul Allen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You never did. I was never. You're like the nicest guy in the world and now you're trying to be mean because of the two of us in here who are actually somewhat mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Paul Allen paid for my master's degree. He did. Stanford. You got a Stanford doctorate for education and that was Masters.  Leo wrote one of my recommendation letters. So I owe him for life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That and three dollars and fifty cents will get you a cup of Starbucks coffee. Or a coffee. You get the whole coffee pot.  Three coffee pot, three dollar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Allen, as you may remember, dropped out of Microsoft because he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's remitted. Now he's been diagnosed with non Hodgkin's lymphoma.  Hodgkin's lymphoma. That's a lot more serious. And I don't know what the prognosis is. According to a letter written by his sister to Vulcan employees, Paul's feeling OK, remains upbeat, continues to work, has no plans to change his role at Vulcan.  His health comes first, though, was sure that nothing intrudes on top of that. So our best wishes to Paul Allen. I feel like I met the guy several times.  I didn't get to go to the yacht.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of three yachts.  There's three?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I told you my yacht story, right, that my mom told me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You went to Paul Allen's yacht?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, he docked when I think it was Bill Gates' wedding. There was a bunch of Richie Riches that brought their yachts to the harbor on Lanai where Bill Gates got married.  And all the yachts were lined up. And apparently someone else's yacht was a foot and a half longer than Paul Allen's.  He put it into dry dock and added three feet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All these guys are like that. The guy who founded Netscape, Jim Clark, famous for the same thing. But in that case it was height.  He wanted the tallest yacht you could get that would still be able to fit under the Golden Gate Bridge. And so he like has three inches clearance.  Anyway, I didn't mean to be facetious about Paul's health, and of course we do wish him absolutely the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it was Chuck Hirshhorn that was the real douchebag when it came to the tech TV.  He got his, though. I'm glad to say.  I don't know anything about this guy. He was a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's a guy who founded G4 and was I think kind of responsible for Comcast buying tech TV. I think it was kind of on his Christmas list.  And did the merger, got rid of tech TV effectively, and ran G4 into the ground. And then shortly thereafter was fired.  And I do believe that he's gone on to worse things in his life. I should find out. He called me once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Boy, you guys are just... He called me once.  ...affected with some sort of negativism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know how it is. It's all just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't really know how it is.  When they were having a tough... Oh, he's the chief creative officer at Retirement Living TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No way. That's bad.  So I think that's kind of fitting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's so great. That's so great.  Hey, Chuck, I hear you're retired. You want to come work for me? Just kidding.  He called me once. No, he called me once. And he said, come on down. We'd love to talk to you.  I didn't offer airfare nothing.  And then I found out that negotiations with Kevin Rose were on the rocks.  Kevin, he was trying to get Kevin to stick around in the screensavers.  And I realized that this is all a negotiation play. He didn't even offer to fly me down.  But I decided not to work for Retirement Living TV, Charles.  That's excellent. Two things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is getting mean. I'm sorry.  I know. One thing is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm against it.  I'm against it.  My motto is if you have nothing good to say, don't say anything at all.  You always want people to live.  You were so...  You start really deconstruct what I have to say and it's all positive and upbeat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have to deconstruct pretty deep to get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you think about a lot of the tech discussions that happen on the web,  it does kind of sound like a bunch of bitchy little girls after a while.  It is. It's high school. It's all fueled by jealousy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
