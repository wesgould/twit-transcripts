Transcript:  The last time I left the United States in August late August I just sent out a tweet and said hey would anyone here like a non-toxic gaming environment and if so what game would you like me to set up? It was Minecraft. Of course. You probably wanted to do Rust though I know you love Rust but that's not non-toxic. It's not non-toxic but we had managed to make a non-toxic Rust server. It takes a lot of moderation and a lot of input. So I set something up for you know 20 30 40 people just enough for people to play around with and  then it got picked up by a local outlet and overnight we went from 20 40 people to 5,000 people. Yeah because it's the Vatican. Because it was in the Vatican. And you also tweeted it. And because I tweeted it correct. And then we had a semi toxic YouTuber who jumped on. Of course. And he immediately got banned because he was cheating. He was hacking and then all of his followers decided. Was it OMG Chad? No I won't mention him. I won't mention him but I will say we almost got DDoSed off the internet.  And then CloudFlare reached out. Their CEO reached out and said Matthew Prince is awesome. We'll protect you. We're big fans. So we're still running. We're now up to we've got 17,000 unique users. We are now also running Rust and TF2. And we've got something like 18,000 people in our Discord.  So are you going to run Gary's mod? You're running TF2? We're running TF2. I didn't notice. And you have a very active Discord server. I wanted to sign on so I could chat with you but you're too big of a star to get that. No I think we could take care of that. There actually is there's a role in my Discord server for super awesome Twitter people.

Transcript:  Aww. I'm not even joking about that. So all of that if you go to Father's Twitter handle with PadreSJ you can see all the links and everything if you want to get involved in that. Some beautiful stuff they're building in there actually. That's been the most amazing thing. So you have a creative server but you also have a PVP server. We have five servers. Do you have a survival server? Yeah so you have all the different. That's actually one of the keys to making a non-toxic environment. We have a server no matter how you want to play. Right.  I do both. I like creative though and I noticed that Michael our kid, 17 year old and his friends they still like to build. And it's amazing what they've built and it's amazing what people built there. It really is like Lego. It's more like Lego than a game. It's a creative outlet. And in creative mode you're not trying to survive or anything. You just get all the bricks you can use all the different types and you put it together in a unique and beautiful way.

Transcript:  I will say that I was surprised by how many people build cathedrals. Well it's the Vatican server. Even when it wasn't the Vatican server so many people were building these huge cathedral like structures. I'm like is that the pinnacle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well it's nice because instead of taking a hundred years, a thousand workmen, let's do it overnight. It's true. Michael's friends are building a sewer system now. They decided they had underground stuff for the lighting they were using but then they said we should also have some sewers. So they have an infrastructure as well as buildings above. It's crazy. Virtual infrastructure. But I think that is to me that's a game. That is a great game. Anyway it's great to have you here.  Great to see you. CES was all last week. None of us are sick. This is an unheard of proposition. The incubation period we're still within it. So it could still happen. So technically it could be carriers. That's fair. I haven't been in eight years. And one of the reasons I didn't go for so long, partly it's just a nightmare. In fact a lot of, you know last week I asked my panel how many of you are going to CES and none of them are going because they're all senior enough.  In tech journalists they don't have to go. Nobody imposes on themselves like we did, Ant. That's nuts. Or like you guys do. All of you could have recused yourselves. There's something fun about it though. I liken it to a football game. If you go to an NFL game, you go for the atmosphere, for the fun. Not to see the game. You could see it much better at home on your TV than you can even if you have good seats because it's distant and it's people running around and it's, and see you're not going to be able to see the game.  CES is like that. You can only get, it's like the elephant and the blind man. You can only get, it's 4,500 booths. That means more than 12,000 products. It's impossible in four days to even scratch the surface. So you'd be better off if you care about CES to let everybody else go and read all the coverage.  But if you want to get the atmosphere, so once in a while I think it's fun to go get the atmosphere. All of you go all the time, right? I go for the swag. Yeah. He's just not in line. I'm pretty good at getting swag. When I first started going, I could remember prior to actually being able to go, hearing folks like yourself and other senior.

Transcript:  I was like, Oh, I could never go. I don't want to go back. I hate it. I was like, really? But after going two, two times or so, I could see why you would feel that way because it is a grind. It's hard. Oh yeah. You are running around. It's hard to get around. And if you're covering it, if you're, it's easier if you're not working it. Right. If you're just hanging out and that's actually fun. Right. But if you're working, you feel an onus to see as much as possible. Right. I think I went to North Central and South Halls. I went to the Sands Expo Center. I went to the

Transcript:  Venetian. I mean, and I still didn't get to Mandalay Bay and I still missed thousands of products I wanted to see. Right. Jason, how do you do it? Well, we have 90 people. We cut it up into little chunks and we, you know, we try to get down every aisle of every, you know, every exhibit. Do you do it by beat? Do you say, okay, Lexi, you're going to cover health tech and stuff like that? Yeah.

Start time: 655.54
End time: 680.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We do. It's by and large, but then we still even have to slice and dice it. Right. Because there's some that have overlapping beats. There's some things there that is in nobody's beat. And so we have to really be strategic about the way we approach it.  Who do you put in charge of the sex toys? That's health tech. Health tech.  We have a culture team. So it's actually true. It's culture. We have a culture team. And then we also have a team that's focused on health and wellness.

Transcript:  This was a big story, partly because it has the word S-E-X in it. But this is a big story because last year the Consumer Electronics Association, which runs CES, inadvertently gave an award to a vibrator, then yanked it.  Wait a minute.  And pulled it back.  No, no, not that either.  Enhanced it.  Thank you.  And got a lot of heat. In fact, the company that created that and won the award and then lost the award was smart and went out.  Press releases, went on a tour. They got more coverage than they would have otherwise. And I think the CEA said, oops, that was a mistake.  Because we've allowed, you know, they used to have adult corner where they'd have adult videotapes in there. Right. Eventually they had to exile that across the hall.  But it was very sexist. They said, well, you can't have women's health products, but you can have men's.  Exactly.  I don't know if health support works.

Start time: 733.88
End time: 738.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They just tried to treat it like adults this year. I think that's the thing.  I think that was better. Now, of course, I'm the one who's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So did you see it again?  So there were 10, 10 booths.  I have to say there were a lot of them and I avoided it.  I didn't want to cover it.  I didn't want to like I didn't even know how.

Start time: 752.16
End time: 755.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I personally didn't have any interest in it, but that's just me.

Transcript:  I went to a suite that had a bunch of products and I came over.  Did you wear your collar?  I was wearing my collar.  Oh, God, that's so good.  I came away with a gift bag and I didn't open it up till I got back to my house.  And there were two of them in there.  I'm like, oh, right.  How am I going to explain that when I get back to the Vatican?

Start time: 772.92
End time: 793.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of embarrassing.  And I don't want to I don't want to be sexist about it.  It is ridiculous that women's health and women's pleasure was somehow second class to men's pleasure.  So I'm glad that they did the right thing.  But at the same time, do you have any computers?  Are there is there anything else I can I can look at?

Start time: 793.44
End time: 834.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I will only say two things.  One, a well-designed product actually is amazing because it's not just a product.  You have to design it for comfort.  You have to design it with proper materials.  The second thing is and their Bluetooth and Wi-Fi enabled in many cases that I do not like  because they again, this is not just for health technology, but this is for any technology.  When security gets slapped on as an afterthought, you are just asking for trouble.  Yeah, but they don't know that in their R&D just exactly.  They're not even considering.  But you've got these Internet enabled applications.  And I'm like, do you do you really want that?  Yeah. I mean, unless you've actually considered how that can be abused, that should not be a feature.

Start time: 835.28
End time: 939.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well said.  Anyway, I so good.  You know, so if you want coverage, don't come to Twitter for that.  You go to CNET.  They had a whole section, a whole bunch of health people covering it.  Apple was there for the first time in a long time in an official capacity.  Apple always sends people.  But Jane Horvath, who's Apple's privacy officer, actually did a keynote, spoke in a panel  talking about the state of consumer privacy.  Speaking of privacy, first time in 28 years that Apple was at CES in a official capacity  and made headlines because she talked about encryption, the encryption issue.  She says because, remember, Apple was famously asked by the FBI to decrypt the phone,  the cell phone, the iPhone of the Apple of the San Bernardino mass murder shooter in 2015.  They refused the FBI back down.  Horvath said building back doors into encryption is not the way we're going to solve these issues.  She talked about privacy by design.  But she also revealed that Apple does do some surveillance that they do, for instance,  look for child pornography on their device and on their cloud that they are somehow.  She wasn't specific about this filtering through your pictures.  Is that privacy?  And then you have to question, can we balance protecting minors online with protecting people's privacy?

Start time: 940.06
End time: 968.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the hard part on this because it's their services, Apple's servers, right?  When they're scanning your photos through the iCloud services.  It's theirs. They have the right to to manage it how they see fit.  And kudos to them for having some type of cognizance of trying to be aware of the issues of child pornography and whatnot.  But then at the same time, did we sign up for them to, quote unquote, snoop on that?  Yeah.  You know, well, and apparently-

Start time: 968.56
End time: 991.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They also have responsibility too, right?  Once it's on their servers and they own sort of the part of the data, it's your data, but they're hosting it.  So they have some responsibility too.  So I think that's where there's a lot of gray area here that still as a society, you know, a lot of those conversations still have to happen.  What are our expectations as a society?

Start time: 992.10
End time: 1025.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Honestly, I think Apple mishandled it, Horvath mishandled it by not saying what they're doing because there are ways to do this that are nonobtrusive and there are ways to do it that are obtrusive.  Facebook, Twitter and Google use something called photo DNA, which is merely looking at the hashes of known child pornography online  and looking for the same image on their service.  So they're not looking at your images in any real sense.  They're just scanning for hashes that match hashes of known bad images.  If Apple said that's what we're doing, no worries, no problem.  But they didn't say that.

Start time: 1025.68
End time: 1053.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Facebook also employs an army of people-  Humans.  Humans, actual humans who have to physically look at the digital imagery and video coming through.  Just to find that hash to begin with.  And you have to remember when we talk about asking these companies to self-police or to be proactive, because we just did a huge hearing in DC,  asking these companies to be proactive in their stand against the undesirable elements of the Internet.  This is what we're asking them to do.

Start time: 1053.80
End time: 1086.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is so hard to do.  So this is a slippery slope too.  It's a slippery.  And this is the problem we have across the board, which is and it's always things like, oh, think of the children.  They always use these very loaded issues to say, well, it's OK to scan for child pornography.  But Apple was unclear about are they looking at images?  Are they using humans?  Are they using hashes?  They didn't say what they're doing.  And is it just limited to child pornography?  They're looking for other illegal activity?  What exactly are they doing?

Start time: 1086.56
End time: 1090.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or is it an issue of Ms. Horvath wasn't coached on what to say?

Start time: 1091.62
End time: 1111.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I would expect at some point to hear more detail.  So she raised a little bit of controversy by talking about that.  But, you know, it's just not clear what Apple's doing.  Nevertheless, it's good to have Apple at least talking about this in a panel fashion.  Did you know?

Start time: 1111.64
End time: 1188.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These are going to be one of the most important.  Yeah, it's one of the most important topics for us to deal with as a society over the next decade.  Because a lot of the companies, it's been the Wild West for a lot of these tech companies.  And they are they have more and more power over the conversation and more and more responsibility.  Right.  Exactly.  And so what our expectations are for them, you know, what the regulations or guardrails are for them in doing some of these things,  especially when it comes to managing your data and looking through your stuff.  Right. Because that that gets back to at least in the U.S., some constitutional issues potentially.  So there's a lot that we still have to figure out.  We've barely scratched the surface on it.  And you can expect that it to be a big part of, you know, the 2020 political campaign in the U.S.  as well as conversations that are going to happen worldwide over the next decade.  You know, it started to happen a little bit in Europe more than other places.  It's very a lot of these issues are similar to the U.S.  But obviously, it's more population dense there.  And and government takes a more active hand, obviously, in society, typically in most of the countries.

Transcript:  I mean, this wasn't a CES story, but we learned The Guardian reported that Microsoft was using workers working at home in China  to listen to Skype audio, to grade it, to prove it with no security measures at all.

Start time: 1203.40
End time: 1208.00

Transcript:  So, you know, there's a lot of this happening in Amazon and Facebook.

Start time: 1208.04
End time: 1234.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, remember, Siri and Echo and Google Assistant all had the same problem.  Now we're finding out Microsoft was doing this.  We understand that a lot of these services need to have some humans comparing what the system heard with what the person actually said.  But I think in response to these revelations, Google, Amazon and Apple both have said, OK, you can opt out of that.  You know, you don't have to do that. And we're going to have better controls.  Now, Microsoft caught in that same.

Start time: 1235.76
End time: 1241.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If we want these systems to be better, we have to allow these big companies to train to train the systems.

Start time: 1241.96
End time: 1249.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they also have an obligation to tell you they're doing it and give you the option to opt out.  One of these that's part of the New California privacy law that goes into effect.

Start time: 1249.42
End time: 1279.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're running into this idea that we think that there's going to be a technological solution to this.  And unfortunately, that's not the case.  The technology is already far outpaced.  What we're ready for. The problem is we we we have not developed a consistent morality about what we want them to actually do.  And you can see how hard it is. Right. Because we can all say we want both.  Should there be something to stop child pornography?  Everyone's going to say, yeah, of course.  OK, well, if we're already looking for child pornography, what about drug activity?  OK, maybe should they be able to look at your hard drive?

Start time: 1279.86
End time: 1290.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Should they be looking at everybody's cloud accounts to see?  Should they be able to look through all my pictures to see if any of them are child pornography?  And what about false positives? I have pictures on my account of my kids in the bathtub.  The bright line examples are easy.

Start time: 1291.06
End time: 1293.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all that gray area that none of us are going to agree on.

Start time: 1293.96
End time: 1372.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. And think of it as like in the real world, right?  In the real world, if you were like, OK, the because this comes up with the ring doorbell examples,  which they handled very badly, right, where you have people have these ring doorbells.  You have a camera on your doorbell.  And with that, they're they're they're working with the police and the police are, you know,  pulling information without people knowing it from doorbells when crimes happen.  And you can say, great, that's you know, they're being proactive and they're catching people who are committing crimes.  But if you think of it, you know, when you turn it on its head and you think of it from a real world example,  it's almost like saying, I have a house, I live in a community.  If the police, you know, are in charge of protecting this community, then they can come and they can hang out on my porch.  They can go through my backyard because they're, you know, looking for information  that's going to help keep the community safe.  Well, no, it doesn't work that way.  They have to have a, you know, in order to come on private property, they have to have a permit.  They have to have courts and judges that say, yes, there is probable cause for them to come,  you know, into your property and do that.  So that's where the slippery slope starts to happen, which, you know, which I was just talking about.

Start time: 1372.12
End time: 1439.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and there's not even any agreement about how to handle it.  You know, Ring was at CES.  Ring made a lot of announcements.  They had an opportunity at that time to clear up the their reputation about this.  They not only did they not, but their company's top hardware exec said,  we're proud of the program of our partnerships with law enforcement and we're going to do more of that.  This was at CES.  He said he believes this is Dave Limp.  The partnerships with police departments are good for neighborhoods and hinted at a future in which Ring cameras  could use Amazon's facial recognition technology.  By the way, my my Google Nest doorbell already does that.  They'll say, hey, Michael's at the front door.  You want to let him in? And I like that.  And this is the problem.  I think you might in your neighborhood say, I think it's a good idea that the police can look at these videos.  So, you know, and clearly Amazon has decided it's less it's not as big a black mark as Vice and others have painted it.  Maybe maybe, in fact, normal Americans think this is a pretty good thing.

Start time: 1441.16
End time: 1465.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is no expectation of privacy in public.  Period. You have to you have to put it on my doorstep.  Yeah. And actually, if you've got these products in your house, you now have no reasonable expectation of privacy inside your house.  At your house, if you've got an echo, if you've got cameras watching you inside the house, that's all going off to the Internet.  And if my policy is if it touches a network, I have no reasonable expectation of privacy for that data.  Yeah. OK. That's fair.

Start time: 1465.80
End time: 1494.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's and by the way, I think that Ring got a little bit of a bad rap because it turns out you have to opt in to share your Ring video with the neighbor program and that the police have to request the video from you.  And you have to say, OK, if you want that video share with the police.  So it's not like, you know, we're all putting up police cameras up and down our street.  Willy nilly.  And there are a lot of people would say, so let's do that, because I mean.

Start time: 1495.90

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Except those programs get misused all the time and misused.  And there's a great example of that, which is geolocating of cell phones that was only supposed to be available to law enforcement agencies.  Look at that. And it turned out anybody who could set up an account could could represent themselves as a bounty hunter and therefore be illegally able to obtain records for any phone.  For like fifty five cents each.

Transcript:  So one of the things to that, you know, Alfred Eng from CNET, from our publication, has been reporting pretty adamantly on some ways that ring has not been forthcoming about the way that they're using it.  And it's not just the ways that you thought.  Like you said, Leo, if it was just the way of I said, OK, I'm connecting my camera to the police network and I'm giving them permission to use it.  Then, you know, that is much more clear and transparent.  You could be fine with that. What's happened is to to what Father Robert was talking about is the ways that they're using it, that we don't expect that that's where the problem comes in.  Right. And it's very tempting for them to have this ability.  And what we've seen is Amazon has in some ways been not so forthcoming about some of the data that they are sharing with police, even when it's not just those straight sort of opt ins.  And that's where this gets dangerous.

Transcript:  Here's the good news, at least in California now, thanks to the New California Privacy Act, companies who want to do business in California have to reveal what information they gather.  They have to give you the right to delete it.  I think that's going to help.  It's kind of our own GDPR.  Because California is a big part of the U.S. economy, I think most companies are just going to say, well, we'll make it we'll make it for all customers in the U.S.  I hope Ring will pay attention to that.  It's dumb of Amazon because people are already very nervous about Amazon and what Amazon's gathering.  And Amazon, I mean, that's their business.  We thought they were in the retail business.  We thought they were selling books.  Oh, they're in the data business.  They're gathering data.  That's what they do.  And that's what they do so well.

Physical packages, but also delivery of data, whether that's images going from your doorbell to the police or to the cloud or whether it's you buying music.  Digitally or storing your information or your company on their servers or them delivering packages to you.  Right.

Actually, this week I was really interested to read what Bill Thompson said on Strategory.  His name's not Bill.  It's Ben.  Bill.  Ben Thompson.  Ben Thompson.  I know Ben pretty well, but I think he's Bill.  On Strategory, his lead this week was the end of the beginning.  And this is something I've said for a while.  We're talking about Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook.  I think some people say, oh, there'll be another Facebook.  There'll be another Google.  There'll be another Microsoft or Amazon.  You know, IBM didn't last forever.  He says that's not necessarily true.  And the car industry is kind of a way to look at this.  He said when automobiles were first invented in 1895, the first American automobile maker  was founded.  34 more in the next five years.  233 more in the next 10 years.  168 more in the next.  There were a lot of, and then slows down and pretty much boiled down  for many decades to the big three.  GM, Ford, and Chrysler.  And until imports started showing up.  Yeah.  And, and you know, I think people might've said, oh, well, there'll be another Nash  or something.  You know, GM isn't going to own this forever.  No, there's a, there's an economy of scale.  There's things Google does now that you couldn't start up and do.  There's things Facebook does.  There's the network effect.  He says we're in a dominance epic.  We're in the third dominance epic.  It was first IBM, then Microsoft, and then present day.  And you can no longer assume that that's, you know, going to change that these companies.  He says, but that's the beginning of an era like with cars where you get amazing innovation  because you've got these big platform companies that everybody can innovate on.  And I, you know, here I am walking around CES and what do you see?  You see thousands of little companies, but sign after sign works with Amazon echo.  Right.  Works with Google assistant.  Works.  Type of hook in.  Yeah.  They're building on a platform.  And even though there wasn't a, there was a Google presence.  Did you go down the slides?  You wrote the slides, father Robert?  Really?

I never saw less than two hours in that line.  I knew someone at the gumball machine.  Oh, you jumped the line.  That's why I'm not talking about it too much.  I kind of cheated.  It's a giant machine.  You do a Google query into a microphone, a giant big gumball comes down.  It's not a gumball.  You open it up inside a beanie, inside a butt bag, inside...

He was from Russia.  He was living in New Jersey.  He's made an Apple One kit for $99.  He said Waz approved it because we use his code.  We have an Arduino for the disc controller and the screen.  I said what's that?  He says it's 6502.  I said where did you get a 6502?  He said there's some old ones from MOSFET but there's a guy who makes them.  There's a guy fabbing 6502s.  He comes with a breadboard, all the chips.  You don't have to solder.  You put it together.  $99 you can have an Apple One.  I said is it a lowercase?  He said no, of course not.  It's an Apple One.  It's all cash.  That's old school.  It's old school.  That's like 1976 technology.  I thought to see a kid, he was probably 25, doing that.  And the fact that Waz, he contacted Waz and Waz said yeah, I like that idea.  Go ahead and do it.  Steve Waz is the co-founder of Apple.

Transcript:  I love Eureka Park.  It's almost like a flea market.  It's like a flea market of technology.  But you know, the cool thing is,  CS is dominated by these giants, right?  Samsung and LG and Sony.  They have monster multimillion dollar booths.  And then a bunch of these companies are just really scrappy startups,  sometimes just two people and their whole marketing budget they spent to buy a booth  in Eureka Park and they're there just trying to peddle their wares and get somebody to believe  in what they're doing.  And there are people, like you said, from all over the world.  And some of those are companies that are pretty big.  If this was a show in Europe, they would have a bigger booth, but they're here.  So there's a little bit of everything.  They're just people that are pretty passionate.  Some of them aren't very polished about the way that they're given their presentation.  So you have to kind of read between the lines a little bit.

I have to say, of all the things I saw, the one I wanted to bring home was the giant 8K  micro LED.  I think micro LED.  While it's not available yet, and if you could afford it, actually, I guess you can,  but it's just like million dollars.  But I think in the years to come as they improve the product, improve the...  Really, actually, they have to improve the process in the content.  Yeah.  Well, there's no content.

Transcript:  They can't really manufacture it right now, to be honest.  It has a little bit of an uncertain future because...  Oh, really?  It's too hard to make?  It is.  It's too hard to make.  They've not figured out how to manufacture it at scale.  You'll see them wiggle on that a little bit from our sources, from what we've learned.  It's a little bit of a mystery if it's going to actually come to the mass market.  But what we did learn...  I was in Korea in November and had some pretty good sources there.  And also, this announcement that went under the radar is Samsung is going to be making  OLED screens, which has a great future.  And Samsung...  So LG owns the OLED market today for TVs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Samsung Display, which is a competitor to LG Display, which sells all those,  they announced in the fall very quietly that they're announcing what they call QD display,  which if you look at closely, it's actually OLED using quantum dots.  So this is very wonky.  But essentially, they're taking the technology that they've learned to do with their QLED displays  and bring this mashup of OLED and with QLED, which is just a film on top of the screen.  In the short term, it's probably the future.  I did see at that time.  I agree with you 100%.

Start time: 2646.32
End time: 2669.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But remember how long it took OLED to get to maturity.  There were all sorts of problems with OLED.  Maybe it'll be 10 years.  Micro LED, I think, will get there eventually.  But yeah, it's not next year.  It's not the year after.  It's a few years off.  It was interesting to see that Samsung's QLED technology, which I thought they owned,  showing up with Hisense and other companies.  Apparently, other companies are able to make QLEDs as well.  I don't know if that's Samsung licensing it.

It didn't get much press, but I thought the nicest TV you could buy today is the Samsung 8K.  It's called their Infinity Display.  Yeah, that was gorgeous.  It is literally bezel-less.  It's an 8K display that is literally bezel-less.  I saw a soccer match on it.  Literally, when the ball gets kicked, on our TVs today, we don't think about it,  but there's a blur as the ball goes by.  You don't see any blur as the ball moves in this 8K.  As the runners are running, you see every pixel of them running.  I thought, oh my gosh, to watch a sporting match.

Transcript:  I'll tell you how long it's been since I've been at CES.  The last time I was there, there was this running battle between companies who had the biggest  display.  And remember that?  I thought you were going to say, oh, they had the Walkman.  And the Walkman wasn't that long ago.  But it was like, oh, Samsung has a 100-inch.  Oh, Sharp has a 101-inch, 102.  Nobody attempted to compete with Samsung's The Wall.  No.  I think that thing was 245-inch.  It's like two stories tall.  Was that a micro-LED or what was that?

Transcript:  Because those are roughly a foot square and you could tile them.  One thing I did notice though on the micro-LEDs, in the right lighting conditions,  you could see the edges of the tiles.  See the seams.  So they got to work on that too.

Transcript:  Yeah.  The crazy thing is what's even weirder about this.  When we went and when we saw it in Korea, we went to the area where they kind of staged  these things and they had box after box after box in this giant long hallway, stacked like  10 or 15 deep.  Meaning these are the ones they're shipping out to places and having them installed.  Obviously, it's only like the 1% not even the 1% but the 0.1%.  That are getting these things.  Because it's a million bucks at least.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  They're at least 300 to 500,000 to just start on these things.  So if you are professional athletes, obviously Wall Street bankers.

Transcript:  Why not?  So Samsung did show off some of those because of their current technology QLED.  You can leave it on all the time and it doesn't have the burn in problems.  That's the one problem with OLED right now and probably some of these other newer  technologies as well is that the burn in on your screen.  There were some of these ambient mode screens, essentially like screensavers,  like you said, that are running.  So one was like a window and you had some books on it and the wind would blow and the pages would flip.  So it was just sitting there.  Another one was a fireplace and the fire is crackling.

We saw a lot of folding phones.  The Royal had a cylinder with a screen around and all sorts of things.  It was a smart speaker-ish.  They were the first to do the folding phone last year at CES and then everybody copied.  Although John Gruber writing in Dairy Fireball talked a little bit about the fact that  CES should be called the concept electronic show because a lot of these folding phones  will never be sold.  I would prefer that, actually.

Transcript:  Sony's car.  Sony got a lot of attention because at the end of their keynote, they said,  oh, and we have a car.  They didn't expect that.  But it's not a car you'll ever be able to buy or they'll ever manufacture.  It was just a concept.

Start time: 3126.30
End time: 3174.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the show was originally a product, a place where product buyers from big retailers would go  and they'd pick like, oh, yeah, I want a bunch of those.  Make that for me.  I'll buy a thousand of those.  Exactly.  And they would put their orders in and then it evolved into a little bit more of a concepty  show.  I think what we've seen now is there's room for both.  There's room for companies to come, announce these are the products we have coming out in 2020.  And here's some ideas we have about the future.  Take a look at these.  Let us know what you think because that's the way they use it.  And then they just they may never go into product development or they may be in various  stages of product development and they get the reaction from consumers, from the press.  And then they decide, okay, this is if we're going to go forward or not or how we're going  to go forward or how we're going to change the product and move ahead with it.  I like the idea.

Start time: 3175.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't show them.  They make them.  They demo them.  Their design lab makes them.  They don't show anything until they can sell it.  Project charging that project.  Well, the power map was a mistake.  OK, you're right.  So maybe they are changing.  But but there is something to be said for a company that I mean, every company is going  to do concepts as part of the design process.  All right.  Showing them off shows, I think in my mind shows a little weakness.  It's almost saying, see, we can innovate.  We can develop cool stuff.  But if you're not going to make it, if you can't make it into a product, if Sony cannot  make that car, will not make that car.  There's no point.  So they can partner.  No, no, that's not the point of that car.  The point of that car was to get attention.  The point of the car was exactly the same point as the Charmin toilet paper robot.  Robot.  Best part.  Yeah, show floor.  So this is the thing that always gets me about CES.  Actually, let me take a break and then I'll tell you the thing that always gets me about CES.

Transcript:  I'll explain why this is this in a nutshell is what's wrong with CES.  But first, a word from our sponsor.  This is what's right with Epson.  Epson makes printers, right?  And they make inkjet printers and for a long time make cartridge printers.  They had the courage to say, you know, maybe there's a better way to make an inkjet printer.  Maybe instead of cartridges that run out in the middle of the print job every few weeks,  we could put a big tank on our printer, four tanks, black, cyan, magenta, and yellow.  You fill them up, print thousands of pages before you need to put more ink in.  Maybe we could do that.  But then they realized, well, this is going to take a smart consumer  because the consumer is going to look at the box and say,  you've got two years of ink in the box.  It's going to cost a little bit more, right?  They have to make that.  They have to understand that's going to save you money in the long run.  It's going to save you frustration.  You get all the beautiful color of an inkjet,  but you also get up to two years of ink in the box.  I even bought an extra set of ink bottles because I thought,  well, you know, you have to always have more.  No, it's been more than a year.  Go ahead, print all the documents, everything you need in beautiful color.  Don't worry about it.  You're not going to run out of ink because of those great Epson EcoTank printers.  Color-coded bottles.  You can't load them wrong.  You can't spill them.  They're easy.  There's a whole range of them.  Perfect for every need.  Add the Epson EcoTank printer to your shopping list.  You can do like Shaq does.  Just fill and chill.  Transform the way your home or office prints.  Do away without of ink frustration.  Go to Epson.com slash EcoTank Leo, E-P-S-O-N.com slash EcoTank Leo for Epson's EcoTank printers.  I think they deserve a lot of credit for considering their customers first  and doing something that was a little scary, took a little courage at first,  but man, does it make a difference.  Epson.com slash EcoTank Leo.  Just fill and chill.  Epson, exceed your vision.  I've been using Epson with my computer since the very first computer I got,  a dot matrix Epson MX80.  Remember that?  I miss the old dot matrix.  You go to any airport.  You can pick one up.  Tractor feed, burst and decolate.  Or you can get the 21st century printer, Epson.com slash EcoTank Leo.  Thank you Epson for supporting that.

And over the years, certain ecosystems have evolved to make it easier for Channel 7, 8, 9 and 10,  CNN and the others to get in, get out, get the story and get out.  And so it started with I think Showstoppers and then Pepcom's Digital Experience.  These are the little mini trade shows that they do before.  And then the Consumer Electronics Association said, wait a minute,  those guys are making a lot of money.  So they said, we're going to start ours on Sunday.

Transcript:  I think Showstoppers this year, like not even close.  It's pretty good.  It's pretty good.  So that's how, so this is the whole trick.  So you rent a ballroom, you charge a hundred vendors $10,000 a piece.  Minimum.  You do the math.  Minimum.  Yeah.  You can charge some vendors more because I've realized now, and they did it with a happy fork,  that some vendors say, you know, if I'm the first person as you come in the door,  I'm going to get all the coverage.  So this year, Charmin, you go in the door, there is Charmin.  Front and center.  And Charmin didn't even bother, didn't even pretend to make a device that you could buy.  They made the RollBot.  And I went up and I asked the kid who, I said, did you invent this?  He said, yeah.  So when can I get it?  He said, you never going to get it.  What's the premise?  It has the Charmin Bear on the front.  It has a toilet paper roll on it.  If you are sitting on the can and you run out of toilet paper, the Bot brings you to,  first of all, that's nuts.  One of the world's biggest problems.

Transcript:  You were cueing me.  Thank you.  I was cueing you.  You're good.  To your point, Leo, a lot of what it's about is trying to find where are the tectonic plates moving?  Yes, because they move slowly.  They do.  They move very slowly.  When you're at CES, you're overwhelmed with 40,000 products.  You can lose the forest in the trees like that.  It's really hard to see the forest in the trees.  So I think I'll just sum them up super quick.  One was the Impossible Pork thing where they're making fake pork.  Pork is the most consumed meat in the world.  They made a big splash last year.

Start time: 4105.52
End time: 4118.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it good pork?  I haven't had it.  I didn't try it either.  It's actually really good.  They were handing out sliders.  In fact, I brought one back just for you.  It's only a few days old.  The White Castle ones.  White Castle.  Yes, they're making White Castle sliders, but out of Impossible.

End time: 4137.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Our team thought so too.  I eat a plant-based diet.  I'm vegan, but I just didn't get to that.  But I think because they made such a big splash last year,  it was kind of like the big hit of the show last year.  Let me ask you, Jason.

Start time: 4138.22
End time: 4144.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So are you a vegan for ethical reasons or for environmental reasons or health reasons?  I guess those are the three big.

Start time: 4144.80
End time: 4158.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  More the last two.  I would say like three, number one, and two, the second.  Biggest one for me was health.  I had some health issues, mostly around environmental allergies, a few years ago.  That was why I...

Start time: 4244.00
End time: 4248.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It shouldn't be because it's actually cheaper.  Well, it's a novelty to make.  It's a novelty.  It's a novelty.  It'll get cheaper.

Start time: 4249.46
End time: 4266.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's also, it's economies of scale, right?  Once they can make these at scale, it should be much cheaper ultimately.  It'll be more economical to feed a lot more people because you're using less land.  So that was my question.  Is it really an improvement?

Start time: 4266.54
End time: 4267.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It sounds like it is.

Start time: 4268.25
End time: 4277.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is.  It is.  But it is economies of scale to Anne's point now.  And in the near future, it's probably going to continue to be more expensive to do these  things because they're just not doing them at the same.

Start time: 4277.82
End time: 4280.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what's the trend?  The trend is an impossible pork.

Start time: 4281.41
End time: 4314.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  The trend is that food, last year it was a big hit.  You could say, oh, that was a novelty.  That was a one-year kind of thing.  The fact that it was one of the biggest hits of the show again this year is really that  the tech industry has accepted that food innovation is a valuable part of this industry.  It's accepted this as part of the industry.  So I'd expect you're going to see not just impossible.  Probably next year they'll come out with impossible poultry.  I would recommend or I would say is probably a pretty safe bet.  They've said they're working on that.  When are they going to make kale that's got meat in it?

Start time: 4316.10
End time: 4321.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 4332.18
End time: 4353.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One analyst said I think very cogently at the show is that a decade from now,  it might even be two decades, probably most meat that we meet quote unquote,  that we eat will be plant-based and then the real meat will be a luxury.  It will be a premium item.  There's going to be less of it produced.

Start time: 4360.38
End time: 4382.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then I'd want to eat it every day.  In fact, that's my exact experience.  That sounds like my life.  Can I have a ribeye every day?  No, but I actually for health reasons and ethical reasons, environmental reasons,  I do want to give it meat.  I'm looking at that as my next thing for next year.  I don't really have that option where I'm living right now.  All you can eat is spaghetti all day.

Start time: 4382.40

Start time: 4408.50
End time: 4445.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Toyota announced what I think of as the most ambitious thing at CES,  which was Toyota's Woven City, which is this prototype community of the future,  which has a very similar ring to Epcot, which in Disney World,  which actually stands for Experimental Prototype City of Tomorrow.  But I think what the trend here is that they have said, look,  most of today's communities, cities especially, are built around cars.  What if we built a community where there were no human driven vehicles?  What would that look like?  Even better.

Start time: 4445.56
End time: 4450.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's just build around pedestrians.  Do we even need, I guess we need delivery vehicles.

Start time: 4450.70
End time: 4459.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm more so with you.  I'd rather a community be something where it's pedestrian friendly  and a little bit more safety and not get hit by these massive machines.

Start time: 4460.68
End time: 4553.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you're right on.  That's more the idea.  I'd say it's not so much self-driving.  The vehicles that you do have to have would be self-driving.  But other than that, it's going to think about new forms of personal mobility.  So there's this little thing, for example, that came out, the Wello.  It's kind of like they call it sort of a tricycle for adults.  It's more like this little pod that has three wheels that you  can drive around when you have to go further.  That's W-E-L-L-O.  And then there's other ideas.  Obviously, bikes could be part of it.  Walking, obviously, would be a big part of it.  Make things like the High Line in New York City where you can.  Isn't that a great place?  I love the High Line.  It's amazing.  I love that thing.  I'll walk to meetings and do that because it's a lot faster and it's great.  Things like that.  So that's the idea.  And my point in this was that if this takes off, look for other communities and even companies.  Because sort of the weird thing is this is a company city, right?  But they're letting normal people essentially move into this place, which sits at the foot of Mount  Fuji as well.  And the idea is if this takes off, look for other companies and communities to replicate it.  Super ambitious idea.  Interesting.  We'll see what happens.  But obviously, it's a good thing that people are thinking of how would we innovate,  not just technology or not just a product, but the way that we can optimize,  the way that we get together.

Start time: 4555.28

End time: 4572.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is not their first time this has been at CES.  Ten years ago, I actually dropped a link into the doc for this.  GM did a concept called the Envy, which was the exact same thing where you would have the inner core  of the city that only had these people pods.

Start time: 4573.04
End time: 4579.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 4580.12
End time: 4595.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they actually showed you if you made it entirely driverless,  you could do these traffic patterns that they didn't have lights.  You would have an absolute arrival time at your destination.  And then if you needed more, you just summoned more pods.  Like if you had cargo, you'd summon an extra pod that would caravan with your pod.

Start time: 4596.66
End time: 4631.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Health sensors were there.  That's it.  Which looks goofy, but it was actually very cool.  It was designed for cities, obviously, where no vehicles would be.  Segway actually had that fun little pod with the two wheel pod that balanced.  Did you like that thing?  Yeah.  Somebody drove it around on the show floor.  I can't remember who it was.  One of our friends.  And the knob fell off and he crashed into a wall.  But he wasn't hurt.  So there you go.  Health sensors, health tech.

Start time: 4633.80
End time: 4701.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is based on the idea of you look at just what's happened in the last few years,  what you can do with the ECG and Apple Watch and other devices like the ones from Withings.  There's tests and things that you can run on your own wrist now,  or devices that you've gotten for under $500 that you used to have to make a visit to the hospital  and get an appointment and would cost you thousands of dollars.  Right.  So like a heart rate variability, for example, which is a tests or essentially a sensor  that tells you your stress levels.  So that is something that you used to have to do would be very complicated.  One of the ones that was announced at CES, one of the new things.  So there were a number of new kinds of sensors or newish,  like the PPG for optical heart rate, SpO2, your blood oxygen, and also allows  some deeper sleep analysis that can detect sleep apnea.  Right now you have to do these really expensive tests often.

Trend number four, according to Jason Heiner of CBS Interactive,  computer and CNET.  Computers are folding like phones.  Yeah.  But a lot of the folding phones we saw won't be sold, right?  Yeah.  Samsung is rumored on February 11th to be doing a new Samsung Galaxy Fold,  but it's going to be called the Flip.  It'll be more like the Moto Razr.

Transcript:  So my colleagues and I were talking a lot about this last week,  and we think these things make a little more sense as tablets and even computers  than they do on phones.  The Galaxy Fold was really about a phone that folded into a small tablet.  It's a small tablet at its core, right?  So, but when you take this, the interesting thing about this is this horseshoe bend,  which is the reference design that Intel-

Start time: 4911.56
End time: 4920.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you see it bend here, but don't unbend it or re-bend it.  So, we've been using the Galaxy Fold and the Clara before CES,  and we've bent it a little bit.  So it's usable.  It's still early days.

Start time: 4946.88
End time: 5010.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's the versatility of it because what you can do,  and yeah, I think you're going to see some of these where they just  make two screens on each side and you don't have to worry about the bend.  What's cool about the way, with the one that bends,  and I do think it's the future even though if it might be a few years away,  is when you fold it all the way out, it has a little kickstand  and it's essentially either a 17-inch tablet or an all-in-one computer, right?  You just hit the kickstand, set it down.  If you have a mouse and keyboard, then you're right there.  You can use that as your sort of all-in-one, right?  Imagine that when you're in your hotel room.  That's much nicer than being on a laptop, having more like a desktop.  And then the keyboard is like magnetically sealed,  so the keyboard can snap to the bottom of the screen  if you want to use not a virtual keyboard but a physical keyboard.  So some of these things are just a really interesting idea on rethinking  the usable concept of a computer.  Yeah, I commend them for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I mean, is there space...  In the GPU business, you've got NVIDIA and you've got AMD.  And both of them are making incredible products.  Is there really space for Intel?  Because Intel is going to be playing catch-up for at least the first four years.

Start time: 5189.28
End time: 5203.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They can play catch-up, but they at least have the  pockets to play catch-up for now and do more in that R&D side.  I wonder how much runway they have.  AMD was pretty much in the same position about five, six years ago.  It's true.

Start time: 5205.84
End time: 5240.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To that point, I think I have to say that I have more confidence that Intel could build  GPUs than they could build mobile CPUs.  Right?  They tried to go into mobile.  Yes.  Not good for them.  But when it comes to just raw power, Intel is your company.  I have more faith that they could do this well, especially because GPUs are becoming  more important in high-end compute and those kinds of things that are more server-based  kind of stuff.  They have a lot of IP.  They have a lot of expertise in that.  So I wouldn't count them out on it.

Start time: 5251.23
End time: 5328.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Today's tech is so flashy.  It's in your face.  If you bring one of these assistants into your house, which you really should think  about before you do it, understand what you're doing when you do it.  But it's like putting this big thing, even if it's a puck.  It's like putting that thing in your kitchen or your living room or, God forbid, your bedroom.  Right?  It's like you're putting this big round piece of technology that's either a giant  cylinder or a small puck.  It doesn't fit in the environment very well.  I liked and I think that we should feel good about some of the companies, like the one  that I have the picture of in the story is Muilab.  I think it's pronounced.  It's a company that has made the smart display made out of natural wood.  So when it hangs on your wall, it just looks like a piece of wood.  But when you touch it, and it's very rudimentary.  It's very sort of just getting started kind of look.  But it has it lights up.  There are little LEDs that light up on top of the wood where you push buttons and you  have a number of different things you can do.  Much more subtle.  The whole idea is to blend in with the environment, not be another piece of technology.  This is what you were talking about, Anne.

Transcript:  Father Robert, are you wearing it now?  I'll tell you later.  Our show today brought to you by the Fox Mint Mobile.  Ryan Reynolds phone company.  Yes, it's Deadpool's phone company.  I asked him, we were on a call with him.  I said, does Ryan Reynolds really own Mint?  They said, yeah.  Yep.  She does.  So if you're still using a big wireless company, you know what a pain those big four are.  What are you paying for?  Besides expensive retail stores, inflated prices, hidden fees,  you're being taken advantage of because they know you'll pay.  That's why I love and use Mint Mobile.  Same premium network coverage you're used to at a fraction of the cost.  They don't have stores.  They don't have inflated prices, hidden fees.  They don't have any of the stuff that costs money.  They just pass those savings out to you.  They do have great tech support.  Nice people who will help you get set up with Mint Mobile.  No, I can't promise Deadpool will answer the phone, but somebody very nice.  I love Mint Mobile.  It makes it easy to cut your wireless bill down to as little as $15 a month.  They have a three-month introductory plan.  What I did, I should have just done the introductory plan, but then I saw  that for $25 a month, I could get 12 gigabytes of data, unlimited text and phone calls  for $25 a month when you buy a one-year plan.  I said, I'm in.  I bought a year.  I said, that's the best price I've ever heard of, 12 gigs.  And by the way, I haven't once touched even 10 gigs.  It's more data than I'll ever use.  You use your own phone if you want.  You can buy a phone there.  I like just bringing my own.  You keep your phone number, you keep your contacts, you keep your apps.  Just the only thing you don't keep is that expensive wireless bill.  Start saving with Mint Mobile.  It's amazing.  I'm going to move all my stuff to Mint Mobile.  I'm looking at my $90 a month Verizon plan for one line, one phone,  and I'm thinking 25 bucks for 12 gigabytes.  That's crazy.  To get your new wireless plan, just $15 a month with their three-month introductory plan.  Get a sense of what it's like.  By the way, they'll ship the whole box to you for free.  You get the SIM, you put it in.  They have a little IMEI form on the site.  You can see if your phone will work.  I was just talking to Roberto, who was one of our chatters.  It's his 60th birthday today.  His father gave him an iPhone for his birthday, 11 Pro Max.  He said, can I put it on Mint Mobile?  I said, yes, you can.  Just go to the IME, find her, enter the IMEI.  Happy birthday.  Mintmobile.com slash twit.  Cut your wireless bill to $15 a month with their three-month introductory plan.  They also have six-month plans, 12-month plans.  You pick the plan that works for you.  Mint, M-I-N-T, like the color, like the fresh flavor of mint.  Mintmobile.com slash twit.

So, you know, Ant was talking about how he needs the Ant-Pruit experience.  Cuda cores.  I can get my Ultrabook, grab one of these, and when I plug it in,  that's my Ant-Pruit experience.  I love this.  I love this idea.  Now, I will say I've tested four different eGPU enclosures.  I was very unhappy with three of them.  Oh, interesting.  They kept crashing or they had clear driver inconsistencies.  Is it typically driver problems?  Yeah, horrible driver problems.  This is the only one I've used, the Asus one.  It's also the prettiest.  It's a very nice looking-  It's very nice.  It's very small, but it's the only one I know that worked immediately.  Mac or PC.  Just no problem.  Nice.  Yeah.

I wanted to see what else was out there.  I like it that it's open source.  There's one thing I don't like about Yubiko is they've closed source what they're doing.  On the other hand, nothing is as capable.  And really, if you're just using it for two-factor authentication,  you don't even see what the source code is.  That's fine.  What else you got?

Start time: 6450.52
End time: 6466.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's the same idea.  So if you want to use it as a stand, you just push this right in the middle.  Oh, look!  A little ring popped out.  So now you can use it as a stand or...  Oh, I might get that.  You put them together like that and suddenly it's a phone.  You hold it.  It's called Oh Snap.

So partly using it to hold it but partly so you can stand it up.  I wished I had that on the airplane.  I was watching a movie on my iPhone and I had no way to stand it up.  I will say that though, like seeing that.  Wouldn't that be better?  Wireless charging and everything?

Start time: 6489.84

Start time: 6530.04
End time: 6539.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 6605.70
End time: 6621.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We showed that.  So they had the Ghostbusters ambulance.  And they had a dolly camera and a photographer shooting around it.  And it looked like it was in an alley.  They even had blowing leaves and stuff.  But what that alley was, was a TV.  It was a crystal display TV.

Start time: 6622.52

Start time: 6625.82

Start time: 6633.96
End time: 6650.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this had all of the beautiful perspective change when the camera moves.  It shifts as you move.  And that could save so much money on a TV or movie set.  I think a lot of movie makers will be buying this.  That was really cool.  It's expensive, but it's going to save them a lot of money.  You don't have to build sets.

Start time: 6650.96
End time: 6655.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 6655.88
End time: 6664.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It also solves things like how do you make sure that your equipment doesn't show up in reflections  when you're shooting?  Because that's actually a big problem for practical...  Plus, green screens are so hard to light.

Start time: 6664.66
End time: 6696.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you can't get a green screen that's slave to the camera.  But this is so much easier.  This seems like a great way to do it.  You also like that Canon that they were showing up.  They rented a gamer.  He was there streaming.  He was like a Twitch streamer guy.  And he was sitting there.  Hardcore.  He was sitting there gaming while the conference was going on all around him.  And they showed him instead of using a Logitech camera,  like something like the camera you're using, Jason,  he was using a Canon point and shoot, the EOS M200.

Start time: 6697.80
End time: 6723.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a mirrorless design, M200, 499, but it has an HDMI out that allows you to stream.  Live stream.  Live stream just like you would with any other webcam.  So you get a much cleaner image and you can put any type of Canon glass on it  that has the proper in-mount.  So if you want to have something with a nice shallow depth of field,  you can grab you a nice in-mount lens.  It's like an F2.8 and just...  Oh, it'll be so purty.

Start time: 6724.24
End time: 6739.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do want to get one of these.  It was really nice.  I'm surprised though that you didn't pick the 1DX.  Well, they also showed us their most expensive case.  I like the 1DX.  The 1DX is going to cost you...  499 less.  That's nothing.  The 1DX M200 is great.  That's actually great.

Start time: 6739.26
End time: 6768.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The 1DX, so Mark III, yes, I drooled over it.  I think it was $6500.  It's $6500, but I would take it.  It's total overkill for what I shoot.  You shoot with Canon.  Yes, I'm a Canon guy, unapologetically,  but it's total overkill for what I like to shoot.  Now, if I was going down to the Niners games or the Packers games or anything like that,  or even shooting wildlife, wanting to shoot birds and things of that nature,  yes, that 1DX would just totally crush it.

Transcript:  Nice.  V-log, V-gamut.  So for video shooting, and you liked, and I saw you oogling the fact that you can take...  And I wish we'd had this.  That's another reason why I like Canon.  If we could have flipped the LCD out and flipped it around so you could see  while I was shooting you what I was getting, they would have been so much better.  Practicality.  Maybe for next year.

Transcript:  I think though if you ask me my favorite thing, it would have to be  any one of the micro LED 8K screens, especially the big 145-inch one that LG was showing,  the giant wall that Sony was showing, or no, Samsung was showing.  No, that's Samsung.

Start time: 6905.88
End time: 6961.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you see the 8K looking glass?  Looking glass?  Which one?  No.  So imagine...  Okay, I know holographic slash 3D, bad, bad, bad, bad, but it was incredible.  So they had a demonstration in the Seagate booth.  No controllers, no headset, no nothing.  Up to 50 degrees, you get the full 3D effect and I can completely interact with everything  in the image.  I can pull it out.  I can use my hands.  I can take a flashlight, shine it at the display, and it knows what I'm doing.  It actually illuminates the image.  That's interesting.  It's one of the stealth stories of CES.  That thing was an incredible piece of technology.  We missed that.  Where was that?  This is at Seagate?  It was in the Seagate booth over in the Nician.  It was micro LED?  What was it?  No, so they're using an 8K display and then they have a proprietary piece of technology.  They call it their light array.  So again, up to 50.

Start time: 6961.40
End time: 6972.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, this is that new light array.  Light field stuff.  So this is really interesting.  We looked at Sony's version, but I was told it wasn't as good as the one you saw at the  Seagate booth and I had meant to get over there.

Start time: 6973.00
End time: 6981.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  3D display, I don't care about, but the fact that I could interact with it, like VR,  but I had no controllers, it was just my hands.  That was special.

Start time: 6981.28
End time: 7014.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So these new 3D displays are direct view.  You don't wear special glasses.  They're not lenticular because they're actually shooting.  They're using basically reverse ray tracing.  Correct.  The light is coming out of the display in every direction.  So as you move around, you're seeing just as you do in real life, if it's a three-dimensional  object in real life, as you go around it, you see the light being bounced off in different  directions.  In perspective change.  Same thing.  But yeah, we saw the one that Sony did.  I was very underwhelmed by it.  I wish I'd seen this one.

Start time: 7014.38
End time: 7048.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it was one of these stealth press releases.  They didn't mention it that much.  I just happened to walk by it and then I saw people interacting with the elements.  And I realized that even from where I was standing way back, I could see the 3D effect.  I was like, wait, what is this?  But does Seagate make it?  No, no.  I guess they had some sort of partnership with Seagate because it takes a lot of storage  to be able to do these holographic images.  But it's a company called Looking Glass.  Interesting.  If you look at it, some of the demos that people recorded are just amazing.

Start time: 7048.58
End time: 7061.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that was the other reason I didn't run over to see it because I thought we can't  shoot this.  But apparently some people were able to.  How big was this?  It wasn't that big.  32 inches.

Start time: 7062.02
End time: 7070.02

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I didn't see it.  Darn it.  This is the other reason I freaking hate CES.  It's so big.  Because you come home and then somebody says, well, you saw the thing, of course.  It's so big there, man.  Oh, but it was hidden away.  It was like, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the other advice if you do go to CES.  Prepare an answer to the question, what have you seen?  What's good?  What's interesting?  Because that's all anybody asks you.  Because everybody's trying to figure out what should I go see.  Jason, besides your five trends, did you have a favorite product at CES this year?  Can I do three?

Start time: 7110.18
End time: 7155.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, of course you can.  All right.  Cool.  I mentioned already earlier the one that really didn't get much attention,  but I thought was amazing.  Because you can buy this TV or you will be able to in 2020.  The Samsung Q950.  That's the bezel-less 8K TV that I was talking about.  Ever since I saw this, so I saw it in our pre-briefs for CES,  it's ruined me on every other TV.  I look at every other TV.  I talked about what it did when you watch sports on it.  Obviously, this was an 8K stream that was there on plan when I saw it.  But it's just like, man.  No bezel.

Start time: 7155.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is.  And the screen is amazing.  Obviously, it's a huge step up.  And you can do the stuff that we were talking about earlier.  It can do that kind of ambient stuff.  You can have artwork go and it can be there all day.  And it's not going to have any burn-in issues.  You could have a photo album of your family cycling through.  You could have those ambient modes that we talked about like with a fire  or a book in a window where the breeze is blowing.

Transcript:  A lot of people who watch our shows are in business  and they want to do podcasts for their business.  Corporate Communications, Sales Podcasts,  Chance for the Executive to talk to the people who work for them.  If you're listening to podcasts and you're saying,  why don't we do this?  It's not surprising.  44% of Americans listen to podcasts for news and information.  Of course, businesses want this too.  But there's a lot of challenges, trust me,  to getting your own podcast going.  It's one thing to record it,  and almost anybody can do that laptop, microphone, no problem.  It's another thing to host it, to manage it, to distribute it,  to keep it private, to publish it.  And that's what YouStudio does.  A new sponsor to our show.  I love this idea for a business.  YouStudio has an app.  You can brand it with your company's logo and colors.  You give it to, you tell your salespeople, your employees,  everybody you want to talk to to download it,  put the YouStudio app on their phone,  and now they can automatically subscribe to your show.  Audio and video, by the way.  In fact, studies show audio and video formats  are up to 500% more effective than text.  Email updates, so easy to miss, so easy to ignore.  What?  You sent me a newsletter, I didn't see it.  YouStudio can be implemented in hours.  It could provide detailed analytics so you know who's listening,  who's not listening, when, how often.  Think of all the ways you could use YouStudio for your company.  You could share weekly messages from the CEO.  You can provide on-demand and engaging training to employees.  Interview happy customers instead of just putting written testimonials on your website.  Spread company news.  By the way, it doesn't just have to be your employees.  You can also share it outside your company.  I think you'll like the idea that you can keep your confidential business information confidential  because they have security and privacy built into the app.  Your private information is never discoverable online.  You can authenticate users using SSO or other authentication protocols.  You can even restrict access within the company by department or seniority or location.  It gives you a very flexible way to publish podcasts  to just the people with a need to know, to spread the word in your company,  to keep your employees excited, engaged, download an on-demand YouStudio.  Big companies, you just mentioned Salesforce, Robert.  Salesforce uses it.  Nike uses it.  Dell uses it.  They all trust YouStudio to power their private podcasts.  U-S-T-U-D-I-O.  YouStudio.com.  Request a free trial and get a personalized demo.  Tell them you heard about it on Twitter.  If they don't know, that's not good for us.  That's the letter UStudio.com.  I think this is a great idea.  They came to us and said,  look, we know you've got a lot of podcast listeners.  A lot of them work for a company or probably thinking about how to do it.  I know people ask me that.  They've been asking me that for years.  How do I do this for my company?  It's easy to do the recording.  I can tell you how to do that in a snap with a laptop, with a microphone.  It's the distribution.  It's the management.  It's the analytics.  It's the keeping track of it that's so hard.  YouStudio will do it for you.  You at a very good price.  YouStudio.com.  And I thank you so much, YouStudio, for believing in us.  I hope you all try it out.  YouStudio.com.

They said, look, we're not going to try to make the coolest looking display.  We're just going to make a really nice looking watch that has a small circle in it.  That has some of the digital readings in it.  And we're going to track a lot more.  And your app will have all of the data on it.  It's like a semi smartwatch.  Yeah.  I mean, it's a super smartwatch.  It's just the screen is, you know, most of the data and everything goes to your phone.  This is the one that does that I was talking about.  It can check for sleep apnea.  It does deeper sleep.  It does ECG.  It does the PPG, which is an optical heart rating, literally.  And then SPO2 to check your blood oxygen level.  Oh, it does.  Really?  Oh.

It has hands, a second hand.  It's only got a little circular screen embedded in the watch.  Yeah.  I kind of like what they're doing over there.  Why things I think they really have some interesting.  I use their scale, their blood pressure monitor.  Maybe I should be looking at the watch.

Samsung Galaxy Chromebook.  This I did not.  Oh, I was impressed as hell.  No, no, no.  It's expensive, but I was impressed as hell with that.  Yeah.  In terms of design, one of the best looking design laptops that we saw at CES this year.  It's the, uh, I called it kind of the spiritual successor to the original Google Pixel.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a high end Chromebook.  This thing is looks great.  Super light.  It's a great design.  USBC.  Uh, they are selling more and more of these Chromebooks to normal consumers.  They obviously have 60% of the education market now with Chromebooks.  But this one is aimed.  They have more.  They now have 20% of the market in just consumers.  So, yeah, we won't see this in public schools.

Start time: 7680.38
End time: 7683.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 7684.06
End time: 7728.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's a high end laptop.  So still when you're using it, one of the misconceptions about Chrome is that everything's  running in the cloud.  Well, no, when you're doing video, when you're doing, um, you know, local, there's a lot of  local processing that still happens on these things.  And so this thing's going to run all of that stuff a lot faster.  You know, basic, basic photo editing, um, video.  Like I said, it has a great screen because, um, you know, Samsung, like we just talked  about makes really good screens.  I went to see this.  I had a briefing with this and I did.  I was like a thousand dollar Chromebook really.  And then I saw this thing and put my hands on it.  I was like, wow, this is the kind of, I would love to carry a laptop like this.  Chromebook can't do everything I need, but I was impressed by this for sure.

Start time: 7728.40

We'd love to have you in studio.  We had a great studio on.  Sean, you're a little late, but you made it.  Sean's visiting from Ann Arbor.  We have Wesley and Millie, as I mentioned, from Lancaster and from Moran.  We've got Rob.  If you want to be in studio, just email tickets at twit.tv.  We love having a studio audience.  It's really fun to meet you.  You can also join us in the chat room, irc.twit.tv.  That's where Roberto is.  Happy birthday, Roberto and the whole gang, including you, Father Robert,  a brave thing to do to chat as you participate, irc.twit.tv.  You don't even need a special client.  You just do it right from the browser there.  All of our shows are stored at the website, twit.tv.  You can, of course, download them from there.  But my suggestion is YouTube too.  And in fact, all the CES stuff is also on YouTube.  But my suggestion is subscribe in your favorite podcast application  so you get it automatically the minute it's available.
