Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also Bug Magazine in Croatia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bug?  Yeah, Bug.  Is it a, you write about entomology?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  An info in Brazil.  An info in Brazil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When we first started working together, John and I have been working together since 1991.  And when we first started working together, I think you were in 23 magazines, 23 columns  a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was 23 columns a month, but it wasn't a lot of it was chewed up by the...  Oh, yeah, PC Mag was like...  Well, I was also writing for the Examiner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that was like every day.  Yeah.  Hate that.  Almost.  Hate that.  Also with us, and the first time, and I'm really thrilled to get you on the show, Om Malik  from GigaOM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, Leo, thanks for having me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You've got an empire now over at GigaOM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  Not as big an empire as you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, how many...  So it was originally just your blog, and now you've got a number of bloggers working for  you, and it seems like a number of channels too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  We have seven blogs now, including GigaOM.  We have New TV, Earth to Tech, Webworker Daily, Ostatic, the Apple Blog, and JK on the Run,  including.  And we've just launched a subscription service called GigaOM Pro, which is a research service  for $80 a year.  You get unlimited research on five verticals for now, and we keep adding more verticals  to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's funny because John and I always talked about doing some vertical stuff.  That's where the money is, isn't it?  You can get an executive to lay some dough on you for information that can help them  in their business.  Right.  We always thought that would be the smart thing to do.  Did you ever do that, John?  No.  No.  Om's a smart guy.  No, I didn't do it.  Okay.  You know why I didn't do it?  It's more fun for me to cover end user computing than anything else.  I have no interest in business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What you really have interest in is playing around with overpriced gear.  That's it.  That's all it is.  Look at this gear he's got.  He's got a whole new rig in here.  People who listen to the podcast don't know it.  But he's got like, you feel that you're on a Star Trek set, only the stuff actually works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you know how many screens now I have around me?  I have 13 screens surrounding me.  Yeah.  That's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank this guy here, Kirk Harnack.  He is the, Harnack the Magnificent we're calling him.  He is the guy, Director of International Business for Telos Corporation.  Telos makes the Zephyrs that you and I use.  They make phone interfaces and radio stations.  What I didn't know is they also make sound consoles.  So Kirk out of the blue about six months ago sent me an email saying, I hear all the trouble  you're having with Mix Minus on Skype.  Maybe you'd like to try this stuff.  And so they lent us a Axia system.  That's what we're using here.  It's a digital, I'm going to give him a big plug because it's very kind of the...  Obviously you should.  Well, they lent it to us.  It's an 18 channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like a $30,000 audio system.  It's 18 channels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you know what's neat about it?  We use them.  Kirk asked the same thing.  He said, how many channels is that 18?  He said, what do you need 18 channels for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well explain it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I sure can't get it.  Kirk, are we not using them all in some form or fashion?  I mean, there's a few empty ones.  Most of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We've got a couple to fill up.  But we'll have an auxiliary input here tomorrow where you can bring up an iPod or something  to plug in if a guest has something to plug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's nice.  It's digital, which is neat.  For us, this is really kind of timely because we used to be doing...  Microphones are still analog, obviously.  They have to record your voice.  But everything else like OM is coming in through Skype on a digital channel.  Why should we make a conversion to analog at any point?  That's what we were doing.  So now OM's audio stays digital from end to end.  The only thing analog is your headset, OM, and the rest of it comes in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The cool thing is it's not just digital.  It's all IP.  So our people have made digital consoles for quite a few years now.  For probably 20 years there have been digital consoles which are digital equivalents of  what they replaced analog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Music studios now are all recording digitally.  These are Pro Tools and they record on digital media.  The IP part is interesting.  But this in here is IP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And we're one of only three companies that does that and we were the first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So if you look underneath my desk, it used to be all these analog wires.  I mean like hundreds of analog wires going on in here.  Now it's basically one ethernet cable that carries all the data.  It is a dedicated ethernet LAN though because we decided not to mix the packets with our  business LAN.  So we have two LANs.  So every computer that we're getting audio from or audio into has to have two network  cards.  So we're recording this for instance on a PC with Audition.  That's got a regular LAN card to get out to the outside world but it's also got the audio  LAN.  That's what I'm calling it, the audio LAN.  And the packets there going back and forth are all from the Axia system.  But I tell you there's no noise.  It's really amazing.  And then there's built in...  The board is not the mixer.  The board is just a...  It's like a keyboard.  It's a surface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That beautiful thing that John mentioned...  It's a surface.  It's a mouse that looks like a console.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then all of the stuff is behind you that's really doing all the work.  But that's a Core 2, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's Core 2 Duo.  And the console basically exists in software.  We've got guys in Rigo Latvia who write the code for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this thing is just basically a mouse?  It's a mouse that looks like a console.  Did you know that there's no evidence that people will ever want to use that thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you write that?  I think you wrote that.  John C. DeVorek copying to the fact that in 1942 he said nobody will ever need a mouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I never said that.  I said there's no evidence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's no evidence.  That's a pretty...  That's a little bit of a cop out.  It was accurate the time I said it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I said because it was a cop out when I wrote it.  I wasn't going to be...  I wasn't sure.  I just said there's no evidence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When did you start covering technology?  How long has it been?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, a long time.  I guess since 91, 92.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So me too.  Although, well, I started writing for Byte and Infoworld in 78.  I was a DJ slash technology journalist till 91 when John rescued me.  Saved him.  He saved me from a fateful death.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In combination with Rush Limbaugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I lost my job because Rush got my midday gig.  Still the funniest thing ever.  Me and 550 other midday talk show hosts.  That'll work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's this guy named Rush.  This is when Rush was going, listen up you people.  We've got a news bulletin.  Nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Feminazis.  He was really a showman.  And I'm thinking what the hell?  This is what...  How did I get bumped by this guy?  This is where radio is going.  Oh man.  The day they told me that, I went out and I chopped a quarter wood.  I just didn't know what to do.  I was like, what have I chosen?  I mean, I'm 33 or something and I've chosen the wrong profession clearly.  But that was...  Little did I know what a break that was.  In fact, I want to do...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You could still be a local yokel.  Exactly.  Doing the crappy little show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Exactly.  I'd be, oh no, the author of the latest Chicken Soup for the Soul is with us today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, that's what I was doing.  No wonder there were no ratings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The show was...  And it was a classic because I still hear one of those, that type of show once in a  while.  Nobody does it anymore.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there's still a few.  They used to call it, Kirk will know this, full service radio.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  A song, the forecast.  I don't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Were you a combo man at the time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was...  Well, various.  Sometimes combo, sometimes not.  But I think towards the end, combo means you run your own board.  And then...  Which you love to do apparently.  Turns out I like to do it.  Yeah, obviously.  But when you get to be a big time DJ, you have a board op.  And then you just sit in a room with a microphone, like you're doing right now.  And somebody like me is pushing all these buttons.  And it turns out I like the control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, we couldn't guess that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now I have more buttons.  Not only do I have a board, I've got a video.  I've got, I mean, I'm doing all this stuff.  I'm typing into the chat.  It's really fun.  It's really fun.  Anyway, so that was 91.  And they said, and we're working to tech news.  Now I'm just saying.  A little memory lane here.  And they said, we don't hate you.  That was nice.  Thank you.  But we like Rush better.  But here's what we're going to let you do.  Nine hours, KNBR, nine hours Saturday and Sunday of talk shows.  You'll be the announcer.  And then we'll bring in the Carey brothers to talk about home improvement.  Or Anthony Blue.  Anthony Blue to do wine.  And I said, OK, but can I do a computer show?  Because this guy, Dvorak and I used to do a, you'd come on my talk show and it was great.  Can I do a computer show?  And they said, well, nobody's going to listen to that.  I said, I know.  But you're making me do nine hours.  Can one hour be computer?  So they let me do a show with you.  And that was it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I didn't know you had to talk him into it.  Oh, yeah.  I thought they said Dvorak.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  They said, well, look at this is this was maybe even 90.  This was DOS three, Windows three, DOS two.  This was like nobody wanted to know about computers.  They still don't.  We got a lot of calls.  Still in niche.  You're right.  We did.  We always have.  Anyway, that's how it started.  So you so yeah, you and I probably went full time computers technology about the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, pretty much.  A lot of changes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, good changes.  I think that's the great thing about our business is that you never get bored.  Like every day is just like you start afresh.  It's you know, memories are great.  But is the future which is exciting.  And that's what keeps me going about this business is like the actual technology is  evolving by the minute.  Like you have the new players, the storylines remain pretty much the same.  The winners, the losers, the monopolies, you know, the Mavericks.  The names just change.  The characters change.  And that's a great movie in a way.  I think it's boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think it's boring?  I think that the people that you've just been doing it too long, John.  No, no, I think the people that are in the business are nearly as interesting as they  used to be when you had the Chuck Peddles and you had.  Oh, yeah, you're right.  George Moro.  Who was the word star guy?  And you had the Philippe Kahn.  Oh, he was a character.  Rubenstein.  Seymour.  Yeah.  And there's all these characters.  Steve Jobs and a bunch of guys who won't talk because they're the CEO and they're worried  sick that's our base.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Andy Grove was the last interesting CEO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  And these guys won't say anything because they're afraid the shareholders are going  to hear about it or the SEC is going to crack that.  No, John, they got smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's all.  The old ploy of playing with bourbon and saying, so what do you think of AMD?  That just stopped working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I'm telling you, the other thing is these guys aren't interesting on the stage.  They're boring.  Except for the two guys that are good are Steve Jobs is still entertaining, but he doesn't  do anything now because of his health.  And Larry Ellison has potential, but he doesn't want to.  So we have a bunch of these CEOs that go out robotic like and they give their little spiel  and it's so dull that I don't even go to these things anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, come on.  Benioff is a lot of fun.  Benioff is a lot of fun.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mark Benioff.  He's the one guy.  OK, you got one.  He's what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  SalesForce.com?  Is he SalesForce.com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  But he's from the Larry Ellison camp.  That's true.  He was pretty soon to stop showing up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you agree on this is a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is a very tame industry now.  But again, that doesn't mean it will always remain tame, right?  It's just we don't know who are the people who are showing up.  The next generation could be funny.  There's a lot of interesting young people out there who are doing things and someday  they'll get to be a big company.  I'm not talking about people who are doing Twitter and Facebook, but people below the...  Under the radar so far now.  So they're interesting.  You know our Kevin Rose is an interesting fellow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, always fun.  Part of the problem with that is John and I know him too well.  Yeah, I think that's true.  We don't know him from a distance, but he is interesting.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Kevin has potential as being a celebrity personality.  In fact, he is.  He gets a big audience.  Zuckerberg.  What about Zuckerberg?  Couldn't he be...  He's boring.  He's the boringest guy in the world.  What about...  Now, Rose, when's the last time he did a keynote?  Does he do them?  Does he even give speeches?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, he doesn't.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  He doesn't have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So is that one of the marks, the measures of success?  Guys should be able to do some stand-up.  It's true.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's really all they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I finally stopped speaking.  I still do some speaking, but I did a lot less.  Your speeches are great.  Well, I realized that all they want is to laugh.  I thought they wanted an insight.  They're not looking for 24-7 laugh.  They're not looking for a wall at all.  You need to get in about one every five minutes.  You got to get a punch line in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's the opposite.  That's a good show.  I think it's a good show.  I think it's a good show.  I think it's a good show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's about right.  That's a good show.  It sucks.  That's why I gave up.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a bunch of guys that'll do it for you.  All right.  Help me, because I'm going to October 10th, 1010.  I'm going to Dubai for TEDx.  So TED has franchises and Dubai has-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to Dubai for TEDx.  I'm going to Dubai for TEDx.  I'm going to Dubai for TEDx.  I'm going to Dubai for TEDx.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to Dubai for TEDx.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to Dubai for TEDx.  had to take you home to my US heroes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You were there, were you there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We was right there.  There's zero lead in that around, so yeah, something you can do, and then we'd get out  there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We really don't need as many jokes.  Oh, 18, have Marty Higgins do it.  It's a Ted talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Marty Higgins could help me.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's a comic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, he's on Skype.  He can do a whole.  All right.  I'm gonna ask Marty to help me write some jokes.  I'm really looking forward to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  TEDx to buy if you get a chance, 1010.  There's a lot of joke writers around.  You just have to get back into the, you know, into the, into the clique.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You used to do something very funny.  You'd make videos with your Amiga, your video toaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  Which is a precursor to what I use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's precursor.  It's basically the same thing.  I don't think they made a single, single change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Different operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the same.  Yeah, it's XP.  It's an Amiga.  Om, do you do much public speaking?  You do, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not that much.  I used to, but not anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What happened to the, the, the Om Malik show on Revision 3?  Did you still do that?  You had a heart attack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I kind of had a heart attack.  Pretty much, you know, so I kind of scaled back on that.  We're trying to bring it back.  But you know, I just, I'm a little bit of a perfectionist, so we're working on that  a little bit.  So hopefully by end of this summer, we'll be able to bring it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're going to get you to do Twitter a few more times, Om.  This is like public speaking because you've got this chat room and that's, there's eight  or nine hundred, nine hundred and ninety seven people in the chat room.  Kibitzing.  Kibitzing.  So I'll give you an example.  Out of nowhere, Web 577.  Leo, you're ignorant of UK news.  Did we mention anything about the UK here?  I don't know.  I think I don't know where that came from.  All right.  Thank you, Web 577.  So that's one thing you don't get in a, in an audience.  They're relatively tame compared to that.  Big stories this week.  I'm sure there are some.  I don't really, I have no idea.  Did anything happen this week?  Let me look back and see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've just been basically putting this machine together all week.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I really haven't had a whole lot of time.  Let's see what we have on the blog.  See, see what's on the blog.  Anything, anything big happened this week?  I'm trying to think.  Maybe Om has something to say about FriendFeed and Facebook.  Who's the, who's the, do you, do you, do you care about social media at all, Om?  I know you're on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I do.  I actually, it's, it's, it's an interesting, you know, evolution of the web and why shouldn't  we, I think every should be caring enough for this thing.  I think what we're seeing is, is the, the future of the media evolve and right in front  of our eyes.  I say media loosely.  I say the future of information.  And, and from that perspective, you know, services like Facebook, like Twitter, like  FriendFeed are interesting.  And I think the big change which might be going on in the web right now is that the,  the information is being atomized, right?  Being, first we saw the rise of the blogs and, you know, singular blog posts and now  we've seen, then came the YouTubes and photographs being put on Flickr and all those places.  And now we are seeing a pattern amongst people of sharing links to these things with, let's  say using Bitly or some other URL shortener.  And what you really are seeing is that the, the, the web is getting, you know, or the  information web is getting, you know, sliced into little components.  And the only way to aggregate it is through your social graph or recommendations from  your friends and, you know, colleagues and that, you know, like sort of like what shows  up on John's blog is interesting enough for other people to read and go consume.  And I think that's, that's a bit of a change which is happening.  So from that perspective, I'm very keen on social media.  That's more of a macro web perspective.  Sorry, too much, too many words.  No, I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I think that's exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is, there's a story that I want to, I don't want to forget to mention.  The, you know, the, one of the things if you're looking for a news item.  I have a few.  Well, you know about Apple.  Oh, that story is great.  The 999 thing.  No, what's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought you were going to talk about the Google Apple FCC.  No, no, I'm talking about.  What's the 999 thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Apple's going to have this meeting on September 9th.  Now is that official?  From what we can tell, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nobody's got an invite yet, but supposedly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They were shooting it in Marin.  They were shooting the commercials they're going to bring out and probably what's going  to be at the show in the Marin headlands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's going to be the Beatles, right?  Cause number nine.  Yeah.  Number nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Number nine.  Number nine.  So they're going to do a Beatles thing.  They're going to have the Beatles catalog.  They're going to have a bunch of remastered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you think they'll have Ringo and Paul at this event?  Because supposedly they'll have an event at this, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's an interesting idea.  I doubt it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, Microsoft had Paul and Ringo.  Well, Paul and Ringo want to do the whole program.  I think Paul and Ringo are available.  I don't think they're too busy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They got a remastered albums and they got some of the albums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well 9909 is when the rock band collection comes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  And also there's going to be a new iPod design and one with a Beatles iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We've been saying this on MacBreak.  This is the Merlin Man rumor for the last two years.  A yellow submarine iPod.  You think it'll happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if it's going to be yellow submarine, but it might be.  That'd be good.  It's going to be something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That'd be good.  So FCC letters have been released by Google, AT&T and Apple.  Remember the FCC said to all three, so what's the story?  You rejected the Google voice application.  And I talked about this in the radio show.  It's like you got teenagers here.  So AT&T says, no, I didn't do it.  FCC says, did you tell me the truth, AT&T?  Did you tell Apple to reject the application?  No, I didn't do it.  That was their response.  We have nothing to do with it.  Apple?  Did AT&T tell you anything?  Apple's intro, Apple really is like a teenager.  We didn't reject it.  They literally said we didn't reject it.  It's hilarious.  We're still under study.  They're like the Eddie Haskell of computing.  It's like, no, Mrs. Cleaver.  Oh, no, Mrs. Cleaver.  We would never reject it.  We're still studying that.  And then Google, this is the weirdest part, redacted it, their answer.  So their answer was, yes, we know why Apple rejected it redacted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, Google did that.  That was AT&T.  Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, Google.  So I know Steve Gilmore has a conspiracy theory about this, but do you have any thought about  what the hell Apple explained in detail why they rejected it?  Google says redacted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this is, you know, I think in many ways this is a Google inspired investigation.  I don't think they have, you know, unless they reveal what really is the issue, they  don't really have a case, so to speak.  I mean, you know, it is the Apple's platform.  Nobody really said on day one that, you know, they will allow a competitor to play in their  house.  So Google's a competitor?  I mean, either they make an OS, they're making phones, they're making an operating system,  they have a browser.  I mean, they're a competitor.  That's the post I wrote about this.  It's a Google versus Apple posturing going on, and FCC is just playing a little role  in it.  I think that's what really it is.  People just don't want to admit that Google is as nefarious as any other monopoly in our  time, whether it was Microsoft or AT&T before that or IBM.  Google has come to that point where it is don't do evil.  It's like, oh, don't just try not to be caught.  Don't be too evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Don't get caught.  Don't get caught.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I kind of don't buy that.  This is okay.  You know, Apple, whether I like what Apple did?  No, absolutely not.  But you know, I think Google is not above SIN here as well.  So I think that's what it is.  And I think what you're really seeing is like, you know, that documentary Planet Earth, which  has this beautiful scene of African elephant bulls fighting amongst each other.  That's what this thing, the whole thing reminds me of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And remember, if African elephant bulls are fighting, you do not want to be the little  native guy on the ground.  Get the hell out of there.  Or the cameraman also.  Or the cameraman.  Get the hell away.  Use a telephoto lens.  I think it's interesting.  Do you think Google was posturing in a way?  Look, Google probably knew, right, that Apple would say no.  It's to underscore the freedom.  And by the way, big announcement, Android's not, you know, anything you want in the Android  store, it's to underscore the freedom that Google is offering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think it's a good idea.  I think it's a good move.  I think the Android phone is a clear winner long term.  Really?  Oh yeah.  I think at some point it will actually overtake the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It has, it's got a way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  No, I'm not saying tomorrow.  But look, it was the same thing with Apple.  This is just a fractal.  Apple starts off with the Apple II.  They really get pretty much grab market share.  Took a while.  The IBM PC comes out.  Apple is still a dominant company.  They welcome them.  And then the next thing you know, the PC is beating them because of the closed nature  of Apple.  And then Apple does another, you know, holding a new platform and kind of owns it for a long  time.  The Macintosh, then all of a sudden Windows comes out and, you know, just essentially  wipes them out overnight.  And this is just another replay of the Apple's model.  You know, they milk it.  They make a lot of money.  They have high margins.  It's not like they're starving to death.  And at some point, because it's going to be easier for me to just do an app, like somebody  pointed out in the chat room, something like, you know, 10,000 apps being received a day  with 40 people reviewing them.  What different, what should I even deal with it?  Why don't I just put the app up on my own website?  And if you want to run it on the Android, just download it and run it.  I don't have, what should I have to go through hoops to sell something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But Apple's point, and maybe it's a good point, is that if we do this, we'll control it, then  the consumer experience will be better because every app is-  It will be.  Macintosh is a better machine.  Isn't that how you win by a better-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't work with even, the Macintosh is doing well, but it's still second, way  second place.  It's profitable though.  Yeah, I'm not saying it's not, the whole scheme is not profitable.  Well, that's all they care about.  I'm just saying it's not popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think, John, I think you're kind of overreaching a little bit here because, you know, Apple  never said that they wanted to control all the market, right?  They will continue to make a lot of money with iPhone, and this is not like the computer  business.  This is more of a phone economy.  So they can sell like 40, 50, 60, 70 million phones a year and make a ton of money on their  own existing platform, but they don't necessarily need to sell all the phones on the planet.  Nobody does, right?  And from that perspective, I think their strategy is okay where they're going with it.  I think where they are messing up is that they have too much control on the app store.  I think they need to kind of loosen up on that.  Apart from that-  I don't think they're going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think they're going to do it.  I'm not saying it's a bad strategy.  I'm just saying that over, in the long haul, the Android phone will win in terms of market  share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, but Android phone makes no money for anyone except Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google doesn't need to make money.  In fact, Android probably doesn't make money for Google.  Google's all about eyeballs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Though they basically want people to use the search inside.  It's eyeballs.  You know, again, Google is not a proven thing, right?  Like it's not, I mean, it's a 10-year-old company and it still hasn't proven a secondary  revenue line apart from advertising.  So it's very easy to kind of be in love with them, but they still have to show that they  actually got ability to make revenue from anything above and beyond advertising.  So that's my view on those guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, okay.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they're only evil to the extent that they have to be.  You made us do it.  The devil made us do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All monopolies actually end to that point where they become-  It's not really a monopoly yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google's a monopoly.  60% of search?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, 65% of the search and growing still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is your alternative?  Bing?  Bing is the apple of search.  I love Bing.  What is your alternative?  Ask.com?  I don't know.  I think Google, in fact, it always surprises me when I see 65%.  I think, well, who are these other 35%?  Who are these morons?  What are they using?  AOL search?  What are they using?  They're using Bing, I guess.  I don't understand why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think they're using Yahoo.  A lot of people are diehard Yahoo.  Well, then they're using Bing now.  Well, they are using Bing.  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unfortunately.  Yeah.  You know, Yahoo has an out on that.  Oh, do they?  They still have, they've kept their deal in China with Baidu.  Baidu?  Baidu?  Baidu.  And they, I think, are still continuing to develop the search engine in China.  Oh, that's smart.  And so they can, like-  I'm glad to hear that.  If the deal falls apart, they can come back and say, well, let's just go back there.  Oh, and flip a switch and bingo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To do any less than continue to develop in some skunkworks way would be really stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think another thing that they should do, which I don't understand why they haven't  done this, is that they should have, like, immediate, when they did the deal with Microsoft,  done a secondary deal with one of the other search engine companies and handed over their  programmers and the search code to, like, one of these other, like, what's the crazy  one, Clueless or whatever the name of it is.  Clueless?  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I use Clueless Search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think that's the name.  It could be, but-  Let them continue developing it so if the Apple deal-  Oh, cool, cool, you're talking about, UIL.  Yeah, Clueless is actually a good-  So cool, give it to cool and let them work with it and then-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that, wait a minute, I have to try cool.com.  Because that can't still be around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah, actually, it improved.  It's actually-  But who knew?  Well, who knew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They over-promoted themselves at the beginning.  Over-promoted and under-  Performed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is always the wrong way to go.  But you know, that would be a good thing to do.  They could just give it to them and then if the thing falls apart, they can just-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What do you use?  Do you use your name for a test search?  I need a test search for cool.  Yeah.  I use my name all the time.  Because you know what the results are supposed to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I know what should be on there.  Like if I type in John C. Dvorak and the Dvorak keyboard comes up as number one, I know the  search engine sucks.  That's a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you own have a tool, a canonical search?  I use just Google.  I don't bother with-  I mean, what do you type?  If you want to test cool, would you just type on Malik?  Yeah, or I'll use Gagom.  That's probably- yeah, because we all know what it's supposed to be, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I type in Kirk Harnack.  I got all my stuff.  On cool?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you want to do a good search.  Type in white shirt.  White?  Two words?  White shirt?  No, no.  White shirt.  Yeah, just type that.  One word or two?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One word, two words.  Okay, so I get just white shirts, web store, the white shirt, New York social diary, quick  and easy stain removal, keep your white shirts white and bright, Mrs. Stewart's bluing.  But look at the map to your right.  It's just off your screen, Leo.  Oh, I get a map of white shirts, Nebraska.  India is there.  Why?  Why is India there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have no idea.  I thought it was a trick.  You did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, so did you know that would be the result?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I just think you compare it with Google and you'll see the results in Google.  So you can always tell which results make more sense.  You compare Bing with it.  Just a random phrase.  I mean, you could type in Range Rover, for example, and you'll get, see if you get enough  details about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here it is.  The reason you get India is because you get the Maldive, a woman in a sarong, a man in  a long sleeved white shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Google results are more interesting.  You get tenfold fashion classics you need to own.  White shirt.  I got to do Bing because Bing should give me some shopping, right?  We have the B-store Bobby Deluxe white shirt review at selectism.com.  White shirts good.  You know what?  Oh, this is a really interesting result.  The great white shirt is on Oprah.com.  Fashion editor Stacey Wallace Albert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you're looking for what is a white shirt, you will never figure it out on any of these  search engines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, so if what you were doing is trying to understand a phrase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or like, if you want to buy one, you can't figure that one out.  You want some practical tips about what is a great white shirt, you can't find it on  any of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree.  I mean, I disagree.  With a Google one, you get a lot of good answers that I think would tell you exactly what a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  white shirt is.  All right, let's see Bing.  I get related searches, women's white shirts, just white shirts, men's white shirts, white  blouse, Clorox bleach.  These are ad results.  Clorox bleach, white blouses at the loft.  They must be making some money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Type white shirt in the Wolfram Alpha and it doesn't know what to do with your input.  Wolfram Alpha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It says 14 to the 17th power.  It doesn't know what the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You put in 10, you put a number in there, it would give you something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  10 white shirts.  I think Bing did a deal.  Pretty decent job.  Bing is actually getting the best results here.  Yeah, there you go.  Let's get back to the news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, that's news.  Well, from being got good results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Stop the presses.  Stop the presses.  That's huge.  Wolfram Alpha, as if I mean white Shirley.  White Shirley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And what does it say to white Shirley?  Uh, that's not that I'm interested in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's names.  The name white and the name Shirley.  I see.  Proper name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it'll tell you 32 percent of the population is named Shirley White.  Let's take a break.  We're going to come back, talk more about the news like there's some to talk about.  I'll give you I'll give you all five minutes to find a news story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, have this chat room chime in with chat room news stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to hear some.  Meanwhile, ladies and gentlemen, go to meeting from Citrix.  This is the software that we are using now at Twit to collaborate.  We use it on some of our shows for screenshots.  It's the better way to meet with clients, with colleagues to sell, to collaborate,  to train.  I love it and I want you to try it free.  For 30 days, Citrix is just a great company.  I mean, they know how to do this stuff.  And and they've they've created the simply the best online meeting.  You know, it's software.  You know, it's great is that when we first started talking about this a couple of years ago,  I think 2004, a lot of people were using a lot of other solutions.  Go ahead, John. Please be my guest.  John, just if we didn't have have commercials, we would have had to invent them just for John,  just so he could get up, wander.  He doesn't have any cooking going on.  He just wants to take off.  Go to meeting is is is kind of the best of the breed.  And as I as we've been doing these commercials over the last five years,  I see more and more and more people using Go to Meeting.  And now I very rarely see anything else.  Why? Because it's the best.  Replace that online conference or the that on the phone conference call with an online  meeting, just as good as meeting in person.  You start your meetings with one click.  Everyone sees your computer desktop on their computer screen.  So they see your PowerPoint.  When we when Kirk was showing us what he was going to do with the Axia system.  Now, Kirk, you could tell the truth.  Did you do that because you knew I loved Go to Meeting or do you use Go?  No, I use it. You use it anyway.  Absolutely. Pay for it every month.  It's well worth it. Yep.  You were able to show us the PowerPoint and everything you were going to do.  You had diagrams. We could collaborate.  We could say, what about this and circle it?  That's just amazing.  I want you to try it free 30 days free trial.  Go to GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  In fact, I think we taped and broadcasted that GoToMeeting that we did.  We have it somewhere else.  I'll see if I can bring it out, because actually it's kind of fun to combine that,  which was the planning stage with what you've done.  And since then, it's just really neat.  GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.  Nice people with a great product.  Oh, what's hot on your agenda these days?  What are you paying a lot of attention to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hmm. A lot of things.  I think my big focus is the disaggregation of the web.  You know, I've written a lot about it.  And I'm also trying to figure out, you know, what's the...  There's a lot. There's a big trend for startups to develop their products  for other people's platforms without taking into account  what happens when those platform owners start mucking around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it started with FriendFeed, but Twitter is the one that leaps to mind, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you have Facebook and Twitter, right?  So last week, a couple of companies shut down.  You know, it's just like one was a little startup called Lookery,  and they kind of blamed Facebook for their troubles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Now, Lookery was going to...  Was it an online ad play, right?  And they had a little...  In fact, I have Lookery code in my page, so I guess I'll take it out now.  It was a little JavaScript. It's kind of like Google Analytics.  And then they would help sell it. I never got any ads from them.  How could they blame Facebook for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because they were initially for the Facebook platform.  And then Facebook changed how the apps would interact with their newsfeed.  And it got shifted from page one to page two.  And it's actually thrown the whole Facebook ecosystem for...  or app ecosystem for a loop.  And that's, I think, a big elephant in the room people don't want to talk about in the valley.  The same thing is going to happen, you know,  all the troubles we are having with the iPhone platform  or the problems we are going to eventually end up having with the Twitter platform.  Who the hell knows what's going to happen?  But a lot of the excitement in Silicon Valley is around these platforms,  which are owned by corporations, right?  It doesn't matter whether they're big or small.  So I'm a little concerned about that.  So that is definitely occupying a lot of my time right now,  thinking about that and covering that.  And the other thing is I'm tracking, you know,  what FCC is really doing about the broadband stimulus  and how we get more and more broadband to more and more Americans.  And actually, higher and higher speeds.  And I think this is like one of my pet projects right now.  So all of us are old enough to kind of have experienced the low bandwidth days.  And I'm sure you remember when we went from 1200 bauds to 9600 bauds.  And then from 9600 bauds, we went to 56,000 bauds in dial-up.  And then we went to DSL.  I think we are experiencing a similar 5X jump in bandwidth, which is coming our way.  We are going to like, you know, more and more people can access above 25 megabits per second to their house.  They have to pay a lot of money, but you can access that.  And, you know, soon, maybe in 12 to 18 months, they're going to see the bandwidth prices come down  and more, you know, higher speeds become more affordable.  And when that happens, I think the web becomes even more interesting.  So my theory is that every time we have a 5X gain in bandwidth, we have a lot of interesting things happen.  So let me explain.  So when we went from dial-up to DSL slash early cable modem, we got ourselves Napster.  And then we went from, remember, 384.  And then we went to like 1.5 to 3 megabits.  We got Skype.  We got YouTube.  We got WordPress.  We got Facebook.  We got a lot of interesting things.  So we got got Twitt TV.  We got Twitt TV.  And and now you have, you know, your twit is as big as tech TV.  I mean, it's absolutely right.  So it's actually better, bigger than them.  So and with with more bandwidth, more and more interesting things will happen.  But what are you predicting?  My prediction is that we next next 12 to 18 months, a whole new different class of applications are going to emerge.  Specifically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I'm not Google Wave is that now that doesn't need that kind of bandwidth.  It's got to be what's going to be rich.  It's going to be rich bandwidth.  What?  I mean, what would you need?  A high def.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, you could say you could make this kind of analogy with hard disks because they got  bigger all kinds of different new things that they were using.  But at some point, the hard disks now are going to terabyte after terabyte and nothing  news coming out.  Is it possible that all these apps that, you know, that the cutoff point was one point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you could make a point that cutoff point was one point five megabits that enabled  all you need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think it's a 64 kilobytes is all anyone needs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you talking?  Did you work for AT&T?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, let's see.  So all right.  So let's say what is what do you think the default will be now?  Are we going into the five megabit range, the 10 megabit range?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think it is by 2011, 2012, you will expect at least 25 to 40 megabits.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK.  So what does the world look like when you have 25 megabits?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I've started to think about.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what I would think about is not an asymmetric 25 megabits, but what if we get  upload bandwidths higher?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  That is a big, big issue.  I think more and more people have started to talk about the upstream bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's where people are gated right now.  You know, with 128 kilobits, you can't do anything.  They got five going up.  So what if people have five, then all of a sudden anybody can do what I'm doing.  Anybody can be a broadcaster.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anybody can be a broadcaster now.  They just have to pay more for the bandwidth and they get five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, if that becomes ubiquitous.  Look, I think I think you're right.  But I'm just to speculate here on this.  I think I've always thought that we are about to see a huge creative eruption.  I'm waiting for it.  A renaissance.  Well, I'm waiting for it, but I think you're starting to see it on YouTube.  100,000 videos a day on YouTube.  Junk.  That's a very subjective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's not.  It's not subjective at all.  It's objective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're objectively junk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'd say 99 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You think Fred Flingelhofer is junk, but a 14-year-old doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they're amused at the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're amused at the tune of 30 million downloads.  Good is it doing them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The point is that most of the stuff is crap.  All right.  I mean, besides your show, even with podcasting, most of it's garbage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Most of it's garbage.  That brings up the 80-20 rule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The 80-20 rule.  It makes even more garbage.  So we're just inundated.  We're going to be inundated with crap.  I mean, and to encourage this, I think we should go back to the modem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you're going to see a creative upwelling.  And you're right.  A creative upwelling.  It's really crap, but 10 percent of a lot is more than 10 percent of a little.  And I think you're going to see a lot more great stuff.  And you're going to get those people.  You're the optimist in the room.  I always have been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Leo, here's an analogy for you.  Back in the day when people had big hi-fi systems and appreciated fine quality music.  Which they don't anymore.  We've all agreed.  Now we move to the iPod where my daughter has her cell phone in the backseat of the  car.  She's playing the latest Fergie song.  She has no idea.  She thinks it sounds great.  And I said, that sounds terrible, Madeline.  Where'd you get that?  I got my cell phone up to my friend's cell phone and recorded it.  Madeline, that sounds terrible.  But wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, the kids have always done that.  The transistor radio when you and I were little was pretty crappy.  You're right.  I helped my kids set player up to the radio and the phonograph.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But the expectation for audio quality is much lower now than it used to be among the majority  of people.  I agree.  Well, so what's the expectation of quality of content as it becomes easier to produce  for the majority of people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe the crap that we think is crap today will be seen as good.  That's good.  High-end.  And that's scary.  Maybe the Taj Mahal of the future is being built out of popsicle sticks right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In 10 years.  I remember back when Twit was on the air and it was a good show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I get that already.  We jump the shark every week.  Every week.  I've never seen a show jump the shark more often.  So Om, what are you thinking increased bandwidth might lead to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think interesting applications.  I think the gaming shifts into the browser because of that.  I think the more upstream bandwidth means we will be able to do more and more interesting  things.  Like what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Virtual reality, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  For starters, being able to access your information, your information which is stored on your devices  over the net rather than your information stored in somebody else's browser.  It's cloud computing you're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My information is stored on my own machine, my own 10 terabyte drive.  What's wrong with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, but in order to access that you still do need a big network, right?  John, you can't really get it over a puny 128 kilobit upstream line.  So you get more bandwidth that way.  I think there is a whole new class of applications which are going to come.  And I mean if I could actually predict which is the right application, you know, wouldn't  I be building it right now?  Yeah, you would be.  Exactly.  So, but it is, we are in that big shift period.  Like think about it, you know, go back.  Like every few years we have a 5X jump in the bandwidth and when that happens a lot  of interesting things start to happen from the application standpoint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ken Sheppardson says 3D LOL cats.  That's the next big.  That would be awesome.  That would be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Om, do you think your prediction in bandwidth increase is applicable to third world countries?  I deal a lot with people in Africa and some in the hinterlands of India and all over the  place where they still have dial-up sort of speeds even on their quote high bandwidth  connections.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And thank goodness because I've had enough Nigerian email scams to last a lifetime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you know, I think more of the more people, whether it's in India or in Africa,  they are going on the net using wireless devices.  And so even in the wireless, if you come to think of it, we are seeing a big jump in bandwidth  on the wireless end of things.  So in India, for instance, you know, all at least three of the five major telcos are rolling  out WiMAX networks in rural India.  So that is also going to cause some kind of, you know, behavior change.  It will also going to cause people to use their handheld devices.  I don't call them phones because they will also be looking for some lower cost, you know,  iPhone type devices to get to access the Internet.  And I think there is a lot of interesting things which can happen because as the bandwidth  goes up, people's behavior changes and through that behavior change, you get interesting  applications.  You know, Google is a result of a behavior change.  Google changed is why we use Google is because it's easy to use Google because we are always  on the web and we don't have to kind of we can we don't find anything.  We'll search for it again using some different kind of a phrase.  And I think that's that's one kind of a behavior change which happened with the increase in  bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I don't think Google was a result of any bandwidth increase.  It's popular.  It's a better product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which you can use more and more more often because you're more and more connected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's why it's become so you're referring not just to higher speeds but also more places  to be connected.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But the ubiquity is as important if not more important than you know, you can you can have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know, high speed networks in your house.  That really doesn't mean more people connected to the net at higher speeds.  So even on the wireless, if you look at it, we are going from about 300 kilobits right  now on like a low end 3G connection to like a 4G LTE connection, which will give you between  you know, three to five megabits to your handset.  That's a big jump.  And even even in the third world countries where they are just rolling out wireless networks,  you're seeing the big jump happen.  I mean, the application wise, I think, you know, I'm sure once people have that kind  of bandwidth within six to eight months, they'll start to figure out how to build, you know,  things to consume that bandwidth.  It's pretty much like the processor and the operating system.  More powerful the processor Intel made, Microsoft figured out a way to use it up, right?  And then and then Intel did another one.  And you know, so you had the next generation of windows come out.  And that's how the bandwidth is the new processor, in my opinion, and applications just, you  know, come as a result of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The network is the computer.  You know, on on on GigaOM.com about three fourths of the way down the page, roll out  to Wi-Fi fleet wide in first quarter of 2010 on Southwest Airlines.  Yeah, that's interesting.  And up to 30 megabits to each plane.  What?  That's amazing.  By satellite, I'm trying to figure that one out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you still but you still don't get a reserved seat.  I'm still not flying them.  So you don't fly in Southwest?  That means you get to choose your seat.  I try not to fly Southwest.  That's where Virgin America is just going to eat Southwest alive because you get a you  get you still get the online bandwidth, but you also get a reserved seat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Leo, that's interesting because I fly Southwest because I get to pick my own seat.  You prefer that?  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you're smart enough to be in the group zero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's because you go online and you get your boarding pass.  You get group zero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And all the people with screaming babies get to sit in the back because they're too stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That advantage is not going to last you very long.  I'm sorry to say, but I'm too forgetful to get online.  So I'm back with the seats with the crazy screaming babies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, now Southwest does need to add to their website.  Where's the service?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where's the service?  Where's the website?  You can go on and say, I'm going to be on this flight.  Get me my boarding pass.  Oh, that's a good service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But Southwest doesn't charge you to change your flights.  Leo, my trip here, I've changed flights three times.  That's because you have to pay the top dollar.  The cheapest ticket.  No, come on.  If the fare goes up, you pay the fare difference.  But there's no hundred dollar charge as a service charge to change your flight.  That's nice because United charges.  And if you fly an international, you pay a two hundred dollar service charge a lot of  times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So let's talk about, since people keep saying in the chat room that I'm being mean to Ohm.  You're not being mean to Ohm.  That's what I said.  This guy in the chat room said I was being mean and rude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ohm, has John been mean to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  So let's talk about the Kundra thing you wrote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That Kundra.  Oh, hold on.  Hold your water on that.  And I do want to get back to what you were talking about with people building on unstable  platforms because I think that's kind of you.  You raised a really interesting question there that's become very timely.  But before we do that, I do want to mention our friends at Squarespace.  Go ahead, John.  Just walk right in front of the camera.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just to have the camera up a little bit so I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can squat under.  No, actually, I tell everybody just just go right ahead.  This isn't really it.  Nobody's watching anyway.  It's an audio podcast.  I love it.  All the seats are now empty in the studio.  It's just it's just you and me.  You can get up.  Oh, there you go.  You can go somewhere if you want.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nobody's here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I switched to a different seat.  My batteries were running down.  There you go.  There you go.  I'm MacBook Pro.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Poor guy.  We've we've we've worn him out.  Let me I just want to talk briefly about Squarespace and then we will get to this.  You know, it turns out for us, sometimes the shows that are the most interesting ones with  the least news and we could talk about issues.  But I do want to mention Squarespace for those of you looking to set up a website.  Who do you what do you use for your provider?  Here's this is this is a good I use WordPress dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For that whole big talk about building on a platform that may go away at any time.  You don't serve you don't host your own stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but you know, it's it's an open platform so I can get my information off whenever I  want. That's true.  It takes a minute.  I literally it's just a minute process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So. So the whole giga-ohm network is built on a free system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We pay for it like it's a paid service.  They have business. They have business.  Yeah. And there's a business class service and they call it VIP hosting.  We use that. And I use Maso for some of our non critical stuff.  We use Maso for now.  So those are two services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to work on you.  I'm going to move you over.  I'm going to get you moved over to Squarespace.  See, have you looked at it ever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have. I know the guy that I actually, you know, wrote about him back in the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anthony and then Anthony and Dana are great people, great young guys who had a better  idea. They're kind of like Matt Mullenweg.  I look I love Matt, too.  But Squarespace is about not and not just a blog, but about creating a website based  on a Java machine, a virtual engine so that as bandwidth requirements go up, they just  flip a switch. More servers come online.  It's all distributed across all the servers.  So they're very responsive.  Design is unbelievable.  I mean, they've got great templates to start with, but then you just drag and drop lots  of Ajax. You can create your own design about as easily.  You don't have to be designer.  You don't have to be a programmer.  Boom. And yet, if you are a programmer, full access to CSS templates, you could embed  JavaScript. You really have very a complete flexible situation.  And I love the idea that you can import and export right away from WordPress, from  TypePad, from Blogger.  They just export right back out.  So just, you know, you as you say, you're never trapped inside.  I want if you're looking to start up a system, whether it's a multi blog system like  Ohm's doing or a single page for yourself, a photo blog, I mean, a forum, I want you  to try a free Squarespace dot com slash twit.  These are smart guys who create I think created the next generation platform for  websites, Google Maps integration, social networking and immigration and the stuff  that they're rolling out, you know, every day something new really keeps it up to  date. Go to Squarespace dot com slash twit.  Try it free, no credit card needed.  And if you use the coupon code twit, you'll get 10 percent off when you sign up.  Squarespace is the future of the web.  So, Ohm, I like this when you're talking about building a platform, you know what?  What's this, John?  John found a Zephyr and he's taking it home.  I think that's over Kirkstead body.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's the that's the new IP version of your ISDN codec that works over IP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, what's cool about that, John, is that as you may or may not know, it's  getting harder and harder to get an ISDN line.  Phone companies don't want to do ISDN lines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I know the other day, Leo, you looked at my Squarespace beginning website.  Are you doing Squarespace?  Where I misspelled podcast, you point out it says podcast.  Podcast. That's right.  You're using Squarespace for your podcast.  I just now fix it. Well, I don't have a podcast yet.  It's coming from Kentucky, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pocahontas. That's what I said.  It should be that's Nashville.  That's Nashville.  Tennessee. You got a po boy.  Yeah, it's pocahontas.  We got pocahontas here.  What is a good Kentucky burger and pocahontas?  No, I think pocahontas is good.  Do you like Squarespace? You've been happy with that?  Absolutely. It's really neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Just playing with it. There's so much to learn.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So not to interrupt the news thing, but talking about this ISDN box.  Yeah.  Are they going to since you can't get ISDN anymore, it's getting more difficult.  IP, public network.  Are the radio stations going to be hooked up properly  so you can use just straight IP into them?  Well, for remote broadcasting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's two different kinds of IP codecs out in the broadcast market now.  There's there's kind of dumb ones that require router setup.  And and you got to underutilize the bandwidth.  Or over specify the bandwidth.  And then there's this one.  And Tellus makes the dumb ones.  And a lot of other companies do, too.  This is a smart one, a smart IP that it works kind of like Skype.  It gives you a buddy list.  And so we have a rendezvous server that keeps track of where  where the studios are that you're supposed to connect to.  And so you just highlight the name of the studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to have a Tellus in it.  They got to have the same one. Yeah.  No, it's still studios.  How many give me a number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think we've sold probably 400 of them so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know where they're starting to use in recording studios  because, you know, you want to do a multi-track recording  and the musicians are all over the place.  Yeah. And they're not going to have ISDN lines, let's face it.  So they used to, but they used to not anymore.  So more and more you're seeing studio recording studios use this kind of thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  as they do virtual recording. Yeah.  The musicians are in different states and putting headphones on and they jam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's remarked.  But there's even a web based way to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Latency. That can be a problem.  One way to solve that is to just  get with the other guys over the web, but make a local recording  and then FTP or send in the local high quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But if you we've actually played with a lot of different ways of doing this.  Steve Gibson was writing a ring recorder that would send.  So you drop packets.  What you're listening to, you drop packets, but the ring recorder  waits until and reassembles it once that packet comes in  and and has some redundancy so that even if you drop a packet,  you eventually get a perfect recording.  It may not be in real time, but you can have a real time  kind of imperfect audition channel.  I don't know if you guys don't do that, though, Kirk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, that's pretty cool.  What Steve's doing, we ought to talk to him. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a neat idea. Yeah.  So let's talk about building on platforms.  You know, one of the things that we were talking  we talked about this on a couple of times on this week in Google is the idea.  It seems to be in the last couple of weeks.  And it seems to be with.  The realization that a lot of these platforms, not just for applications,  but even for individuals that we're building on  are shaky with a friend field  feed sale to Facebook, Twitter's, you know, multiple fail whales.  Facebook, who knows what they're doing.  People are starting to say, maybe I should be doing my blog again.  There's this kind of return to sanity almost.  I blog less.  I know a lot of people blog less because we were micro blogging.  But we started to realize we're pumping all this equity  into somebody out there that doesn't we have no share in.  Do you think that's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree with you on that.  I think people should listen to Dave Weiner more often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have to be very. Dave's the leader on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, he was he was saying this a long time ago.  So and, you know, I think  blog is the epicenter of of of the digital existence,  at least for people who like to publish on the web.  You know, so there's a lot of people who just want to,  you know, be be friends with other people and publish amongst their friends.  Sort of like for them, Facebook might be interesting.  But for people who are like me or like John or like you,  I think blog should and always will be the most crucial place for us,  because that's where we can we can bring everything together.  But I think the bigger challenge here is that the blogs need to evolve  from what they were.  They started off as content management systems with some level of  discussion attached to them.  But now they need to go more than that.  And I think they and what what what I mean by that  is they need to kind of embrace the fact that we publish more in different ways.  We publish photos, we publish videos, we publish tweets,  and we publish them from our cell phones and we publish them  not from a computer.  And we are always interacting with our blog or what we publish  in a in a very different sort of a way.  It's more of a live stream than just a blog.  And I think people, the people who make tools for these platforms,  whether it's WordPress or six apart, they need to kind of just take a step back  and say, OK, how do we evolve this technology?  And I think that's the crucial part,  you know, creating more of a conversation platform  than just just a random publishing platform.  So, you know, the point is like you can publish as many photos as you want.  But if nobody sees it, like, who cares?  Right. Like even if your friends don't see the photographs you've taken,  like you're really, you know, whistling in the wind, so to speak.  And so that's that's where the blogging platforms need to evolve to.  And I think hopefully, you know, last couple of weeks, all the stuff  which has happened around Facebook and friend feed and Twitter, et cetera,  people will start to pay more attention.  I think that's the key part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's interesting. You should mention six apart because we had a Neil  Neil Dash on when we were talking about this on Twig.  And that's exactly what Anil said.  I have a feeling companies like six apart are going to are.  It's a it's a kind of a thorny problem, but I think they are going to address this.  I think it's a mixture of the blog and some sort of social media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think John might have some ideas about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I'm not, you know, I have he hates everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't hate every every thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think there's a couple of things going on with blogs.  One is as they never crap. That's the problem.  They never started off as content managers per se, but they were.  And they ended up being.  Yeah. And the thing that I think is missing is is the variety.  I think this is what the problem is, is that there's still a blog model  with a last in first out kind of, you know, last thing you post is at the top.  So everything's backwards.  You want some sort of random.  So if you did a five part series, you have to read part five.  Yeah, that's backwards. Ridiculous.  No, I think there should be something called a new blog.  And you're starting to see them now, which are these these these templates,  which turn the blog into what looks like a magazine or a publication.  And so you could have fixed areas that don't really change.  And you can have a rotation of photos.  I mean, there's no reason that the New York Times can't be a blog template.  And in fact, Facebook is a matter of fact, not Facebook, I'm sorry.  But the deal book in the back of the New York Times is, in fact, a WordPress blog.  And it's been jiggered around to look like like just a section of columns.  So I think the potential for blogs to go into the next year,  to move ahead into the next generation,  where they become more than just a simple run,  you know, one thing that runs down to China with your posts  and the most recent post going last.  I think the model is tired.  And I think what about this notion that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  both Anil and Om we're talking about with  the fact that the blog is kind of an island in the middle of nowhere.  If you don't get this kind of not merely people going to your blog,  but this kind of you need you need  some sort of like social media, like flow and interaction around it.  The comments are so static.  Is there some way to make this be more and see why there's more social?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd like to see some different models that would maybe incorporate  social social mechanism that was a little more active.  I mean, I like the idea that some of the blogs you can  there's a lot of plugins now that, you know, some people use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I use a thing called Echo on my blog.  It says it's a new commenting engine. It's really amazing.  And there's really. Yeah.  It's like discuss because it pulls in  I don't know how from Twitter, from friend feed from everywhere else.  Become part of your comment stream so you're not losing your.  You know, you still have a locus.  But you're including everything.  It's a first step in that direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lot of blogs that have the Twitter feed on their front page  and other kinds of things which make it look a little more interesting.  I don't know.  I what I'm just getting tired of is the is the is the last in first out  process where you have the.  That's a good point.  Thing at the top and it just scrolls down to infinity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then, you know, so that comes from this kind of misapprehension  that you're really a link blog.  You're you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it came from the diary thing.  Yeah, there's a diarist.  Yeah, it's a journal. Yeah, journal.  And I don't think there's that many.  I mean, pop, there's a lot of people like to do write a journal, which is fine.  I don't have a problem with it.  I think most of them are uninteresting.  But something like Deuce, Heather, Heather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a lot of great job with it with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, there's there's a dozens of really good journals  style blogs that are kind of interesting to read.  But why does every blog have to be like that?  I mean.  And the versatility when it comes to when you do get a template that  and there's a couple of guys that do these real wild templates,  that revolution is what I use and it has revolution is that you have to that  revolution takes some work.  It takes some work to figure out.  You got to watch all the videos.  It's really it's a difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you're a life blog last year and first out.  Yeah. Do you want to change to work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm changing. Yeah, but I'm changing it slightly.  But I'm still going to be life on one side.  There's going to be more stagnant stuff around it.  But yeah, I know I'd like to change it.  But, you know, it's a blog.  I'm not.  That was what it looks like.  I mean, at some point you want to say, well, maybe I don't want it  to look like a blog anymore because our credibility issues.  Blogs have don't have the same credibility as stagnant pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know, John.  I think that that ship has sailed a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lots of people like you and me and Leo.  But in fact, the general public, when they if they I always say this,  if you say you took the New York Times and you took a blog  and you have the blog that's scrolling, you take the exact same article  and you put on the front page of the New York Times, it's kind of a stagnant spot.  And then you have it on the blog.  And you can you take somebody in some blind test,  you take a big population of people and see which of those two  has the most credibility.  If you had a credibility, it's not just credibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's readability.  Go to here's an exercise.  Go to omg.yahoo.com.  This we talked about this a couple of weeks ago.  I had never heard of it.  It's bigger than TMZ.  This is Yahoo's celebrity.  And it is a blog, but it's not it's us magazine.  I mean, they really have figured out a way.  It's time based.  But this doesn't look like a blog.  You see this.  You see a bunch of stories and it's kind of a, you know,  Hollywood Square's kind of layout.  Yes. Paris Hilton say that's hot.  It's I think this is a good design.  Look at the advertisements in a mixed with the tiles.  They've got a poll in there.  This kind of gives you an idea of and it still has,  you notice one of the squares is the latest and it's chronological,  reverse chronological.  By the way, this is huge.  They get I can't remember.  It was 40 million uniques a month.  I mean, I never even heard of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I never heard of it till now.  I know.  But we're not mavens of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, this and that's what I'm but what I'm saying is this is real people.  Real people use this, not people like you, me and Omen Kirk.  We are, you know, comfortable with the web memes.  You know, this is more this is more like real people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To be honest about this is actually quite crappy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just was wondering how long it would take.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I expected nothing less from you, John.  Nothing less. You're not going to argue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I know that. But if you want Angelina Jolie news, it's I found it in two seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It achieves what it's it's intended to achieve.  Oh, there's my Miley Cyrus news.  See, see what I'm saying?  Look who's on the front page.  OK, Lindsay Lohan.  I don't know who that is at Mary J.  Blige. I don't know who that is.  Say Freed. See, my problem is I'm not hip with this stuff.  Is that Vanessa Williams?  I don't even know who that is.  Milla Jovovich, some sort of baby makes shopping spree story.  Real Housewife.  See, my problem is and he's probably yours, too, John.  We have no idea who these people are and we don't care.  And nor do we care.  And I think that's something we're proud of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Promoted for people that really have nothing better to do with their time  than follow somebody else's life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is bigger.  This is bigger than almost any other website you and I have visited in the last two years.  This is huge.  Don't you want to read about Dina Lohan on Lindsay's home burglary?  Yes. Yes, I know you do.  All right. Get the bourbon out.  I need to write it. It's time for a drink after that one.  So when you were talking to him about platforms and building on a weak platform,  building on Twitter, building on Facebook, I was thinking this is where Microsoft really succeeded.  They made a platform that a developer could rely on that was consistent, even cross versions.  And really, we wouldn't be about windows.  Yeah, we wouldn't be where we are today if we didn't have that kind of rock solid platform to our developers.  Where's the windows of the Internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ohm, tell him.  Do you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  John, you should tell him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that what we need, Ohm?  I mean, is that the response to...  It's going to be Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe it is.  Do you think?  No, I don't know. I doubt it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's Google, man. Come on.  Look at their track record.  I mean, they've not done anything great.  You know, they do a lot of things.  They don't do anything great.  You know, Gmail also has taken a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not going to argue with you.  I'm glad you're on my side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google is the emperor's new clothes.  Google is this company everybody loves.  Since their IPO...  Because they do no evil.  They do no evil.  Since their IPO, 480% increase in value in five years.  It was five years ago on Friday.  I'm surprised this is...  That should have been more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If it wasn't for the economic collapse, it would be at 750.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, and yet it is kind of the emperor's new clothes because you look at everything, all of Google's initiatives, they're all kind of half baked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And a lot of them, they just dropped the ball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Dodgeball, literally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dropped.  Dropped the ball.  And they had that catalog thing for a while and they just let that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's talk about Google Books because that was a big story this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm giving them a blank stare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a bunch of stuff that's happened with Google Books.  But which one are you talking about?  The fact that nobody's buying into their lawsuit, what their settlement is?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And including, I might add, Microsoft and Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you get the letters from them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, they were sending out letters?  You didn't get the letters?  I don't have any books.  Do I have books on Google Books?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You had a bunch of books. Yeah.  I probably do.  Those Wiley books that you did?  Yeah, 13 books on Q.  Those 13 books where they gave you like 500 bucks a book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A book. It was a great deal.  I put my picture on the cover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And no royalties?  Yeah, no, it was a great deal.  Yeah, that book.  Yeah, those books.  The ones that you do...  Those are all on the shelf there, right?  You paid no attention to my advice on this deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that one.  Yeah, that.  So they're probably on Google Books.  I didn't even think about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should have gotten letters for each one of those books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Microsoft and Yahoo joining a group of opponents to a class action settlement  that gives Google the right to digitize millions of books,  including books that are not in the public domain.  Right.  The companies are becoming part of the Open Book Alliance.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, right. Open Book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We figured out a way to close books with the Open Book Alliance,  made up of nonprofits and libraries that have raised a red flag  against Google's plan to digitize books and put them on the Internet.  Very old trick to give it names like that.  Yeah, that's what they learned from the Beltway.  Silicon Valley.  Yeah.  Oh, yes, we're the Open Books Alliance.  Now, get your hands off my book.  A spokesperson for Microsoft said,  yes, we've agreed to participate in the Open Book Alliance.  Yahoo has also signed on.  Amazon has also joined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, Balik is against it.  ACLU, Electronic Frontier Foundation.  Samuelson Law, Technology and Public Policy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It would allow Google and only, and this is the key,  only Google to digitize so-called orphan works.  Yeah.  These are works. Orphan works are still in copyright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is so bogus.  They would know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How do they determine it's orphaned?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because they can't find the owner of the copyright.  It's not clear who owns the rights. Who's they?  They. The great they.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is there some librarian somewhere who says, OK, Google,  it's I can't find the rights.  You go ahead and digitize.  It's all yours, Google.  Google's took issue with the criticism.  The Google says,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  oh, the agreement.  I think I'm thinking Google.  Google is the Eddie Haskell.  Oh, no, that was Apple.  That was Apple. You just do that.  Oh, is that the neckbeard voice?  The agreement is not exclusive.  If unproved by the court, it will.  Clinton.  No, the agreement is not exclusive.  If improved by the court, it'll expand.  I did not do that woman.  It will expand access to millions of books in the United States.  The Book Rights Registry.  The agreement stands to inject more competition into the digital book space.  I like that word.  So it's understandable why our competitors would fight hard to prevent more competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do no evil. I love the way they do.  They twist it. This is all twisted.  You can't you need a you need a genius.  You need a Bloomsday book to understand half of what these guys are saying.  And why you Professor James Grimmelman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I am not making this up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  His real name. I'm not making this up.  He runs the public index dot org.  Says Google is right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are access benefits to making books available.  The question of whether this is good or bad for competition is hotly contested.  There are clear ways that the settlement could create a concentration of power,  especially over orphan books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's only the orphan book thing that makes a difference.  Right. If Google's just saying, hey, anybody can digitize these.  We think we'd like to.  But if Microsoft wanted to, of course, Microsoft dropped its book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know they released all the books at the public domain.  It's good for them. That's what Google will not do. Right. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The proposed settlement was reached.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If Google digitizes a public domain book, they stamp their their little water.  It's now a Google book. It's a Google book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's bold. By the way, it's not public domain.  And that's the point. It's orphaned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but there are public domain books that go back to the 19 that now become Google books.  Yeah. And nobody else can do it.  You can't. The way it's the way they have the license deal is that if you have a copy  of the book and you want to scan it in yourself, yeah, you can go out and reprint it if you wanted to.  But if Google reprinted some book from the University of South Dakota, they now have the copyright.  And they they own the copyright to the digital version of their digital version.  Yeah. Their digital version, not one you might do. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they're the only ones who are going to spend any money doing this.  If they do it, it's done. You could do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, you could take a book.  It takes you about a few weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Part of the agreement, they're paying one hundred twenty five million dollars to create  a book rights registry where authors and publishers can register their work.  So you and I would run over to the books rights registry and say, we own these books.  Right. And receive compensation from institutional subscriptions or book sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that'll be big bucks. Yeah, I get five, six bucks per book.  Who knows? Well, you know, maybe you didn't.  You know, you might not.  One of the things I always do when I and I always tell people to do so, they do a book deal,  is you got to get the rights back to the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know you told me I should do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did not do that. They always sign off on it because they don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They know it's worthless after five years.  You know, they don't care. Five months or whatever.  You can't even get a fine month in the bargain bin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you get your your your rights back after.  And it's a performance clause.  Usually once the book doesn't sell enough copies per quarter  or per half year, you have they have to give you the book back in 90 days or 60 days.  And so then you have the rights.  And so then now you own the book again.  You own your own writing.  And that's what everyone should do. That's the way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And then what would happen with Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's why I got all those letters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google would notify you because you have the rights.  Yeah. Otherwise, Q. See, that's what happened.  Q got the letters. Yeah.  Well, along with a thousand other letters.  And they put them in a box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They sent me one letter for each book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Geez Louise. So I had to.  And what do they offer you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't figure it out.  They just want you to sign up.  And, you know, so so there's money they'll give you some.  I can't I'm looking this over going, I don't know what this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow. Home, do you have a dog in this hunt, as Kirk would say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do. I accept.  I don't know how much control I have on that dog.  I wrote a book called Broad Bandits and and Wiley published it.  Oh, Wiley.  They they gave me some advance and that was the last I heard of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you know I did you sign the dummy contract?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I actually did.  I must have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't sign the dummy contract.  I mean, the only reason they make a dummy contract is because dummies sign them.  The I remember.  Where's my rim shot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I should have known as soon as you gave them the leading line, I should have had it ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So no, the dummy contract.  Yeah. While he's dummy contract and they keep the book forever.  You basically sold the book to them.  I actually knew I didn't.  You could have done that throughout the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't I didn't I didn't sign the dummy contract then.  Oh, you were smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's a lot of things and there's a bunch of liability clauses  that got to go on these book that you got to get rid of.  There's about 50 items that have to be pulled out of a typical book contract.  They always do it if you if you have the if you just say, hey, I don't want this.  Oh, OK. As opposed to just sign.  Yeah, they're very they negotiate.  That's what the contract is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what I always hear about negotiations.  You negotiate with somebody who makes a living negotiating.  And I make a living being a genial fellow on the radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're a genial fellow.  And so you sign it. You would say, OK, sure, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's kind of a dummy.  I was on the dummy. Oh, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No more. No more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're too big now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nobody's asked me to sign a contract in years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't need one. You're making more money than them put together.  You're making more money than Wiley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Probably am. But that's not saying much.  I probably am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's one publisher I wouldn't recommend.  Let me just say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They actually none of them.  They're all the same. Pretty much a bad business these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think once you just publish a book and just get it on Kindle.  I mean, if you're writing a textbook,  you probably reach all the right people with a Kindle. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Unless they. I think you're probably right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean, that's the way I would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You only get 30 percent of the of the of the money.  The Kindle guys get the other 70, which is still actually not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, which is better than 15 percent or 10.  Or maybe nothing.  Or in 500 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are you? I think it says that in the dummy contract or maybe nothing.  It's in there. It's a clause 14.2.  Let's check into audible.com here real quickly,  see if there's any great audio books to purchase.  Kirk, with all the travel you do, I think you must have an audible.com account.  I do. I do. Do you listen to audio books? You do.  Audible is the is the place to go for audio books.  Sixty thousand titles now.  What kind of stuff you listen to?  You like to listen to the thrillers or the serious stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I've I've listened to Snow Crash and the what was what was the  the book about the divers?  Shadow Divers, that one.  That one. That's that.  I listened to that when I was on this tour of Brazil.  We were in the bus bouncing down the dusty road, me and my wife.  And I thought it's four hours to get to the whatever we're going to.  So I'm going to listen to that.  But lately, I've been into a lot of Anne Rand stuff.  So I'm listening to capitalism.  The unknown idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would think you'd be an Anne Rand fan, John C. DeVore.  I don't want to even talk about Anne Rand.  So let's not even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't you're not a fan of objectivism, John.  You don't believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When I was in college, I had a roommate for a while who was an objectivism nut.  And he that was the end of it.  They're nice, thick books.  That's the best part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm just a capitalism nut, not an objectivism nut.  I like the thickness, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I buy them for the number of a lot of CEO types are big and random.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Of course they are, because it's all about I'm Dagny Taggart and I run the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Shadow Divers is a good one for if you've never read an audio book.  This is kind of like the greatest audio book for your first one,  because it's just it's gripping.  It's the true story of two guys who are these, you know, they're dry suit divers.  They're deep sea divers, not scuba, deep sea divers.  You're a diver, right?  No, you're a pilot.  I'm the air guy.  That's right. You go up, not down.  I go down.  Whoa. Hit the drums.  Where's my rim shot?  Shadow Divers, two Americans who risked everything to solve  one of the last mysteries of World War Two.  They find a U-boat that is not recorded, a sunken U-boat that is not recorded anywhere.  No one knew that it sank.  It's very, very deep.  So they're I mean, they're using these weird nitrogen mixes in their tanks.  I mean, they're doing weird stuff.  And it's a story of them finding the wreck,  figuring out whose wreck it is and ultimately going to meet the families  of the German soldiers, the German naval  the seamen who went down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, let me play a little bit of this story for you.  The book is rooted in hundreds of hours of interviews with Chatterton and Kohler,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  plus countless more hours.  I hate it when they do this and it makes me mad.  They put the forward on there.  And other witnesses to the events.  You know, I don't want to hear the forward.  But this is Michael Pritchard reading and he does a great job with it.  I'll tell you what, you get this.  Not the comedian.  It always confused me because Michael Pritchard, without a T,  does a lot of audiobooks, but it's not the same as Michael Pritchard,  who also does audiobooks, but he works with kids and so he's great.  You remember Michael, he was a great guy.  He's a great guy. Yeah. Yeah.  I like him.  Probably a friend of Marty Higgins, that he could write some material for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You probably could.  There's a bunch of guys in the bear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He does a lot of speaking and Bob Sarlat does a lot of the speaking.  You know what they do when they do the corporate stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could probably do Sarlat's material.  I could easily because I have that same kind.  And get the same labs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, right. Get as far as he got with it.  No, they do a lot of corporates.  And in fact, Sarlat told me the key with corporates is you throw in three jokes  that include the CEO and, you know, you know,  you throw in the jokes from the company and they all they love that so much.  I don't know how I got it on that track.  Shadow divers, two Americans who risked everything.  So here's how you get it for free.  You go to audible dot com slash twit.  Actually, let's do I'm going to get you two books for free.  Audible dot com slash twit to the number two.  If you go there right now, you can sign up for the platinum account.  And the platinum is two books a month.  And that's what I do, because I think one book is not enough.  Two books a month. And the first two are free. How about that?  Certainly, if you've never listened, audio books make the first one shadow divers.  But we have if you just go to audible dot com, you'll see a lot of other  wonderful choices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's an ran. Get in the end.  By the way, that that shadow divers, that's a six hour book.  That's how long it takes to go to shit.  So Neetsa and back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what's what's in shit.  And it's no, that's where the ruins are.  They ask that the shit's in its ruins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. I don't think he's saying it right.  Maybe I'm not.  Chit's needs a I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll look at it. Put down chicken eats chicken eats is how it's spelled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where would you go then if you were reading Atlas shrugged?  Because Atlas shrugged, my friends, is 63 hours.  You could go to Mars.  It's 56.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It was about 50.  You had the unabridged version.  There's an abridged version, which is what I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no. Listen, the unabridged.  All day, me all the time. All day.  It's 60. We've got to see what this is.  Scott Brick, one of the best narrators.  Long. Well, maybe you'd like maybe you'd prefer something lighter  like the fountainhead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I read the fountain. That's only 32 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I read the fountainhead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I actually read the fountainhead in one seating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These are the things you read.  I read it in what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you didn't. I did, too.  How did you read it?  The more you started reading it, I finished it like a day later.  You didn't move for a day?  No, I just read the whole book.  Oh, my God. Oh, come on.  Really? I swear to God.  It's the only time I've ever done that with any book ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's pretty engrossing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So I figured I might as well read the whole thing  and just get it over with.  Or shoot myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going, OK, OK.  So you get you get two books.  You could have if you want more for your money.  I would go with the Atlas Shrug because it's 65 hours.  I buy my books by the pound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They should pay you to read them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's listen. I want to see if there's any tag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Individualism and collectivism within man's soul.  It showed the nature and function of the creator and the second hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Audible dot com slash twit to you get to choose two books of your choice for free.  You get to keep me if you don't stick around.  But I know you will because it's really a great way to spend time.  If you're in an airplane in a car, if you're going to chicken eats a  if you're going to chicken delight,  chicken eats anywhere.  Mexican chicken. Yeah.  Chicken eats it in Russia.  Chicken eats you audible dot com slash twit to thank you so much for their support  of this week in tech.  It is this is a this is a good group.  I think we should just convene this again.  You know, my dream is we're going to move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So he's never here.  It's amazing that he's even in the country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got Skype, but you know, he's got Skype.  That's a blatant invitation.  He's got I've got Skype and I'm not afraid to use it.  We're going to move the studio eventually out in the big room there.  No, you're going to like it because I have a big roundtable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you have like the same set up two weeks in a row?  Is that possible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm like a shark. If I'm not moving, I die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People out there don't realize it, but the studio of Leo's.  If you come here week after week after week, it's different every week.  They've got the cameras, the lights different.  They've got different things hanging from the ceiling.  And now it's got a whole new board and a big computer sitting behind me.  It's ridiculous.  It's almost like there's something wrong with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's definitely there's no no question about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know that it's just never good enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He just wants to sit still.  I mean, he's just tinkering.  It's like you're retired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is my retirement.  Some people go out in the garage and make, you know, bookshelves.  I make studios.  So you're going to move into the big room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're thinking about what's going to be in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is such a cozy little room.  Keep this. But I want to have a second studio out there.  Because you know what I want to do?  Studio B. Studio B.  And you know why? Poker.  I want to have liquor in the front, poker in the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like I want to have poker in the back, ladies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to have this is my dream.  You know, like like I want to have you and a bunch of tech guys  playing poker like a poker TV show, but talking tech while they play poker.  Wouldn't that be good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess. That's actually a good idea.  I'm signing me up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are you a poker player, Om? I am.  I think Calacanis is pretty good.  We may not let him play with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, we can only have two blowhards at a time.  Yep.  We can't have John and B and Calacanis all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Calacanis would be  he wouldn't be able to fit the three of us in a room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just too many egos in one place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'll see your iPhone and raise your 200 Twitter friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think exactly. I think we'd have a lot of fun anyway.  That's basically what Twitter is minus the poker.  If we just added the poker, we'd really have a good show.  That's what I'm thinking. OK.  All right. I'm going to I'm going to close this up  unless anybody has any other big stories that we want to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why he wrote that scathing piece.  Oh, I forgot Vivek Kundra. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. So John writes a blog post  about our national CIO,  the man in charge of investment for the nation's infrastructure  and says the guys at Doofus.  First of all, you say you said he inflated his.  Yeah, you said he inflated his resume a little bit.  And but but but the greater, deeper implication is not so much that,  but just that he knows nothing about tech and that he snowed everybody  in Silicon Valley because he came out here and Tim O'Reilly  and everybody's going crazy. This guy's a genius.  We love this guy. Tech whiz.  Tech whiz was the name.  So Ohm picks this up.  And now, Ohm, you said that we got it wrong last week.  So correct me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is what I wanted to just point out, just to set the record straight.  I just called the White House to get a comment  on what was John's story, just like any good reporter should.  Oh, no, no.  And they said that it is not true.  It's a lie, et cetera, et cetera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And like every good reporter in the national media, you said,  well, the White House said it, so it must be true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I said just the portion, which was not true.  I wrote that portion and I said, OK, this is what the White House said.  And my post is exactly that.  What should I? It just states the facts.  It doesn't take any other issue with John's post.  It is just a poet. My reporting. That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, let's say what you mentioned, what any good reporter would do.  Wouldn't most good reporters get a comment from the person being targeted  by an article since somebody had to get my email?  You got my email. You got my Twitter account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You got my. So you asked Kundra for a comment and you got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I sent my I went through channels.  I got nothing. But I'm saying, why didn't Ohm contact me?  Because I was out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was asking them to comment on your story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, then you went on and on.  But you could have called me and at least gotten the idea.  See, this is the difference.  I didn't go on.  Others would have said, did you know, I didn't go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't go on and on about the story.  I just said, this is what the door I wrote.  And this is what Kundra and his people said.  And that's the end of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the end of the hit piece really came from O'Reilly more than the ohm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, O'Reilly just basically went went at hominem on me.  And so that was a a loser for making that tape with Weiner.  But anyway, that's I didn't think it was that bad.  I just thought it was funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I just want to make sure that, you know, the record is straight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I like to know why you still haven't gone out to lunch with me,  like you promised six months ago. We have a recording here.  I want you to listen to Kundra here.  My favorite part of Kundra's little his his little speech at the broadband  hearings of the FCC, where it's just like people should just listen to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We'll let our audience be the judge. They can just listen to this.  And this is this is Vivek Kundra, the CIO of the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And if I can add to that, you know, I think one of the biggest problems  we see right now is the fact that so much of what we do online  actually requires training.  I think where you're going to see the greatest innovation in the coming decade  is going to be around that human computer interface.  And think about this.  I know there are people on Second Life right now.  But imagine a universe where you have the Star Trek holodeck  where you could literally ask the computer to ask or ask questions and get answers.  In the same way, if you look at some of these software companies,  they made it so complicated to interact with their technologies.  And at the same time, the underlying architecture and the platforms,  it's almost a chicken egg question.  He's riffing here. He's riffing.  It's better as a lot of it was built and architected around bandwidth constraints.  Therefore, you had to deploy technologies that were much more complicated  in terms of interacting and communicating.  Now, as broadband deployment and more importantly,  if you look at the megabits per second,  how much how much information can we get through the pipeline  is going to be so important.  And as new and new software technologies are being introduced,  but you're going to see a huge change from how applications are architected  with skip logic, video and much more human ways of interacting  with these applications rather than binary or cobalt ways of interacting  with those applications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cobalt binary cobalt.  What is cobalt? What's skip logic?  Ohm, you must know. Skip logic.  I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, Adam Curry actually figured it out.  I'm looking it up. It's got to be on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it turns out that Vivek was once a worked in a boiler room  and skip logic is the term based on the script that they give you.

Transcript:  So I just was saying that, you know, John reported something.  I just called a couple of people just to make sure he said, you know what he said.  And that's the end of story.  I'm not taking positions on one way or the other.  That's not, you know, I don't really know enough about.

So he said here.  And that's all you know, it's not that that's all I was doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it depends on who you ask.  He controls the post.  I have oversight on on spending in the tech sector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I thought you should have been the CIO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm I've got a really bad website that's ten years old at Harnack dot com.  But I really think you should call it Harnack the Magnificent.  I really do. I think you're missing a bet there.  I agree. Eventually, I'll have a podcast called This Week in Radio Tech  at This Week in Radio Tech.  It better be part of Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, we'll talk about that over dinner.  Yeah, because we we you guys were in here talking during the install  and we got a huge audience watching Kirk and Colleen work on this  and talking and chatting.  Well, my wife, a lot of people interested in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's interesting.  My wife would be much more happier if you had the cameras in your studio  than in my studio.  OK, so we should talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why I'm not working out of my house.  John C.  Dvorak is at Channel Dvorak, of course, a million different podcasts now.  You're the guy who hated podcasting, who suddenly discovered podcasting.  And you did.  I am sure I have a column somewhere where you said it'll never go anywhere.  You did it on this show.  You said that says it'll never go anywhere.  You can't miss on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not to mention it.  No, there's a lot of technology I like, and I say it right off.  I was skeptical about most things.  And the fact is, 99 percent of the stuff is garbage.  So it's like an easy, you know, it's a safe bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The safe bet, the default response is his skip logic is it's crap.  It's great. It's crap.  Just get to the point. It's crap.  Channel Dvorak dot com is the place to go for all of that.
