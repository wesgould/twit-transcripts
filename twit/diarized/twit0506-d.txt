Start time: 909.18
End time: 953.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You rub it like a genie's lamp and then it shows like something else to me. Oh, you can see it  Where where's the camera there it is you could you can see the time?  The date and then I can scroll that and I can get nothing new and test or you can just look at your watch  Well, I'm thinking the watch is gonna be a better supposed to show I thought it was supposed to show up there  Well, that was a problem. I had with a note for edge, which was it's actually upside down this one finally flips around  So there you go  And when you can assign colors to people so if you're and but see who leaves their phone face down  That's a date. That's a bad idea  But if you leave your phone face down it will glow with the color of the person that's texted you or  On the back or in the sun?  No, the side the edge glows so you get a little purple glow coming out of the bottom

Start time: 953.50
End time: 959.78

Start time: 967.36

Start time: 972.18
End time: 987.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and a lot of people are saying don't spend a hundred extra bucks to get the curve  Just get a normal like mr. Green in the chair room. That's a gimmick if I ever seen it is absolutely a gimmick  But remember I'm the guy who paid a hundred bucks for a black painted MacBook  That was a hundred bucks extra remember for black paint. Mm-hmm

Start time: 987.62
End time: 1034.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So imagine you put 18 karat gold on your iWatch I mean on your watch. Sorry, I would spray it with gold paint  So are you getting an Apple watch? I'm not I'm not and not because I totally don't believe in it  But right now like the the only reason I can see to get one is that some of the beta  Testers say that if they pull out their phone a hundred times a day, right?  They'll I'm now only pull it out about 20 times a day and the rest of the time they'll look at their watch and spend  Less time so that more time to not be staring at it  if that really holds true and I really do pull my work times a day maybe it would be worth it because I get to  Get the input and then carry on however  I feel like I'll probably have 500 interactions instead of a hundred and maybe it'll be just you'll use it more  But I kind of want to wait I'm usually an early adopter  I want to wait and see what the jury of hundreds of millions of people's have to say and then maybe

Start time: 1034.98
End time: 1038.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'll consider it that's surprisingly intelligent about having to charge it every 18 hours

Start time: 1039.28
End time: 1068.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So what don't you charge your phone every day? Not necessarily I get home I get in bed  I put my phone on the charger. I'll put my watch on the charger do that with a moto 360 already  You a million  analysts say  One of course analysts are guessing it's a wild-ass guess but they guess and I don't know how well-founded it is is about a million  pre-orders, right  That's got to be though like  Almost all the people were gonna get one at least initially

Start time: 1070.06
End time: 1094.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  There's a study that said that and I think is the study was done the same way as they do exit polls where they said  How much did you spend on your order? It was over $700  Yeah  and I feel like  Those are clearly the early adopters and of the sample that they got to respond to the equivalent of that exit poll are the  Ones that are spending more I think it's less but it's that expensive. It's a billion dollar business already  Do you really want to spend 450 to 500 dollars on a watch that has that has a?  Marketplace that's not quite defined yet

Start time: 1095.16
End time: 1106.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It is a testament to Apple and their amazing ability to market because it's completely unknown whether this watch is gonna work  Is it gonna do what you want to do? Is it gonna be of any value is a battery life amazing?

End time: 1120.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  We don't know I mean everything I've seen even though they're catering the message and all they do is talk about you know  The aluminium among other things but like they put so much work and research and the ways not of course  They're tailoring the way they presented but darn thing is incredible

Transcript:  Hey Prager, I have too much ADD  Me too and sell it after you buy you're selling your Tesla, right? Yep  Why because I don't drive and I live in the city and I have no commute almost and it's starting to depreciate like a tech  Product oh no, you like what meaning like the first gen  I had the 360th one which in a way is kind of neat  But now you know mine doesn't have as many sensors at all the new ones and finally there's a reason for that car to depreciate  In value that specific one. I think the Tesla's model s  I give you 30 grand for the most amazing cash another amazing feat of engineering  But I have no reason to keep I probably want to get another one  But I might as well wait six or eight months and save that 15 to 20 thousand depreciation

Start time: 1166.54

And that was all CPA cost per action even though everyone wanted branding campaigns  And so kind of making up ideas and trying it if you have some semblance of an audience  You can you can try things and throw darts and see what works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think that's been shot in the last couple years any of the new digital cinema cameras has enough stops of  Exposure in order to create or to remaster it as HDR, right?  It the complexity really is that if you think about the studio monitors that  Man, you are the producers are looking at when they make this content for distribution. They're not looking at HDR displays  So well good because neither are we?  How are you gonna make content that's not if you don't know the characteristics of the display  It's gonna be really hard to make content that supposedly high dynamic

Start time: 4153.96
End time: 4165.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're just now solving that for 4k so that the every at every step of the way, you know  What you're gonna get there's a standard and the TV will reflect what's shot and we still don't have those TVs  That's not till the end of this year, right?

Start time: 4165.18
End time: 4218.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Beauty about Netflix in particular is that there's a new HDMI standard the plugs type that is now supporting the metadata for high dynamic range  That will be embedded in the content  But if you have always something you're gonna get your streaming content over the internet and things like Netflix  It's just gonna be a software update for the TV  You won't have to worry about a port you won't have to worry about an upgrade there and it'll just broader color gamut  It's a different color gamut or it that's the potential this space is different  They want to use the same color space that they're using in commercial cinema right now  Which is a say another 50% larger than then what they use for HD. So a bigger palette of color more saturated colors  That's probably just as important as high dynamic range a little high dynamic range really has a good look to it  The TVs that will really be able to support that though are mine are gonna be expensive. You know what?  No, it won't be able to do the people

Start time: 4221.00

I got one for my son. He wanted a queen  He's up three flights of stairs. It's the only way we could get a mattress up there. He loves it in college  And  You have a hundred days to sleep on it and anytime in the first hundred days you can return it  They pay the shipping to you. They pay the shipping back no cost to you. You don't have to worry. That is a trial  That's the way but does that look comfy Springs from memory phone? It's a memory. It's memory foam and then on top of it latex  I can't I don't know you should try it. We will get you one if you want  They're really incredible if you go to Casper comm slash you can get yours  We've got it's five hundred dollars for a twin up to all the way up to nine hundred fifty dollars for a king-size a lot  Less than the mattress at the mattress store and we're gonna cut 50 bucks off as an audience member  If you go to Casper CAS per comm slash twit and use the promo code to it Casper CAS  No, he's not dead.
