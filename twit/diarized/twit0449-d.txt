Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's an interesting point.  I mean, I guess you could develop without actually playing them.  But I always feel like people who develop games play them.  What are you, why are you watching the show, John?

Start time: 280.31
End time: 289.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, that's a funny thing to mention.  It's a hard habit to break.  Well, it takes about six months, actually.  So you haven't done it in a while?  I haven't done it for 10 years or more.

Start time: 299.16
End time: 303.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I was going to ask.  Where does it even come from?  It comes from a typewriter thing.  It's monospacing.  Yeah, monospacing.

Start time: 304.08
End time: 332.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Typewriters used to have different amounts of space in between the characters.  And once we had computers where we could have different typefaces and things like that,  the spacing is automatically corrected.  So you have things like ligatures are easier to type because of spacing issues.  We now have proper kerning.  Although I believe in Microsoft Word, you can change it so that if you are one of those habit double spacers,  it will always just take it out for you.  And for cranky editors, there's the find, replace all function.

Start time: 334.19
End time: 410.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I actually remember reading an article, this is really nerdy,  about where the two spaces after period came from.  And it actually goes way, way back, as I remember.  James Felice, the author of The Complete Manual of Typography,  says that the early history of type is one of inconsistent spacing.  And he actually refers to monks and manuscripts and things like that.  This is from creativepro.com.  And it's about double, I remember reading this, double spacing after period.  Here's 1774.  Caslon, nice font typeface.  Yeah, that's a beauty.  In the first printing of the United States Declaration of the Independence, two spaces.  Wow, look at that.  This one, big space between the periods and the...  I don't know how we got into this.  It really doesn't have anything to do with it.  Yeah, I don't know what you're doing.  Here, from Bembo. Remember Bembo?  Oh yeah, Bembo.  Yeah, I knew him.  You know, somehow this just kind of stayed in my mind.  I remember reading this.

Start time: 411.10
End time: 413.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you just find out about this recently that you only use one space?  Is that the deal?

Start time: 414.02
End time: 445.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I've been typing two spaces.  I actually did get in trouble when my kids were little because the fourth grade teacher...  Okay, there's another one.  Remember in the old days when you were typing a paragraph, you'd begin the paragraph, you'd go in...  Indent, yeah.  You'd tab in one.  Five spaces.  Yeah.  And then nowadays we don't do that anymore, right?  Rarely.  So Henry's teacher expected him to tab in.  No, so he looked like a schmuck.  And I said, oh Henry, we don't do that anymore.  And I think she graded him down because he didn't tab in.

Transcript:  Hey, speaking of which...  That's what we do.  25 years ago, March 12th, 1989, Sir Tim Berners-Lee...  He wasn't a sir yet. Soon to be sir, Tim Berners-Lee had a twinkle in his eye.  Yeah, and then what?  He conceived of something he would later call the World Wide Web.  He wrote a little memo to his...  Remember that?  You were there?  I do remember it.  You remember that?  I wasn't there, isn't he?  To his fellow physicists.  I cannot... I am stunned at the number of people who confuse the World Wide Web with the internet.  Did you see...

Start time: 493.64
End time: 507.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I used to be a complainer about this, but now I just gave up.  To 99% of everybody, the World Wide Web and the internet are the same thing.  Not true, obviously.  No, it's not true because your email is not done...  Well, actually most of the time it is done on the web.

Start time: 508.36
End time: 518.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you just type in Happy Birthday Internet, you get all these results from people who think that the World Wide Web was the internet.  Yeah, the internet was...  Not true. The internet is closer to 50 years old.  Yeah, 1969, technically.

Start time: 521.96
End time: 538.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To be fair, it's with the web that it really took off.  It's really the UI for the internet, right?  So it is fair to make it the most important and momentous occasion of the internet anniversaries, of which there are many.

End time: 558.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And we're in the golden age of the internet and the World Wide Web.  Ten years from now, we're not going to be able to do anything.  It's going to be worse?  Porn's out, spam is in, phony baloney ads.  My favorite ads that you get, these great ads because they're so talented at targeting you.  Ads for stuff I just bought five minutes ago on every page.

Start time: 559.12
End time: 566.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

End time: 631.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I think we could talk about the Malaysia flight.  There's a tech angle to that.  No, there's not.  Well, what's interesting is that in this day and age, in fact, I had an airline safety inspector from a major US airline in studio a couple of days ago, just by chance.  I won't say his name or the name of the airline, his big airline.  And I said, are you guys fascinated with this?  I said, yeah, because it's kind of hard to understand what happened in this day and age for a plane of that size, for instance, to disappear with all the technology.  Now, we know somebody turned off the transponder.  Yeah, but there's all kinds of other.  A cars was turned off.  And interestingly enough, the transponder was turned off.  Then he said goodbye.  Good night to air traffic control.  Then he turned off a cars or may unclear the timeline.  It's very odd.  Don't you feel now?  Are you guys going crazy with this on no agenda?

Start time: 631.44
End time: 645.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We've decided that most of this is comprised of lies and the planes probably parked somewhere with a bunch of dead people in it.  That's kind of how we finished our analysis.  You think you.  Whoa.  Why would they be dead?  What are they going to keep them alive for?

Transcript:  I find it great if everyone was pleased this punch and they were all alive in some remote island or something.  But I don't know.  Something's crazy about the story.  We just have to wait.  I mean, I think the speculation at this point is out of control.  It is clearly.

Start time: 662.02
End time: 665.39

Start time: 700.02
End time: 735.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can't.  I don't care.  And this is why we have a Frenchman with us will no longer be under the aegis of the United  States of America.  And I think you have to blame this a little bit on the Snowden revelations and the fear  around the world that the U.S. is perhaps not a benign government.  On the other hand, this has been going on for a couple of years with Russia and other  countries kind of trying to say, no, no, we should run.  We want to run.  You guys.  We want to see the President of the United States of America, President Putin running  the Internet.

Start time: 737.02
End time: 801.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is that?  Give us the Parisian point of view.  Well, I don't know that it's the Parisian point of view.  But my point of view is definitely in line with I think we've talked about this on the  show before, but in line with what you just said, there's definitely concerns about one  of the things that we've talked about is the Internet.  But on the other hand, a lot of people are saying we don't we don't want the U.S.  to be doing it maybe partly because of the Snowden thing, but also, you know, it had  been in the minds of people before that.  And the thing is, personally, I think I would rather have the U.S.  running it rather than an assembly or a body, multinational body where China is running  it, and Russia and other countries that are, you know, less reliable than the U.S.  or the West in general have their say, especially in the Internet and where the war about free  speech and surveillance is happening now.

Start time: 803.32
End time: 853.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me give you the background, a little bit of the background on this.  And then I have a statement that Vint Cerf emailed Ars Technica.  He's one of the fathers of the Internet and certainly somebody we respect and admired  and a former chair of ICANN through 2007.  What did he say?  So in the early days of the Internet, it was invented kind of here, Bolt, Berenick, Newman  under DARPA, SRI, Stanford.  And there was a guy, John Postle, at the University of Southern California, who pretty  was a guy, was one guy in his office.  And if you wanted a domain, rather a number or a set of numbers, if you wanted to, you  know, some IPs, you'd go to John and John would say, well, yeah, let's see, wait a minute.  I'll give you 64.0.  How about you want a B block and A block?  What do you want?

Start time: 854.04
End time: 857.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think those days are over.  That was the way it should still be.

Start time: 858.22
End time: 913.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was enough.  And then John passed away.  But even before then, IANA, which was the organization that he ran, gave way to the  ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Sign Names and Numbers, kind of under the aegis of the  U.S. Department of Commerce, more recently under NTIA, the National Telecommunications  and Information Administration, which is a division of the Department of Commerce.  The key is the domain name system.  In 1997, the domain name system was transitioned from basically a government project into this  private hands as ICANN, although under the oversight of the United States.  ICANN meeting coming up next month in Brazil.  Brazil and other nations very upset about the NSA.  Brazil, in fact, threatened to build its own cloud, its own Internet.  That'll work.

Start time: 914.64
End time: 932.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does anybody think, just to stop your story here, does anybody think if the thing, let's  assume that it was run all along by Russia, does anybody think that the NSA still wouldn't  be collecting the same data?  Right.  I mean, I just don't buy that.  It didn't give them any inside track.  This connection between, yeah.

Start time: 933.34
End time: 982.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's just that with the NSA story, there's obviously a little bit more concern about  the US basically running the Internet as some people understand it.  I think there's also a lot of American guilt in that somewhere.  It's like, oh, right.  You know, we have this imperialistic attitude towards the world and maybe we shouldn't be  running the Internet.  And I think this is one example where actually we're happy to let you handle this.  Just do it.  It's fine.  Yeah, again, at least for me.  But there's a little bit of that.  Don't you guys feel that sometimes that sometimes Americans feel like they have to be more respectful  of the world?  And that's interesting.

Transcript:  We got to bend over backwards.

Start time: 985.23
End time: 1004.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, a little bit, a little bit.  I don't know if it's accurate, but it's a feeling I get sometimes.  And sometimes it's justified.  I'm not saying it's completely unnecessary.  I think there is a little bit of over boasting or over obliviousness to the rest of the world  sometimes.  But in this case, I'm not sure.

Start time: 1004.90
End time: 1047.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Vince Cerf was the chair of ICANN from 2000 through 2007.  He's now a fellow at Google.  He was co-inventor of TCPIP.  He said a statement to ours.  He said the announced change would ultimately eliminate the contract between ICANN and the  between ICANN and the Department of Commerce in the U.S. and leave it to ICANN and the Internet  community to create a transparency and accountability regime that's rooted in the multi-stakeholder  model of administration.  What does that even mean?  He says basically this is a major step toward implementing a global system of Internet administration  where there's no one country.

Start time: 1048.54
End time: 1084.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's going to go to the U.N.  And the U.N. is going to implement all the crap the U.N. does, including all its kind  of freedom of speech limitations because of their edicts about hate speech.  And you're going to see sites disappear.  Well, that's a hate speech site.  I don't think so.  It's gone.  I think that the...  Okay, well, I'm losing a bet when you say that.  You want to make a bet?  It's too late.  I already made a bet.  What was the bet?  The bet was with Adam.  I would say that.  That you defend this crazy notion that should be...  It's not going to the U.N.  I agree with our French fellow here.  He's got the right idea.

Start time: 1085.98
End time: 1087.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's amazing.  It's not going to the U.N.

Start time: 1089.06

Transcript:  It'll be a U.N. operation you watch by the end of the day.

Start time: 1093.46
End time: 1167.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, even if it's not the U.N., the problem is you're going to have...  If you start giving it to someone else in the U.S., of course, the situation is not  ideal.  Ideally, it shouldn't be run by one country.  But still, if you go to someone else, then you can't go to another country.  You have to go to everyone.  So even if it's not the U.S., you are going to have...  A bureaucracy.  You're right.  You're going to be setting up a...  I'm sorry.  And you're going to have to...  First of all, it's a bureaucracy, sure.  But that's not the...  It's not my main concern.  My main concern is that you're going to have to listen to China.  And if China has a bunch of deals, economic deals with your country, of course, you're  going to want to please them somewhere else.  And as the NSA scandals have proven, this horrendous invasion of privacy, people don't  give the weight to the internet that they give to real life, even though we all know  in the audience on Twitter that it actually is as, if not more important.  So I do worry that the internet stuff and the free speech aspect and all of that is  going to go by the wayside because we have to protect the factory deals and the exchange  deals and all of that.  So if China...  I don't think that's going to happen.

Transcript:  The Department of Commerce has even said, we're not going to give it up to the UN or  another country.  Look, the IETF has worked very well.  Where have they said that?

Transcript:  They're not going to give it up to the UN?  Commerce officials indicated they wouldn't give up oversight.  This is from recode of ICANN to another government or intergovernmental organization, which would  include the United Nations.  Whoever takes over would be required to maintain the security and stability of the internet  domain name system.  This doesn't make sense.  Meet the needs of global customers and maintain, according to a Commerce Department statement,  quote, maintain the openness of the internet.  This makes perfect sense.  No one country should be responsible.  Okay, so they're not going to give it to a country and they're not going to give it to

Start time: 1210.10
End time: 1232.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's already something, well, in effect, it's a consortium, but not just of countries, of  stakeholders.  And it's how the IETF works, the Internet Engineering Task Force, which, frankly, arguably  is more important because they determine the protocols that run over the internet.  It shouldn't be run by the US Department of Commerce, but it shouldn't be run by any country.  It certainly shouldn't be run by the United Nations.

Transcript:  These guys have been, I had been over, this has been a decade long, this fight.  I remember I've been down to ICON a couple of times.  They ship you down there and they lecture you about how horrible this is going to be  because you're going to have exactly what Patrick said, almost to the letter.  You're going to have these vested interests because you know we can't do this, we can't  do that because you're demeaning us, you're demeaning China in the case of his argument.  And we can't have these kinds of sites.  They have to be shut down.  We have to do this and that, take them off the domain system.  I agree with all that.

Transcript:  We know that.  I think the Americans having it are so paranoid and conscientious that I think we've done  a really good job of maintaining this thing.  You don't look at the internet, except for the NSA, which is just spying on just streams.  You don't look at the internet and say, Jesus, this has been poorly managed.  I'm surprised it's even up today.  It's been very well managed.  It's actually astonishing how well it's been managed.  But oh, let's fire the guys.  Let's fix it.  Let's fix it.  That's what I see.

Transcript:  So John is agreeing with me too much.  It's scaring me a little bit.  So let's take the other side of the argument.  The internet is made of things that are astonishing that they work, and yet they work very well.  And you mentioned Wikipedia.  I think someone did.  Anyway, Wikipedia is one example where if you describe it, you think it's never going  to work.  We're going to have a bunch of people who can go and edit pages all at the same time,  all the way they want to, and we're going to build an encyclopedia out of it.  And it would have seemed ridiculous.  It did seem ridiculous a few years ago.  Actually it worked.  So maybe the stakeholders and the people who know how to run this thing will find a system  which is not necessarily involving the special interests or the particular interests of various  countries and will manage to devise a system that will make it collaborative and decentralized  and efficient.  So I hope they will.  I'm just worried.  Jill, any thoughts?

Transcript:  Patrick, well, I don't want to jump on Patrick's analogy too much, but I would say that Wikipedia  is not really a great analogy because it does have a lot of bias in it, mainly male bias.  Women don't contribute to Wikipedia, and there's a whole culture and history behind why women  don't contribute.  Really?

Transcript:  It's a very, very big can of worms to open right there.  I mean, I could go through the culture of editing and having people respond to your  edits, the way people are treated, the way women say, I don't want to get into this because  I see the way that it happens and what goes on there, the kinds of communications that  people are having.  I don't want to even start with that.

Transcript:  Can I interrupt you for a second?  Because I think you're missing Patrick's point.  I don't think Patrick was discussing the politics of Wikipedia and why or why not women get  on it or anybody else for that matter.  I think he was just trying to say that here's a crazy idea that kind of works that we just  stumbled upon that did not look like it was going to work and it seemed idiotic when it  came out.

Start time: 1437.38
End time: 1454.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What I want to say about the analogy though is that sometimes because of our own perspective,  we don't see what's missing.  So we may not see as Americans or as Westerners what's missing from the perspective of just  having Westerners or Western countries manage this.

It's like when they bring in the new boss.  The new boss is not as good as the old boss.  He's crappy and it just deteriorates.  It deteriorates over time and we're going to see the same thing.  So I'm telling you that this is the golden age of the internet.  Be happy because you're not going to see it this good in the future.  You'll see.

Less than 15% of contributors on Wikipedia are female.  8.5% of editors are women as of a 2011 study.  So women hate the Wikipedia.  But what's interesting is that that bias shows up in the way Wikipedia is perceived on a  gender basis.  Thank you, Jill.  Thank you.  I had no idea.

They've raised almost a quarter of a million dollars two weeks ago where you put this really  interesting...  It's nine sensors on your elbows, your tummy, your hips, your knees, your feet, your head.  And then you could play a game and shoot and stuff and crouch and everything, which is  kind of cool.  Kind of like Kinect.  There it is.  There's a video of it.  But, hey, hi Paul.  How are you?  He was just here.  But then, see that's what you're doing.  But just connect without a sensor because they don't need a sensor because it's smart.  But then they put the Oculus Rift on my head.  And that's the VR helmet.  It's monocular vision though.

Transcript:  So GitHub, we should explain first of all what GitHub is.  It's a very widely used source control software, right?  So if you are working in a group of programmers, you can all work on the same project.  You can check out the latest work, check it back in after you've made your changes,  keeps track of version control and all of this.  GitHub is an open source project, but it also has a website and a commercial site, GitHub.com.  A lot of people use it.  It is a great piece of software.  And I always think of it because I like open source kind of as being, you know, kind of  hip and cool and with it.  Apparently it's not the best culture for women.  She has worked for GitHub since 2012.  She says it was fairly small then.  She said at the time, culture, the culture was supportive of the women on its staff.  She was the only female designer or developer on the team.  And I remember that she defended GitHub.  There were complaints, but she defended GitHub.  She says now I had a really hard time getting used to the culture, the aggressive communication  on pull requests and how little the men I worked with respected and valued my opinion.  She wrote this in an email to TechCrunch.  I loved the idea of GitHub because it was a place people went to make things for people  who make things.  She says it was a boys club.  She felt she was being treated differently internally due to her gender.  Now she's quit.  Any thoughts on that at all?  I mean, I think this is really something we need to address in general in the tech industry.  Absolutely.  This goes along with the Wikipedia story where women feel like it's too aggressive of an  environment and it's not a place they want to be.

Start time: 2028.30
End time: 2151.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, she didn't go into a whole lot of detail about exactly what was said, but she  did give an interview with, I believe it was TechCrunch, and kind of mentioned that  one of her bosses or one of the co-founders' wives said, let's go out for drinks.  I want to talk to you.  And during this conversation, she said it got to be a little bit personal and it got  to be a little bit aggressive.  And the wife was sort of asking her for a lot of details about what she was working  on and she was insinuating some things about her work.  I have a hard time thinking that that's all that happened.  I have a feeling that this was a building problem that was going on and on and on for  months and there must have been something that made, you know, the straw that broke  the camel's back, but we don't quite know what that is.  And then Julianne Horvath tweeted at one point, my only regret is not leaving or being fired  sooner.  What I endured as an employee of GitHub was unacceptable and went unnoticed by most.  And I think that unnoticed sort of speaks to what I was mentioning before, you know,  this bias that men don't always see or know about.  So it's sad that she was there for two years and that she was, I mean, two years at any  company is a long time.  You know, you get to know everybody there and you become part of the culture.  I kind of hope that she wasn't unhappy that whole time, but I would like to know a little  bit more about what went on.  It's hard for women to speak up about these kinds of things because of the retribution.  I believe she at one point, you know, got the death threats and rape threats online  as all the trolls like to throw at women.  But I kind of wish she would speak out a little bit more about what happened.  And I think any woman in that situation is going to be afraid of their reputation and  their career prospects going forward if they become the center of attention and the backlash  that happens with a back and forth with a bad employment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's no there's no question that the Internet is a sexist environment at the  end.  And hostile and full of trolls and that is.  Yeah, it's it's but yeah, it's full of trolls.  It's full of people who like to criticize and hate for just the sake of it and because  anonymity and all of that.  That's no question.  But specifically about women, we all have a few tech industry actors that are women  friends, you know, we have friends that are women, you know, Veronica Belmont and, you  know, others.  And all of them tell you the same thing.  And you can see it on their the places they interact with people on the Web.  It's horrendous.  It's terrible.  You have specifically on the matter of sexism, you have some absolutely unacceptable things  that are happening.  You were talking about rape threats and death threats.  And guys don't have to deal with that.  And I think there's a sort of a societally acceptable sexism thing in on the Internet,  the same way that we had maybe at the beginning of last century, societally acceptable anti  semitism or maybe in the 50s.  Or racism.  Racism.  But what's different here is because it's anonymous, you feel like that racism went

Start time: 2289.50
End time: 2303.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  under a rock.  It wasn't acceptable socially anymore, but that it didn't go away.  And now that it can be expressed anonymously, sexism, racism, anti semitism are being expressed  much more vigorously because people are anonymous.

Start time: 2303.34
End time: 2386.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe maybe a little bit, but she's she's talking in her article on TechCrunch about  yeah, it's not even that's the worst part.  The anonymous thing everyone has issues with, but it's not even anonymous.  You know, it's like you'll make a horrible or even snide comment.  Let's not go into the really outrageous snide comment, a comment about some girl who dresses  that way or this way or just and you'll do it.  And if someone is shocked by it, the reaction of most people is going to be, you know, I'm  just making fun.  I'm just.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, I was joking.  I kid I kid.  And it's like if you say some if you would say something about, you know, a black person  in the 50s or 60s or about the Jew in the in Europe in the early 1900s.  And it's it's I think, you know, my understanding of this situation, and I'm not a girl, so  I can't I don't have a very good grasp on this.  But on the Internet, it's now OK to do these things to girls.  And it's completely accepted.  And it's shameful.  It's it's really something that we have to take a stand on and we have to talk about  it. And we have to change the environment because it leads to real problems for you  were saying earlier, forty nine point nine nine percent of the population.  And it's it's unacceptable.

And I think, you know, I've seen some studies that show that the same culture goes  back into the classroom in STEM classes where you have men who came up learning this stuff,  men who ended up teaching it.  You have 80, 90 percent male classroom.  You put a woman in there and they very often drop out, especially at the collegiate level.  They get a few days into this class.  They don't like the way that people communicate with one another.  They don't like the way that they're talked to.  They don't like the way that they're dismissed.  And they leave and they go over to the other kinds of sciences like biology and psychology  and some of the softer sciences because there's a more equal environment there to learn.

Transcript:  Here's a related story, an interesting discussion going on  on the ethics of anonymous apps.  And Secret, I think, has really brought this forward.  Mark Andreessen, P. Marka on Twitter started the conversation.  He's lately he's been it's really interesting to see him use Twitter with numbered posts.  He's it's as if he doesn't want to write a longer piece, but he ends up writing a longer  piece at 140 characters at a time.  He starts. I never really like to criticize any startup and I won't in this thread by name,  but there is an important topic that must be discussed.  He's asserting that software can condition human behavior.  Software design, how software design deeply influences the human behavior that results.  And he says there are programs, especially now that are being created, that encourage  negative behavior, tearing people down, making fellow souls sad.  Such experiments start out as naughty fun, end with broken hearts and ruined lives.  In the end, everyone regrets participating in them.  And that clearly Secret is what he's talking about.

Transcript:  This was way this goes back to the old Accompuserve days where you had these groups together and  you'd always have these characters that come and you get into these debates and if they  ganged up on you, you had all kinds of issues.  And it happened plenty that women weren't even involved at the time and you had to go  through this. It was like some sort of a rites of passage, as a matter of fact, and you get  criticized ridiculously and told you're an idiot.  It was really horrible.  And it was really horrible.  And it was men only, by the way.  And then the women walked into it later and then they didn't like it.  Of course, we didn't like it either.  But this is what develops into the bullying meme or, oh, God, you're being bullied.  And I just go back to that.  Like somebody saying bad things about you, they're not coming over and knifing you.  And it's like the old sticks and stones thing that we used to hear when I was a kid.  It seems like that's been gone by the wayside and everybody's got to be nice to each other.

And so I'm going to come back to the question of women and the barrage of hate  and threats and and and trolling that women get when they talk about something.  I mean, it's I don't think it can be quite equated.  Both are not really the same.  I maybe, you know, I'm not the best person to talk about this, but it's  especially if a woman, which is the worst, especially if a woman starts talking about  this specific issue, which makes everything worse.

But this is what happens all the time.  That's one of the reasons I don't even look at the chat room on no agenda.  But it's like if JCD hit his head on the glass ceiling, his life would be say he  wouldn't say such stuff or something.  Quit your old.  I mean, this is the kind of this is the thing is you can't.  So you can't have an opinion anymore because you get shouted down by the masses  and usually a masses of a bunch of anonymous jerks.

Some people said, really, you need to raise money for a Hollywood movie on Kickstarter.  But I think they demonstrated there was an audience and the movie has been made.

And keep coming back to the women's thing.  It was one of the first TV shows I saw where there was a strong woman  character that was not in there, you know, that wasn't there because she was sexy  or pretty or anything like that. She was a strong female lead.  And it was well written, clever.  It was a teenage show, but still, it was very efficiently made.  And I was very happy that I could, you know, help Rob Thomas.  He's the director, the creator.  Yeah, the creator.

Start time: 2950.74
End time: 2974.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's it's annoying if you pay for Kickstarter to get the Veronica Mars movie.  And and and this is they give it to you on on Flixter via  with an ultraviolet copy protection.  That's a little frustrating. Yeah, it is.  The buyer beware on Kickstarter, frankly. I don't.  I always felt a little weird that they raised money for a Hollywood movie.  Yeah, it makes no sense by going to real people and saying, hey, give us money.

Start time: 2975.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it wasn't the entire amount of money needed to make the movie.  Not even close. But it's told Hollywood, hey, look, there's, you know,  there's 20,000 people actually, I'm sorry, 91,000 people  were willing to give us actual money to make this same with the Zach Braff's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  movie, which I was here.  There was a big, big deal made about the fact that he was even more  because he was he's actually a film director who had a successful movie  before. And but, you know, I don't see what the big deal is.  If people are willing, people aren't completely idiotic.  You know, they know what they're getting into.  They're willing to give money to the guy to get his film off the ground.  It's their money. Yeah.  I mean, I have a Patreon.  I'm do you are using Patreon for money? Yeah.  For a new show or?  No, for I think, you know, for Patreon, it's for the Rendezvous Tech.  And I'm very thankful of all the people who are giving money.  But I think it's difficult to do for a new show because I really think  you have to have a community behind you that trusts and knows you  and knows what to expect.  But there are a lot of people.

Start time: 3050.48
End time: 3073.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Patreon, in fact, I think just raised something like 20 million dollars.  The idea is it is very focused on the arts,  although Kickstarter was when it started, the idea that and what's unique  about it is you subscribe in effect.  So you say not only I'm going to give five dollars now,  but I'm going to give five dollars for every episode. Yeah.  So that's that's worked out for you.

Start time: 3074.86
End time: 3127.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, obviously, it's not it's a little I'm in a little bit  different situation than others who are using Patreon.  I do less shows and I'm not it's not my sole income. Right.  But it's worked out enough that it's a very decent supplemental income.  So it's it's it's really an interesting model, because as you were saying,  it's sort of a subscription and it allows content creators to get reliable,  a reliable source of revenue as well as Kickstarter.  A few people try to do kickstarters for different creative projects.  But the problem is you get one big chunk of money to get your thing off the ground.  It's a one off. And then that's it.  And then you don't know what's going to happen in the next,  you know, maybe the next year or whatever.  You have to do it all over again. Whereas Patreon has this.  It's actually Jack Conti from Pamplemousse.  You know, he's a he's a content creator.

Start time: 3127.34
End time: 3135.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love Pamplemousse. Yeah. And I'm glad Jack's doing this.  The only that Brushwood told me this because he's he's raising  and has raised money on the picture.

Start time: 3138.12
End time: 3152.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What he said is that the number is deceptive because you give an amount.  But there's also you could set a limit for how much total you're willing to give.  So he says the number the amount you get is is actually more like half  what you see on the page.  Is that your experience?

Start time: 3152.96
End time: 3191.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because well, for me, my show is on twice a month.  So it is a little bit less for the second episode, although, you know,  I haven't invoiced yet. I haven't activated it.  It's just this one.  So it might end up that I don't get, you know, half of what people have promised.  But yeah, for the second episode, people can set a limit  and the limit can be equal to what they want to give for the for the first episode  every month. So in the case of Tom and Brian,  they're doing it for court killers and they have four episodes a month.  So if someone they have to go through, you know, one, two, three, four episodes,  if someone sets a limit to one or two or three, the next one is going to get less money.  I see a lot of people doing this.

Start time: 3191.80
End time: 3197.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it allows people who appreciate you.  It's an alternative to advertising in a sense,  although it doesn't have to replace it completely.  But it also allows people who enjoy your content enough to support you.  And there hasn't really been, especially for podcasting,  there hasn't really been an appropriate way of doing that until now.  And I think Patreon might be part of the answer to that for some people.  And so I'm very happy they're raising money because I'm terrified now  that they will go under and and take all the money away.

Transcript:  Well, you know, it's interesting because we've tried different podcasters,  at least in France, have tried models where you would do it yourself, basically.  Just have a PayPal, a bunch of PayPal buttons on your website.  And people could subscribe that way for its work for some.  But maybe not.  I don't think as well as it does on this system, because for some reason,  going through that proxy and having them handle the the payment  and the managing of everything, I think people got used to to  to crowdfunding in general.  And for some reason, it's easier for people to commit to that kind of thing  with a site that can be somewhat equated to to Kickstarter.

Transcript:  Here's the problem that people have with podcasts that they want to make  a listener supported.  They have a huge and I've talked to people about this.  They have a huge reluctance to ask for money.  I don't like doing that.  No, most people don't, because they generally most people are in a position  where they used to either work for somebody.  They're always they have not to say it so bluntly,  but they have a slave mentality and they feel that they should either be paid  by someone or they should be subservient to someone.  And they don't have the wherewithal to take this leap of faith and say, look,  we here's what we're providing.  Here's what we need to provide it.  And we want you to be the person that has to do this.  We're going to do an end around the advertising model and all these other models.  And the problem that most podcasters have is they cannot do this sincerely.  They cannot sincerely.  They put a button up.  They say, oh, God, God, yeah, they feel guilty.  God, maybe if you if you just because you and then they get five bucks  and they say, oh, well, this don't ask again because, you know,  they already gave us five bucks.  And so if you're not into it at the right psychological level,  you can't be successful.  And so falling back on Patreon to me is just a cheap trick.  It's just like, oh, God, well, let them do the work.  And I'll just I don't want to ask.  I don't want to ask. You have to ask.

Start time: 3375.64
End time: 3398.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't you disagree with you?  I'm going to disagree with you, John.  I did ask.  And it's even it's maybe a little bit more challenging even in France,  where money is a bit more dirty and you don't really talk about it.  And you you shouldn't want to be making money  because that's what evil capitalist people do.  So I did have to sort of challenge myself to do it.  But I did ask for money.

Transcript:  Well, that's the reason I didn't do it, because we didn't.  We made 10,000 a month or something like that.  But well, that's not bad.  And I wasn't willing to beg. I really wasn't.  But that wouldn't have supported more than one show a month.  And it's not begging, by the way. Felt like it.

How do you get people to just support you directly  rather than having to have an advertiser or sponsor as the middle man?  And it's a it's a really interesting piece.

Look, what we're doing costs money to put on.  Yeah, we do that all the time.  We need to make the funds like and just that little bit of human touch to say  we want you to know that this is the way that it works.  So please listen to our wonderful sponsor.

So it is a little bit different and it's every show is different  and every show is special and wonderful.  But there are different  factors to take into consideration.

And a couple of days later, Edward Snowden, instead of using Skype,  used Google Hangouts because they're so much more trustworthy.

End time: 4501.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So actually, it's it's not about him getting shot  or whether he should be shot. It's the opposite.  I think a lot of us have been I don't know if you've listened,  if you've actually listened to this interview.  And there's been a couple of others.  And he is incredibly soft spoken and well spoken  and very precise about what he wants and what he wanted to achieve  with his leaks and the care he took in not making it  too damaging and the way he approaches the whole problem  shows how much it's not about you were talking about the song.  I think Assange is is a lot more controversial in the sense that  he's very much of his own personality.  And you can feel that there is a lot of him in what he does.  Snowden feels very different.  And I think that by now it's been a few months.  Maybe I can't remember how many maybe eight months.  So eight months since then.  And a lot of us have been incredibly careful in how we were  judging this whole affair because we didn't really know enough.  And it was the dust was still settling and we didn't know what the NSA did,  what Snowden was after, what we knew, what we didn't know.  Now, I think that we're in a point, unless there's something  incredibly surprising that happens, which is always possible.  But now the dust has settled.  And I think we can decide which side of this argument we're on.  And for my money, I think it's I think it's OK to say that Snowden is a hero  and he's an American hero and he's an international hero.  And he did something incredibly dangerous, not for his own sake,  but because he was witnessing, as he says, the constitution  of the US being being broken left, right and Sunday.  I can't remember how you say this, but, you know, we've seen how  it's pretty good.  I say he has left, right and Sunday.  There you go.  The NSA has been lying to Congress.  And anyway, I'm not going to go back through everything  that we've witnessed in the past eight months.  But I just want to say it's OK now to say that to decide whether or not  we want to say that he's a hero.  I think he is.  And I think a lot of the people from the tech community  should be taking a stand on this.  And now we know it's not OK anymore to say, well, you know,  we're not sure. It's still unclear.  We're waiting to find out more.  Now we know more.

Transcript:  Boy, the things we're learning.  This week, the revelation was about quantum,  a tool that weaponized the Internet in effect by allowing the NSA  to automate the infection of as millions of computers with malware,  malware that could be used to turn on the camera and take pictures,  turn on the sound and listen in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's never ending. It's one story.  No, it's never ending.  It's never in months. That's what's funny about it.  Think after six months, it would be like, OK, now it's done.  But it keeps on coming all the time.  And it's it is to a point where it's clear  at least to me again, I want to qualify this a little bit,  but it seems very clear that the NSA and possibly some parts  of the government is breaking the I hesitate to say the law  because they've actually arranged the law so they wouldn't be breaking it  doing these outrageous things, but is going beyond the scope  of what is acceptable and what they should be allowed to do.  And that, for me, settles it.  It's it's clear someone had to blow the whistle and he didn't.  He should be commended for it.

Transcript:  The NSA and Britain's GCHQ  wanted to add Pwn by Keyword feature to Quantum.  If a user's email through Yahoo or Hotmail contain any keywords  that were offensive, like, I don't know, hummus,  it would exploit them automatically.  Nice. It would just go, Oh, good, we got him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's that's even when I when I say Snowden is very precise  in what he wants, it's exactly what he's saying.  He's not saying we should stop spying on everyone or he's not a privacy nut.  You know, he's not saying that should never be possible about anything.  We should neuter the NSA.  That's not what he's saying.  He's saying we should absolutely pursue valid targets.  We should have tools to fight terrorism.  It's just the mass surveillance is unacceptable.  And that's exactly what you're saying, Leo.  It should be OK for these organizations to have these tools  and to use them in a targeted manner.  That's it. We're not against spying.  God knows. I'm very much for that.  And you know, for these kinds of practices.

And he said when he told German television,  I still work for the CIA.  He basically did. Yes.  Really? Did you ever see that interview that was he say  he was involved in Bitcoin?  He says he still has his ID.  And he as far as he's going to technically, I still work.  They never fired me.  They of course not.  And he kept calling what he did a mission.  I'm telling you, you should.  Why would he admit it?  To German TV, did that even run in the United States?  They do it three hours and not one word of it runs in the United States.  In German. No, it was all in English.  Oh.  That's OK.  Just listen to No Agenda and you won't have to listen to Leo's theories,  which is that everything's fine.  It's fine. The world's a wonderful world.

You found some good government computers  running XP will be vulnerable to hackers after April 8th.  I wrote a column about this in the PC magazine.  Hackers who said that Microsoft should charge a little, give a certain  half a million. I'm sorry, half a billion, half a billion XP machines out there.  If they charge the dollar a month for support, they could easily make  about three to six billion dollars extra on the bottom line and just support this.  And they already got a group in play that supports it.  Why don't you just keep them in business?  So that's my argument about XP, because then nobody would ever buy.  No, no, no. These are things that are they're stuck in place.  They're on ATM machines. Banks use XP.  There's a bunch of people they don't want to.

Yeah, they're going to have trouble with 20 due to the increased  cost of fuel and transportation.  If you read the book, The Everything Store by Brad Stone about Amazon,  the guests, they completely guessed at 79 bucks.  They had no idea what prime would cost them.  And what did it cost them?  Well, no one even knows Amazon's so willing to lose money on something like that.  They don't care. It's like, yeah, we lost money on every every sale,  but we got lots more customers.  That's the that's how they think.

And I think they're also willing to lose money just to gain consumers.  But I do believe that when they first came up with prime,  they just really didn't know how many people would use it,  how much the shipping would end up costing them, whether they would make  the money up in the amount of sales and so forth.  I think that was a bit of a guess.  In fact, it was supposedly Jeff Bezos who just said after much debate,  79 bucks. We'll see. We'll figure it out from there.  But you make a good point because it didn't change for years.

Start time: 5919.98
End time: 5942.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I think going forward, if you are an existing prime member,  that this year is still seventy nine dollars.  You're if you have an auto renewal, I believe it is.  And students actually get a discount.  It's it's half price from the typical prime membership.  So if you are a student or if you're in a family and you have a student  and you can sign up using their credentials, then you get a nice little  chunk of change back on that.

Transcript:  The only thing about Amazon, a lot of its products are just cash registers.  Right. The Kindle is a cash register for buying other products in the Amazon store.  When I started looking deeply into the streaming aspect of Amazon,  I really, really felt like I was getting nickel and dimed,  because as much as there's a lot of stuff to be streamed for free,  there's also a whole bunch of content that isn't free,  that is then advertised to you for, you know, two or three dollars to rent it  seven, eight, nine dollars to buy it.  But it's not really clear if you need to be a prime member or not  in order to stream the content that's paid.  So it's this it's this weird thing that you're afraid.  If I lose my prime membership, do I also lose the ability to buy this  streamed content that's not free and part of prime?  And I believe the answer is that, no, anybody can buy it for the price that it is.  But it's it's so like murky in a way that it's designed that that you can't tell.

Transcript:  I use Fresh Direct sometimes, and they have, you know, a similar thing  where you get free delivery.  And I don't remember what the what the price is on that.  But the real key there is when you have it in cities  where people don't have cars and carrying a lot of heavy groceries  to our homes is really inconvenient.  So the ability to order something online, especially like if I'm going to have a party,  if I can get some cases of beer delivered to my house and all the food  and all the paper products that I need, like that's that's worthwhile.

It's a set top box that has a game controller.  So Netflix and Hulu, yes, it's running on forked Android.  That's Amazon does that like the Kindle.  And apparently, according to the FCC  documents, there is a Bluetooth game controller,  which really has a lot of buttons on it.  This looks pretty serious.  It's most yeah.  Amazon, I think it's how long before Amazon has,  you know, same day delivery in big cities like New York?  They just kind of bring it to you.  We'll have it for you in a couple of hours.  They and and by the way, why does Amazon still use UPS?  Why don't they have their own delivery service?  They haven't bought UPS. I am, too.  Seems like that would be a way to save money.

Transcript:  They had that for a while.  It was the new one.  Yeah, I have the old one.  More stuff going on.  It's kind of an interesting thing.  It reboots a lot on me.  I you need to have a special kind of HDMI port that has power.  It's an MLC port.  I happen to have one device that does.  So you plug it in and then it gives Roku capability to that HDMI port,  which is kind of neat.

So this is a $50 streaming media stick the size of a pack of gum  plugs into your HDMI port does have a remote control.  This new one does not require eight MHL.  The new Roku streaming stick, instead of using MHL, requires a special HDMI port.  Well, that's what MHL is.  To send power as well as video, it is all.  Oh, I see.  Now it has a separate USB plug like the Chromecast that can plug into a USB.  Yeah, you just plug it right in to give it power.  That actually is better because while MHL is a great idea, it just didn't take off.  So it's the same specs as the Roku one, 1080p capable media hub.  I really like the Roku three, frankly,  it's missing some of those features like the remote headphone jack.

What's the amount of money he's got?  He's raised...  He launched this on Tuesday. I immediately got in.  I was lucky too because...  What do you get for getting in?
