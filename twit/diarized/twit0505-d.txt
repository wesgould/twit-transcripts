Ben is an amazing analyst and I love having you on.  And if you are not yet subscribing to his newsletter Stratecary you must.  You must.  Also with us from Business Insider the great Steve Kovac.  We got a great panel here.  Hey guys.  Hey.  Welcome.  International panel.  International.  In honor of Apple Watch Day.  Maybe even better in honor of Game of Thrones Day.  I like that better.  There we go.  I was thinking this is a terrible night because Game of Thrones Silicon Valley and Veep premiere on HBO.  But there's Mad Men episode two on AMC and The Good Wife.  And Daredevil on Netflix.  And Daredevil is on Netflix.  I have one of those Tivo's with the six tuners.  Well that's the thing.

Start time: 198.02
End time: 224.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They would have carefully programmed this and you only go head to head if you really want to sock it rough.  But everybody watches on demand now.  Nobody cares.  It'll be interesting to watch tonight because this is the first big night for HBO now.  Oh man.  This is the over the top app.  HBO ships on Netflix.  The over the top app.  HBO ships on only on Apple right now.  Although in three months it'll be the exclusive will be over.  But right now on iTunes.  Not iTunes.

Start time: 225.18
End time: 257.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The iOS app and on Apple TV.  You can get it.  Although it's funny I've heard some people say that it's not actually true that it's the exclusive.  It's the exclusive for HBO now.  But Sling lets you get HBO.  So it's sort of over the top.  But it's like regular HBO.  Because Sling is considered a TV provider.  Right.  It's not on demand.  Exactly.  But HBO now through the Apple devices is sort of in a different thing.  But it's going to be interesting to see if the internet grinds to a halt at 9 p.m. Eastern when Game of Thrones comes on.

Start time: 262.22
End time: 267.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And HBO dismantled that multi-million dollar project they had up in Seattle.  They'd hired a bunch of Amazon engineers.

Start time: 267.06
End time: 304.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah and their CTO basically exited the company and they're using Major League Baseball Advanced Media for the streaming of HBO now.  Which is funny.  If you're not a baseball fan you might think that's totally random.  Why are they using that?  But it turns out Major League Baseball Advanced Media is maybe the best.  It's certainly one of the best video distribution mechanisms.  CBS uses it for all of its sports broadcasts.  I believe ESPN is still using it for all of its streaming.  They have been using.  They've had other clients for a long time.  It's not just a baseball streaming service.  And they've got this huge infrastructure.  I've been in their building in New York City that has this huge streaming infrastructure that they've built.

Start time: 305.81
End time: 308.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do they have their own CDN or do they use Akamai or something?  That I don't know.

Start time: 309.96
End time: 350.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean their own infrastructure is gigantic and then they probably have CDN partners too.  But I don't know that offhand.  But it's an amazing company actually.  And so it's funny that HBO has drawn a little more attention to it.  Because this is one of the great benefits baseball had of having the foresight to embrace digital technology earlier than most other sports leagues did.  And they invested in the tech.  And now you've got big media companies like Time Warner with HBO Now coming to them and saying, please help us.  So we'll see how they hold up.  It is a surprise, isn't it?  Yeah, it's funny how that is.  But baseball, that rural pastoral game.  Turns out to be pretty high tech.  They did some really smart things with their tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Sling TV had trouble with March Madness, the NCAA tournament.  Apparently people who use Sling TV to watch ESPN had buffering and stuttering and it wasn't a good experience.  We saw that in the World Cup.

Start time: 362.00
End time: 380.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  Interest here is outpacing the ability of these streaming services, I think, to really catch up.  We've seen that Apple did some live streams of their events early and then they stopped for a while.  Yeah, and remember the iPhone.  I think the reason was that they couldn't manage it.  And then when they came back, they struggled to get it done.

Start time: 380.00

Transcript:  Chinese translation in the background.  Streaming video is hard.

Start time: 382.79
End time: 385.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If a lot of people, I mean, if there's demand, it can be really hard.  Yeah.

Start time: 386.38
End time: 424.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's a very different model than the broadcast model.  It doesn't matter if you've got a transmitter and an antenna.  If one person watches or a million, it's the same bandwidth from your point of view.  But it's completely upside down for streaming.  Now cable kind of is more, is a little bit like streaming.  I mean, but but it's so distributed that I think the cable companies don't have to worry so much about this.  HBO decided to launch Game of Thrones in 170 countries this year.  It was the most pirated TV show of last year, hoping that it was this year.  And guess what?  It started.  Can you can you watch it in Taiwan?  Is it on somewhere in Taiwan, Ben?

Start time: 424.10
End time: 435.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not sure.  I'm people asking how I get a lot of stuff done.  And one reason is I don't watch TV.  So that's why I get very little done myself.

Start time: 436.04
End time: 459.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just I prefer to watch TV to actually doing anything.  But I presume it's going to be all 170 countries.  It doesn't leave many out.  But already the first four episodes have been leaked to the bit torrents.  You can get them on Pirate Bay, not HD SD.  The thinking is, it's the review copies that were sent out.  The DVDs, yeah.

Start time: 460.10
End time: 492.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I know a TV critic and I know that they got the four episodes.  And I actually saw the screeners of the first year before it came on.  And these are these seem to be a little more recent than the ones I saw in year one where they were missing effects.  It looks like maybe the effects are all there, but it's still it's a standard.  It's an inferior experience.  But if people really want to see those four episodes early, I guess they they're going to go ahead and do it.  I'd rather watch it in HD with everything locked down in final.

Start time: 493.06
End time: 497.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So have you watched Daredevil, the TV series on Netflix, Steve, or you just brought it up to be?

Start time: 498.62
End time: 501.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I watch it. I've watched the first three episodes.

Start time: 501.12
End time: 502.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People are raving about it.

Start time: 503.00
End time: 529.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's really good.  The second episode, especially, I was so blown away.  We put the story up on the site today.  There's this one fight scene that they do in all one shot.  And it's just absolutely brilliant.  They did a really, really good job.  And it ties into the other Marvel movies and TV shows.  And it's it's really good.  If you if you have time to watch it, you definitely should.  It's a must watch.  I agree.  Even if you don't like Marvel.

Start time: 529.00
End time: 555.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not like any of the other Marvel stuff.  It's a TV MA.  It's grittier.  It's darker.  It's more violent, like realistic violence instead of sort of cartoonish violence.  And what I like about it is the ramifications of the violence are not ignored.  Like if a guy gets in a fight, he's hurt afterward and in pain.  And I like that that there's a you know, violence has consequences.  And that's one of the things that happens in Daredevil.

Start time: 557.95
End time: 560.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now I have another show.  But I'm really not going to get anything.

Start time: 561.06
End time: 564.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's another thing for Ben not to watch.  You won't be disappointed.

Start time: 564.02
End time: 581.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's always days like today, like premiering Game of Thrones.  I always have like a wince of regret, like, oh, it'd be cool.  We're like the big things happen.  But now the only one the one that I have kind of kept up on is Mad Men.  So I have that for it, too.

Start time: 582.16
End time: 596.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's kind of even more incomprehensible this year.  This season, I can't figure out what the hell's going on.  But I do like the style.  I like the era.  I like the period.  So Daredevil, when did it come out?  Friday.  It was Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So now I have to watch Daredevil.  Yeah, so a lot of Twitter chatter about it.  People saying it's darker than the Dark Knight is really good.  And I don't know what they're talking about.  Twitter is great for the keeping up, though, on what the in crowd is talking about.  You know there's something going on.  All right.  Let's say I've been putting off talking about the Watch.  Let's talk about the Watch.  Friday, 1201 Pacific Time.  I feel so bad for anybody who's not in California.  3 a.m. if you're on the East Coast.  Apple opened the store.  Ten minutes later, sold out.  Pretty close to. Sold out, right?  Yeah.  So I bet you, Ben, you must be following this a little bit.  Is this a lack of supply?  Unexpected demand?  An ability to produce them rapidly enough?  What's going on? We don't know, of course, but do you have a thought?

Start time: 670.44
End time: 739.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You just said my thought.  Well, we have no idea.  I mean, obviously it's some combination of women at supply and  excess demand, but that's like saying two plus two is four.  Right.  So it's I mean, it's hard to say.  I think it's clearly I mean, this is as you would expect, I guess,  from any new product from Apple.  You know, it's very much in high demand.  It's sold out everywhere, not just in not just in the U.S., also in China.  They watched in China the first week.  You know, something to keep in mind is they did that for the first time with the  this is really the first time actually, because they plan to do it with the iPhone  six, but it was delayed in China.  So, no, I mean, I'm sure Apple would prefer everyone to think that it's  massive demand, but we don't know.  It'd be interesting to see if Apple does a press release on Monday saying how  many they sold.  Is there a precedent for that?  Oh, yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. They use they often do.  And if they do, I'm sure that, you know, the interpretation would be that it's  it's it's a success to me.

Start time: 740.16
End time: 746.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Even the most expensive, the seventeen thousand dollar gold edition sold out  till June.

Start time: 747.14
End time: 750.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think there's a question of whether they were.  It said August at first when I first signed in.

Start time: 751.34
End time: 756.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It said August and then they've downgraded it to June.  You think they hadn't made any except for Katy Perry and they said that they were

Start time: 757.46
End time: 760.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  going to be later to ship the editions.

Start time: 761.04
End time: 780.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So maybe they can't crank these out.  This is this is the one I would buy if I had seventeen thousand dollars.  But who has seventeen?  So obviously somebody has seventeen thousand.  So everything across the board, as you look at the sport, the edition, the  stainless steel, almost all of them are now June, whatever June means.  I don't know if that's June 1st, June 30th.

Start time: 781.40
End time: 796.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I ordered mine 15 minutes into the order period and got it got mid May.  I got the Space Gray Sport Edition, which seems to be the nerd watch of choice.  I didn't even know that I was a stereotype.  Turns out, yeah, I'm a stereotype.  And yeah, mid May is what I got.

Start time: 797.14
End time: 833.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was I overslept and I woke up at 1209, the Apple fanatic inside me.  My eyes went, whoa.  And I ran to the computer, which I had pre-configured.  I had it all set up.  I had the app store, the Apple Store running in the app on an iPad on an iPhone  and on my computer.  I had it and I had already favorited the two that we want to get because I'm going  to get one for Lisa and one for me.  And I was very fortunate because Lisa wanted a 38 millimeter steel.  I want the 42.  The 42 back ordered as well to me.  But I got April 24th on the April 24th to May 7th.  I don't understand what that is.

Start time: 833.04
End time: 841.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's really interesting was that it went on the app store or on the on the apps.  It was available at midnight.  It didn't go up on the Web until 1208.

Start time: 842.02
End time: 844.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That happened with the iPhone as well.  It did.

Start time: 845.14
End time: 903.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It did.  And I was very mildly stressed out because one, it's not shipping in Taiwan to start.  So I have to ship it to the US first and then get shipped over.  But two, I was on the Web.  It's three in the afternoon for me.  So I'm at my desk anyway.  I'd pull up my phone and do it.  I'm curious if that was intentional to drive people to use the app more.  One that's interesting is you could pay with Apple Pay.  And I wonder if for a lot of people that is the first time using Apple Pay outside of the app store.  And it was the first time for me.  And to be frank, it was it was pretty amazing.  Like you you could have ordered the watch you wanted in like less than 15 seconds.  Seconds.  So I'm curious if that was intentional or just as an accident or what.  But I mean, for me anyway, it was effective in getting me to actually use Apple Pay to pay for a physical object.  And it was a very impressive demo.

Start time: 904.00
End time: 929.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is not the first time this is this has happened a bunch of times now.  And it seems to me that there's something in Apple's infrastructure where the store back end goes up and the app is directly hooked into that back end.  But the Web front end goes up later.  And this has happened three or four times at least to the point where it's like the open secret now that if you really want to buy an Apple product, the moment it goes on sale, use the Apple Store app on iOS.

Start time: 930.08
End time: 959.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that makes sense.  If you think about, you know, it's all API based, but the front end has to propagate.  Now, it makes sense from a tech perspective, that'd be the case.  But unfortunately, the open secret was forgotten by me.  I saw the 24th ship date, but it was funny.  I was I was very stressed out.  And also, I like for some reason, the app store is my wrong address and I can't get it to update.  So every time I order, I have to change the address.  So I was changing the address and like I was like, you get a little fumble thing.  I was like, hurry, hurry, hurry.

Start time: 969.68
End time: 1016.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I see a movie here.  Well, it's like, yeah.  So I if I had to guess, you know, there was kind of an open question whether the Apple Watch as a luxury and as a new category would sell as well as an iPhone.  And it's in the initial blush.  I think a lot of people counseled, oh, wait to the next generation.  No, don't rush.  I would guess that the demand outpaced Apple's expectations.  They the rumor, of course, to the Wall Street Journal published was that they made five or five and a half million.  I would obviously they're going to go back and make as many as they can as fast as they can.  We don't know. Maybe they made one made two.  I don't know. But my guess is they sold five million in the first minute or two.

Start time: 1016.44
End time: 1030.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, well, I think just I think just like Jason probably put a much wiser technical explanation to my my surmising about backroom thinking.  It's probably the same thing here.  I mean, the reality is, is ramping is very difficult and ramping a brand new product is even more.

Start time: 1030.00
End time: 1034.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But nobody knows how to do this better than Apple.  They've got decades now of experience.

Start time: 1035.44
End time: 1082.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure. But I mean, it doesn't change.  Like, it's like a physics problem.  Like, you can't like the speed of light is a constraint.  Like gravity is a constraint.  Like, no, it's like that when it comes to manufacturing, like there is just fundamental constraints when it comes to making and ramping a new product.  And we've never had a company of the scale of Apple, the demand that Apple generates, launch a new product ever.  I mean, because you have to remember the iPhone like Apple wasn't at all the company that it is now, even the iPad.  And whereas today just the demand for anything they sell is so overwhelming that I I'm sure that no matter if they had estimated to be 100 million sold, I bet it would still be sold out just for the very kind of the constraints that come with building a brand new product.

Start time: 1082.36
End time: 1097.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think strategically, if you're Apple, you want to release the product at a point where you can ship a decent number of them.  But you don't want to wait to the point where you can fulfill all demand anyway.  You want to you want to have some backlog, I think, because otherwise you've waited too long.  I would I would say you kind of want to have that.

Start time: 1098.48
End time: 1102.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And if somebody's waving money at you, you want to take it.  They took it and then they'll give you your watch later.

Start time: 1103.12
End time: 1104.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, yeah, that's a good point.

Start time: 1105.50
End time: 1183.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the issue is that to to meet demand in like because the demand is always highest in the in the first quarter that something that's held typically.  I may be able to be the case with a new different with new product, but say an iPhone, for example, if you want to meet that demand in the first quarter, it's extremely inefficient and a very poor use your capital because the problem is all that capacity is then going to be severely underused the rest of the year.  So it's a very difficult balancing act.  I suspect actually that with the iPhone anyway, if you'll notice the the date of the physical week of the phone, what the phone looks like from a physical perspective, which almost certainly is coming from the supply chain, it's actually getting earlier and earlier every year.  So this year, the first week of the iPhone 6 was in February.  The first thing the five S was like in March because they're starting earlier and earlier.  I think that's what's happening is they're they're actually ramping earlier and earlier because they want to have us.  They don't if you build enough capacity to satisfy first quarter man, like I said, you're wasting money.  So I think they're trying to start earlier and earlier so they can have some pent up and they sold 75 million in the first quarter last year, which is insane.  Yet they still didn't meet demand.  So I mean, it's it's safe.  I mean, it's a good problem to have in some respects, but it's a problem that no one in any industry really has ever had to face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, next week.  Next week.  But I think it's going to be a review near from Apple.  I even try to order it because well, first of all, I'm not sure I want to own one in the first place.  But second of all, I think like if they really did make five million of that initial shipment, we're going to hear about it on Monday because they don't really have a precedent for like bragging about these kind of things.  There's kind of a reason why they haven't been saying those opening week and iPad numbers.  I think in the last two years, maybe correct me if I'm wrong, one of you guys.  But it's because those sales are kind of going down, whereas iPhone sales each opening weekend is bigger than the previous year.  This if they can sell five million.  Wow, that's more than any other smartwatch maker has made ever.  Pebble has only sold about a million, I think.  Seven hundred thousand Android wears in the first six or seven.  That's nothing. That's peanuts.  And if they can do five million in one weekend, that's insane.  And they've already proven they have a market for this thing.  But moving forward, we're not going to really know.  They've already said they're going to lump these reports and with that other category with Apple TV and a bunch of other junk.  So, you know, we'll get a sense from third parties and stuff how well this thing is doing.  But it will be really interesting to see if they have that press release tomorrow.  So talking about opening weekend sales and preorders.

And yet, oh, yeah, triumph of Apple's marketing is they it doesn't matter.  They're going to sell out no matter what.

Transcript:  Yeah. If you look feature for feature, what this watch can do versus Android Wear.  I mean, the features are very similar. You can talk into it.  You get notifications. It buzzes you.  It looks a lot better than the other watches.  And it has that status of what's more expensive.  You know, it feels premium.  But as far as feature for feature, what it can do, there's not that use case like Android Wear  has proven the use case. And this it's too early to judge.  But, you know, this hasn't proven it either.  Maybe once you know, because it's Apple and it's a triumph of marketing.  Like you said, people will find that use case.  But right now, you know, even Apple's big kind of mushy on that messaging.  Why do you need this thing?  You know, there's that big thing in wired that I know Ben wasn't a big fan of that piece.  But, you know, that said, it's OK.  It helps you not look at your phone so much.  And that kind of came from Apple.  It was still not clear if that's Apple's real mission with this thing or is it just a, you know, a status symbol of, like you said, marketing?

Transcript:  Wait, so let me understand this.  So on one hand, it's Apple's marketing.  On the other hand, Apple is bad at articulating what it's good for.  No, I'm not saying they're bad at articulating what it's good for.  No, this is the tiredest trope when it comes to Apple ever that Apple sells stuff because of good marketing when it matches feature for feature.  I mean, it's like saying why are why can you sell a MacBook that's more expensive like the one sitting in front of Jason?  What is it?  Thirteen hundred thirteen hundred dollar computer that's underpowered and low featured and only has one port.  Like at some point, like when do we put this argument to bed that Apple sells stuff because of marketing and actually consider that maybe there's other factors going on?  I mean, for the marketing might not be the right word.

Transcript:  I think I mean, Apple has has built up a very loyal customer base.  No question.  We're we're I don't think anyone would deny that.  And the reason why they built that up, I would argue, is they've delivered a superior user experience for their products relative to competition.  The problem with the user experience is something that doesn't go on a feature sheet.  It's not something you can check off and compare next to each other.  I mean, you started out when I jumped on top of the Samsung edge.  I mean, why is why is Samsung losing the high end to Apple?  It's not because of features.  And given that people Apple has got has people trust Apple like they trust that they buy an Apple products are going to be satisfied with it.  And now Apple can trade in on that trust.  People will buy the watch regardless of what because that's a good point.  This is this is the culmination of reputation years of reputation.

Transcript:  It's like saying that there's you know, people are going to go see a Disney movie.  That's not first off, that's earned.  Disney earns that label.  And second, if they spend too much time not delivering what the promise is, then people will stop going.  But there is that truth that you can have a brand that has that attachment to it.  And I think that's what we see with Apple is is part of this is, yes, people are buying it because it's an Apple product.  But Apple has earned a lot of that brand loyalty because of the products that they released up to now.  They're buying it on faith.  I think there is a certain degree.  You know, I hate the faith based metaphors for Apple, but I think in this case you got it right, which is a product in a new category.  You are there is trust that I think a lot of people are putting an Apple that this will be a great product, even though they may not know quite what they're going to do with it because it's from Apple and they they have some trust there.  And that trust could easily be harmed if it doesn't live up to to the to the hype.  That's true.

They're for whatever reason they're buying into.  Look at people bought windows for years, even though it was a horrible operating system.  But that's what you bought.  That's what everybody bought.  You buy a PC, you're going to buy windows.  You buy a phone, you're going to buy an iPhone.  It's just the default.  It's not that they're dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dark times.  The odds.  I mean, like the reality is, is until the Internet came along and most of our applications moved to the Internet, you there was just lots of stuff you literally could not do on on a Mac.  And user experience aside, and that was changed with the Internet, which made it which remove that kind of like gate.  Like there's there's there's there's two different things when it comes to features.  Some stuff is like it's a reason to buy.  And then there's stuff that's a reason not to buy.  And the reason not to buy, if you have it there, it's devastating.  Like Windows Phone, for example, like not having a competitive set of apps.  And even if you have to do have, they're all inferior.  That's a reason to not buy.  It doesn't matter how good user experience is, how how delightful it is to use our if you use all Microsoft services, you're not going to even consider it because there's a gate there.  And that was the same thing when it came to when it came to the Mac.  And to say that people were buying Windows because they were sheep.  I think that's insulting to people.  The reality is, is most people aren't tech people.  They're not sitting around weighing the stuff.  They have stuff they want to get done.  And people, and in my experience, anecdotally, but normal people who aren't technical at all consistently find it's easier to go about their day and it's less frustrating.  And they can do what they want to do more easily and consistently on an iPhone.  And I agree with you in the 90s.

Transcript:  But I, you know, again, I think objectively you could see that there are for different people, different operating systems and platforms could be of value to them.  And I don't think an alien that came down from outer space would necessarily look at the at the Android ecosystem and say that is clearly better.  I think that it would depend on what that alien's personal preferences were and how they wanted to use their phone.  Because I look at Android.  Also, we've got to say the difference between a platform and a product where the iPhone has been such a well, I think I think I think you could argue that the Galaxy S6 is one of the few.  And in fact, as Ben mentioned, Samsung changing its approach and pulling lots of features out of the Galaxy in order to create a product that by all accounts is way closer to what Apple has been doing with hardware and that and that people really like it.  But a lot of these products aren't there.  A lot of the Android experiences aren't that good.  And so, you know, it's not just the operating system platform.  It's also the hardware.  And Apple has excelled at that for quite a while now.  And only now are we seeing some Android phones that that can match it.

It was it was there was a learning curve there.  But it is it is fascinating.  It was actually it'll be interesting to see how that changes the feel of Apple stores because now they've got those big tables for the Apple watch right in the middle there.

But it does lead to I think some places where people say, well,  you know, it didn't wake up and show me the time fast enough and it didn't sync with the phone fast enough.  And I think those are all decisions that Apple had to make in order to get it through the day.  But if you can't get it through the day, there's no point in having that product.

Transcript:  So it's interesting. You mentioned that, Leo, because I'm not sure that I'm very curious to see how the S6 sells because one reason to think that why objectively Android is superior in your words is there's no question.  The US is much more flexible, much more customizable.  You can arrange things more to your liking.  But I think if you're dealing in a premium product where someone's paying several hundred dollars for a phone and they are buying it because they value that customization and flexibility, I would assume they probably value it in the hardware as well.  And I think this is actually an advantage that Samsung actually always had over HTC, for example.  HTC has been making beautiful phones for a while and it hasn't exactly helped them that much.  And I think that someone who values that in their operating system, I think is more likely to value that in the hardware, to be able to switch batteries, to be able to have the expandable storage, things like that.  And it's interesting to hear you say that you're disappointed that they prioritize the industrial design or the aesthetic, I should say, over the rest of it.  Because I kind of suspect there's a lot of people that are going to think that way.  So it'll be interesting to see how it sells.

Transcript:  It's a pretty spectacular shift for Samsung, which was making utilitarian industrial design phones like the Note 4, which I was carrying prior to this.  I'm not a Samsung fan, by the way. I thought the S5 was awful.  I've been very disappointed by the junk where Samsung's been lading into its Android.  And yet this phone is easily the most beautiful phone I've ever held.  This is the Edge, so it's got the Infinity screen.  I wish I had the Infinity battery life, but unfortunately not.

Transcript:  Did you read Kushal Dave's Medium piece?  This is very interesting.  He said, I did not write this piece until I was no longer working for a company because I know Apple app developers do not want to speak out about this because they're afraid of getting slapped down by Apple.  He says, and I completely agree with him, that the review process in the app store is hurting users partly because bug fixes are way delayed by weeks, partly because Apple has decided to be a nanny and prohibit all sorts of apps that we should be able to see.  We're not four-year-olds.  And I'm not just talking about adult content, but political content, all kinds of content.  Apple is blocking apps that ridicule public figures, that show too much skin, apps with jobs themes, legal marijuana information, gun images, search engines, drones.  Steve Jobs once argued he was actually offering us freedom, freedom from porn.  Apple says, if you want to criticize a religion, write a book.  I think Apple's putting itself in a very interesting position here.  Obviously, again, people don't care.  So they sold 75 million phones.  Whoops.  I don't know where that's what I'm getting there.  There we go.  But this is a strong, I think a strong indictment of Apple as a gatekeeper, as a bad, frankly, steward of the app store because it's so hard to get bug fixes out.  So hard to test apps.  Anyway, I'm not I'm not here to bash Apple.  Actually, I wasn't intending to do that.

Start time: 2790.00
End time: 2836.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I think there's a bunch of things in this piece.  A lot of this is not new at all.  This is a lot of this is fundamentally just absolutely just complaining about app store moderation policies that a lot of them have been in place since Steve Jobs was making those rules.  Right.  I do think there's some interesting things in there about how the backlog in the present day, the backlog creates issues where it's hard to get bug fixes out.  I've heard from developers who said that they have some updates that are sort of just a few nice to have features, but not major features, and they don't bother to release them because they don't want to go through the process.  And I think if you're going to be Apple and say we're going to watch everything that gets submitted, there's some responsibility you have to take to get the backlog down.  You've got to find a way to make it so that your developers aren't spending weeks waiting for their apps to get out.

Start time: 2836.48

Transcript:  Also kind of arbitrary enforcement of the rules.  It's never clear whether your app is going to get approved or not.

Start time: 2841.10
End time: 2914.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We learned this.  So a good friend of mine is a developer of an app that got approved and then told to be removed.  It was applauded and featured on the store.  And then some other part of Apple said, no, no, no, we don't want you to do that.  And that happens sometimes.  And I think that a bunch of things are going on here.  I think Steve Jobs was a real key figure in defining what the rules were.  And with him gone, Apple is willing to change.  But there are parts of Apple that are changing and other parts that are not changing as quickly, if at all.  And so there are I think inside Apple, there's conflict.  And when Apple is a black box like it is, it's very hard.  You end up with these bizarre behaviors of like they say they say yes and they say we'll feature you.  And then they say, please take it out of the store, which doesn't make any sense.  It is absolutely problematic.  I think the idea that comes from Steve Jobs of we need to make the app store someplace that if it's not really appropriate for the lowest common denominator of essentially a child, we need to keep it out of the store is also probably kind of kind of crazy.  Now, I am optimistic that Apple is changing and that this is going to their approach is going to change here.  But right now it's kind of a mess.  And I think that's because there are parts of Apple that want to change and other parts that don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead.  One thing one more thing on this point.  And I you said you didn't come out of Bash Apple.  I didn't come out to defend Apple.  But I think first off, I completely agree with both of you and with with Jason's point that there are significant issues at the app store process.  I think this is something I've been consistently very critical of Apple about, not just from the the randomness of it,  but also the fact that I think they're hurting themselves by not enabling sustainable businesses.  And I think Jason's point about there being we look at Apple's being a monolith, but there is different factions within Apple.  And there's parts of Apple that are still very much connected to the old the old Apple, as it were.  And one of those sections is app review.  If you look at where it sits in organization, that organization is still kind of the old Apple.  That said, I thought this article was disappointing.  It was disappointing primarily for the title.  Apple's app store review process hurting users.  It is hurting users in a by extension sort of thing.  It's hurting developers and and by developers being hurt and not releasing updates and things like that, users are certainly hurt.  The issue, though, is nowhere in this article does it acknowledge the way that the app store and Apple's stringent control.  And again, the trust that people have in Apple has fundamentally changed the way that users think about software and think about apps.  To go back to Windows, people were scared.  They were scared to download stuff. No one would do it.  And the app store and this process completely changed the way people approached it, both helping users and helping developers, frankly.  And I think that there is an issue here where, yes, absolutely believe there are things that Apple needs to change.  Absolutely believe it could be better.  I, again, criticize them consistently on this point.  But I think without acknowledging the the real benefits that are here and the benefit it has to normal people, it does this argument a disservice.  And I wish that would have included that kind of it goes too far in saying that that user I think on balance users benefit from app review.  And without at least acknowledging that balance, I think it it makes the argument weaker than there ought to be.  There's absolutely a lot of good points in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There there is. I mean, Apple does provide an additional layer of scrutiny here.  There's malware on all the app stores, I might add.  It's very hard. There's a lot less of it on the Apple store because they do scan and have people checking.  You know, it can get through and then they run the kill switch on it.  But I think there's a lot less of it.

Start time: 3106.68
End time: 3207.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What and beyond that, I think the way that the the apps are sandboxed much more aggressively on on iOS, perhaps leading to your constipation, Leo,  like you can't really hurt your phone by downloading it from the app store.  And I'm not sure you can say the same thing about about Android, at least previously.  I know they've instituted a new level of control in the last couple of months.  But that like I think again, it's kind of this mushy hand wavy sort of stuff.  But that like that's how Apple gets trust.  Like people feel safe using an iPhone. They feel like everything's going to be OK.  They can just download stuff and delete it. And it doesn't.  And it's it's going to still work OK.  And that accumulated over time is why Apple keeps a profit margin.  It's why they sell the watch on the first weekend.  And I think it matters. It's not marketing. It's not people being brainwashed.  It's that like people don't want to be techies.  They just want to live their life and have something that helps them do it better.  And and apples are in the trust that they're going to help them do better than other brands will.  And the reason I argue about this is not again, I don't own any Apple stock.  I don't want to be a defender.  But I think that a core thing that I think business analysis is strategy.  Why they get Apple wrong a lot is they don't value this sort of middle, this gray area, this this consumer psychology aspect.  And user experience aspect. I think Apple excels at and I think that makes it hard to understand why the company does so well.  And it's why people get the predictions wrong all the time.  Yeah. Yeah, I didn't think I just find it intellectually fascinating.  And that's why I that's why I like getting any different than saying making a great brand like a Burberry raincoat,

Start time: 3209.22
End time: 3281.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  which isn't demonstrably better than some other brand raincoat, but sell out, sells it because the brand is better.  Isn't it like that? I mean, isn't it just saying, well, there's not, you know, I come from a background of celebrating technical excellence, not marketing excellence.  And I think Apple has clearly got marketing excellence behind it 100 percent.  But I'm not convinced that that reflects a technical excellence, to be honest, at this point anymore.  Well, I mean, let's talk about 10.10.3, because I think this is a little frustrating.  There is a there is a back door vulnerability that 10.10.3 is vulnerable to Apple has patched it or 10 that all iOS actually always 10 is vulnerable to Apple has patched it in 10.10.3 this route pipe.  But they have decided that it's too hard to fix it in previous versions of OS 10, meaning that millions of Apple Macintosh users are vulnerable to it.  It is an escalation back door. It's actually an API that was put in there by Apple and allows escalation to root privileges from any user account in the system.  Maybe it's not maybe it's not a real threat. I don't know.  But the fact that Apple's patching it only on the latest version of their operating system seems to me not great.  Then there's the iCloud.

Start time: 3282.16
End time: 3307.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You got to keep in mind that Apple's actually spent the last couple of versions of OS 10 not pushing the compatibility forward.  So there's a huge number of existing Macs.  Almost every Mac made since 2009 and a lot of them from 2008.  And in fact, IMAX from 2007 can run the current version of the operating system.  So yeah, they would have to update for free.  But there are other reasons.  We had somebody in the audience today who runs some specialized sign makers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I appreciate you bringing this up, Leo, because now I can hopefully prove that my not not all completely in the back for Apple.  I think this is I think this is a very poor decision.  And frankly, I think Apple's security record, in particular with OS 10, is getting worse, not better.  And it's never been particularly great.  And and I think it's it's a bit of a dangerous game.  I can understand Jason's point like like they're offering the updates for free.  They go back a long ways.  Like, why aren't you up to date?  There are reasons to there are reasons, particularly in some professional contexts where you're dealing with certain kinds of specialized software and stuff where you might not be up to date.  And it just doesn't seem something that yes, there's a bad like that.  What's the old thing?  Apple prioritized one Apple, two users and like three three developers in that order.  This seems to be taking the prioritizing Apple and what makes life easier for them a little too far.  Unfortunately, it's it's part of a pattern of Apple being slow with updates and and not as far reaching as they probably should.  And it's a dangerous game because it messes with that trust.  Like if if if someone has an issue here and because Apple wasn't aggressive updating it like that's that's a problem.  And I was disappointed and sadly not that surprised by by this news.

Start time: 3415.58
End time: 3443.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I should say my point is that it could have been worse because at least you can update many systems for free.  But, you know, in Macworld, we had a system that was still running Snow Leopard because there was specific software that didn't even run on Lion, let alone Mountain Lion or Mavericks or Yosemite.  So it does it absolutely does happen.  And Apple's security record has not been great.  How do you like the MacBook?  I like a lot about it.  I love the screen. I love the lightness.  I love the force touch trackpad and I don't like the keyboard.

Start time: 3444.22

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, I admire their willingness to really strike out.  I mean, I don't mean not strike out in the baseball way, but to venture force.  Yes.  And try something new.  And remember when the air came out, everybody on the Intel side, including Intel itself, imitated.  And so, you know, it's an interesting thing to make a device that has one connector has, you know, nothing else is very light.  I was just holding it.  It's amazingly light.  You don't like the keyboard, but I see I thought the keyboard was OK.  I've read different opinions.  It depends on how it depends on how you feel.

Start time: 3479.40
End time: 3526.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Some people have very strong opinions about keyboards.  Keyboards are very personal.  And they are.  And this one has a lot less keyboard travel.  So that's the amount of space that the key depresses when you press it.  It's about I'd say like between a third and a half of the travel spring really feels nice.  So that's what they've done to make up for the reduced physical movement because they need to make this as thin as possible is they've got the new the new butterfly switch.  They've got the stainless steel pad at the bottom.  It's clicky.  The keys are wider.  They're more stable.  I mean, there are all these other things they've done to make up for the fact that when you hit it, it doesn't move very much.  For me, I just don't like that reduced travel, even with all of those other changes.  To me, it's like a halfway point between typing on glass on a touch screen and typing on a traditional keyboard.  It's like a little bit better than on a touch screen where there's no feedback, but it's not that far away.

Start time: 3526.00
End time: 3547.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've used ultra thin notebooks.  The ACS 7, which I love, Windows machine, also had a keyboard that was very difficult to type accurately with because it had so little travel.  They fixed it in the second generation, the Haswell generation.  I feel like this is better than that.  But I haven't used it for that long.  So I'll have to try it for a little bit longer.  How about speed?  Because that's the other concern.  It's a Core-M processor.

Start time: 3548.10
End time: 3591.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's about as fast as a MacBook Air from 2011.  And if you're somebody who cares about speed, it's going to be an issue.  But the fact is, I think most people don't use the processor speed they've got.  And the SSD really makes up for a lot of that because so much of what we think of as computer speed is actually slow disk.  And now the biggest upgrade I ever made in a computer was when I went to an SSD only system for the first time.  Because then you realize, oh my God, I was waiting for disk that entire time.  And now when I use a computer that's still got a spinning disk in it, it makes me very sad.  So that makes up for a lot of the a lot of the ills of the Core-M being slow.  That said, if you're somebody who's like rendering video, it's a bad idea.  Don't render video on a MacBook.  I don't recommend it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Jason, who do you think should buy this?  I mean, it still costs more than a MacBook Air.  And I mean, you're paying for design and a retina screen.  Well, you're less battery life.  I like the red.  You're paying for the redness screen.

Start time: 3603.32
End time: 3667.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is basically a MacBook Air with a redness screen.  And you're paying what you'd pay for the MacBook Pro 13.  And what you're getting is something that's not as powerful, but it's thinner and lighter.  And it's a matter of priorities.  I mean, Apple now is making three different lines.  They've essentially got five computer models, laptop models.  So you've got to pick, you know, do you want cheaper but no retina?  Do you want more full featured and powerful with retina but heavier?  Or do you want something that's not very powerful but has retina and is super thin and light?  You know, pick two of these things.  So I think for a lot of people who want that retina display and don't really care that it's not super powerful  because they're not going to use that superpower anyway, I think it makes sense.  In the end, this is going to be the new MacBook Air, essentially, right?  The Air is around because they can make a non-retina laptop for less than a thousand.  And you can't really make, Apple can't sell a retina MacBook for less than a thousand yet.  And so that's why it's still around.  But I think that's, I think it's, you know, today it is of limited appeal.  And in six months, it'll be more appealing.  And in a year, it'll be even more appealing, especially as the USB-C stuff starts to come out.  I love it. Type-C.

But again, anecdotally, I've talked to people and like looking at, you know,  not to use the tiredest cliché in the book, looking at how my wife uses her computer, for example.  I don't think most people plug anything into their computers ever.  I mean, phone, like they're made...  But we're unusual.  But we're unusual, yeah.  I mean, I think for, especially in the big difference here is that most people's camera is their phone.  And now that that is the case, that was kind of the last thing that people plugged in regularly.  And now having the USB-C being kind of like an emergency hatch where there's a port if you need it,  the expectations, you don't use it most of the time.  I think that's going to be totally fine for the majority of people.  Again, I would only buy one if I had a separate desktop computer, like I know Jason has an iMac.  Exactly.  Right.  But I think for the majority of people though, it's perfectly fine as their normal computer.  And I think it's going to... I think Jason's right.  The MacBook Air still exists because they can't get it under $1,000.  But I think it's going to be more successful than people think.  It's sold out, right?  It's spectacular in person.  It's backwarded, right?  Yeah.  Again, it's hard to tell with the new processor.

There's a whole class of people who just don't care about all that.  And they want it thin and light and they want the pretty retina screen and it's got all of that.  It's so light.  You know, there are a lot of nice things about it.  I just say I think we're going to...  All of our concerns about it are going to fall away over time.  And then, you know, just like with the Air in two or three years, we're going to say,  Oh yeah, of course, it makes sense.  That's the air killer.

Looking at it and saying, Oh my God, it's so thin.  Oh, it's so light.  This screen looks remarkable.  And the screen is good too, right?  So I think that comes first for people.  And it's very easy for computer people to say, Oh, that's all just about looks.  And it's really about what's inside, right?  It's functional.  For some people, it's about looks.  It's about it.

I bought it on Google so that I could play it then on iTunes and on Voodoo  because of the Disney Anywhere thing.  Don't buy it on Amazon because then Disney Anywhere won't work.  And Disney won't have episode four, A New Hope, because that's a fox.  And it's, this is a big deal.  I don't know why it is the most recent version, not with all the new special editions, special editions.  I think I suspect it's the original originals.  Yeah. Yeah.  I got really caught up in this because we're watching.  Yeah, we're watching.  I'm going, what?  Hun shot first.  And then, and then I went to Wikipedia and I found that there's this whole movement.

And so it was a high res version that they use.  So they took all of these sources and this is what the video is.  It's amazing.  And of course, they're not legally available.  But the work they did, this is not like some some minor fan at it.  They have this guy's insane.  It is it is they color corrected at all to look like the right color palette from the original.

But when you get into changing plot details, like that's why people focus on the on the Han shot first thing, because that like changes the fundamental nature of the character.  Right.  And like that and that's why that puts the lie to Lucas's argument that, oh, this is what I always wanted to do.  Because, no, if you if you wanted Han to shoot first, you would have had or if you want Han to shoot second, you would have him shoot second.  But you didn't.  You had him first.  I think.  Right. Exactly.  If he had only done the extra stuff, I think people would still complain.  I think a lot of us, including myself, like, you know, get over it.  It's still the same movie.

Start time: 4482.58
End time: 4530.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's these certain specialized companies that they give full access.  They call it the fire hose to literally every tweet and every favorite and everything that goes into that we input into Twitter.  And different companies do really cool stuff with it.  Not anymore.  Not anymore.  They're very restrictive of who they let have that data.  And sometimes they buy the companies that do really interesting stuff with that data like.  Like, um, that was the last one.  And so it's not unusual.  They've been doing this.  I think this company has been doing a lot of social media analytics and now they're boosting up their Facebook business instead of Twitter, which probably makes more sense.  More people on Facebook anyway.  But I think the fire hose is interesting.  There are a lot of cool companies doing cool stuff.  My favorite just as a journalist and a news junkie is Data Miner.  Have you heard of them?

So basically if someone tweets about a tornado hitting or some kind of disaster or anything like that, journalists who are on Data Miner can get like instant alerts for those kind of things.  And we at Business Insider have actually like been the first on some stories because we get alerted to that kind of stuff.  It's a really cool product and just shows the power some of these companies can have when they have that fire hose of Twitter lets them.

Start time: 4562.79
End time: 4624.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twitter said they're not going to let anybody have the fire hose anymore.  They've got their own internal analytics since the acquisition of Gnip.  And they're just it just shows.  I mean, I feel bad for these data sift.  I think is one of them and the other going to shift over to mining analytics from Facebook.  But I have to think that their customers are going to be a little unhappy when data sift gets cut off in a month and no longer will you get those those insights.  Not not only will their customers be unhappy, their investors, they've raised 78 million dollars to date.  And I think you got to think that company is a lot less valuable and all of a sudden.  I feel bad because I feel like Twitter made its bones by having these open platform and letting people do stuff with it.  And that's one of the reasons Twitter got so good.  And now that they're successful, they're going to pull up the ramp and say, OK, we'll take it from here.

Start time: 4625.42
End time: 4736.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the issue is Twitter isn't that successful.  I mean, it's it's a phenomenal service.  There's I've ever done with the company.  I reiterate this, but there's no there's no tech product or service that's more important to me personally.  Like I would gladly trade away my iPhone and and my Mac for a Windows computer and Android phone and with Twitter as opposed to the opposite.  That said, there's in realistically and the reason why it's so great for me is also what makes it so valuable is that it understands me, understands my interests.  Like this idea of there being an interest graph as opposed to a social graph is super powerful.  And and quite frankly, if you're an advertiser, you want to connect to me, Twitter is the best way to do it.  And that's why Twitter is monetizing quite well.  The problem is, there just aren't that many people on Twitter.  I mean, the the official count is is two hundred and fifty million or something like that.  I think there is strong reason to believe the actual number of regular users is significantly less than that.  And that's a problem for them.  And so I think what you see and will continue to see and from a business perspective, justifiably so, is them pulling in all potential money making avenues.  And this is one of them to be frank, probably in 2012 when they when they cut off the access for third party Twitter clients.  Oh, but you can still do this other stuff.  They they should have ripped the band-aid completely off and pulled it all in house.  If you're going to if you're going to screw developers, screw them all at once instead of, you know, kind of dribbling it out over over the years.  But I think it's a business kind of imperative for Twitter as and I agree with you, there's no question that Twitter was built on the back of third party developers.  But I think it's just a reality of of their business that they they have to do this.

And they've apparently, according to TechCrunch, Twitter's been contacting celebrities who use Meerkat, trying to convince them that Meerkat is dying and they should use Periscope instead.  Sources also say Twitter has been in touch with media companies that use Meerkat going so far as to apply.  If they don't exclusively use Periscope, Twitter could cut off their access to Amplify, which is some sort of thing that magical.  Secret Twitter thing.  Twitter thing.

I don't know if that's the audience you want to be showing.  You know, it's still a bunch of tech journalists using it. I don't know if that's how you should premiere your next music video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They do something similar. They have their stories.  Right.  They call it live. It's not like directly live.  But those seem to be more popular because they show it's like a curation of stuff, either like Coachella or, you know, Final Four or stuff in your neighborhood.  That stuff seems to be doing really well because it's really nicely curated.  It's not as raw as just a straight up live stream.

Start time: 4882.88
End time: 4954.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think, yeah, I think big picture looking at Snapchat versus Periscope or whatever is going to be akin to like Facebook versus Twitter.  Like one is just bigger and more meaningful generally.  But the reason why Twitter kind of had no choice but to, you know, pull the knives on Meerkat is one thing that Twitter does better than anyone else and has always been better is the real time stuff when something is happening.  And and the issue is that video is that much more is infinitely more powerful than text when it comes to relaying something happening real time.  And Twitter has to own that space.  That's a core value of Twitter that Twitter does that nobody else does.  And Meerkat was very threatening.  Again, not because it's had a ton of users, but it had the potential to unbundle kind of a core part of that of what Twitter is.  And and it was very fortuitous or strategic or smart or whatever adjective you want to use.  That Twitter acquired Periscope when it did and that it was ready to be released when it did.  And I would expect them to continue to be very aggressive.  Jason, we've lost you, Jason.

Transcript:  Twitter is such a mixed bag because on the one hand, it's a cesspool.  And on the other hand, it is really a valuable signaling mechanism.  When Twitter first came out, somebody like and I don't really understand.  Sadly, it's signaling.  It's signaling maybe.  You know, suck.  Well, but somebody like it to a dial tone, an Internet dial tone.  And I think it's kind of that.

Transcript:  So what makes Twitter great is this asymmetry where I can a random person can ask me a question and I can answer it on Twitter.  And I love that.  The problem is that a random wacko can say things to me on Twitter, too.  And I have to listen to that at least until I block them.  So it is it's funny because I love it.  And yet I am and my friends and I, my colleagues in this industry are increasingly realizing that there's some stuff that you got to keep personal.  And Marco Arment on his accidental tech podcast this week, they were talking about the same thing.  And I've seen this in other places, too.  A lot of the dark social stuff, you know, private social groups, things like Slack channels where you retreat because you know where you're going to be.  And on one level, it's a real shame that people who have followings and who like interacting with people on Twitter have to retreat for some of that stuff because you're losing interesting conversations you might have.  At the same time, you know, people are are only human beings.  And the toll of dealing with some of the people you end up dealing with on Twitter becomes so great that you take some of your stuff and you put it behind the personal shield and say, I'm just not going to share this with people I don't know anymore.  And I think that's an issue for Twitter.  Is that a problem for Twitter?  I think to a certain degree it is because if you're somebody who's got 50,000 followers or a million followers or whatever, you need ways you either you either need to be able to manage what you see or you need to just give up interacting and become just a broadcaster.  And I would hope that Twitter sees some value in providing tools for those people to be able to stay in the mix on Twitter without dealing with the craziness.  I mean, if you're a verified user, I think you get a few more features in terms of like only seeing what is it only seeing people you follow and the tailored view and stuff like that.

End time: 5184.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I think one of the problems is if you lose sight of the fact that there are flies on the wall, that that's a mistake because you have to realize you are in public and you are having a conversation in public.  And if it's a conversation you're not comfortable having in public, you shouldn't have it in public.  And I think that's just one of those social media lessons that we all have to keep learning.  But I think Twitter has great value.  I just you know, I think it's what I use it for has changed over time.  Yeah.

That's a problem.  Right.  But we did a Meerkat stream when I was on Mac Break Weekly with you a few weeks ago.  It was fun.  And it was literally like the after show behind the scenes.  And that was actually kind of a lot of fun.  But, you know, for every one of those, there's one where it's just like there's no point.  And why are you even doing this?  It's a new medium.

Transcript:  I think and this is why I think this criticism of it is misplaced.  I mean, because remember the Christmas Twitter at the beginning was I don't care if we're waiting for breakfast.  Right.  It takes a while for the content that resonates to get figured out and to get out there.  I think that would be the case for Meerkat and Periscope.  But there's man it's incredible.  First time I used it, I think actually was with Jason at the at the watch event.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It was just the idea that there's there's hundreds of people all over the world.  It's incredible.  It's really there's clearly something there.  It will take time for to figure it out and to kind of distill it.  But no, there's clearly something very, very powerful there.

Transcript:  I found it interesting on the launch day of Periscope that explosion happened in these villas.  It was so convenient.  And right away, people I mean, the first thing people did was start periscoping it, not Meerkat periscoping it.  And, you know, at BI, that's kind of we gathered a lot of stuff from there because people immediately started filming this thing.  It was kind of like when that jet crashed into the Hudson River, you know, people took a Twitter and someone said a twit pic or whatever right away.  And that went up.  It became like this defining moment.  I don't know if this is Periscope's defining moment or something, but it was very interesting that instead of photos, we started getting this live streaming video as these buildings are burning down.  And that was really interesting to me.

Transcript:  Thank you, Pixel Punisher.  Whoever you may be.  Facebook apparently is not dominated by old farts like me, but in fact, teenagers are still using it.  What a relief that must be to Facebook.  This is an article in Recode by Kurt Wagner.  I felt like Facebook was for your parents, right?  Not my parents, obviously, but actually my parents are on Facebook.  But Facebook was not for the teenagers.  But Pew Research on Thursday released a study that found that despite a dip in total teen users from a few years back, Facebook is still far and away the most popular network among teenagers.  71% of teens, 13 to 17, use the service.

And she merely all she did was put it on Facebook.  I'm going to be in New York.  And every night she went out to dinner.  She saw friends.  There's a real value to that.  And I think that's probably why a lot of people still use Facebook is for that kind of interaction.

Transcript:  This idea that like anyone's going to only ever use one social network has been flawed from the beginning.  And the reality is, is Facebook is so embedded that like Facebook is the Rolodex of the world.  And it doesn't matter how fuddy duddy people think it is or their parents are like everyone is going to be on it.  And that's why one of the many reasons why I think the service is, strangely enough, still underrated by a lot of people in tech in particular.  It's it's enmeshed in people's lives.  Like every country you look at, they may have different messaging services or different things, but it's always and Facebook like the ones that are actually used.  So I hate Facebook so much.  Don't.  It's you're stuck with it.  Sorry.  I know.  Another one where I guess they have good marketing and it's objective.

And I think that's the best and I know it started on the outside, but the idea that  Facebook can have other apps that have their own ecosystems.  And I think that's they're so smart.  And, you know, in the end, that is seems to be the place that links all the people.  Facebook won't rest until everybody on the planet is on Facebook.  Right.

But I think the value in Twitter is not necessarily the 140 character thing.  I think I'm actually a writer this week.  I'm going to cover all this stuff.  So you everyone's in a preview.  But the the the value in Twitter is the people that are on Twitter and the people that I'm  connected with.  Right.

The fact that you can't have a real conversation on Twitter because it gets all these people  get clogged into it and at reply and you end up having like these three word responses.  It's ridiculous.  I mean, it's it.  And this is kind of the big concern with the company pulling in more and more feet, you  know, like parts of the surface into itself is the company has really yet to demonstrate  any capability of of of evolving the product in a meaningful way.  To be perfectly frank, I would love to have the Facebook feature set.  But with Twitter people and Twitter is miles away from that.  I mean, even like Sina Weibo, the Chinese one, which was kind of big for a while, it's  really gotten destroyed by WeChat.  But they've had a conversation threaded type view within a Twitter type user experience  for a long time now.  And it's it's a Twitter like I guess the depth of your your love for a company will be reflected  or love for a product and will be reflecting your frustration at it not being better.  Yeah, that's certainly the case for me and Twitter.  Yep.

It sounds like, oh, I'm going to print stamps.  Oh, no, no.  Oh, no, no.  It's so much more than that.  You not.  Yes, you can buy and print official U.S. postage right from your computer with your printer  and no special links or postage meter needed.  But you can also it's really more about fulfillment, about shipping.  It can give your small business a more professional look.  I can't tell you how often I get eBay or Etsy packages.  They look like a monkey wrapped them and they, you know, like a hundred stamps on there.  And it's the address is drawn in crayon.  It doesn't take anything to do it with Stamps.com.  Make your packages beautiful.  People go, wow, I really trust this.  This is a big company.  Barcoded postage, return and delivery addresses all printed automatically on a mailing label  with a Stamps.com with your logo and the Stamps.com barcode.  It makes it so easy.  Makes it look professional.  You always have exactly the right postage because of the great digital scale you get.  It's so much better.  You can print directly on envelopes with your company's logo.  It is professional.  This is the way to do it.  For shipping labels, you can put your logo on it too.  You also get discounts you don't get at the post office on certified mail.  You can, if you're sending stuff out with confirmations,  you can send an email along with it saying, here comes your package.  International Customs forms automatically filled out.  It is just so great.  No long-term lease, no hidden fees, no expensive postage meter ink.  The postage rates are always kept up to date.  It's just great.  Stamps.com.  Do everything you do at the post office and then just hand the package to your mail carrier  and that's it.  You're done.  There's even a button on the Stamps.com site that says, get the mail carrier out here.  No wonder half a million small businesses, including ours, are using Stamps.com.  I want you to try it.  Go to Stamps.com.  That microphone in the upper right-hand corner, that's for you.  It says podcast listeners.  Click here and make sure you type in the offer code, TWIT, promo code TWIT, T-W-I-T.  And you're going to get a very nice offer, a $110 bonus offer.  We've talked about this before.  It includes that digital scale.  It includes $55 in free postage.  It includes a no-risk trial of Stamps.com itself.  So it's a really great deal, worth $110.  Stamps.com.  Click the microphone, enter the offer code TWIT.  We mentioned the offer code.  T-W-I-T.  We mentioned that Hillary Clinton announced her run for president in 2016 on Twitter and on YouTube.  She's also hired a longtime, well-respected Google executive to oversee her campaign.  The CTO, Stephanie Hannan, formerly Google's Director of Product Management for Civic Innovation and Social Impact,  will become the Chief Technology Officer of the Clinton campaign.  According to Democrats who are in the know,  she'll be the first woman to hold the title of CTO in a major presidential campaign.  So digital is going to be so important in the next 18 months.  It's, I feel like, critical to any campaign and critical to our democracy.

The White House has said the breach only affected an unclassified system.  However, the hackers, according to CNN, did have access to things like the nonpublic presidential schedule.  You can make them few dates.  I don't know if they had read-write access.  The White House said in October it noticed suspicious activity in the network.  The system has been shut down to allow for security upgrades.  The FBI, Secret Service, and U.S. intelligence agencies are all involved in investigating the breach.

End time: 6170.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That suggests that it might not have been as secure as it could have been to start out with.  Which perhaps it wasn't the most sophisticated attack ever.  There's a bit of a disconnect.  The presidential's private schedule, that's a pretty bad thing to have available.  So I think it is a pretty severe breach.  I question the level of sophistication relative to the level of security.  I'm sure it was sophisticated, but the rest of the excerpt doesn't suggest it was as secure as it could be.

Transcript:  Well, of course, now the head of the National Security Agency, Admiral Michael S. Rogers, is saying,  we'd like a key to all those private transactions you guys are involved in.  They're going for something called Key Escrow.  They want to require technology companies to create a digital key that could unlock any smartphone or other locked device to obtain text messages or photos.  But no one agency would have the whole key.  So you'd have to go to the FBI, CIA, and the NSA to get the whole key, I guess.

Start time: 6203.06
End time: 6300.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or go to the president's private schedule.  That's the issue.  You can create a key that cannot be hacked.  But the issue is that the key has to exist somewhere.  And if they can't secure the president's private schedule, how can they secure this key?  And once it's out there, everyone's going to want to get a hold of it.  Maybe if it stayed on one guy's computer in Wyoming.  But it's unrealistic.  I think the fundamental issue of security is the US as a government, as an institution, views security too much from an offensive perspective,  how they can use it to attack other countries or get influence from other countries.  And probably something like Stuxnet, where they disrupted the Iranian centrifuges, was...  I mean, it was a problem in that I think now the US looks at these issues as how can they leverage it from an offensive perspective  without, I think, a deep appreciation or focus on the defensive angles of it.  And you view this with this key thing.  The more you make it easier for the NSA to break in, the easier it is for it to come back the other way.  This is a two-way street. There's no one way when it comes to security.  And it's certainly very concerning.  And unfortunately, it's going to have massive impacts.  We just don't know what they are and in what direction.

Transcript:  This is the Washington Post.  One possibility, for example, might have a judge direct a company to set up a mirror account so that law enforcement conducting a criminal investigation can read text messages shortly after they've been sent.  For encrypted photos, the judge might order the company to back up the suspect's data to a company server when the phone is on and the data is unencrypted.  And then if they'd have to get a warrant and they could go look at it, no tech company in the United States is going to agree to something like this.  They'll have to be forced to do this.  It's already hurting US tech companies internationally.

Transcript:  Right. No, yeah. But I mean, from a law enforcement perspective.  And the reality is, no, this is hugely damaging to the US tech companies abroad.  And we're only starting to see the impact now of like the Snowden revelations and that sort of thing because it takes companies, it takes other countries time to build up alternatives.  But in the long run, this has absolutely hurt US companies.  Yeah.  It will continue to hurt US companies.  And the issue isn't necessarily like China per se, because the reality is China was already on a path to kind of wean itself off of US technology.  And they've had that project for a while. I think it accelerated it.  But the issue is all these other countries in the world where now once the Chinese finish building up their alternatives, they're going to go to them and there's going to be an alternative.  And the US should have no expectation of being able to hold out like we're better or anything.  I mean, there is a big brouhaha about Huawei and their routers and basically Congress basically banning them for all kinds of purposes from the US because the Chinese might spy on them.  Like that's exactly what the US does.  That's what we want to do.  Yeah, the idea that...  That's our thing.  That's our thing.  Yeah, the idea that third party ex...  We do that thing.  Oh, it's okay if we spy on you, but they're going to spy on you too.  It's such an ethnocentric or what word for it, ridiculous self-centered viewpoint.  I'm annoyed at a lot of stuff today, apparently.

Transcript:  But the fact is law enforcement, when the Miranda decision was handed down, said that they couldn't do their job if they read people their rights.  And the fact is law enforcement will find a way.  But once you give that privacy away, you're never going to get it back.  I agree.

Anyway, Don Matric left the Xbox unit at Microsoft and came to kind of rescue Zynga.  Their stock price was tanking.  You know, there are only so many Farmville games they can make.  And he didn't do it.  I mean, it's still things were just kind of chugging along.  Matric says he wanted to go back to Canada.  That's interesting.

And they've lost a lot of people. They're going to continue losing people.  And they just really haven't managed the transition to mobile or given any indication that that's going to change.  They have Zynga poker.  Yeah, which is a disaster because they updated it.  And the new version was terrible. And so they had to like re-release the old one.

They're not going to be able to find some superhero to swoop in and fix things right away.  And it's just telling of this industry, especially mobile games, it's like these one hit wonders and they IPO, they get hot for a second and then nothing.  After that, they just can't recreate that magic again.  And Zynga was a little different because they were a desktop game built within Facebook piggybacking off Facebook.  And they just they just can't adapt.

Delphi, which is, I guess, an automotive accessories company, took an Audi hatchback, loaded up with autonomous stuff.  What's nice is it doesn't look like an autonomous vehicle.  It's got the stuff hidden behind plastic panels and so just looks like a normal car.  They did have a driver in it.  Fifteen states, thirty four hundred miles.  The car did almost all the driving itself.  At the only time it was really touch and go, the driver got very nervous when they went over a metal bridge and he knew that metal was death to to these autonomous vehicles.  He just hovered his hands over the wheel, though, and never did have to take it.  It worked. The Audi SQ5 went all the way across the country.  That's it. I think we're getting closer and closer to autonomous vehicles.

Transcript:  Yeah, there's something to to this.  I think you just see it with with with AI generally is it's not going to I think it's less likely to arrive as like a finished product.  Like there was that that like the Google car that they had, you know, like no steering wheel or anything.  We that may be in the future, but it's going to come piece by piece.  And you see that already happening, right? You already have cars that can park themselves.  You have cars that on the freeway can all but drive themselves.  And there's going to be like that Tesla update. But also, I think that Mercedes has a similar system.  And so it will it will be one of those things like what there's that there's that Bill Gates quote.  It's such a great quote like you make less way less progress in two years than you expect and way more in ten than you imagine.  Right. It's something along along that lines.  I think that's going to be the same thing with self-driving cars, with with AI generally.  And and you were starting to see that play out.

Start time: 7130.12
End time: 7160.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it'll come slow. I think there's an expectation that self-driving cars are going to be one day, you know,  your local car dealer will have a self-driving car and be like, I don't know, but it's not going to happen.  It's going to it's going to creep in. We've talked about this before.  It's going to be in luxury cars as an auto drive on freeways.  And then there's going to be some sort of like campus taxi service on college campuses and things like that.  And it's going to creep into our lives to the point where it's not going to be that big a deal when the first fully auto drive vehicle happens,  because it will have been we will have all been on an auto drive vehicle in some context before.  And it won't be that big a thing.

Transcript:  Big news for podcasters. I'm going to end with this just because we have a little celebration.  I think there was a patent troll named Personal Audio.  They came to us asking they ask a million and a half dollars, I think, in license fees.  They claimed they'd invented podcasting in in 1995.  We were prepared. We hired a law firm. Adam Carolla got sued.  We didn't ever get sued. They said, OK, we said no money.  And they said, OK, well, we're going to sue you.  We never heard back from Adam Carolla got sued.  A number of big networks also got sued. Discovery, I think, got sued.  Grammar Girl was a lot of podcasts were approached by these guys.  And we contacted a law firm and we waited and watched for those papers.  One of the things the law firm said you could do, but it's a high risk strategy,  is to go back to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and try to invalidate the original patent.  They call that an interpartis motion.  The risk is if you lose, that just strengthens their their case.  They were suing in West or East Texas, where patent cases are usually very strong for the patent holder.  So, you know, we were prepared. I had a strategy.  We were going to get all the Baptist churches in Texas that do podcasts to join us for a big picnic out in the square.  The courthouse is on a square.  All the law firms that pursue these patent troll lawsuits are on the square as well in small, you know, empty offices.  So let's have a nice picnic, a little barbecue, bring all the meat ministers from all the Baptist churches, meet the jury, get to know the judge.  We don't have to. The EFF decided to go after them with the interpartis motion.  They went to the Patent and Trademark Office. We helped kick some money in.  A lot of people did. They raised money to do this.  They got some pro bono work from some big lawyers.  And the very good news is that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on April 10th invalidated the so-called podcasting patent.  This is in time for the 10 year anniversary. Yeah, thank God.  Well, you know, the first thing we do when you go to the lawyers, you say, well, should we be the real eats just purely logical business decision is, well, how much do they want and how much is it going to cost to go to court?  And of course, you may lose in court. So there's the risk that you spend a lot of money in court and then lose and still have to pay the money.  I think I'm trying to remember, but I think they asked us for a million and a half bucks.  And I thought that was odd because we were told that the defense would be about a million.  So I think the normal these guys weren't that bright.  I think normally what you want to do is ask for less than the cost of going to court would cost.  But we were prepared to do it. Adam Kroll did, in fact, have to go to court and raised a lot of money through a crowd sourcing right on.  But they dropped the suit against Adam.  And now I have a feeling they're kind of out of business, although they say, well, we're going to go we'll find some other stuff.  Yeah, it's not over completely.  But thanks to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Cyber Law Clinic at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society.  And I'm glad the Patent and Trademark Office made the right decision.

Transcript:  And that we were very involved in the finding of prior art.  And Kevin Marks, who would kind of did a lot of this early stuff, was very helpful with that as well.  Yeah. A guy named Carl Malamud, who really is a pioneer in podcasting, had a Geek of the Week online radio show he offered for download many years before this patent.  CBC and CNN also did.  So a victory.  EFS said, Unfortunately, our work to protect podcasting is not done.  Personal audio continues to seek patents related to podcasting.  We will continue to fight for podcasters.  We hope the Patent Office does not give them any more weapons to shake down small podcasters or big podcasters or any podcaster.  I want to thank you for being here, Ben.
