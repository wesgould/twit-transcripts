Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is TWIT This Week in Tech, episode 32 for November 27, 2005.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why do we have a picture of G. Gordon Lady now on the screen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not G. Gordon Lady.  That does look a little bit like Lady, though, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was taken by a Newsweek photographer a few years ago.  I think back in the spyware hype days, when everyone was all freaked out about the initial spyware stuff.  Looking around for something that I had that I could...  Let me take your picture, for God's sake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is episode, what is it, 32? 31? 32?  Who's counting?  I'm not counting.  32, I think.  32, and we are on Skype, obviously.  Let me introduce the Skypeettes.  You've already met G. Gordon Liddy, aka Steve Gibson, who is definitely no Republican.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's got my BDI staring out of the screen, looking at Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John C. Dvorak is here using his new M-Audio Fast Track, which sounds really good.  What mic are you using, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's also an M-Audio mic.  Sounds really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course, Patrick Norton, back from the races.  Back from the 1000.  He was down in Baja and had a little hard time getting back for last twit, because, what, three hours at the customs.  Did they search you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, there were forest fires near the border and some sort of parade in Tijuana that shut down the access rope we were lined up for.  So we went to Ote Mesa, where somebody lit a bunch of cars on the border on fire.  It was good.  We ended up being chased around.  We ended up following, it was actually pretty cool, we ended up following a bunch of firefighters from Tijuana.  Because a couple of guys, I was down there with the fire guys from Colorado, talked to them and they basically showed us a little firefighter courtesy and drove us around to find a couple of different on-ramps in Ote Mesa.  It's good to have connections.  It's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also here, Alex Lindsay from the Pixel Core, who is speaking to us, also probably with a pretty good mic.  What mic are you using today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm actually just using a little flex mic.  Oh, you're not using my PR-40?  No, I'm not in San Francisco.  I'm actually down in La Crocenta.  Ah, okay.  Out of LA, froze down here for the holidays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John missed this, but at the Podcast Expo, we received best podcast of the year award from the People's Choice Awards.  And then one of the prizes was this really nice mic, not expensive either, $300 mic from Bob Heil of Heil Sound, the PR-40 there top of the line.  And it sounds fantastic, but Alex has it in his cherry wood box and I've got to get it back from you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think we should just, you know, you don't have to come back to the Pixel Core anytime soon.  Yeah, he wants to keep it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I used it on Twit 30, but I'm hoping, well, here's the deal, Alex.  Okay, so I had a nice conversation with Bob Heil, who is a fascinating fella.  He told me how he invented the quadraphonic PA that the Who used in Quadrophenia.  Who is this?  His name is Bob Heil.  He's an old time rock and roll sound guy, worked for Humble Pie, the Who, the Grateful Dead, the Eagles.  And then he started making microphones and he's been, he's a ham and made ham microphones, really good ones.  But he's, the broadcast industry is discovering him.  And you know who really, where his biggest ad is, if you watch Letterman.  Did you notice about two months ago, Letterman got a new mic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I was noticing, Leo, that that's the same mic that you had at the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that mic's dead. He taps it all the time with his pencil, nothing ever comes from it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Bob told me the story about that mic. Letterman wears, as most TV people do, lavalier, you know, lapel mics.  He wears two of them in case one dies. The guest is also wearing a lav.  The problem is with the guests, they're unpredictable. They jump on the furniture, they move around.  Sometimes their mics fall off or die. If that happens, the PR-40 is live and can be turned up.  And if you know, if you look at it, it's aimed at the guest, it's not aimed at Letterman.  It's an emergency guest mic.  Also the top of the mic is hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. In fact, one of the nicest things about the mic, Leo, is it looks so good.  I mean, you know, it's perfect for like when you're doing TV stuff, because it looks like you ought to sound good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we're getting, Bob is very kindly lending us four PR-30s for our live Twits.  And a fifth mic that he made specially for me, they also make an old-  Wait, wait, wait, let's stop right there.  Yes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What?  He made specially for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And what is special about the mic?  Well, wait until you see it.  It's got like a big diaphragm for that gut-busting voice. Yours or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, it does as a matter of fact. But it's a PR-40 Guts.  But what it is, Bob has a mic that looks like an old-time radio mic.  It's called their Classic Pro. It's one of those big network mics.  Like an old NBC mic.  Yes, with their ears cupped. And it's got the mic flag on the top.  It's going to say Twit. And it's going to be great.  So that's going to be my mic. You guys will have to suffer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, what's the- now normally, Leo, what's the name- what's the model number of the EV mic that most radio people use, which is a dynamic mic?  It's not even a condenser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It used to be the RE-20, and now it's an RE-27.  Right, but that's-  The condenser mics are powered mics, you know, they use phantom power.  Bob is a- Bob hates condenser mics. He's a dynamic mic guy.  Oh, so these are dynamic mics.  They're all dynamic. He far prefers it. He says as soon as you put power over the cable, you get all sorts of issues.  So these are all dynamics. And I think, well, you'll hear in our- we're going to use them this Friday on our- for the next coming Twit.  Next Friday.  Yeah, a week from whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think the Twit 30 really showed off the mic the way it can be.  No.  I mean, it was- there was so much- it just sounded so amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's an amazing mic. So you'll hear. And I think Bob's very smart.  What do they sell for?  They're inexpensive. They're around $300.  And I told Bob, I said, you're not charging enough because Neumann charges, you know, two grand for their top of the line mic.  And I think he's got a better mic. And he says, well, I should charge more, but that's how much they cost.  So this guy is a character. We will get him on. Really an amazing- the stories he was- he invented.  You know when Frampton comes alive, the talking guitar thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wah, wah, wah, I want to thank you.  Yeah, we get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. You know that? He invented that. That's called a Heil voice box.  Oh, really?  You know what it is? It's actually pretty straightforward.  It's a little amp that comes off the guitar, pumps the sound up a tube into your mouth.  And then you shape your mouth to shape the sound. I said, well, where's the pickup, Bob?  He said, it's the mic. You're doing it into the microphone.  So that wah, wah, it's just coming off the mic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This guy sounds like an interesting character. We definitely must have him on.  He wears purple sneakers.  Just like you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just like me.  Well, and the other thing I think is interesting about him is he's smart enough to see that there-  you know, it's hard to penetrate the radio market. All these guys are, you know,  I love my RE-27 or my Neumann or whatever.  But the Hams picked him up early and now he recognizes that there's a big market with podcasters.  And I think that he's very smart. He's going after podcasters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think at the price point that his mics are at, I think that that's just-  Reasonable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, does he have a cheaper mic for the cheap podcasters?  I mean, most guys aren't going to buy a $300 mic. Let's face it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, he does. They start with the PR-10, which is still a very good mic.  And that's, let me see, that's $89 bucks? I mean, I don't know. It's $100 bucks? Something like that.  It's very reasonable. I think he's on target.  But we're going to use the PR-30s and I'll get a PR-40 in that special case.  And we can- the PR-20 is $160 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's the difference between the 30 and the 40 in terms of just the guts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, we'll have to get Bob to tell us that. I think it's the size of the coil, but I'm not sure.  He uses big coils. That's why he has to-  So you're going to be booming over us again?  I am. Once again, I'm going to beat you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're going to steal that mic. Actually, we have to switch the guts out.  I have to try to get a hold of this guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you had any problems, John, with your Xbox 360?  Zero.  And you've seen what's happening.  Have you actually used your Xbox 360?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've got two kids. Are you kidding me?  I don't know.  It's- the thing's being used 24-7.  They don't sleep anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is the power supply on the ground?  Yes, it's on the rug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, that's one of the things people are saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it heating up? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They say the power supply is overheating and-  It's not.  But it's not.  Well, maybe yours isn't, but some people's are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why would mine be any different?  I mean, different production runs, different factories.  Bunch of reasons it could be different.  I guess it's possible, but-  The one they said-  I mean, it all takes a bad pass.  But do you have one, Patrick?  No, we have one at work that I was using for about a day.  Is it overheating?  They're hot. They run hot.  Well, this doesn't run hot at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's got three 3 GHz processors in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's amazing.  It sounds like an old-school desktop PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really? The fans are noisy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The fans are that loud.  If you're not- I mean, basically, if you're-  Where did- this one must have been made in-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  in Kenya or something, because mine makes no noise.  It doesn't sound like an old-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're playing a game, it makes noise.  If you're just browsing the menus-  No, we're talking about playing games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're talking about playing that racing game.  We're playing- I've got all the games.  I don't hear anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is there any chance they sent you a special John Loretta version?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no. I can tell when they do stuff like that.  And that's not the case.  This is just a bulk sent out to all the reviewers.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  According to iSupply, which I guess looked at all the parts,  Microsoft's losing $126 per unit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That doesn't surprise me, but that's part of the marketing plan  for stuff like that.  These boxes are sold at a loss, all of them.  Yeah.  Razor blades.  Exactly.  Those are razors, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I also- I'm not totally sold with it.  I mean, I think someone's calculating that they're losing $126,  but that's probably calculated against what the normal price would be,  or even a discounted price, but probably-  I would guess that Microsoft probably got a better deal than that.  Yeah.  I don't think Microsoft has that much leverage on the hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're making- they're going to sell $3 million by the end of the year.  If you're making $3 million on anything, don't you think you have a little leverage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Patrick, I think you're wrong there,  because there's been stories in the trade press about Microsoft  putting the screws to people about their prices.  And I suspect that they do have some leverage,  and actually it may be that leverage that causes the-  that causes these inferior- if they're out there, unless it's BS,  these inferior power supplies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're saying that they bid a lower price to get the deal,  but then they had to make inferior components?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's- I mean, it's not unheard of.  I can tell you they got leverage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They got 3.2 gigahertz power PC processors that Apple couldn't get.  Somebody's got some leverage somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'm telling you, I have- this box makes no noise,  and the power supply doesn't overheat, and the thing works like a champ.  All right, we're going to have a new slogan for John.  It makes no noise.  No, I don't need another catchphrase.  But as far as I'm concerned, I mean, we did have-  the box did crash once in, like, you know, the week that we had it.  It hung?  It hung on some screwing around with-  Oh, by the way, I've seen the screenshots you were talking about last week, John,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the UI on it. It is beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and actually, it's kind of- you can get lost in it, unfortunately.  I think it has, you know, it could be a little-  because sometimes to find stuff, like, for example-  The blades, they call them.  Yeah, the blades.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's like 23 of them, it feels like.  What's a blade? What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These things slide out from the side, and then they have all these menus on them.  It's like a menu that comes from the side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's sort of like these margins are stacked up on either the left or the right,  and when you click the thing, it slides everything over and opens up the space in between.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, blades sounds much better than digital file folder tabs  that slide out from the left side of the television screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I think blades is a good moniker.  Absolutely.  But whatever the case is, you know, it's sometimes a little-  I mean, if you want to switch your display from 480p to 720p or 1080i or whatever,  you have to really dig around to find that tab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So do you think that- I mean, some of these surveys on some of these Xbox fansites  say 15 to 25% errors of crashes, you think those are overblown, you think it's not?  Microsoft says it's a minuscule number of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what?  I think this is part of a campaign to besmirch the machine, to be honest about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like hardcore gamers are saying, PlayStation 3 and dumping on the Xbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  And then what I'm seeing, which is really, I think, kind of freaky and kind of creepy,  to be honest about it, is kind of one of these iterations of fanboys,  like the people who used to be Amiga fans or the way the Macintosh guys are now.  They can't afford to have both machines or all three machines.  So they have to dump on the one they can't get.  Right, so they dump on the one they don't own or they can't get or they don't like or whatever.  And I think it's just creepy.  You know what baffles me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is a fairly large contingent of Windows fanboys, because I hear from them,  because I recommend Macintoshes, and they're virulent.  It's like Bill Gates is their secret lover. I don't understand.  It's creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the other thing, you know, these guys were like actually making a bigger scene during the OS 2 era.  And I thought they'd gone away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they loved you. You were a big OS 2 fan. I remember that.  Yeah.  So Apple is not part of this group, but Microsoft, Opera, Mozilla, the folks at Conqueror,  have all agreed to kind of change the security standards in browsers.  They're going to add a new certificate, a super certificate,  that when you go to a certified website, you'll see a green address bar that'll kind of be a green light.  IE7 features this, and so will Opera and Conqueror.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it was really neat that they all got together on this plan.  And it's really aimed also at defeating the whole phishing problem so that people are...  How so?  Well, the UI will make it very clear if the certificate does not match what's shown up in the URL.  So it'll be something, you know, that you're actually...  Better than a padlock?  Yes, exactly.  Is it the same as a padlock? I mean, is it the same...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it telling you that you have a secure connection, or is it doing more?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's going to go further and make sure you really understand if the certificate that's been exchanged  does not match what is displayed, the URL displayed up in the address bar.  Normally, users have to go phishing for that.  You've got to right-click on the padlock, view the certificate,  and visually make sure that it all matches.  And this is going to make it extreme...  I mean, it's going to be in your face flashing at you if there's a problem.  I guess that's what you need to do.  I think you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And people will still ignore it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In order to get what they want.  Well, it would be better if it would flash red at you if it didn't match.  It just flashes green if it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It would probably be actually better if nothing worked at all, if there was a match.  Exactly.  Because there's no reason that you should ever have a mismatch unless something's wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know, Steve.  I frequently will get...  Not frequently, but it happens to me on legitimate sites that I'll get a certificate error.  No kidding.  Out-of-date certificates.  I get one.  Never happened to me.  I'll give you an example.  If you go to Google AdSense, instead of going www.google.com, you go to google.com.  It still works, but the certificate apparently says only wwws.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are some you're able to get, and they're actually a little bit scary, that are asterisk dot, like google.com.  That would probably be a bad idea.  It is a bad idea.  For example, I have to purchase, and in fact, mine are expiring in the middle of December.  I'm getting constant email now from VeriSign warning me that I've got one that came into date.  It says I have 21 days remaining.  So I've got one for GRC and www.grc.  Separate certificates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Google is cheap and didn't buy a Google.com certificate?  Yep.  That's stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or they're not redirecting people who come in at Google.com over to www and forcing the www to be on there.  That's a silly thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You get your certificates from VeriSign?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do, and it hurts.  I mean, it's like $700.  Really?  Oh yeah, I mean, it's just bent over.  What are you using the certificate for?  What do you have it?  In order to do SSL connections for our web server so that people are able to do HTTPS to GRC.com for e-commerce stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When you connect to a secure server, whether it's a bank or Amazon.com, you're using an SSL link,  and that has to be validated by a certificate from a trusted third party.  There are other people besides VeriSign, there's Thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  VeriSign bought Thought.  Oh, they did?  They're no longer independent, and the price is one up.  Oh, that's too bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gee, huh, what a shock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Capitalism at its best.  That's really, because Thought used to offer free certificates for personal use.  Yes.  That's kind of sad.  I guess bye-bye to that.  Well, as long as we're talking browsers, Firefox 1.5 is going to come out probably this Tuesday the 29th with a big marketing blitz.  Wow, open source has changed.  Firefox has always been kind of one of the more aggressive groups about convincing people to switch.  There's a spreadfirefox.com and a getfirefox website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, Leo, let's wait and see what this so-called marketing blitz really looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't think it's going to be an open source style marketing blitz with quotes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, it won't be hanging banners off that giant tower in Toronto, I guarantee that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I have to say, though, companies like Firefox have these, talk about fanboys,  these adherents who will put banners everywhere and badges everywhere.  And there are, you know, Firefox makes money off these Google searches, as you told me, I think, a couple of episodes ago.  So there is some money to spend on marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they get a piece of the action when you use that little Google thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They say they're going for 10% of the browser market by the end of this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I still don't believe they only have that.  You know, I think if, you know, the problem with the, you know, this is like,  remember the old days of the original Star Trek show and before they had demographics for TV shows  and they finally figured it out and they said, well, wait a minute,  we lost this audience that was pretty good audience even though we didn't have real numbers.  The same thing I think holds true with these browsers.  I don't think the real numbers, I mean, yeah, maybe they only have 10%, but who are these 10%?  These are probably 10% of the people who really use the browser a lot.  I mean, every, you know, my mom, you know, who doesn't even have a computer, she goes online,  she'd use Explorer, but she'd use it once every five years.  So I'm not convinced that that 10% number is what it really sounds like.  Bloggers, for example, my blog, I get over 60% of the people are Firefox users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I think on Twitter it's even like 70 or 80%.  Very few people use Internet Explorer anymore.  So it's the technical, the literate technical technology users that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I think that 10% number doesn't mean anything.  And I think we need to re-examine what we mean by 10% market share.  Right, right. I love Firefox and I've been using One5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the current release candidate. It's very stable.  I think they do a nice job. It's a great browser.  It's remarkable.  And the open architecture for extensions is great.  You know, they did a smart thing.  Basically, the UI in Firefox is JavaScript and XML.  So it's very easy to modify the UI, to write extensions, you just have to know JavaScript.  I think in some ways because of that and things like Apple's dashboard,  which is also in JavaScript,  JavaScript is surprisingly, given all its flaws,  becoming a very popular language for writing stuff on the web.  Ajax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Next topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess so. I guess so.  iTunes is number seven, the number seven music retailer in the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that weird or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For the first time since ever, it's from one down, it's Walmart's number one,  then Best Buy, Target, Amazon, FYE, Circuit City.  These are all brick and mortar. And then, boy, boom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't even know what FYE is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'd see it around.  You see FYE, don't you, Patrick? You live in the Midwest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think I've ever seen one of those.  Really? Where have I seen FYE?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've seen it. I wonder, maybe it's East Coast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hold on, this calls for a Google search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's FYE.com, for your entertainment.  And they have stores all over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could have sworn that I'd seen them around. Maybe it's East Coast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have a store near you.  Wow, they have stores everywhere except for Idaho and Montana.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they're in malls. I think you guys don't go to the mall enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are they under the name FYE?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  F.Y.E, yeah. It looks like it.  You should see the map. There's a ridiculous number of them coming down the eastern seaboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're the number five music retailer in the U.S. Somebody knows where they are.  But it's interesting, isn't it, that Walmart is dominant?  Walmart's been dominant for years.  In fact, that's a big deal because sometimes Walmart will refuse to carry covers that are distasteful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, at one point they were selling, I think, over 20, 25 percent of the music in the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. Are you surprised that Best Buy is number two there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I'm not surprised by that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People go to Best Buy to buy music, huh?  What do you think about the notion that Apple is basically charging a buck a song for low bit rate, low quality digital music?  Do people care anymore about high fidelity?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do. I almost never buy tunes off there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Most people have been using those earbuds and they keep them cranked up and they've blown out their ears.  Maybe that's a strategy.  But it's a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a strategy.  For a while we were getting more and more high fidelity. Music was getting more and more accurate.  And digital music really is taking a big step backward.  I'm not talking about CDs, uncompressed CDs, but compressed digital music is taking a big step backwards.  I can't hear the difference, but I'm an old man and I've been using earbuds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. It's something that you're either excited about or you're not.  I mean, almost all my stuff comes off the CDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everybody's all excited about FYE. That seems to be the subject.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's one in Stone Ridge over here in the East Bay.  I have to go check it out.  I think it's mostly malls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Patrick, you would not buy digital music. You would only buy CDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do it once in a while for something I can't get any other way, but I don't like having the rights management.  I like to be able to move my stuff around the house without having problems.  And I also like to be able to do a higher compression, to do less compression than they usually offer on the download sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When you put it on a portable player, what do you compress that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Depending on which player.  I'm basically building up two sets of music. One's like 192 and the other one is lossless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you use FLAC? What do you use for lossless?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been playing around a lot. It's not the best, but I've been playing around a lot with the Apple Lossless Codec,  just because it'll play on the... I've got a 60-gigabyte iPod and I can just dump it on there in volume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot of people use iTunes, but you have to use iTunes.  The nice thing about FLAC is it's kind of standard, but it doesn't work on an iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well it's hard to find. I mean, the lossless codecs, it's hard to find support for them on the...  I know I'm going to get a bunch of angry emails about this, but it's more difficult to find support for the lossless codecs...  On the players.  On the players. But I've been doing some listening stuff.  It's interesting. There's a lot of... I had a chance to recompress a bunch of stuff and listen to it in a lossless codec.  And it was a reminder that you lose detail when you go down to 192k.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It seems to me that at some point the question is, is the content good enough?  Look at the slow... Well, look at the...  No, no, no.  No, no, no. I mean, in terms of the general market, Patrick, look at the incredibly lethargic adoption of HD.  We know from John that HD is fantastic and sharp and crystalline and wonderful, but most consumers haven't made the move because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know. I think you're looking at that the wrong way.  Because the TV picture is good enough.  Hold on, hold on, hold on. Take a step back.  First of all, if you look at... I'm pretty sure if you take a look at the Consumer Electronics Alliance numbers,  that they're going to tell you that the majority of new TVs being purchased are starting to swing over to HD.  I know it's especially for DL.TV. We constantly get questions about HDTV because everybody's moving to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what do you mean when it comes to music, what are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not arguing that the future is not HD. I think it is. Although it's been available for years and people haven't moved.  Certainly as old TVs die, you're going to replace it with an HD capable TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but Gary, I'm saying something. Since 1970, how many televisions have you bought?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what's going to transform this is when HD DVDs come out.  I think people are smart enough to know that your DVD isn't going to be helped by HDTV.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Listen to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the FCC is forcing the world over to HD. I mean, the old analog...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, the FCC is trying to liberate bandwidth.  And in the process, the side effect of that is to force people over to digital television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say, I've changed my tune. I for a long time was kind of berating the FCC saying there,  this is going against what consumers really want. But I have to say now, consumers are pretty clearly in the HD camp.  They want HDTVs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, Costco's got a lot to do with this. Every time you go to Costco or these big stores, you walk in,  you see these things and you go, wow, this is pretty cool. And now they're starting to show better content on those screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you know, HBO is almost all HD. Once you have HD DVD players in widespread use, I think every...  And look at the Xbox 360. The full version comes out of the box with HD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, there's almost no point in buying an Xbox.  Let's get back to the audio. I think that's arguments different than the audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I was gallant of you, Steve, to try this, but I think the argument for audio is different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know a lot of people who buy music...  I agree with you. The people who buy music...  ...who don't get it.  Okay, guys, one at a time.  I know a lot of people who download music from iTunes. The quality of the audio is absolutely never an issue.  For like your typical, just...  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The hoi polloi.  You know what? I'm hoi polloi then, because it sounds fine to me.  I buy most of my music on iTunes. It's convenience for me.  And Patrick, is the iPod good enough to notice the difference if you put lossless audio on it?  Yes, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think it's a little...  Absolutely.  Can you hear the difference in the little headphones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, in the little headphones, not so much, but I'm usually using a decent set of headphones,  or I'm running it through my desktop speakers.  I use a set of B&W speakers in a 100 watt amplifier.  Yeah, you might hear a difference.  And I can hear huge differences, especially...  I do agree with Patrick.  ...singles, high-end, jazz.  Even the punk rock stuff, you can definitely hear differences in the quality of the audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are we breeding a generation of kids who don't know the difference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely. They've already been bred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had a meeting with the Mission Electronics people in Las Vegas at the last CES,  who used to make these really fancy speakers and amps and stuff,  and they said that there's a lost generation of people that have a nice stereo system in their house.  They listen on these earbuds and these mediocre little computer speakers,  and they're losing their ears.  Wow.  You can't sell these speakers anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It also just changes the way you even mix the album.  I mean, everything has to be much harder and more towards the center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we notice that with Twitter, we mix it for earbuds,  because we know that's how most people will be listening.  Not that we're high fidelity by any means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But partially also to tap onto what the Mission folks are saying,  one of the things they're forgetting is there's usually a small percentage of people who buy decent audio equipment  through high school and college.  I mean, the classic nerd geek demographic.  And then a lot of people come into it later.  But if you're looking at high-quality audio, that's always been a minority of the people who purchase it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, but they see the numbers dropping drastically.  Even worse, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My gripe is DRM.  I don't want to buy something that I don't have the right to do with whatever I want to in perpetuity.  So I buy CDs and rip them and compress them myself, just like Patrick,  because I like having a really strong master that I own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, it's interesting to look at, I mean,  because if you take a generation of kids that really got heavy into music  around the time that Napster first became popular,  the audio quality on that was atrocious.  Is it good enough for, you know, on the flip side,  you've got entire generations for the last decade that have been building up insane car stereo systems  where it's moved beyond just beyond the big dual 15-inch woofers that are rattling the spare tire in the trunk,  but to do in serious competition on audio reproduction quality.  And the other thing is, maybe the Mission people aren't acknowledging,  is that the average quality of a lot of consumer electronics has gone up dramatically in the last decade.  You know what I mean?  There used to be a huge gulf between mid-fi and the stuff you would find for sale on the consumer,  you know, the shelves at your local Sears or Target or Walmart or Kmart or wherever you shop for your stuff,  Best Buy, Circuit City.  I don't think that void is as vast anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Interesting.  Well, you know, Nick, I think we should go to the next topic.  I think it's kind of interesting that...  I mean, before Patrick names every retailer in the country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, I got a related topic.  Charmin Networks, given just 10 days by Australian courts to take pirated music off its system or shut down entirely until December 5.  It's kind of the end of the line for Kazaa, or are they going to squeak out of this one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, is it... do they have to take it off or do they have to filter it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is exactly the... almost to the letter what happened to Napster, where the judge said,  all right, you have the... you know, and this is what the record industry was saying.  They have the technology to, yeah, filter out copyrighted music.  They have 10 days to do it.  And remember, Napster said, we can't do it, and eventually just closed their doors.  What would happen? Charmin must, as a first step only, by the way,  this isn't the final compliance, implement a keyword filtering system for Kazaa  that will remove links to copyrighted files being shared over the network.  Of course, if there are misspellings, and this is exactly what happened in Napster,  people started misspelling Metallica to get their stuff through there.  It'll get by the filters, and that's why the judge, I think, in the long run will say,  no, you've got to get this copyrighted music off.  Rockster and E-Docky shut down last month thanks to lawsuits.  BitTorrent just signed a deal with the MPAA.  It's kind of more symbolic than anything else, but Bram Cohen said,  no, we won't carry any pirated music on the BitTorrent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not that BitTorrent...  No, what they said they would do is he would work to make the search engine,  to take copyrighted material that shows up in the search engine out of the search engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But does Bram even run a tracker? I mean, he makes a software?  Yes.  Oh, he does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he put the search on.  Around the time that everybody started getting shut down by the lawsuits,  he put a search up on the BitTorrent website.  Ah, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's not the one...  I think it's search.bittorrent.org.  Pirates don't use BitTorrent.  I mean, to use their searches, they go to a tracker like Pirates Bay or something.  Yeah, there's a bunch of black sites in Germany everyone uses.  So it's more symbolic, I think, for Bram to say that,  but I think the Motion Picture Association is hoping that here is the guy who invented BitTorrent  if he says no pirated stuff.  And I think Bram's doing it because he's looking at that Supreme Court decision saying,  well, he's also looking...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  BitTorrent's raised $9 million of venture capital funded to develop more...  They paid him off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they bought him.  Well, I think that the MP...  I think BitTorrent has a lot to gain from getting people in the MPAA to distribute...  Oh, sure.  They want them as clients, and the MPAA knows that BitTorrent right now  is still the best solution for them.  They have a future.  But they have to start with some kind of formal agreement that they're not going to...  They're coming for you, Alex.  The other thing is BitTorrent isn't about content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's about a distribution mechanism.  He shouldn't even be caught up in any of this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And in fact, I think what's going to happen is that the Motion Picture Association  is going to use peer-to-peer of some kind, maybe BitTorrent, to distribute movies.  And this is the beginning of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think that Apple needs to really pay attention to what's going on there  related to iTunes.  To make iTunes truly scalable for video,  Apple has to put some kind of peer-to-peer into the back end of iTunes.  It kills us. We can't distribute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're not visible. Our video is not visible on the iTunes Music Store  because we can't afford the bandwidth.  We're not Ziff Davis. We can't afford to pay for the bandwidth.  How many terabytes are you using for digital live TV, Patrick?  A lot.  Yeah, I mean, it must cost thousands a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We got a pretty good deal on the bandwidth, actually.  Well, can you help us?  We just got another provider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you help a buddy out?  I'll see what I can do.  I've been going around out in hand saying,  please, sir, can I have some bandwidth?  But this is scary when you're talking 500 megabyte files  and you're talking potentially 100,000 downloads of that file.  That's a scary amount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, talking about big files, let's talk about that 300 gigabyte DVD nonsense.  What's the deal there?  Well, I mean, it's essentially a technology that has been played...  It's holographic memory.  Yeah, well, holographic memory is a technology  that people have been playing around with for decades.  And it never worked commercially before, and I don't see it working now.  I mean, it's nice that we have these kinds of things,  but as far as I can tell, it's similar to that run-up we had  with these field emission displays,  these so-called FEDs that were also known as the thin CRT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this is a credible company.  This is Inphase, which is a spinoff of Lucent.  They say they're going to start selling them next year.  Yeah, sure.  They can read and write, they say, at 10 times the speed of DVD.  They hold 300 gigabytes on a disc that's roughly the size of a CD or DVD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they probably can sell one or two at $150,000 a pop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ah, so you're saying it's not going to be affordable.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I didn't call nothing affordable initially.  Well, I know, but this is really unaffordable.  We're not talking about, you know, you could buy some of these DVD burners  when they first came out for 10 grand.  This thing is going to be over the top.  There's no way it's going to be that cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Be interesting, though, if they could come out with this,  then you would have, I mean, you already have a format war on high-def DVDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, this is never going to happen, Leo.  This is one of those things that come up all the time,  and they just flop every time.  They suck up a lot of venture capital money, and then you know,  then you wonder what, you know, some years from now,  maybe they'll get the thing to work, but it'll be a decade away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they've got a video that shows the inside.  They actually have a prototype.  They've got it. They're building it. They've got it.  And it's not rendered.  It's actual physical, you know, machinery going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maxell has agreed to make the discs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what? They would agree to do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As a business model for the, I mean, the movie industries are fighting  over whatever format they're going to end up using,  and they'll probably finish fighting over the DVD formats  about the time when we realize we don't really care about DVDs anymore.  But the...  Just out of curiosity, when's that going to be?  I think within a decade,  we're going to stop really thinking about the idea of...  I mean, even now...  You mean you're saying online distribution?  Yeah, you just download it.  I mean, the thing is, right now, that's a big file.  In Korea, right now, it would not be a big file.  You know, to download a movie.  Because they've got the bandwidth.  Yeah, they've got the bandwidth to just drag it down, you know.  I'm not completely buying this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, we could be doing that with music right now,  but people still buy CDs. My wife won't download anything.  I'm not completely into this.  You can also download books, but people still buy books.  I don't think media necessarily goes away when it gets such a foothold.  I don't think it just disappears.  I think it just manages its own market after a while.  I don't see these things going away.  I don't see newspapers going away.  I don't see magazines going away.  I don't see nothing going away.  I just see these things stabilizing.  DVDs aren't going away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you're right.  I thought I'd make a bad train joke here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there is a eventual phase-out.  I mean, you know, eight tracks are gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but they never got a real – eight tracks never got the big foothold.  Now, you could make the argument that vinyl, you know,  yeah, that one was replaced by something else,  and that's always a potential.  Cassettes are on their way out.  But the vinyl is still being made.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yeah, it'll be made, but the question is,  is it the center of the market?  And when you look at Apple going to number seven,  you know, it's starting to become – I mean, there's a lot of us.  I mean, I even buy – you know, I buy CDs and rip them for my own use as well.  But the thing is is that what we want is we want it to end up on our portable player.  We don't want to have that piece of plastic.  You know, I have this little system to rip my DVDs so that I can watch them on my PSP or on my iPod.  You know, I don't need to – you know, and I'm not downloading them.  I go get my DVDs and I do it.  But the thing is is I'd rather just download it.  It's way easier for me to –  Well, for you it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think for you it is.  And I think maybe 10 years from now it'll be interesting to check this out  because this is really worth examining.  But you know, the idea of these portable players,  I have mixed feelings about them ever getting the kind of traction that everybody thinks.  You know, there's like this interesting thing going on where you have the one movement toward HDTV  with 40-inch plasmas and 60-inch screens, and I have a 90-inch projector  along with these little handheld devices with a 4-inch screen that we're supposed to watch movies on.  I mean, it seems to me there's a discrepancy here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what about IPTV, though, where you download – the movie is still coming in through the Internet,  but you're going to watch it on your big-screen TV in your living room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, and you maybe want to watch it on a portable device, too,  but it just seems – I think these portable devices are a flash in the pan personally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I just think that the media goes in two different directions.  So there's some media that makes sense to work on a small screen.  There's some media, like a big movie, that would be great to see on a projector.  You know, and I think that – but whether it goes –  whether it's a large screen on the side of my wall in my house or in my iPod video,  you know, the bottom line is that I don't want to buy some piece of plastic that holds it.  I just want to log in and download it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, relevant to these stories – there's two big stories.  TiVo has announced that they're going to allow you to move TV shows  using the TiVo2Go system onto an iPod.  Only on a PC.  Desperation.  Desperation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, absolutely. These guys are going out of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. I think the TiVo-Yahoo deal is significant.  Don't you think TiVo's going to –

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know, when the stock goes up, let me know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd buy now. I think TiVo has a shot now because this deal with Yahoo –  and we talked about this. You weren't around, John.  We talked about this in Twitter.  I think this deal with Yahoo means that TiVo is in good position to become the IPTV set-top box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If this is TiVo's best shot, I think TiVo's in trouble.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  CBS in talks with Yahoo and Google to start making television shows  and archival news footage available on the web.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, which one is it?  I think it's CBS that's actually still looking at selling shows  and then adding advertising to it as well.  Selling shows for a dollar.  Disney –  And with advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Disney did this deal with Desperate Housewives and Lost.  But there was no advertising.  There's no advertising, but they're selling it for money if you make enough money.  And I know you'll be happy about this, John.  NBC has made a deal with DirecTV for My Name is Earl, your favorite show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what?  It's not my favorite show, but it's one of my favorite shows.  It's a tremendously funny show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they're making a deal.  Battlestar Galactica as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, now that's the bad side of the argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But see, hey, if you're going for the geek audience,  Battlestar Galactica is probably a good choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and the advantage of all this – I totally agree with Alex –  that the preparation of the media from like a DVD to a file that you can then make transportable,  at the moment, it's not only very labor intensive, but even if you automate it with scripts,  it takes an amazing amount of time to transcode this stuff down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true.  I mean, CBS says they want to put their entire 60-minute archive online  so that you could type in Harry Truman and find footage of Harry Truman.  Well, that'd be great.  It'd be great.  But boy, you're right.  That's a lot of work.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's a lot of work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But do you think if you've got enough little worker bees doing it,  there's a business model?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think also if you're going to do it on that scale,  then you bring in some serious hardware compression,  and you can do a much better job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, also, I'm sorry, a lot of these companies already have that.  I mean, like Discovery Channel has that entire – they can search all of their old data right now.  You know, so making it available to the public is not something like they have to do a lot of work.  They just have to turn the database outward.  So it's already online and digitized?  Yeah.  In the example of Discovery Networks, all of that stuff is already there.  And BBC was the same way.  A lot of these companies are already working that way.  When you buy your stock footage from ABC stock, that stuff has all been digitized.  It's all been sorted, tagged.  Everything's done.  So for a lot of these companies, they've been doing all of the work to make that possible for a decade.  Now, a lot of the data wasn't at full res.  That's why it's easy for them to turn the low-res stuff public,  is because it was just to search it so that they could – so then that you would be able to search 320 by 240s.  Sort of like a thumbnail.  Exactly.  And then you'd say, I need this footage, I need this footage.  We used to order this stuff all the time when I was working at a cable network.  And so you would just go through it and you'd watch all this stuff, and then you would just order –  you'd pay whatever you were going to pay for the licensing, and you'd get a beta tape of all the stuff that you had ordered for your edit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know who's really making money on the net?  Ruth Parasol.  You ever hear of her?  Ruth Parasol is a 38-year-old lawyer, lives in the tax haven of Gibraltar.  She's worth $1.8 billion, one of the wealthiest women in the world.  How'd she make her money?  First with phone sex, then web porn, then with partypoker.com.  She's as rich as Mark Cuban.  How old is she?  She's 38.  She actually –  Hey, she's looking for a date.  Hey, Steve.  Steve, she's a looker.  She's gorgeous.  She's apparently quite beautiful.  She's from Marin County, a mother of two, and she is one of the richest women in the world.  How'd she do it?  Partypoker.com.  What's not to like?  There you go.  There you go.  So I'm just saying, if you want to make money, it's the same old story.  Sex and gambling.  Sex and gambling.  Pretty amazing, huh?  I just think it's very interesting to see all of these mainstream media giants get sucked in by this IPTV thing.  Do you think they're being fooled by the flavor of the month, or do you think they're –

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, IPTV is big everywhere in the world, except the United States already.  If you go to my website, iptvdaily.com, there's a plug.  When did this start?  I started about six months ago.  I know it's another one.  But it's basically – there's all these stories that I've been cataloging, and it's like everything's going on everywhere, except here.  It's unbelievable to me that we're so far behind on this one, we don't even know what we're doing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you said you liked the idea of being able to search for Harry Trimman and finding footage of Harry Trimman.  Oh, yeah.  I think that would be very useful for writers.  Well, that'd be awesome.  I think it'd be useful for anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because you can't get these quotes.  I mean, there's a lot of good stuff that's done on television that you can't find the quote.  You can't get the quote because they don't do transcripts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the biggest problem is they haven't been saving tape.  You know, where is our old tech TV tape? Who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what? I took all mine home.  You're smart.  Because they were going to throw them out, like they always do.  So I have all my shows right until the day that they went to the hard disk for the recorder, which was just before they took the show off the air.  That's the sign.  I have all the other shows. I've got four years where the show is all downstairs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I see it right here.  Dvorak talking to Google Yahoo for putting all his archives online.  Actually, you know what? I'm joking.  Yeah, like they really want that.  I don't know.  I think that that could well be serious value.  I think you're smart to save that stuff.  After all, think about it.  We talked to, I mean, this was always one of the things I liked about tech TV.  And one of the things I had hoped it would be is an authoritative record of these people who, you know, in 100 years, we're all going to be dead.  But there might be, you know, if somebody saves this stuff, a record of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, there's also the problem with dead media, though.  You know what I mean?  Well, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why digitization is a key right now.  Get it into bits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think that somebody is going to get to a point where they can normalize the procedure of downloading this stuff.  And I think right now the company most, you know, you have AOL has a really, really good, you know, is positioned well for that stuff.  But I don't know if old content is really going to be the answer.  I think that the contents bad.  You know, and I think that but I think that if Apple made let people buy videos, you know, I think that it would the whole thing would it would flip on.  I think that Tivo is really great.  But Tivo's got two million subscribers.  There'll be two million people with video iPods.  There's already three million PSP users.  Is that right?  Eight million.  I don't know what the number is.  But there's all these people with these portable devices that are ready to buy stuff, you know, that are ready to, you know, to get that stuff either.  It just that the purchasing process and that in that sorting process is the part that is is still missing.  You know, and I think that in something for us as individuals to not have to deal with the e-commerce level of it.  And I think that all these companies are trying to work with the big media companies to make it to figure out some way to take their old content and shovel it up on the Web rather than working with new content creators to, you know, find a way to create fresh stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, why you bring out content?  It's just free money for them.  That's the way they look at the old content.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're not free money because it costs money to serve it.  But anyway, while you're on the topic.  You know that and I know that.  But they're looking at it from the.  Since we're I don't want to make a segue here.  But since you brought up television in the first place, we should talk about the bad news this week in TV, which you mentioned.  Oh, which is Alias is over.  Alias is over.  Although I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Explain the last season.  Explain.  And what a painful death.  Oh, you're not talking about Alias Wavefront.  You're talking about the TV show Alias.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jennifer.  Jennifer's gone.  Jennifer in France.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's gone.  I don't think she's gone.  I think she's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank God.  I see Steve Gibson is a big fan of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I watched it religiously until they moved it to Thursday where it collides with everything else in the world.  And I use a Tevo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, that's why.  I've got two of them.  Download it to your iPod.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, you know, they've been trying to screw with the show.  They move it to Thursday.  They moved it to Wednesday.  They changed it and keep moving back and forth.  And they wonder why the show never got traction.  Hey, they.  I mean, it seems to me when it was on Wednesday it was doing fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At least they never moved it to 6 a.m. Pacific like a G4 moved call for help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The real earmark of its death, if anybody's a real fan out there, there used to be a website called SD6.com.  I think it was SD-6.com.  And when that guy folded the website after the fourth year because it was too much work for him, he had maintained all the highlighted letters.  And he was doing all kinds of weird stuff.  And he kept all the show synopses.  It was amazing.  And then he closed it down because he had to get a real job.  To me, that was the end of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And of course, SD6 was shut down too when Arlen got captured and figured out all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But anyway, at least ABC says they're going to try to pump up the last few episodes for the fans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anything else that you guys have on your agendas?  That's it for me.  I want to mention we did a survey, a very interesting survey through PodTrack of Twitter listeners.  And some interesting results came out of that.  I'll tell you what.  I'll see if I can...  It's an Excel spreadsheet.  I'll see if I can figure out a way to post it on the website.  Can you summarize it?  Well, yeah, I'm 97% male.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  60% single and living alone.  Uh-oh.  That's not good.  Now, this is out of, I think, 3,500 or something like that responses for 75-year-olds.  But most of them...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It might be self-selecting at that, you know, with this kind of thing.  It is self-selecting, of course.  The guy living at home more likely to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe that's it.  Well, he has enough peace and quiet to be able to concentrate.  They're all Steve Gibson's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nobody nagging him.  About 16, 70% students, which is about what I would expect.  A broad demographic range.  But I was kind of surprised that so few women listen to this.  Well, we do want to thank all the folks who make this possible.  Most importantly, of course, our donors.  And we want to remind you that if you like Twit, you can keep it going.  By the way, oh, I have a big announcement.  The Twit store is going to go online later this week, just in time for the holidays.  And we'll have Dvorak, I get no spam hats.  We'll have Twit hoodies.  We'll have T-shirts, caps, stickers, bumper stickers.  Anything I can jam into that store, we're going to put there.  In fact, if I can figure out a way to get CDs of Twit, Security Now, and our other podcasts online, I will.  We are starting a new podcast, a Twit extension is what I'm going to call these.  On Tuesday with Amber MacArthur, we're going to do a Web 2.0 podcast called Inside the Net,  which will be all about the new web technologies.  We're going to start with a look at the Flock browser with its creator.  We're going to talk about Mozilla 1.5 with Mike Shaver from Mozilla.org and some other great topics.  Very cool.  Yeah, it'll be a fun podcast.  Yeah, like Inside the Net, that's a great name.  Yeah, Inside the Net, Under the Net, Caught in the Net, I don't know, something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How about Internet Tonight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, if I could find Harriet, I think he's off chasing Sasquatch, but if I could find him, I think he'd make a great podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I should mention the listeners out there, we did have a show on Tech TV called Internet Tonight,  which was the most professional, professionally produced and slickest show that they did.  And they canceled it for no good reason out of the blue with no numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  First show to be canceled, you know why it got canceled?  Paul Allen hated it.  I'm not kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was it too slick for him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it was, well, it was also one of the more expensive shows, but I thought it was brilliant.  Michaela Ferreira, who has gone on to start him at KTLA in Los Angeles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Paul didn't like it, I didn't know that, I never heard that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I believe that was the case, that Paul killed it.  Scott Harriot, funny, funny comedian, it was the best written show on Tech TV.  Well, it was probably the only written show on Tech TV.  And it was fast.  It was great.  I always thought it was going to be the big hit on Tech TV, to be honest with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You mean it was actually a written show for Tech TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was well produced, it was beautifully done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I actually got to host it once.  Did you?  Yeah, I took Michaela's place for one show just because I can't imagine, because I wanted to do a show like that just to see what it was like.  And it was really professional, it was really a hot show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very well produced, I just thought it was.  There were some really good shows, you know, I think the music show we did was quite good too.  And you know, but people like the screensavers, what can you say?  Some people have no taste.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank God.  Screensavers, yeah, but that was just basically you carrying the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was a guy named Patrick on there too, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's not forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The love flowing over the phone, John, it's just frightening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry, Patrick's on the line.  Patrick, I mean you were carrying the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're going to bite me a second time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, what's the story with G4?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  God, I don't know, you know, the ratings are appallingly bad for that channel.  .01, which is statistically zero.  We were getting a .03 for Call for Help when we first got on, so they moved us to 9 a.m.  And now we're down to .01 as well.  They're geniuses.  They're brilliant.  The Man Show's doing okay though, .09, which is still pretty pathetic.  And given the cost of the Man Show, I doubt that, I think it's a money-loser for them.  So who knows what's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How expensive is it to have gals in bikinis jumping on trampolines?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you buy a successful show like the Man Show, you're spending some bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait a minute, you're telling me G4 bought the Man Show?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They bought reruns of the Man Show.  Oh, great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Re-runs of a topical show, fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, people don't watch for the news on that show, John.  I think they watch for the trampoline.  Be my guess, but I could be wrong.  I've never seen it actually, and I'm sticking to that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, the commercials are annoying enough.  It's like, oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they run them throughout Call for Help, which is really annoying.  I wish they wouldn't do that, but we don't have any control over that.  So the Twizzlers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's all those big bucks you're making there, Leo?  You shouldn't be complaining.  I'm not complaining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Big bucks?  What are you talking about?  I'm barely scraping about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're just getting about 500 grand a year to do that show.  Really?  Wow.  No, not really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll take it.  I've got to go call Canada right now.  Oh, it's $500 in Canadian.  But we are going to open the Twitch store and look for that on ThisWeekInTech.com while you're there.  Your donations, of course, are much appreciated.  We really do thank you.  Just $2 a month is all we ask, less than the price of a latte.  We do thank, of course, Ashley Twitt for our closing theme, Mark Blasko for opening theme,  Dorothy Yamamoto for the little Twit guy.  By the way, I know Alex is working on animating the little Twit guy.  He's coming to life in some amazing ways.  We're going to have Twit sightings.  Twit sightings all over the world.  And of course, to America Online's radio network, AOLradio at AOLmusic.com.  We're on the podcast channel.  They've agreed to carry Amber's new podcast as well.  So you can listen for it there at AOLmusic.com.  When is the first Amber podcast?  We're going to do it Tuesday.  So watch for it on ThisWeekInTech.com.  It's another Twit extension.  And John, you and I are going to start doing some too, I hope soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, we've been promising that now for 20 shows.  I thought you were going to go do it with Patrick.  I thought you were going to read your columns, John.  Yeah, actually, I want to do that.  I just have to get the clearances on a couple of items.  I have to share copyright, but there's some delay that's involved.  Will you do dramatic readings?  Yeah, dramatic readings.  We'll get a duck to read the things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, ladies and gentlemen, another Twit is in the can.  This Week in Tech.
