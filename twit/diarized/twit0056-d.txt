Transcript:  Bandwidth for This Week in Tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com slash podcasting.  This is TWiT This Week in Tech, episode 56 for June 4th, 2006. Bork, bork, bork.  This is episode 56 of This Week in Tech, joining us. A good mix of people. I think we're going to have a good time tonight.  Of course, John C. Dvorak, as always, is here. Dvorak.org slash blog. The first word's out of his mouth, the last word's out of his mouth.  The first and last word in blocking. Also from Long Beach Island, New Jersey. It's only one person that can be. It's John C. Dvorak. Patrick Norton, my good friend, my good buddy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you on vacation? A little bit of a tweak of vacation before work in New York on Monday and Tuesday.  What are you going to do in New York? They've got a premiere for the Digital Life Show and then doing some meetings at the Mothership for Ziff Davis.  Ziff Davis. They're not in one dark anymore, are they? No, they left that place not too long after I moved out to California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What a nightmare building that was. Their old one park avenue. It was a charming building. Awful.  Also here, somebody who's never been onto it before from Grape Radio, one of the pioneer podcasters, Michael Gohagen. It's great to have you.  Thanks for having me. Thanks for joining us. Michael does Disney's podcasts too and has made a business out of podcasting, which is kind of neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We try. What's the name of your company? Willnick Productions. Willnick. Are you Will or Nick? My sons. I have William and Nicholas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's cute. Also, Doug Kay, who doesn't have a microphone, so he's just going to have to shout from IT Conversations, another pioneer celebrating your third anniversary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's right. We came up here to Petaluma just to celebrate. ITConversations.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Learning from Dvorak. Three years. Now podcasting is not even two years old. That's correct. That's saying quite a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We try and claim that we are the oldest still running podcast. Now that ignores the fact that people like you were doing audio way before podcasting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who would take Pride a place older than you? That came out wrong. What podcast is older than, I mean, was there something that isn't running anymore that is actually older?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, Chris Leiden did the first podcast, I think, which was an MP3 attached to an RSS feed. That makes it a podcast. Right. But that show's gone.  So we get the name of that show. Chris Leiden. Good name. I don't know. The eponymous Chris Leiden.  Well, he was fired from a public radio station back east, and he did his own shows. That's right. Did some interviews. Great interviews. That's right.  And then so that became the first podcast. We should get him on. Whatever happened to him. He's great. Oh, I saw him about two months ago back in Boston.  He's doing a show called Open Source. It's on public radio and podcast as well. Very good show. Good. Open Source is not a good name for a radio show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it confuses everything. Yeah. And also here from CNET and Buzz Out Loud. We're always glad to have Molly Wood join us. Hey, Molly. Hello.  Buzz.Cnet.com. Is everyone doing that? Buzz.Cnet.com. I'm looking at, I'm watching, I went to the CNET reviews page and you have the world's most massive laptop in front of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What the hell is that? That thing is huge. It's a new, it's kind of a concept laptop from Dell, the XPS M2010. Looks like the Andre the giant of laptops. It's unbelievable.  It's so strange. And it weighs almost 20 pounds. Like it actually, I mean, it was hard for me to carry. Great. We're going back to the days of the Compaq and the sewing machine. What's the point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's more of a lifestyle machine than a true notebook. Essentially it's a desktop with a 20 inch monitor you can sort of strap onto it and take to the beach for the weekend or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If that's a laptop, I want to see the lab. You know, it's interesting though. It has a detachable kind of Bluetooth keyboard and a bunch of like a remote control that actually lets you control the cursor from across the room.  I can see it actually working pretty well as a computer plus television plus stereo in like a dorm room. Oh, that's maybe that's the market except it's $3,500. So that's clearly not the market.  So is it sale or is it pure concept or is it actually for sale? I think it is for sale. I assume it's only concept in the sense that they're going to see if anyone would actually buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow. Well, $3,500. I think they're going to be making one or two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I think it's disturbing how often products like that sell in ridiculous amounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The problem is it just doesn't, maybe it was the way you were demonstrating it, Molly, but it just didn't look, it looked ungainly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is incredibly ungainly. It's like a suitcase. I mean, when I walked around with it, I felt like I was selling encyclopedias.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a loser. It's not going to sell 10 copies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And there goes the Dell advertising campaign. We're hoping to launch next week.  Actually, they won't get back to us. So I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, you know, I've done the other hand, Dell's got some nice little guys that are lightweight.  So too late, John. Don't try to save it. No, but we never let people try these big clunkers.  I mean, even some micro systems made one of them. They suck. It's a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't understand. I don't even understand the motivation to do it, frankly, because you guys are never done sales.  You would do this and say, oh, yeah. So you would arrive at the at the clients with this massive laptop and you'd unfold it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, do you have any idea how many vendor meetings I've been to where the vendors are traveling around with a full sized desktop machine and a monitor?  Still today, even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's so much easier to bring one of those lightweight projectors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Those are cool, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you don't have a dark room or, you know, too dark enough room and an empty wall to point it at, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So we took a week off for Memorial Day weekend, which means we really have two weeks worth of news we can do.  I don't know if we care about going back to the good old days. Why don't we start with the actually the most recent story?  It's one that Patrick brought up. And you're going to have to fill me in because I don't know much about it.  You were talking about a meeting with the ISPs. What was the story? I don't remember.  Was it Molly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was pretty good. So CNET actually broke the story. CNET and the USA Today.  A week ago, the attorney general, the guy that runs the FBI sat down with a bunch of ISPs, including, I believe, you know, basically reps from everybody from Microsoft and Comcast.  AOL, Verizon.  And said, we want you to we wanted you to do us a favor. We want you to hold all the records for everybody.  Everybody wants to hold all the records for everybody's downloading and search habits for two years.  Yeah. And then Friday, you know, the day before yesterday, Friday, they were supposed to sit down and sort of start hammering out the details about what they wanted retained.  And the undertone was it was the reports were really interesting to read because the undertone was that they wanted the ISPs to voluntarily do this or they would hammer through legislation to make it law.  They want this they want this information subpoena. Is that a word, John?  Subpoena. It rolls off the tongue. I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It feels so subpoena. Licious subpoena. Licious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The subpoena colony for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And in Canada, they won't let you register that as a domain name if it upsets anyone.  But the subpoena. No, there's a whole fura about anyhow.  It's a political thing. Somebody managed to use their political poll to get a site, the DNS information, register information for a website that was critical of their candidates.  Oh, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So our esteemed attorney general seems to be really kind of backward on privacy rights, I have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if he's not looking at it, it was from what the, you know, jump in any time, Molly, but apparently from what some of the people responding who were at the meeting said is like, Gonzales starts the meeting and immediately throws up a bunch of pictures of a child porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. This isn't about child porn. They want to see who's going to vote for Bush.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I understand that, John, but it's like the next thing they do is they're talking about how it's all about, you know, tracking potential terrorists or being able to pursue terrorists.  And then at the tail end of the meeting, it's like, well, we'd also, you know, we'd definitely be using this for intellectual property cases.  That's who's pushing it. It has nothing to do with terrorists. It's Hollywood.  Yeah. And the general consensus, it would be like whatever they wanted to use it for to gather evidence for federal, you know, and or I suppose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's pretty disturbing. It's pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You go ahead. They pull up, you know, the most sensational pictures they can terrorists, child pornographers.  And that's what they always do when they want to reduce human rights or civil rights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They say, and they've been absolutely hammering on this terrorism argument that, you know, we have to use this to catch terrorists and we have to use this to catch child pornographers.  And the feeling in Washington, from what I've heard from various sort of Internet lobbyists, is that they've got a lot of tools at their disposal that they're currently not using.  There are a lot of child porn laws that aren't currently being enforced.  And they, you know, they know that they don't have the congressional mandate to require ISPs and telcos to keep this data.  But I can't imagine how unnerving it would be as one of these companies to be in a position of saying like, OK, obviously, we don't want to do this.  But what are going to what's going to be the retaliation? What's going to be the result if we if we don't?  It was 16. Microsoft had a pretty good comment, actually, in response.  They sort of said, we really respect what you're saying and we're not going to do that.  Good. So at this point, it's just sort of like, well, who's going to do it first?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But wasn't it about 15 shows ago that we had Dane Jasper, the CEO of Sonic.net, the small ISP up here, who said that they've been trying to get, you know, carnivore and these other boxes in ISPs for ages.  What's new about this? Is this new?  And retaining information? How is that different from them looking at everything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't you think it's very different because they're putting the burden of storing like, let's say, if you're talking about two years of the search and an IP request from from for every user, you're talking about a pretty insane, you know, archival issue.  Right. It's different from the point of view of the ISPs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But from a privacy point of view, if the ISP stores it or the FBI stores, it doesn't really much matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It wasn't just data retention. I mean, it would be it would be literally search terms.  It would be emails, not necessarily, they say, the content of emails, but who those emails were sent to and when and how often, possibly instant instant messaging correspondence like ISPs turning over your buddy lists, essentially.  I mean, it is an extreme amount of data way beyond kind of what they already can look at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they were saying they would have to they would have to file a subpoena to get this information, but they just wanted the ISPs to sit on it.  The idea of having this sitting around in an ISP, I think, creeps me out more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or they would just institute a wiretapping program and get it without a subpoena.  I mean, that's the unnerving part, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like, yeah, but wire. I mean, in this case, they'd actually have to break into the ISP to do the wiretapping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or they could get the ISP to pull an AT&T and funnel it directly to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's well, without a subpoena.  But most of the ISPs have been pretty amenable to that in the past.  Yeah, well, they can get the data.  The search engines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not going to be a problem to get the data.  What I think is being overlooked in this argument, which I actually mentioned in the Market Watch column some weeks ago, is that the ability to use this kind of information with some data mining tools to figure out mergers and acquisitions before they happen.  So you can make a killing in the stock market is, I think, the real goal of this.  Wait a minute.  Trying to find people who are going to vote against you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You think Alberto Gonzalez is looking for market tips?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, this is how Google made all its money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now that's a conspiracy theory. I'm liking this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a 90 degree turn from where we were headed, I think. At least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They just want to make some money.  AGs just want to have fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I guess it's sort of regard. They clearly want to do something that is most likely untoward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And don't forget, you can also, this is a great way to identify your political enemies.  I mean, you know, we might as well just all move to Venezuela.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, maybe I'm just getting paranoid, but I have to say I just feel the grip tightening every day, further and further from this administration.  And I have to say the more we talk about it, the more I feel like we're going to get a knock on the door or we're going to get audited or hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hello.  Run, Leo. Run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Get out. Save yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's just scary.  Here's another story that's related, I guess, in a way, you know, Pirate Bay, the Pirate Bay in Sweden, which is kind of the historically the most rude of all the BitTorrent tracker sites.  They whenever they get a cease and desist or DMCA request, they just post it online and mock it.  We're rated Swedish police.  And I just for some reason see these guys from the Muppet Show going, for the very near by the given.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Give us your server.  They came in, they shut the place down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some say all the Swedes out there send your email.  I already got an email on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We have a lot of Swedish listeners and I know that this is inappropriate, but it's just I can't I can't help it.  I just see the Muppets in any event, which is, you know, I'm sure that the Swedish police are just as mean and nasty as police anywhere.  But, you know, I just they seem to be police are very helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo, we're just trying to do good things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wouldn't want to live in a world without police.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they basically they went and they yanked all the servers and inadvertently yanked the servers running some other web pages in the process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and then the irony is that Pirate Bay is back up.  Back up.  Offshore.  Didn't take too long.  They said they would be up within days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they continue to claim that they're doing nothing illegal under Swedish law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Doesn't take much to move a server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the interesting thing is that under Swedish law, even if they are found to be violating copyright, I mean, it sounds like the Swedish police served seized about 200 servers, only two or three of which were actually running the Pirate Bay site.  And even if they are found to be violating copyright under Swedish law, that's punishable by a fine.  So there's sort of a big question about what you know, what prompted this massive sort of SWAT team style raid?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, there's a lot of contention that the U.S.  government put Hollywood and the recording industry put pressure on the U.S.  government.  The U.S. government makes a call to the Swedish government.  The Swedish government calls the Swedish police and goes for David and Barbara.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's how it happened.  Leo at Leoville.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you very much.  I guess they are looking at their site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, I like the picture of the ship shooting big cannonballs at the Hollywood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, these guys, these guys really have always won my vote for just sheer ballsiness.  You know, they have an entire anti-piracy bureau.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One million registered users.  Holy mackerel.  Well, what do you mean an anti-piracy bureau?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What does that mean?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's got a bunch of letters in it with those weird symbols above it.  I have no idea.  Anti-Pirate Byron, the Swedish anti-piracy bureau.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you really want to have fun, read, click on the bottom there where it says legal threats.  Those are so rude.  Great.  Just, you know, the email from DreamWorks, for instance, and then our response.  Oh, these are 404.  I like Microsoft email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We get tons of these.  Tons of these.  They're so bold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what?  These are all 404-ing.  I have a feeling they haven't got all the servers up.  But this is the best, frankly, the best part, if you ask me.  And they'll say things like, you must mistake us for somebody who lives in America.  Or your lawyers must be taking your money because it's not illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I get for users, for listeners out there, the URL is thepiratebay.org.  And that's all one word without a www.  At least I don't, maybe there's www, too.  But it's thepiratebay.org if you want to have fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The graph at the bottom of the legal threats page is always so much fun.  And it's like nice graphs for the law firms that don't get the hint above.  Threats rising, torrents deleted, remains at zero.  At zero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Although maybe they can't say that anymore.  I don't know.  They say we've never carried any pirate files.  We just have torrent, you know, torrent metafiles.  Well, that's also like saying I don't traffic and stolen goods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just tell you where to buy them.  They aid in a bet.  You know, but then you get into the whole international law versus American law  versus what's, you know, how does copyright get applied?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I have to admit, I mean, they are, these guys really are promoting piracy.  They make no bones about that.  Oh, yeah, look at the stuff they got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I hate to say it, but I've actually never been on this site until now.  They've got a lot of stuff here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you, RIA.  Corey Sherman has helped us find new sources.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's considered to be like the premier, you know, public torrent site.  It's the one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it's the one that never went down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, when Loki torrent went down with the MPAA threats,  all of the trackers in the U.S. went down,  the Pirate Bay stayed open.  And frankly, I always thought, you know, these guys are the champions of  of whatever free piracy everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting that they're also almost like a sort of, I mean,  they're the forefront of a political movement, too.  There's a pirate party.  That's what I like.  Saying, saying essentially we need to reform intellectual property law.  And it is quite, I mean, there is still that outstanding question of can we  in the U.S. export our intellectual property demands, you know,  our sort of particularly draconian set of laws, at least right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I want to say something in defense of these guys looking at,  I'm looking at some of the offerings or some of the links that they have  to the various torrents.  And in the case of, of course, being a ridiculous nerd, I go to audio books.  But the number two is learn French and the number to number 10 or 11 is learn  Spanish, learn Italian, learn German, learn Russian.  This or this is a benefit to society.  Educational.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, John, we're going to take everything you've written and later on we're  going to take everything out of your house and we're going to give it to all  the needy people in the Bay because it's a benefit to society.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And of course, if you go to movies, you see that the first movie is X-Men,  the Last Stand, the second one is the Da Vinci Code, the third one is Mission  Impossible 3.  I challenge anybody to try to download these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'll never come over.  Well, even if you get it.  John, they will all come over.  How would you know, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have friends in law enforcement that assure me that they work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, so the cops are, you know, Patrick, the way I see it, it works.  Victoria works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And people wonder why Victoria gets a bad rap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, this is law enforcement.  That's a good one.  He does.  He has friends all over.  I'm sure he does.  He doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, Patrick, I was in Indianapolis over the weekend and the chief of police  said to say hi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thanks, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This really is BitTorrent's biggest problem because the technology is  obviously lumped in with the use of the technology and it can't really make  progress as long as this is going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love that the Motion Picture Association on the one hand is shutting these  trackers down.  On the other hand, is giving Braham Cohn money and basically co-opting BitTorrent  for their own purposes.  So they realize they recognize the value of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, we would all like to see BitTorrent built into our clients.  And how's that going to happen as long as this kind of stuff is going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are actually a number of companies that have already, like, im.com has  BitTorrent downloads built into their video client and a number of other.  There's a couple of video companies that are using it for distribution.  And it's also being developed for, actually, for a really interesting thing.  On some of the cell phone, companies are playing around with using a version of  it to distribute their downloads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But Michael Gohagan, wouldn't you like to have iTunes support appear, some sort  of peer to peer?  I mean, how much band?  What's your bandwidth building?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I've got the same deal you do through AOL.  Oh, you don't have to worry.  But, you know, for some of the other stuff we do, it's a problem.  We hide the files in different places.  And, you know, some of the clients actually have it built in.  But obviously the main player, iTunes, it should be in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How about you, Doug?  I know you actually were starting to face a real bandwidth crisis.  It was IT conversations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, we're doing OK right now.  But ultimately, I...  You do like a hundred podcasts a week, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, you're kind of crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but we have a limelight who helped us out.  We have a partner, yeah.  But as we're expanding, we're going to be up against the same problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It would be so much better if you had BitTorrent built into a major client like iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but the biggest problem is that, of course, Apple's got such close relationships  with the intellectual property people, I don't think they could ever do it.  No.  Because that just wouldn't be possible.  But is it...  Is it...  Am I making this up or are we supposed to be getting BitTorrent in Firefox?  Patrick, do you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've heard that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've heard it, but I haven't seen it.  Yeah, I haven't seen sort of official confirmations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I never heard it.  I've heard it.  All right, well, maybe that's just one of my dreams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  One of my dreams.  I woke up saying, oh, I just feel like it's going to be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm telling you, this pirate thing is...  I'm fascinated by it.  John's enjoying the pirate day.  They got sound clips on here.  Everything.  Remember the old sound effects we used to use, Leo, on the old radio show?  I still have them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I haven't gotten rid of them.  If you want, I'll send you the disc and you can once again make merry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to try to minimize that.  Although the time in Bacava, Belgian Congo is still...  I haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can drop it in any time.  In fact, I think I did on some of the very earliest twits.  I think I might have thrown that in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Opera, getting back to the browser discussion, Opera does have BitTorrent.  Interesting.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Who uses Opera?  The Swedish police.  It all comes back.  Firefox get angry because we don't mention Opera because everything Firefox does, they

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  claim Opera did.  Opera does better.  Firefox is open source and Opera is not.  Yeah.  The other thing, Opera has a problem.  It says that it's not Opera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and it's not a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a good thing.  It's a good thing.  It's a good thing.  It's a good thing.  It's a good thing.  It's a good thing.  It's a good thing.  It's a good thing.  It's a good thing.  It's a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and for people who complain that we don't talk about Opera, we had the president  of Opera on Twitch.  So, whatever his name is.  And we're talking about it now.  Bye, puisquekonen or whatever his name was.  I got it when they were giving away for free.  That was it other than that.  It is free now.  Oh, is it?  It's back to free.  It's back to free.  Yeah.  And still good.  If you use a phone, it's probably still the best browser for a small device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, a lot of CSS experts say it's really the best browser of the three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  And they're doing the Asset Test, which makes it a little unfair, but they and Safari are  the only two browsers to my knowledge that pass it.  The Asset Two Test.  Is that another Yormak Kakanen reference?  Asset Test and Yormak Kakanen.  Yormak Kakorian.  Kakorian, whatever his name is.  Hot Tuna, right?  Oh, no.  Have you guys heard about the All of MP3 developments?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's happening with All of MP3?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, they're much like the Pirate Bay.  They've been squeaking through on a loophole in Russian law offering what they claim to  be legal downloads of major music for pennies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What site is this, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All of MP3.com, John.  But don't go there.  Because your ISP will know and will continue to know for the next two years.  Yeah.  So what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's all you need to say is John, don't go there.  I'm doing it.  I only go to these things as a journalist.  They research them to see exactly what the heck's going on here.  I have to inform the public.  Look, they've got the new Dixie Chicks LP.  It's actually a pretty good defense.  Don't kid yourself.  All of MP3.com.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the thing that bugs me about them, instead of just saying, hey, look, we're stealing  fine, they actually...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This looks like a commercial site.  It really is a commercial site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it is an unbelievably built out product.  I mean, it's so professional looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They call it AllTunes, not iTunes.  It's AllTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And it looks just like iTunes if you download that desktop app.  It's unbelievable.  This is unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Make no mistake.  This is a very professionally run organization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they're busting kids in college for downloading stuff while this thing isn't running?  They can't get these guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John, can I tell you guys about the story?  There was a story related to this.  People have been trying to shut down All of MP3 for a while, but they are exploiting a  really peculiar loophole that basically says that this organization, which may be owned  by them, is collecting royalties.  They have the legal right to sell the music this way.  The New York Times is reporting this week that American negotiators are demanding that  AllOfMP3.com be shut down as a condition of Russia joining the WTO, the World Trade Organization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  The US trade organization has declared it essentially a pirate haven.  And so there were all these, and there had been kind of an open question.  If you just Google All of MP3 legal, you'll find all of these kind of conflicting arguments  with people saying, well, it must be legal.  They say they're paying royalties and we haven't heard anything about it.  And so I think that at least the trade arm of the US government right now is trying to  put the message out there loud and clear that they consider it to be completely illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  If you ask the RIA about it, the RIA says we don't talk about All of MP3.  They do all their international stuff is fed into another, I want to say the IFPA as the  international organization.  And they basically claim it's, they basically say, look, All of MP3 may be paying money  into some account somewhere, but none of it has ever been received by an artist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's a note that says I can confirm the legality of All of MP3.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can legally buy MP3 songs from this site if it does not break the law, the national  legislation of the country in which you will be during that moment.  Sorry for my English.  Yours faithfully, the assistant to the lawyer of the Russian society on multimedia and to  digital networks.  Rom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hey, Moose, listen to Squirrel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Squirrel say he's got a dialect coach.  Now what's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, for an airman, Hey, I'm going to try to get everybody before this show is over.  But this is for this is on some site.  I did what you suggested, Molly.  And this is on some site that talks about the legality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Essentially there's a FAC available on all of MP3.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And essentially the position is it's legal in Russia and it's legal if it's legal in  the country you're in.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So essentially, I think, you know, what most people would argue is it's legal.  It is currently due to this bizarre copyright loophole, legal in Russia.  But is it legal for you in the US to buy this music?  Actually, probably most certainly no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's legal.  Russian copyright legislation allows phonograms, whatever those are, to be performed publicly  over cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you go to the IFPI, which is the international version of the RIAA, they don't like it.  No, actually, it's now they've they've used to be buried.  Like you had to go through one of their annual reports and go to the Eastern European Russian  section like go through 27 pages to find it.  The top story now on the IFPI website is that all of MP3.com setting the record straight.  First paragraph, all of MP3.com is not a legal service, either in Russia or anywhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They say so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting.  The IFPI is saying that all of MP3, the international organization that the RIAA and all of the  world, you know.  So where does the nine senses song?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the news as of June 2nd, in fact, this is like those attorneys that were suing everybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and they'd set up the charity to benefit it.  And you know, the charity money never went anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The site claims to have a license from ROMS, a Russian organization that claims to be collecting  society, yet ROMS has no rights from their record companies whatsoever to license these  pieces of music.  ROMS and all of MP3.com are well aware that record companies have not granted authorization  for this service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, if there's a common thread to the last two stories, it is that you can try to assert  US copyright laws worldwide, but there will always be places where people can do this.  And because the internet is fundamentally global, how are you going to shut this stuff  down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you have the same problem with the Kyoto treaty.  There's a lot of signatories, but it's questionable as to whether, you know, all of the signatories  are even, you know, at least that's a cumulative thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Copyright violation going to become our great diplomatic message of the 21st century.  I mean, that is what is so sort of ridiculous that we're putting so much effort into kind  of politically pressuring these companies over, you know, what is what is certainly  wholesale copyright violation.  But is it the most serious issue facing the international community today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Instead of the white man's burden, it's Harvey Weinberg's burden.  I mean, what's the Weinstein?  You must protect colleagues.  Do you want to do that voice too now, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no.  So call back.  Look, most of these sites, both of these sites actually have kind of numbers of downloads  and the like.  And it's you know, I don't want to be kind of marginalized the whole thing, but the numbers  are rather trivial in the scheme of things compared to the millions and millions of albums  that Britney Spears sells.  Yeah, that's probably true.  Well sold.  How much now that we have like blown the, you know, promoted it.  Britney elements.  Although I'm telling, let me just say this as a disclaimer.  If anyone listening to this broadcast, do not go to these sites.  It's really not.  We're against piracy.  You should not go to these sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You want to give us the URL again, Leo?  All of mp3.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's like we are against piracy.  We are for law enforcement agencies and we love Swedish people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think people should at least be aware that these exist.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The pirate bay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or at least now you know what your kids are doing with your credit cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're wondering about those charges from the Russian mafia, it's all of mp3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe we're supporting terrorism by buying stuff from all of mp3.  Do you ever think of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, probably.  I'm really almost certain that we are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know that when I buy cigarettes without a tax stamp, I'm supporting terrorism.  You smoke?  No, but I like to support terrorism.  So I, you know, I always buy cigarettes whenever I can without tax stamps.  You get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  At some point along the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  At this point, I don't care anymore.  Come and get me copper.  I'm like, I'm like Jimmy Cagney in Public Enemy.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly the same.  Michael, go ahead.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You're slowly creeping out the door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You gonna name Jimmy Cagney for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No.  I know.  I was gonna say there was no copper.  Copper.  Come and get me copper.  King of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now see, I was under the impression that most of these sites were dark.  I didn't, yeah, I feel kind of dumb now that I didn't know about these two sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think that's what the RIA would like you to think.  I think that's what the MPIA would like you to think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why all of MP3 is so scary to them because really you would not ever, I mean  there's no sex ads lined up along either side.  No, it's pro.  Have naked women.  I mean it looks like a legitimate business.  There's no reason for you as a consumer to end up there and think this must be against  the law.  It's got this great iTunes like product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, this reminds me of when I last time I visited Malaysia.  You go to a big mall there and they're selling, openly selling DVDs with all the right packaging  and the whole thing and you can actually view them there to make sure they're good ones.  These are excellent copies and they sell them right out in the open and you can come back  and if anybody would question that you're bringing these bootleg discs back and I assume  they are, but I don't really know.  There's no way to really tell because it seems to be, I can see where people would think,  The only thing I can say is the prices are cheap.  I don't think anything because they're like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then how on earth would those DVD sniffing dogs for FedEx ever know the difference between  that DVD and a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's DVD sniffing dogs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  Didn't we do that story a couple weeks ago?  I think it was two weeks ago.  What are they looking for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are they looking for polycarbonate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What are they sniffing for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well I don't know.  FedEx hasn't really said, they just said that somehow they have these magical DVD sniffing  dogs that know the difference between a pirated DVD and a non-pirated DVD.  So they can open up your mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that they can, it's possible that some of the, you know, those writable DVDs  might be odorous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the only thing I can think of.  They're actually, no, they're just identifying packages containing DVDs.  Yeah, they're sniffing for polycarbonate.  This actually, it's happening in Britain.  They are using, there was a trial of dogs and packages containing DVDs were opened and  inspected to see if they were legitimate shipments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just think it's great that one of the featured bands is Thievery Corporation.  I saw that at all of mp3.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're a pretty old, that's actually a pretty old punk band.  They've been around for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well their time has come now.  What band is this?  Thievery Corporation.  I like them.  They're like quite flag only different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As featured on allmp3.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Microsoft has decided to remove PDFs from Office 2007 after a threat of a lawsuit from  Adobe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Adobe wants you to keep using their miserable reader software for as long as possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This makes me mad because, well it also puzzles me because one of the beauties of OS X is  PDF is built in throughout the entire OS.  What are they paying a license fee?  What's the deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why are you puzzled?  How are they doing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why is it that Adobe doesn't want Microsoft to do it but isn't doing anything about Apple  doing it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an open standard for everyone but Microsoft.  Microsoft is the only organization that's not allowed to use the open specs for the  Adobe reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's like in the law and then they're copyrighted?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no.  Essentially they open sourced the ability to build your own reader and then they sued  Microsoft when Microsoft started to integrate the technology into the, or threatened to  sue Microsoft when Microsoft tried to integrate.  This is something you're almost never going to hear.  I'm defending Microsoft from being bullied by another company.  I think you're right.  I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is it because of market share that they don't worry about Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Adobe's afraid that if they don't have a reader on everybody's desktops then,  or I can't think of the name of the really cool free reader for Adobe.  Excuse me, not that Adobe reader isn't free but the not suffering through.  The not a free reader, yeah.  Adobe pain in the ass downloading everything every five minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Their fear is that if this is included in everything that the average consumer uses  nobody's actually going to purchase the Adobe product?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  What's going to happen is nobody's going to know who Adobe is except for professional  Photoshop users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My puzzlement is, I don't understand, if you open source it, you open source it.  If it's an open standard how can they stop Microsoft?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, that's the crux of what makes this a fascinating story, Leo.  It's basically, it seems to be an open standard as long as Microsoft doesn't try to integrate

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the technology.  They wanted to pursue it in the EU which maybe means that there is some sort of difference.  The antitrust action is still going on.  Maybe that's what they're going to do.  In fact, I think it is what they're going to do is threaten antitrust action.  They're not saying, it's basically blackmail.  They're saying if you use PDF we're going to raise this issue in the EU where you're  still up on antitrust charges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're essentially telling Microsoft how to build its own product because what they  want to do is allow you in office to save Word, Excel and PowerPoint as PDFs.  Adobe is saying, yeah, and Adobe is saying no, we're threatening antitrust action unless  you remove that feature from office and offer it separately for a fee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and what's funny is they've been negotiating on this.  Wall Street Journal says they've been negotiating this for like four months and finally Adobe  just broke down and said, uh-uh, you put it in there we're going to hit you with an antitrust  lawsuit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I have to say I'm with you, Patrick, on defending Microsoft in this.  It is unbelievable.  It's extortion, it strikes me.  No, didn't I get in trouble for saying something was extortion?  Yeah, you want to watch that one.  It's not extortion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We are not suggesting that Adobe is extorting.  We are suggesting that Adobe's behavior regarding Microsoft is a little strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's undue pressure using, I think, something kind of really unrelated.  They're saying we're going to cause trouble for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So it's only not good if you're a monopoly.  It's perfectly legal for everybody else to do this.  Well, that's right.  It's only Microsoft.  Exactly, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if you're huge then you have to, you can't use our PDF free, which we made and distributed  to other people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Microsoft should just go and put out some sort of a public patch through a third party  that does the whole thing on the side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing.  You can download free programs that do this now on this cute PDF.  There's a lot of good PDF programs.  Adobe spokesperson Holly Campbell said that Adobe is concerned Microsoft might attempt  to use its influence in the PC software space to quash competition, starting with the inclusion  of the PDF format in Office 2007.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It seems to me that they should be more worried that Microsoft would build and distribute  and evangelize an alternative format.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you think that's what's going on underneath?  I mean, isn't Microsoft also building a competitor to JPEG?  They were.  Yeah, also to PDF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They were for a while talking about a portable document.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They backed away a little bit from the...  Did they?  Well, this would encourage them to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, if Adobe keeps this up, you'd think that Microsoft would say, all right then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but you've got to remember something on the flip side for the alternative for JPEG,  until the JPEG lawsuit...  I can't think of the name of the company that was suing everybody for rights to JPEG.  Until that was thrown out by the Supreme Court, it was actually a pretty smart business move  for Microsoft to have a complete alternative to JPEG lined up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Was this ping or was this something else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it was an internal...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a new...  It's like Windows Media Image file or something, but it's cropped up again just within the  last couple of days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I rescind that statement.  They could have just gone to ping, but maybe they thought it wasn't good enough.  Yeah, that's...  With the JPEG threat, where they might want an alternate, that would be an equivalent  to JPEG.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We had the whole thing with a copy, serve and gift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a Sperry or somebody had the gift license.  Yeah, that was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wait until somebody decides to go after MP3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What will that do?  Well, Fraunhofer owns it.  I don't suppose...  I mean, I don't think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, everybody...  I mean, it's all licensed.  All the MP3 stuff is licensed.  So, pity the poor...  You guys see this...  Go ahead.  I actually have to scoot for dinner, but if you guys seen the article, Slash.posted a  link.  Remember the shortwave stations that were always broadcasting numbers that everybody  assumed was CIA type organizations blasting them out?  Well, someone's apparently putting number stations on VoIP so that you can call in to  a VoIP, to this VoIP number and actually listen to the...  Yeah, and listen to the numbers as they're being broadcasted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is this like the lottery numbers, the numbers racket numbers?  Is that what you're talking about?  What are these numbers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  For years and years and years, you can tune into certain shortwave channels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it tier one, two, three?  Ham radio is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, ham radio enthusiasts refer to them as number stations, right?  Nobody really knows...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like a test signal or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where it's coming from, but they're basically...  They're usually...  They're either reading streams of numbers or of words or of letters.  And sometimes, mechanically generated voices, sometimes there's in different languages.  It could be children, it could be male, it could be female.  A lot of the assumptions is that they're communications used to send messages to spies, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh yeah, if you just keep doing it, there must be something in data...  Somebody's getting ready to release that as a podcast, actually.  That's a big great Z512.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're a big guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a couple...  There's actually...  You can now actually dial in...  There's a couple...  There's at least two VoIP numbers you can dial in to and hear these numbers.  You hear the pre-recorded message that's there.  Sure, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I bet it is for spies or whatever, but...  Aliens, it's coming from another planet.  How would you get a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  It's a known fact that these are the way that people have been communicating with the flying saucers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've been hanging out in Perump again.  You've been hanging out with Art Bell again, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  John's living in a double whine in Perump.  People don't know this.  Actually, didn't Art Bell move to the Philippines?  He got a Filipino wife and he's in the Philippines now.  There is actually a space, a lot available in Perump, if anybody wants to move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this obviously begs for a Wikipedia search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm moving there.  What's for dinner tonight, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I'm going to...  I don't know if I'm going to go for the chowder at one of the places down here or if I'm going  to go for a cheesesteak.  I've been jamming on Eastern European food and kosher food and pizza.  It's just so much better in New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do the cheesesteak so I don't have to, Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  For you, I will do this.  Get the big peppers, though.  I like the big peppers.  Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here we go.  At the same time, Art Bell announced leaving his longtime homestead in Nevada, relocating  to the Philippines where he will continue to host coast to coast AM weekend editions  via an ISDN connection.  Isn't that amazing?  We could do that, too.  So as of early June 2006, he has not returned to his hosting duties.  He left on April 29, 2006 and is expected to remain there for at least a year.  And apparently he owns a radio station, KYE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He sadly leaves the whorehouses, the fireworks factories and the casinos in Pahrump now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, Pahrump has become a bedroom community for Las Vegas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can't wait to put this in the show notes.  Oh, brother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's a couple races I'm in that start in Pahrump.  Yeah, Spring Valley.  Because the Trump, excuse me, the Herbst family also.  Do you do these races?  I used to race cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's Spring Valley.  There's a racetrack out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Finally, somebody Patrick can talk to.  Well, he's talking about off-road races.  Yeah, very different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like all of the stupidity of road racing with like added pain and trauma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do you want to go now to dinner or do you want to hang out for a little longer?  I want to hang out, but I'm going to scamper to go to dinner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you all for letting me join in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's always a pleasure, Patrick.  We will see you on June 16th, right?  At Yahoo.  Yes.  We are doing a special edition of This Week in Tech Live from Yahoo for part of Podcast  Academy 3.  And Patrick will be part of the panel along with me and Doug Kay.  And we're hoping to get Woz and Alex Lindsay.  And we're going to have a nice group of people.  So it will be fun.  We'll see you then.  And I'm still working on trying to get together.  And we'll see next Friday if I can.  We're going to do the tweet from the Apple Store if we can get in there because Vlogger  Con is in San Francisco, the first convention of video podcasters, people like Andrew Cogden  and Amanda of Rocket Boom and Cali.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought Rocket Boom had decided it was IPTV and not a blog anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know what it is.  Now it's got imitators.  What is this called?  Is that vloggercon.org?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Vlogger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  V-L-O-G-G-E-R.  Oh, vlogger.  Yeah, so that's going to be a big event.  If we can, we're hoping to get...  It just rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?  Vlog.  What a terrible word.  Vlog.  Someone's about to vlog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can see why someone would choose IPTV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, you're a vlogger.  I guess I sort of am a vlogger.  I know Patrick's a vlogger.  It's not so much a vlog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've never been to Vlogger Con.  Yeah, you're in DLTV's masses.  I mean, you're probably one of the big ones, the big players in this.  No, this is yet another conference.  I have no knowledge of and haven't been invited to be a media sponsor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this the term that they've settled on for video podcast?  Vlogger, videocast, vlogger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought vodcast was okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think vodcast is a little better.  Well, vlogger is also somewhat limiting because it implies sort of the blog thing.  Yeah, that's a bad...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it sounds like an Eastern European mishmash.  What is a vlogger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's extremely gutted.  What's the time you spell this video blog word?  V-L-O.  Vlogger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just vlogger with a V.  V-L-O-G-G-E-R.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've seen this at the Swedish American Hall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's so funny.  Yeah, I'm sure you've been to a few punk concerts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It all comes back to Sweden.  It's a vlogger con.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It all goes back to TSOL with Patrick and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Meatballs galore.  And Swedish vlogger means true love, so there you go.  Do you have a voice for that?  No, no, yeah, I do.  I'll save that for my other podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's a lot going on on the West Coast at the end of the month.  We've got vlogger con, there's a blogger con, there's supernova, there's up north, there's  gnome decks.  When's gnome decks?  Gnome decks is at the very end of June.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I talked to Chris a year ago and he was thinking of bringing all of us together to do a gnome  decks, but I guess...  He's still doing it, but he's not bringing you.  Not bringing me?  I don't know.  I was one once.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  A long time ago.  Many years ago.  I don't know what the last weekend of the month is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Patrick, we'll let you go have your cheesesteak and thank you for joining us.  dl.tv is the place.  You'll be back next week with more...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What do they do?  Do they keep doing shows if you're not around?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually pre-taped one.  We pre-taped one with Robert to roll Tuesday and then our next live one is on Thursday next  week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We'll have a nice vacation.  You deserve it.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If anybody has the word on vlogger con, let me know at dl.tv at ziffdavis.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sure they'd love to have you there.  I'll tell you what, I'll let you know if we do get the Apple Store for Friday and you  can be a part of it.  It's part of their...  They have a Meet the Vlog...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't have, you know, not to interrupt, but I will.  I don't have a lot of confidence in a conference when you type vlogger con into Google and  it doesn't show up anywhere.  Oh, I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If it's all one word, if you type it in as all one word, then it's the third link.  Oh.  Yeah.  After vlogger con dot blog spot dot com.  This is all too expectable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, Chad's rapidly turning into the little old man who can't figure this stuff out.  You know how I see it?  It stinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't like it.  It stinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No matter what.  I'm furious.  This is too slick for my taste.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Too slick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, now it's too slick.  First you couldn't find it, now it's too slick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  This is not your average tech conference, kids.  Thank you, Patrick.  Yeah.  Take care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What kind of a term is this?  I'll drop you off so you don't have to be subjected to any more of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Bye, Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, I pity the poor Vonage customers who thought they were getting a deal on the big IPO at  The Vonage stock tanks to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would pity them, except they really thought they were getting a good deal.  A company that has never been profitable has said it will never be profitable and really  has no plan to become profitable.  So, everybody got excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Can you say lawsuits though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, now Vonage is saying, no, even though our stock is now down to below $12, you still  have to buy it at $17.  Probably an SEC rule of some kind, but I just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry, can you try to re-explain the story again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, Vonage went public a couple of weeks ago and made an offer.  I thought at the time seemed very generous.  We would love for those 10,000 customers that are really good customers, we're going to  give you an offer.  The stock at the going off price, at the initial offering price of what turned out to be $17.  And a lot of people took them up on this deal.  One little problem, by the end of the day, the stock had dropped down to $12 and these  people were stuck buying it at $17.  Well, Vonage...  Yeah, that happens.  Vonage did have...  It's called the stock market.  Vonage announced this week that customers who had made that agreement must follow through  and buy the shares even though they're worth a heck of a lot more or less, I should say.  Of course, they would have been happy to buy them, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So in other words, wait a minute, let me get this straight.  So Vonage made this offer and they didn't collect the money beforehand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, apparently they had a commitment and now they got to fulfill it, but if it had  gone up, we'd be complaining.  A commitment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does this sound like a public radio?  I pledge $17 for a spare...  Forget it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not surprising to note that they have, as of today, already been sued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I'm not surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A class action lawsuit claiming that they violated securities law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But first of all, the greed of the people who bought.  You're right, Molly, it was dumb.  If they had done a little research, they would have realized it was a terrible deal anyway.  But they were rubbing their hands with glee.  They really were.  And now they're saying, well, but wait a minute, we're going to lose money in the stock market?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know, it's not the dot com days anymore.  You can't just go public with $500 million in debt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Same thing in the prospectus, though, which is apparently, I don't know anything about  this, but they say the news reports, Mercury News says it's unusual that there is a clause  in the prospectus that says that Vonage will indemnify the banks for any losses arising  from customers who refuse to pay for their shares.  So it may be that Vonage, it may be the banks demanded this upfront or that Vonage knew  this would happen and was preparing an out.  I'm sure that law requires that.  Otherwise, it's called a buyback if they agree to buy the stock at a higher price or not  to make them buy it.  I just guarantee it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, the Vonage is going to have to take it out of the proceeds and pay back the investment  bankers.  But it reminds me of whenever that was when Lycos first went public and I saw that prospectus.  How many years ago was that, Leo?  And I just remember reading, the company has no revenues and has no prospect of revenue  in the foreseeable future.  What's going on here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is not a forward looking statement, but we're nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think, you know, actually, unfortunately, perhaps these people will have a good case  for a lawsuit.  You think so?  Yeah, because they basically are going to be able to claim that they were misled by  management or misled by the investment bankers.  And those hold up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What their lawsuit says now is that apparently there is a securities law that requires that  the purchase of or sale of its securities to a customer must have a reasonable basis  for believing that the recommendation is suitable for the customer.  So the crux is...  I mean, I think if your own prospectus says you're not going to be profitable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The crux is, did they recommend it or merely offer it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right.  But using an underwriting bank is almost by virtue of what it does, it's recommending.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, these things are always written up by lawyers.  I'm sure they didn't do anything wrong in that regard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but we'll see.  We'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We shall see.  I love that there's a Reuter story today too that the headline is, or from June 2nd, Vonage  debut shows IPOs need profitable outlook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thank you, Captain Obvious.  No kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll be darned.  You know, I think that Vonage, they missed their window.  They could have, I think, been a very successful IPO if they had done this long before Google  Talk and Skype and all this other stuff came around.  Well, do you think they'll be successful long term?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What do you think is the future for Vonage?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Too much competition.  Too easy to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Too easy to do.  Too much free competition.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and you're up against AT&T, Call Vantage, and there's several hundred VoIP providers.  There's Sunrocket, I mean, there's just dozens of these guys.  No, hundreds of these guys.  Speaking of competitive arenas, Microsoft has, I'm sorry, Patrick left because I'm  sure he would have something to say about this.  OneCare is now official and you can buy it.  $49 a year, protect up to three computers, antivirus, anti-spyware.  It's kind of ironic that the company that made the broken operating system that needed  OneCare in the first place now charges $50 to protect it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's, it really is a hard pill to swallow.  And Macrophage, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everybody's been complaining about this.  It's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I mean, to defend them, I mean, the problem exists at least.  And I think a lot of people will buy the solution at $50 a year, protects three computers if  you're buying a new computer.  I think a lot of people, it's cheaper than, you know, anti-spyware, antivirus.  Is this something you install or what is this?  Yeah, well, it's online.  It is.  It's Microsoft Defender.  It's an antivirus that they've acquired.  And, you know, it's automatically updated.  And I think because it comes from Microsoft, that's the real issue is that, you know, companies  like McAfee say, well, we're going to do it.  We're going to do that, too.  But why would you buy it from Symantec or McAfee, both of whom are going to do it when  you can buy it from the company that made the OS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a company that broke it in the first place.  They're probably in the best position to be able to fix it.  They're in good shape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're in good shape.  You know, there's an interesting story that did not completely change the subject, but  I thought this was kind of fascinating is that Canon announced that they're going to  stop developing these inexpensive digital cameras.  They've decided to just basically go along with their, just essentially take over the  high end of the market and not worry about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's interesting.  So even the little point and shoots, they're not going to do those.  They're only going to do the digital SLRs or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the digital.  Well, I mean, they own that market now, the digital SLR.  It's very profitable.  You can sell a lot of lenses and they're expensive and they have all the things that you want  to make money.  Those little cameras are, and especially Canon never made a good little one anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's funny because I just bought a Canon SD 630.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You just bought a little Canon?  Yeah.  That was a mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, is that what they said really?  I thought they said they were going to stop making SLRs that were not digital.  I think those Canon power shots are like some of the most popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you're right.  I misread the story.  Yeah, those Canon power shots.  That's completely the opposite.  Exactly.  We're getting out of the film business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What you heard was my prediction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm telling you, Canon is going to stop making those little cameras.  You might be right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was sitting here all shy like, well, it is John Dvorak.  I don't know if I can jump in here.  You must know what he's talking about.  I just wing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm at living most of the time.  But I think I know how to read.  Well, I'm just thrilled because, you know.  Oh yeah, we got to work Molly into the routine.  Geez.  What's the matter with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm new.  I'm new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm stuck being too polite.  So what is the difference between the two?  I'm new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm new.  I'm stuck being too polite.  So what is the difference between the two?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The story is that they've essentially stopped making their old-fashioned cameras.  They're going to stop making film.  They're going to stop developing new film cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they will still support.  This is kind of one of the things that was misreported when this first came out.  They're still going to be supporting their old kind of film ones.  They're just not going to end up selling them for a little while, you know.  Maybe another year, year and a half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, can't you use those lenses on the digital ones too?  Yeah, you can.  They're all universal.  So why not support them?  They're still a market point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, Canon actually did the smart thing with their DLSRs, DSLRs, which was to develop  lenses specifically for them.  Whereas Nikon really took a while to figure that out.  They had, Nikon stuck with the, well, we're going to use our lenses.  They're universal.  You can use them on the old film camera and you can use them on the new camera.  And it's really a dead end because those old film cameras are, I mean, everyone's going  to stop making them.  Let's face it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Those things are...  Well, they adopted that lens mount a couple years ago.  That was a big step for them.  You had to go buy new lenses.  Canon?  Yeah, Canon a couple years back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it's a smart mount, right?  So it has the sensors built in and all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you know, I've got two or three.  I mean, I love them.  They're great.  And I'm not even a pro photographer.  It's just the gadget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's interesting to see how Canon has really moved forward in the digital market to kind  of take first place and put Nikon kind of in the back seat a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is interesting.  Although I have a Nikon D70 and I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Me too.  It's my favorite camera.  Oh, I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I love it.  You have a D70, a film camera?  No, no, no.  The D70.  So there's this thing called digital.  Oh, the digital D70.  I'm sorry.  D70.  I'm thinking of the N70.  No, no, D70.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  D per Walt Mossberg is now D for digital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, well, if Walt says it must be true.  So D70.  You use a D70, isn't that kind of...  It's a pretty...  It's a fairly...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a little high end for a DSLR and I'm not a pro photographer, but I, you know, it's  so worth it.  The colors just are wonderful.  But I will say it is a lot easier, I have found, to swap out the Canon lenses.  Like just the mount is a little less tricky than the Nikon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I've shot with both those cameras, the Nikon high end and the Canon.  I think I hate to say it because I've never been a big fan of them.  I have the Nikons, I have an old N890 and I used to have an F4.  I have to say I think the Canon stuff is unbelievably great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really?  See, I thought the D70 looked better than the Rebel because to me it was between the  D70 and the Rebel because that was a similar price point and I wasn't going to go all the  way up to like the Eos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the D70 was a Rebel killer.  Yeah.  So the D70 to me was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but the Rebel XT is very good.  Is that what you have in mind?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I actually bought one of those and then sold it right away and bought a D10 and  then a D20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they're great cameras.  And I think the XT...  You're right, John, that the first digital Rebel was the first sub $1000 SLR and then  Nikon comes along with the D70 and says, see, we can really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was great market penetration though.  I mean that really was an opportunity for people to get involved in a nice digital camera  that they could swap their lenses on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then, but then the XT, which was the second generation Rebel, really did a good job.  The D70 was faster, it did a much, much nicer job.  I just can't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Plus Rebel is a way cooler name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you had Ruru, was it?  Andre Agassi was the, for a long time, was there as spokesman for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Eos, the Eos system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Any other stories that people have?  Well, that just reminds me...  I got more bogus stories than you wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anything else you'd like to make up, John?  Here's a good one, the Conroe L Core 2 Duo.  I mean, oh, did you hear about this?  By the way, oh, I keep forgetting to do this.  Apparently there's some chip floating around.  I can't remember the number.  It's a 400 series or something like that.  That's a cheap chip.  I got to get the details on this.  But apparently you can overclock this thing and you apparently turn on a dual core mechanism.  The next thing you know, you've got like a $1,500 chip for $150.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Intel's done this before, you know, because of the way they've been sort their chips.  And they're so good, frankly, their manufacture process is so good that they don't have slower  chips.  So in the old days, remember, you could overclock the Celeron's like crazy.  Intel's known for, in fact, taking one die and modifying traces and stuff and making  it be a stupider chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, one of my readers sent me a link to this story and I'm going to just request  that they do this, resend it to me so I can post it.  Because for some reason I dropped the ball on this story and I just can't remember any  of the details and I need to get the link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The highly overclockable, hackable Intel chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it was covered on Tom's hardware.  All right.  We'll see if we can find it.  If you go there, you can find the details.  I'm sure you'll be deluged at dvorak.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what I really need?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What I really need from, I need it, you know, in Reykjavik there's a Hard Rock Cafe.  I believe it's still there.  And I need to get my, I had a sweater that I bought there, which says Hard Rock Reykjavik  and it's a sweater.  It's the only place I know that has sweaters.  Everybody else sells t-shirts and sweatshirts and whatever.  Well, it's Iceland.  You need a sweater.  It's a nice Icelandic sweater.  But it's so old since I haven't been there for so long.  I need somebody to get me, I'll pay for it, but I need somebody to get me a new one.  I'm sure we can arrange that.  And there's got to, we have to have at least one Icelandic listener.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We do because I cannot offend them.  I don't know the Icelandic accent.  So we actually haven't chased off our Icelandic listeners.  It's probably like, gibberish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's not.  Actually, it's a little more, I would say it's a little more like a kind of a split  between a Finn and a Norwegian and a Danish accent, if you can imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Can you do that for us, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  He wants a sweater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wish.  Can you just do it in phonemes?  You'd be rich if you could do that, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did this O'Reilly trademark Web 2.0 thing blow over yet?  We didn't talk about that.  And we should talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I was going to say, we're talking about Walt Mossberg in D. I wonder if he registers D  as a trademark and none of us can use the letter D again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So O'Reilly, now actually it really isn't, I don't blame O'Reilly on this.  I blame IDG conferences.  But IDG conferences does a conference with O'Reilly called Web 2.0.  Apparently some small European...  Which is available on IT Conversations, by the way.  Thank you very much.  But some small, I don't know who it was, but some small European, I think it was in Ireland,  wasn't it?  That they were going to do a conference.  Yeah, actually a nonprofit.  It was in Ireland, too.  A nonprofit in Ireland wants to do a Web 2.0.  That loves puppies.  Yes, that's right.  And never club seals.  And they got a cease and desist letter.  But now people blame O'Reilly.  And I think it's IDG.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, O'Reilly never put the keybash on it.  It's Tim O'Reilly that invented the term, so he could have stopped it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's right.  In fact, Tim O'Reilly was invited to the conference, as I remember.  Well, that's what they say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the next thing you know, the guys are sued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Tim O'Reilly and John Battelle from FM Publishing put that conference together.  And then I think they sold it, if I'm not mistaken, to CMP.  Is that right?  Was it CMP or IDG?  No, it's a joint service mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is a joint service mark between O'Reilly and CMP.  And CMP filed for it, I think, in the first place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They actually filed for the registration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But O'Reilly is still very much involved with the conference.  And I think people got so worked up about this because they sort of hope that O'Reilly  — they love Tim and they hope that O'Reilly wouldn't be involved in this kind of thing.  And it felt like the man coming down on the little guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And of course, it happened while Tim was on vacation, just to make life worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Conveniently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And of course, the worst thing is it happened a week before the conference.  So it wasn't the kind of thing where you gave them fair warning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, I don't know if the IT Conversations has this or who has it.  You can look it up.  But the last — I think it was the last Web 2.0 show.  There was a keynote given by Bruce Sterling.  It's a great keynote.  It's absolutely a great keynote.  He's brilliant.  It's just one of the best things I've ever heard for a long time.  I've heard it.  I think I heard it on IT Conversations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'd recommend listening to it.  It is on IT Conversations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Just go to ITConversations.com and search it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you guys do have it.  But you have kind of a truncated version.  You don't have the whole thing, right?  Got the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Every word, every star.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would recommend you go there and get a copy and put it on one of your iPods or something.  Because it's really an excellent summation.  Sterling is kind of a cynical guy in a funny way.  But he's not as bad as we are.  But typically he's got some interesting observations.  A little off the wall.  And I have to say, this was an outstanding speech.  Three words. Tour de force.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or is it — I don't know if de is a word.  Unless you're Wal Mossberg and then it's de.  I don't know if that's technically three words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought the interesting thing with that story was how it kind of exploded in the blogosphere  and turned from a letter to a lawsuit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A very typical response from the blogosphere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. Tim O'Reilly wrote this letter when he finally did come back from vacation.  And sort of explained the whole kerfuffle.  And then said, I'm really disappointed essentially in the blogosphere.  And this whole experience has sort of shaken my faith and the collective intelligence of the blogosphere.  And I thought, have you ever been to the blogosphere?  I mean, that's what they do. It's what they live for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go have a drink with Dan Rather.  Relax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think rule number one of getting a trademark is you have to defend it the minute you see somebody use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're going to get involved with the blogosphere, expect the worst.  Expect the worst from the blogosphere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because they don't have their names attached to their little accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, the funny thing is that we should rather get over it because it's like getting mentioned on DIG.  You know, you get a big spike and two days later you're forgotten.  Right.  I've never seen things turn over so fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Welcome to the new world. I mean, I think it's the way everything is.  We have short attention span theater here.  What were we talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think a dog just started up outside my house and it would be time for me to go out for dinner too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right. We've all just lost interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  To Molly Wood who gets the prize for the first tweet to use the word kerfuffle in a sentence.  We thank you for joining us.  I was going to say something.  From of course Buzz Out Loud and CNET.  And it is buzzoutloud.cnet.com. Is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's that. And then buzz.cnet.com is kind of home of all the buzz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She's the buzzette.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The video podcast and the blog and the column.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that demeaning to call you a buzzette?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A buzzette.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's better than a buzzer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is a little bit better than a buzzer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Transcript:  I'm working on my, in fact we're going to have to do a special on this.  I'm working on my deconstruction of the boom and bust cycle of the U.S. economy.  I would love to read that.  Yeah, you're going to get a kick out.  It's going to be a monograph so it's not going to be that long.  It'll be about 90 pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  John claims that we're in the boom cycle but about 2000...  Well, we're starting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, the boom cycle should start next year, 2007.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But 2009, it's all over.  We're toast, yeah. October.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In a perfect world, it would actually be in October.  But, you know, these things sometimes shift a little bit, which I discuss quite in detail.  Is that why the crash of 29 was in October?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's something about October?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, actually, you know, if you start looking at crashes, a lot of them take place either...  Some of them take place in the spring, a few of them, but so many of them take place in October.  It's really kind of weird.  It's interesting.  And, you know, the function behind that is manifold.  So it's hard to say specifically what causes that phenomenon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think it's probably Canon abandoning its low-priced cameras, I would guess.  The first thing that would strike me...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's no...  They're going to be...  I'm telling you, all these companies are going to drop this.  You know, just to finish on this topic, you know, I've talked to Kodak about this,  and they're kind of getting out of...  They got out of their high-end cameras, and I think they may have some problems in the low-end, too.  All these guys are scared to death, all these camera companies, and Canon will be in this boat, too,  of Sony and Panasonic, because what I was told was that Sony and Panasonic have a different model  for making money, and they have a different model for what their margin should be,  and the traditional camera companies just can't deal with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the prices are dropping dramatically.  I mean, they were much lower this year than they were last year for six-megapixel cameras,  five-megapixel cameras, and they're just a couple hundred bucks now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think it's also getting to the point where you're not going to replace them as often as you used to.  I mean, it skyrocketed so quickly, but you get to six, seven, eight megapixels.  Once you get to eight, you know, we're saturated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a very good point, yeah.  Although I'm impressed with how Kodak has managed to turn itself around.  I mean, here's a company that, I mean, look what happened to Polaroid.  I mean, they must have been on death's door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, Kodak's an interesting, I got to visit the company I was supposed to go a couple months ago,  or last month I didn't do it, but they have this new little camera with the two lenses,  which I thought was kind of silly when I first saw it,  but then I'm hearing more and more good things about it.  I'm trying to get a copy to check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay. Well, we'll start scouting for a spot in the backyard to bury the gold bars,  and we'll talk to you at least on the 16th.  Oh, no, you won't be at Yahoo, but maybe we can see you next week on Twitter.  Yeah, next week.  Yeah, especially if we can do it from the Apple Store.  I'm still working on that.  Thank you, John.  See you.  Bye-bye.  And I...  He's gone.  You guys hear that sound?  That's him going bye-bye.  And I do want to thank very much, thank Doug and Mike for actually coming here  to the inner lair of the Twitter sanctum sanctorum.  And congratulations, Doug, to your third year as a podcaster at IT Conversations.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, we really should take this opportunity to tell people  what it's really like here at the home of Twitter.  But, you know, time's short.  We really just don't have time to finish it off.

Transcript:  And we, by the way, want to thank AOL Radio for support for the bandwidth on this podcast.  And the Cashfly as well, who is offered to thank Cashfly very much because they've offered  to carry the Aug Vorbus and AAC versions, the kind of off versions of the podcast.  But a lot of people like them and want them.  And so the BitTorrent hasn't been working too well.  So Cashfly, the rescue as usual.  I know they rescued the system when they were when their BitTorrent wasn't working too well.  They're like the cavalry that just comes marching in when you need them.  And we thank you for being here.  We sorry we took a week off, but I promise you lots more to come next week.  We'll let you know about VloggerCon.
