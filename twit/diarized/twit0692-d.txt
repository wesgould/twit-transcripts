Transcript:  To the show.  This was a big week for Apple.  Look, the new iMac is here.  The new iMac is here.  Oh, it's so pretty.  It looks just like the.  Oh, it is the old iMac.  This one's a really old one.  Yeah. Yeah.  We used to use these by the dozen.  We've got several still left.  The new iMac.  This is so much like the old iMac, though, but it's the same size form factor.  The on off switches in the same place because there are people who use them in rack mounts  in server farms and they need the button to be the same spot as now for that Mac mini

Start time: 213.18
End time: 217.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is bigger than the other Mac mini.  So why are we still calling it mini?  That's like Mac medium.

Start time: 217.44
End time: 221.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This was the old Mac mini.  But it was thinner.  I see it's thinner.

Start time: 222.00
End time: 223.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like it's like they squished it.

Start time: 223.76
End time: 246.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like it's like a Samoa after you've been keeping your back pocket for a couple  of years. There's a marshmallow that they've toasted and squished down a little bit.  I think these are beautiful.  They announced new MacBook Airs, which look a lot like the old MacBook Airs.  Actually, I kind of like it for that reason.  Both this and the Mac mini, the MacBook Air and the Mac mini.  I feel like it's old home week.  I feel good about that.  I don't want things to change too much.

Start time: 248.52
End time: 285.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, you said it looks good, the new Mac or looks the same.  But if you're looking at it, it's not going to feel the same because it's got that new  retina display.  Oh, why does it look better?  Yeah, finally, finally, finally.  It's about time.  Like the MacBook Air used to be the computer that I would say if someone comes up to me  and says I want to get an Apple laptop and all they do, you know, is email and normal  everyday stuff.  I didn't have a computer to recommend to them for a while.  I was like, do you think you could get by with an iPad?  But now that the MacBook Air is back, I'm happy that that's there so I can say this  is the one you should get.  Kind of is the Mac for the rest of us.

Start time: 286.56
End time: 311.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I was concerned because they're using a Y processor, a slower processor.  But after using it for a few days now, I got it, I guess mine on a Thursday.  I feel it's fast enough.  Does the price not bother you though?  Oh, OK.  Let's say this right up front.  If money is a concern, you shouldn't be buying any Apple product at all.  Right?  In fact, I mentioned this on Mac Break Weekly.

Start time: 311.74
End time: 314.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Entry level Air was somewhat obtainable.

Start time: 314.90
End time: 322.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can get an iPad now at $329.  So OK, we'll leave that out.  But any of the new stuff, it's really for rich folks.

Start time: 323.56
End time: 324.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I don't feel great about that.

Start time: 327.28
End time: 334.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I feel like it used to be that was their tagline, the computer for the rest of us.  It's now the computer for the rest of us if you've got bank.

Start time: 334.62
End time: 343.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but when it was the computer for the rest of us, the idea that they were selling  then was this is a computer where you don't have to know programming to make sense of  the interface and the applications.

Start time: 344.00
End time: 351.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was never cheap.  In fact, I bought, I went to Macy's because I couldn't afford the first iMac, charged  it in my Macy's card, it was $2500.  It was never cheap.

Start time: 351.92
End time: 390.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but the idea was computer for the rest of us was drawing a very bright line between  people who did computer related things for a living versus people who are going to use  a computer to do non computing things, either recreationally or for a living.  But now I would argue that they charge the prices because they can.  They get away with it.  And we've also had nearly 20 years of teaching people that design is a premium worth paying  for when it comes to consumer goods.  People pay money to think that what they're using has been designed well and thoughtfully  and beautifully.  You're using the old MacBook Air.  Yeah, I'm cheap.  I don't upgrade until I have to.

Start time: 390.90
End time: 392.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Still designed well though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, it's funny, I likened the new MacBook Air to mom's home cooking.  Maybe you could get a more gourmet dinner out.  But this is what you, since 2008.  I'm a reporter.

Transcript:  I don't need a lot of processing power.  I don't edit video.  I don't edit a lot of files with a lot of data and I'm not a gamer.  So I don't need a machine that's souped up.  I could probably comfortably use this until it gets to the point where Apple releases  an operating system that's not compatible.  I should also add, I'm still using my iPhone.

Transcript:  At least you're safe from any helium releases.

Start time: 462.05
End time: 472.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, that does not work.  We tried to kill my iPhone.  I was very brave.  I put an iPhone, Samsung Note 9 in a bag of helium and they refused to die, damn it.

Start time: 472.54
End time: 473.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is how I've set up my home screen.

Start time: 475.94
End time: 487.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's so pretty.  By the way, this thing is hot.  It's working hard to display that.  You don't have any icons on there.  You just have a notepad, reminders, messages.  You don't even have a phone icon on there.

Start time: 488.40
End time: 495.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I don't call people much.  But the point is I cleared off my screen to remind me to spend less time on my phone anyway.  This is actually kind of nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 496.22
End time: 498.23

Start time: 517.87
End time: 523.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Wow.  That's incredible.  Well, I also, and this is where you all just keel over and shock.  It's only a 16 megabyte phone.

Start time: 525.52
End time: 528.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  I got to go.  I got to get out of here.

Start time: 528.62

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just put that next to this phone.

Start time: 531.42
End time: 536.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's been great because it forces me to actually just pare down the apps and keep  the ones I'm going to use regularly.

Start time: 536.76

Start time: 544.62

Transcript:  But you know, one of the nice things about actually using lagging edge tech on a regular

Start time: 562.10
End time: 575.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  basis too...  But you can touch with the people, the little people.  Well, I wouldn't say little people, but I think what it does is it helps keep computing  in context outside of my job bucket, if that makes sense.  No, that's smart.  It's smart.

Start time: 577.85
End time: 586.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I wish I could do that, but I can't.  I have to be in touch with the rich early adopters.  Those are my people.

Start time: 587.64
End time: 589.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who will speak for the rich early adopters if not you?

Start time: 589.52
End time: 751.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Somebody has to speak for them.  So the truth is the thing that was most interesting...  And by the way, this is not new.  This was announced two weeks ago, but they finally came this week.  And so we were able to play with them.  The thing that really I think is most interesting is Apple is releasing a Mac Mini and a MacBook  Air that are very much kind of just an evolutionary upgrade on the existing products.  Kind of giving people what they wanted, but without changing, even changing the design  substantially.  And then they gave us the computer from the future, which is the iPad Pro.  And this thing is not this year's computer.  It's probably not even next year's computer.  This feels like the computer from 2029.  It's really futuristic and partly because of the chip in here.  And I think this is where you really look at Apple, what Apple is doing with the A12,  in this case the A12X for the iPad.  And Intel is way behind.  Seven nanometer, eight core GPU, four high power, four low power.  Although if necessary, Apple said all eight of them can kick in, which means this thing  has huge overhead.  It's got seven GPU chips, seven GPU cores in here.  It has its own neural processing chip.  This is a great, by the way, conversation on Ars Technica.  It turns out Anand, now we know what Anand is doing, Anand from AnandTech is now at Apple  and gave the demonstration and the explanation of what's going on with this A12X.  Also don't forget about the T2.  And there's another chip in there.  The T2 security chip, which does a whole lot more than that.  It does sound processing.  It runs the storage so you don't have to put a disk storage card on there.  So in all the new Macs, plus the iPads, the T2, it gives you super fast disk performance.  It's really interesting what Apple is doing.  And that is also an Apple designed chip.  A number of people have written, and I have to concur, I started with Neil Patel at The Verge,  but I've seen many others write this.  I really liked, who was it that wrote, I think a kind of a critique of the iPad Pro is the software.  It isn't anywhere near sophisticated enough for this processor, for this chip.  You have this amazing screen.  You have this new user interface.  You have so much hotness in here.  I'm being absolutely sincere.  This thing is such a mind-blowing piece of hardware.  And it's running on essentially a blown-up iPhone operating system.

Start time: 753.82
End time: 782.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they talk about how the iOS is sort of, it coddles its users.  It is hugging the orangutans, if you will.  It's meant to be simple and easy to use.  And so, literally, I was about to ask you, as you're talking about all these awesome things that the iPad does,  what is the most powerful thing that you've done on that device since you've gotten it?  Well, it's great for watching Netflix.  Right, exactly.  Which is disappointing.

Start time: 783.46
End time: 858.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is disappointing.  Craig Maud on his blog, craigmaud.com, says,  the new iPad Pro is a computer from the future with software from yesterday.  I couldn't agree more, and I think that the more and more people are playing with it, they're realizing that.  Jason Snell told us yesterday that there was a rumor that there were many more features left out of iOS 12  designed to make the iPad more of a real computer.  And that will come maybe in iOS 13.  And I should point out, if there's things you do, like photo editing,  that work on this, this is an amazing device.  There's a great article here.  I've got to find all these articles.  Iceland iPad Pro.  There's a great article by Austin Mann, austinmann.com,  talking about taking the iPad Pro to Iceland and using it exclusively for editing  and saying, yes, my pictures look different edited on the iPad Pro,  but this is a much more effective artistic expression for me,  using the pencil, the iPad Pro, and Lightroom CC to edit.  He says it's a powerhouse workflow that is ultra portable.

Start time: 859.06
End time: 890.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't help but feel like they're kind of catching up with the Surface mind share at this point too.  Surface has had pencils for a while.  I mean, Apple has too, but Microsoft has been very aggressive with their evangelizing  to let you see how you can use the Surface both for office context or for coding  or for more creative work.  They've done a great job of positioning it as a machine that will help you get things done  and is also much more versatile than a laptop.

Start time: 890.98
End time: 910.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's an interesting point.  I'm sitting in front of a Surface Studio with a pen.  I do use that pen.  It is a giant screen.  It's really beautiful.  The next iPad should be like a Surface Studio.  I feel like that's an interesting point,  because there it is, a desktop operating system on iPad-like hardware.

Start time: 911.44
End time: 926.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Microsoft has been moving towards that though  with a lot of their universal Windows applications.  They've been trying very hard to build a user experience  where you can move from your desktop computer to your laptop  to your Surface tablet and back again.

Start time: 927.22
End time: 934.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So maybe that's my mistake.  Maybe this isn't the computer of the future.  I should have just bought a Surface Pro instead of an iPad.  It depends on the rest of the ecosystem.

Start time: 935.22
End time: 952.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Microsoft is always ahead of the curve, too far ahead.  They're ahead of their time.  They've had tablets forever.  It took a while and took someone else to be able to bring it mainstream.  Bill Gates was a big believer in tablets 20 years ago.  Yeah.  So I think the pen, if it comes out on Microsoft,  then wait five years and then come out with it again and be new.

Start time: 953.49
End time: 957.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The pencil, okay, the Apple Pencil though  is better than the Microsoft Pen.

Start time: 958.41
End time: 977.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, because they learn from the mistakes.  They are the pioneers.  They get the arrows in the back.  So everyone learns about what's the future.  And if you look at, what's that project,  the folding Microsoft thing that never came out?  I can't remember.  That was supposed to come out, still might come out.

Start time: 978.02
End time: 985.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was called Courier and then it was called Andromeda.  And now it's called the Samsung folding phone.

Start time: 986.18
End time: 1004.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They are learning a lot from their labs.  And I think that they are releasing things  when they think that it's good enough for them  and not thinking about smart people or not so smart people  to figure out a way to transition between those.  Interesting.  I'd left Microsoft out.

Start time: 1004.58
End time: 1015.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I probably shouldn't have.  Well, one of the things I've noticed...  I don't want to use Windows.  I have the Surface Go.  I have a Surface Studio, as you can see.  But it's running Windows, which to me doesn't feel as elegant.

Start time: 1015.42
End time: 1058.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, one of the things I've noticed about Microsoft  is they eat their own dog food.  Everything that they release to the public,  they use internally first.  And on the one hand, it's great because they've got a use pool in place.  But on the other hand,  I think it may create an effect sometimes  where because it works for them,  there may not be the awareness that the rest of the world  hasn't had the same learning curve at the same speed.  For example, they have been using workplace metrics  on their office software now for a couple of years.  It's working great for them.  It's helped them figure out time management  and move them towards this new idea they're pushing out,  which is that they want to eliminate multitasking  and introduce people to the idea of just flow.

Start time: 1059.16
End time: 1068.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See, that's part of the problem I have with the iPad  is that basically, no matter what you're doing,  and I know, don't write me, I know there's multitasking,  but basically you're doing one thing at a time.

Start time: 1069.46
End time: 1098.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But basically, the point is Microsoft has been overhauling  their own culture and how they work internally.  They've now baked it into their products.  You don't get the feeling.  They're going to release it to the wild.  But I don't, like Wesley said, it's a little bit ahead of its time.  I'm not sure it's going to be something that people are like,  thank goodness, I now have terrifying metrics  that tell me exactly how much time I spend emailing somebody  and how many hours a week I spend in meetings,  and what am I supposed to do with this?  We're not quite there yet,  but people who have been eating the dog food for a couple of years,  they're there.

Start time: 1100.14
End time: 1109.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it says Microsoft left the psychology out of technology.  So they can figure out how to do things that work good for them,  but they do not factor in the rest of the population.

Transcript:  Well, is it the problem that Silicon Valley has always had,  which is engineers design for engineers?  Oh, no, they've got a great UI program.

Start time: 1126.82
End time: 1161.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think, again, the thing is there's a big difference  between designing something that works for a culture internally  versus one that's going to work for a larger market.  Well, to use a different metaphor,  in the 90s you could always tell when a website was really poorly designed,  when it reflected the internal structure of a company,  rather than the customer facing things people want to do on a website.  And so when you're looking at how products get developed,  sometimes it doesn't hurt to ask,  does this product just reflect the company culture that they have,  or does this actually reflect an awareness of who their customers are  and what their customers want?

Start time: 1162.76

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's ironic because Microsoft seems to be leaving desktop computing behind.

Start time: 1165.90
End time: 1201.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they're very clear about that.  They're very clear that we're in a post...  It's all about the cloud now.  Remember, Satya Nadelle's first thing was mobile first, cloud first,  and then they moved to the idea of digital transformation,  which is the notion that computing is all about the digital information  that you either create or you manipulate or you extract value from.  And now what they're moving into is...  Now they're trying to push you to a post-app environment, too,  where the idea is not so much you open this app, this app, and this app  to do your job, but you identify your task flow,  and then the apps seamlessly integrate with each other  so that you don't have to switch between them.

Transcript:  I don't know if I trust that kind of thing.  It sounds cool in theory, but I still have...  The file system on iOS, I think, is an example of this whole idea  that you have a task that you want to complete,  and so it doesn't matter where your files are,  and it doesn't matter where this is or what app you're using.  You just use tags to make sure everything's organized how you want it.  Yeah, I don't like that.  And maybe that's the difference between still being in that area  where we've got holdovers from the way that we've done computing for so long,  whereas maybe, like my youngest sibling,  where he's not thinking so much in terms of apps  and thinking in terms of this idea where it's like workflows that you follow.  It might make more sense to him, but I don't know.  I'm stuck in my ways. That sounds terrifying to me.  Wait a minute. Micah, you're not even 30.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I roll out a theory? Yes, roll out a theory.  Here's the theory.  I think you hit the nail on the head when you said that the hardware is way ahead of its time  before the OS, because my theory is that the iPad Pro is a development platform  for the next era of computing, and they need something more powerful for where they're going  rather than something that fits the needs of today.  It feels like that.  And if you look at what they're doing with their processors, the T2 trip,  they're continuously getting closer and closer to controlling everything that's needed  for something radical to happen.  And if you look at...  People didn't touch on this when they changed their reporting structure for their financials,  saying they will not break down individual units.  They probably are going to release something that's very radical, their future,  that won't sell very well but will be disguised in terms of how well or how not well it's doing.  So they don't have to break down to it.

Start time: 1375.82
End time: 1438.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now I've got to wrap my mind around this one.  Actually, Apple did that. There's a history of doing that.  The Macintosh did not sell well. The Lisa really didn't sell well.  Sorry, Lisa.  I'm used to it.  But they clearly reinvented computing.  And in fact, Apple may be in that exact same stage they were at when they had the conferences at Apple II forever.  We'll never abandon the Apple II.  Meanwhile, here's the Macintosh, forget the Apple II.  And they did shortly after kill the Apple II.  Maybe they're in that transition phase.  One thing we probably do know is that this is almost the end of the line for Intel and Apple, right?  They've got this...  It's pretty clear when you look at what's going on in this A12X Bionic  that they've leapfrogged Intel dramatically.  And because they're designing chips for their own operating systems and their own environments,  they can, instead of making a general purpose chip,  they can make a chip that is tuned to work as well as possible with the existing hardware and operating system.

Start time: 1439.61
End time: 1467.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if you look at the T2, it's an accelerator.  When you break it down, it's a cryptography accelerator.  It's an encoder accelerator.  So anything that wherever their Bionic chip falls short,  they can just accelerate into the T2 and keep iterating there separately  and still be able to stay ahead of the curb.  If a new technology comes out, they just wrap it into the T2  without breaking their development of their Bionic processor.

Transcript:  You've got to think.  iOS 13 has to have...  I mean, because we saw that when...  Well, it even was like a point release where we saw a lot of fun stuff happen for iPad  where the multitasking improved and all that kind of thing.  And so maybe, I don't know if it'll be a point release,  but in the next iteration of iOS completely,  we'll see another one of those things happen where our iPad gets a whole lot more features  like Jason Snell was talking about.  Because, yeah, right now it does feel like you've got this incredibly powerful vehicle  that you can, I don't know, go underwater and fly through the sky.  But right now, those features aren't available to you.  You can't turn those on.  So you get to the water and it stops you.  You don't get to go underwater.  And it seems like when you can look at this thing and go,  well, it's faster than all of these computers and it can do this and it can do that.  But then you go to the app store and you look for something that uses even a third of that processing power.  It's hard to find anything that does that.  Even folks that have been doing video editing and audio editing and things like that on the iPad,  they've been able to do that just fine with the devices that are out there,  or with the devices that have been available so far.  So now we've got this incredible machine,  and it doesn't feel like we've given it anything to stretch its legs with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if you, sorry, I harp on this so much, but if you look at the T2 chip,  I think it's a big key that no one is spending too much time on.  It is the hybridization of their processors and Intel's processors, if you think about it.  So more and more functions in their desktops will be moved over to the T2 or their laptops,  to the point where the processor does just the bare minimum,  and then they'll switch over and replace Intel's processor with the combination of the T2 and the Bionic chips.  And so the reason why I was saying that the iPad is developing...  But, okay, that makes sense. That makes sense. That's a natural transition.

Start time: 1616.80
End time: 1627.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it sounded like you were also saying that maybe there's also a device in here that is neither desktop, laptop, or iPad.  There's some sort of new kind of device they're envisioning.

Start time: 1634.84

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which we've been playing with in all sorts of ways.  We were able to get video out of it. We're able to...  It's got data. It can charge. It can charge in both directions.  It can import camera right now, but it can't talk to an external hard drive yet.  But that's a driver issue. It can't talk to a keyboard or mouse yet.  That's a driver issue. Apple has chosen not to support that, but could easily.

Start time: 1658.60
End time: 1702.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so what I think that the iPad Pro's development platform is because they are plugging in either external accelerators or external devices like the keyboard.  But think of a keyboard within...they have a keyboard with a trackpad or some other interface that can be expandable, which means you can retrofit your old iPad to be whatever their new computing paradigm is.  I don't know. That's augmented reality with a camera or whatever.  And that will come up...they'll come out with some sort of desktop replacement or laptop replacement that'll have all that built in.  And then say, hey, all of everything with the USB-C port, now you can be upgraded into whatever this new thing is.

I think he was given an impossible task, which was also this kind of difficult transition from desktop to tablet computing.  It was a weird hybrid that nobody wanted. And I think they've come, by the way, come out of it pretty well, as we were just talking about.  I think Windows 10 on a Surface Pro is...

So you won't find, you won't look at a phone or a laptop and say, how much RAM does it have and how much storage does it have?  It'll be just one number where your operating system and your storage for your data have to live together.  And so that takes a whole other way of approaching an operating system, memory management and storage.  And we're getting closer and closer and closer.  And so everything has to change when that happens.

And if you look at, there's research where IBM was able to change the magnetism of a single atom,  where it takes like a hundred thousand atoms for regular storage.  You can see how you can really dramatically increase the density of memory.  And once you can make things smaller, you can also make them cheaper.  And faster. Yeah.

Transcript:  Cheaper always changes the nature of computing too.  Because when you think about when cell phones were expensive, very few people had them and used them.  But when Apple and other companies persuaded carriers to underwrite the cost of cell phones,  and they became mobile smartphones, they became cheaper for a while.  And they became ubiquitous.  And that changed computing because that's what nudged us into a mobile-first model.  People are like, my phone is a hard drive and it's also something that connects me to the internet.

Or I want something that will let me take notes in a meeting.  And I can rely on it being a good user experience that seamlessly interlocks with all of the other things in my hardware ecosystem.

It's very tactile.  It's very physical.  And I can't help but think you have a generation that's raised on Minecraft, which is all about building things in 3D.  And they're used to swiping.  They're used to tactile.  Like they have to have keyboarding classes to type.  But it kind of makes no sense to teach them a technology that was developed for an earlier technological leap.  Like to them, why would you not just make your body part of the user interface and move?  What could you do in computing or how could you use computing in ways that you're not using it now if you have 360 degrees of movement around you and you can physically rearrange things?

And what blew my mind about it was, again, it's a much more immersive experience because it is very physical.  And you're using your voice.  You're using your body to gesture and things like that.  And I was thinking, why wouldn't this be the next stage for mainstream computing?  You're always going to have accessibility issues you have to get around.  There's no way to avoid that.  There are going to be people who simply can't use their bodies.  But I think that we're going to move away from the keyboard as your primary interface for data.

She has, I think, like an iPhone 5C or something like that.  And she doesn't really ever use that because a long time ago I gave her an iPad Mini and she uses the iPad Mini for most of the stuff that she does because that is that bigger screen that she it's still small enough for her to like carry around in her purse and things like that.  But it's bigger than that tiny screen.  And so she does most of her iMessage conversations on there, her email, this, that and the other.  And she has a computer too, but she doesn't really ever use that.  She's got that iPad Mini that's like the perfect size for her.  So I could see that definitely being a case where, you know, when you're out and about and you're just talking on the phone because that's something that she still does, then then you want that smaller device with you.  But then when you get somewhere where you're like trying to see, OK, what's going on on the screen or the messages and things like that.  Yeah.

Chihuahua.  Oh, it's that new Chinese phone.  Everybody's talking about the Chihuahua.  I know that one.  I got a Chihuahua 20 just the other day.  No.  No.  And that's Lisa Schmeiser, who is keeping me honest editor at IT Pro today.  She's an editor.  She's already red penciled me all over.  I have one.  We'll get it for you.  Our show today brought to you by Express VPN.  I don't know what the kids are using today, but I do know that keeping yourself protected  and private online is a big deal, especially with all the news about security breaches  and spying.  You want to consider where is your data going and who's keeping an eye on things.  We know you're being tracked online by social media sites, by marketing companies,  frankly by your Internet service provider and your mobile phone company.  They can record your browsing history.  They often say we know they sell it to other companies who want to profit for your  information.  Everybody's always talking about Google and Facebook, but your ISP is also without any  safeguards keeping an eye on what you're up to.  That's why I back my privacy and you'll want to too with Express VPN.  A strong VPN is your best way to stay safe and private online.  Express VPN is easy to use apps.  They run in the background on your computer, your phone, your tablet.  You could turn them on with one click, secure and anonymize your Internet browsing by  encrypting your data, hiding your public IP address.  Of course, Express VPN does not log, so you're completely anonymous.  You could safely surf on public Wi-Fi without being snooped on or hacked.  It's the number one VPN service.  That's Tech Radar's rating.  It comes with a 30-day money back guarantee.  It costs less than $7 a month.  It is the best.  I know people are, we get a lot of calls these days.  I'm looking for a VPN.  I'm looking for a VPN.  Go to ExpressVPN.com slash twit and they'll give you three extra months free with a one-year package.  Express VPN.com slash twit.  Add three months to your one-year package free.  Express VPN.com slash twit.  Protect yourself online.  Now more than ever.  Let's see.  We were talking about the folding phone.  I guess we've said everything we need to say about that.  It's for old people.  Now I understand.  As an old person, I should have gotten that right away.  Is there anything else to say about the new Apple stuff?  We did talk about the fact that their unit sales are no longer going to be reported.  That kind of makes sense.  I don't know.  Some people say it's because Apple doesn't want you to know, but I've lately been more convinced that it's just because it's not as important as how much money they're making per customer, which is what they will report, right?

Transcript:  And that was the argument they made in the call.  Now that Serenity Caldwell has moved on to the fruit company, I handled the transcription of the financial call for iMore.  Yes.  And they brought that up quite a bit.  And then when the folks asked about it, the analysts asked about it afterward, they pretty much just said the same thing over and over again.  They might as well just play a sound bite of Luca because it was what you just said.  It's like I think Tim Cook even ended the conversation by saying something like when you roll up a cart at the grocery store and you get your total cost at the end of the day, it doesn't matter what each individual thing in the cart costs.  And it doesn't matter sort of what that is.  All you care about is the total that you get to at the end.  And so the idea there, I think, is that Apple is focusing more on making sure that the products that it sells are the ones that make their customers happy.  And there's the argument that if we have analysts talking about how, well, the iPhone is now not doing well, then that kind of runs the risk of Apple not being able to focus on continuing this right product experience.  It's all very confusing and I don't know what the real reason is, but I did kind of like Tim Cook's little thing at the end about shopping carts.

It is Veterans Day, the 100th anniversary of the armistice in World War I, 100 years ago, 11-11-1918, and it is 11-11-11-11 a.m.  The war ended. But of course we commemorate veterans on this day and I think it's a good thing to do.  There was a big parade in Petaluma today. A lot of fun.  But in China, they're spending because 11-11 is a lot of ones and it's Singles Day.  I think Alibaba, this is probably invent, this is like talking about a Hallmark holiday, invented this some years ago as a way to celebrate single people, but also it's their Black Friday.  And typically worldwide, the number one buying day of the year, for the last 10 years it has been, and Alibaba, which is kind of the Amazon of Asia, has set a record.

Transcript:  Have any of you read Yuval Noah Harari's book, Sapiens or Homo Deus or his new one, which just came out, which I just got but I haven't read yet?  He is an Israeli philosopher, PhD from Oxford, teaches at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.  Sapiens was amazing and apparently has become, he's become kind of a poster child at Silicon Valley.  But the funny thing is his book, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, is really about something that you would think the tech leaders wouldn't want him to say.  Basically, that we are entering a fascist world run by tech companies with no, democracy is over in effect.  Everything he says undermines the premises of advertising and engagement model, the models that Google and Facebook and everybody else supports.  He's worried that because the tech revolution's work requires so few laborers,  Silicon Valley is creating a tiny ruling class and then a giant, he calls it the useless class.  That in the past, in the past, autocrats had to keep the peasants around because who else was going to grow their food?  But in the future, the rich few, the one percenters will have everything they need and they won't need the workers, which means they're just going to kill them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The useless class is literally useless.  There's no reason for Silicon Valley to pay any attention to them or even listen to what they have to say.  And he says that's one of the reasons that this universal basic income is so popular.  It's because, well, we'll throw them a bone.  We don't really need them, but we're nice guys.  So we'll give them enough money to live on.  Maybe they'll buy some of our products.  And apparently Silicon Valley loves this guy.  He's going to dinners.  He's in town for speeches.

Start time: 3103.35
End time: 3118.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's what he says.  He says because government is so dysfunctional, at some point Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Page, Jack Dorsey, and most importantly, Jeff Bezos are just going to say,  Well, you know what?  Government doesn't work.  Throw it out.  We'll take it from here.

Start time: 3118.84
End time: 3212.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The issue is there is no government support.  Like if you look at the postal system, there's UPS, there's FedEx, and then we have the postal system because it is deemed that getting mail,  at least at the time, was more important than making money because people need to communicate.  There is no equivalent for the digital age in terms of Internet connectivity.  And so the ability to move from one class to another is wider.  The gap is wider because the access to information is further away.  Of course, we have libraries which are being underfunded.  And I think people saying, why do we still have libraries?  But they're very important because of that, people who don't have access any other way.  But there, if you look at institutions that are trying to give accessibility to learn so that you can move forward,  they're being challenged saying, you know, government shouldn't be doing that for people.  Government should get out of the business and leave it to the private sector.  The government is pushing people to the private sector and not giving a safety net for those that the private sector chooses not to support.  That's why I like those rural broadband problems because the private sector should be taking care of that, but they choose not to.  And so there is no recourse because there is no safety net because it is government ceding all of that,  the most important part to the private sector, and there's no recourse.

Start time: 3213.28

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The government recently defunded programs that were designed either for rural Internet access or low income Internet access.  These programs were funded under the previous administration.  They've been defunded under this one.  I've done a couple stories on rural broadband and what I've consistently gotten from centrist or right wing think tanks.  When I asked them, why can't we do Internet like TVA did electricity and water?  And their answer is, well, technical standards change so fast you don't want to waste a lot of taxpayer money on Internet just to have it be upgraded in a few years.  But what it comes down to is a more fundamental failure on the part of government, I would say, to argue that no,  access to the Internet is at this point a utility.  It's as important as a phone program, which they subsidized for years.  It's as important as electricity. It's as important.  And like Wesley said, the economic mobility, the ability to move from one class to another economically in this country is much, much less than it was 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 50 years ago.  And it comes down to a failure.  It comes down to both the government not making a case for itself and politicians not making a case to people that government is a way to provide basic infrastructure to allow people to create and access opportunities.  I mean, but this dystopian guy says is basically opportunity.  No one's going to know one needs opportunity.

I mean, honestly, maybe I'm a cynic, but I just assume that really they they don't want government to do anything that private should do everything that that's just kind of the so back in the 90s when I was ideology of this, the dogma of this back in the 90s when I was coding, I freelanced on the side.

Well, this is the thing is every developer I talked to was like, if I unionized and someone else is going to be responsible for salary negotiations, someone else, their individual benefits, and I can't optimize my own value.

Transcript:  This is from the New York Times article about a Harari.  Yeah.  Harari is puzzled.  Why is it that I've been embraced by Silicon Valley?  And the Times writes part this is Nellie Bowles, by the way, writing, who's great.  Part of the reason might be Silicon Valley at a certain level is not optimistic on the future of democracy.  The more of a mess Washington becomes, the more interested the tech world is in creating something else.  And it might not look like elected representation.  Rank and file coders, exactly what you said, Lisa, have long been wary of regulation and curious about alternative forms of government.  A separatist streak runs through the place.  Venture capitalists periodically call for California to secede or shatter or for the creation of corporate nation states.  And this summer, Mark Zuckerberg, who incidentally has recommended Harari to his book club, acknowledged a fixation with...  Caesar Augustus.

Transcript:  Yeah.  So, let me add one more piece to this dystopian puzzle.  Sweden. This is the deputy governor of the Central Bank of Sweden writing for the World Economic Forum.  Sweden is moving rapidly away from using cash.  The outstanding value of cash in circulation has dropped to 1% of GDP.  Basically, it's a cashless society.  That sounds fine, right?  We're all moving towards that.  You use credit cards.  They have something called swish.  Everybody in Sweden uses swish to swish money.  It's even become a verb.  It completely bypasses central banknotes and coins.  But here's the problem.  If cash stops working, it leaves everyone to rely on the private sector for access to money and payment methods.  It would be a historic change without precedent.

Start time: 3497.14
End time: 3530.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When you think about how many workers in America are compensated, it's not just salary.  It's also access to health care benefits that won't bankrupt you.  And that is dependent on the largesse of a company.  You can't blame them.  And what they choose to pay for health insurance.  So, instead of it being something where to get back to Wesley's point,  instead of it being something where you've got a government as the regulatory body ensuring equality of access for everybody,  you have people with wildly disparate levels of health care access at wildly disparate prices  because it's linked to private corporations and private enterprise instead.

Start time: 3530.90
End time: 3572.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, what Sweden is proposing, and maybe this is a window into what our future might hold,  is the e-Krona.  The central bank says we're going to have to create our own digital currency instead of cash  so that there will be, the government will still have some role to play in the economic life of people.  You'll trade in your ordinary Krona, one-to-one, for e-Krona,  which will basically appear as cash on your Swish account.  I feel like we're going to see this in a few years.  This will be proposed in the United States, don't you think?

Start time: 3604.59
End time: 3634.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That depends on what kind of blockchain.  You can have a private blockchain.  You can control all of the nodes and the servers.  It doesn't have to be non-distributed and open.  It could be a closed blockchain.  That's possible.  You can distribute it, but all of the data centers are owned by you.  Also, if it was distributed and open, you could be open to a 51% attack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This broke, not broke, but this was basically something that grabbed headlines for a minute last month where  China is now assigning, for lack of better words, social credit ratings to individual citizens  based on a wide variety of things, including frivolous spending.  This is, of course, one of the things you'd have to watch out for when you get a lot of government involvement  in your currency and your spending life is when they start side-eyeing what you purchase  and assign a weight and a value to it.

I talked to a woman who was a 13-years chief reporter for a news service in Beijing and China.  Recently left, she was afraid of the government.  And I asked her about this social credit system and she said,  what's really interesting that's happened in China, China's always had these totalitarian leaders forever, really,  if you include the emperors, but what's changed is technology.  And that President Xi has so much more power because of cameras everywhere and digital technology  and the ability to collect information about its citizenry and to use that information.  I said, well, how do the people feel about this?  And she said, well, it's interesting.  They don't seem to really care.  If you're middle class or higher, you like the social order it imposes.  If you're poorer, you like the improved economic mobility.  I remember even 10 years ago going to China in a small village that was agriculturally based.  They all had flat screen TVs.  And our guide said, yeah, that's the gift of the year from the government.  Last year was refrigerators.  The year before was air conditioning.  Government keeps the poor people happy by continually bribing them with goods, economic goods.  Everybody's happy.  Nobody's complaining except maybe the intellectuals or the Uyghurs or those in rebellion.  Talk about a dystopia.  That's common.

Transcript:  In societies where they don't have the words or they don't have the culture around a certain idea,  they can't necessarily distinguish or see why one is better than the other because it's just not in their vocabulary.  They don't dream about it.  It's not in their society.  So when you say, does this bother you?  It's always going to be, well, this is how things are.  This is how I've lived.  And this is what I'm used to as opposed to others who might speak other languages,  visit other locations and get a bigger picture and able to understand the world from a different context.  So I know it seems like it's unrelated saying that Russians can see more blues,  but it's more of the same thing of being able to, if you have more context and you have more education  around just the fundamental workings of what's allowed, not allowed.  And if you can try to move a little bit beyond the construct of what's socially acceptable,  then you can be able to say, yes, I want this is a choice that I have and be able to move there.  So if they don't understand that there's a choice of not having this type of control,  it's not in their vocabulary to talk about freedom, then yeah,  I can see how they can say things are fine.

And I kind of always knew it was important.  But now what we're seeing, and I don't know if I have the frankly the tools to cover it.

But it's just one like very silly example of the way that, you know,  third party companies are getting involved in government.

But when there are potholes all over your town, because I don't know why,  because their city council is incompetent or because there's no local revenue or what, I don't know.  That impacts you.

Let me talk a little bit about something cool.  This is Robin Hood.  It's an investing app that lets you buy and sell stocks, ETFs and cryptocurrency commission free.  There's a good name Robin Hood because basically these guys are doing God's work.  They're trying to make financial services work for everyone, not just the wealthy.  Other brokerages, as you probably know, charge up to $10 for every trade.  Robin Hood, they don't charge commission fees.  You'll trade stocks and you'll keep all your profits.  It's secure.  It's encrypted.  You get market data.  You get charts.  And it's a great app.  You can place a trade with four taps.  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  The web platform lets you view stock collections.  The 100 most popular sectors like entertainment and social media are there.  Let me look at the entertainment market basket or the social media market.  You can view analyst ratings, buy, hold and sell recommendations for every stock.  You could discover new stocks.  You could track favorite companies with personalized news feeds, build your portfolio.  And there's no commission.  Custom notifications for price movements.  If you've been looking for ways to invest, you've got to download the app.  And they're giving you a free stock of Apple Forward or Sprint to help you start.  When you sign up at twittwo.robinhood.com, twitt the number two, one word, twittwo.robinhood.com,  you'll get a free stock.  You get started.  I think this is great.  No brokerage fees, no commission.  Trade stock, keep it all.  What could possibly be wrong?  This is awesome.  twittwo.robinhood.com.  When I found out about this, I said, this is cool.

Because you look at Tim Cook who gets out there and he's, hi everyone, I'm Tim Cook.  I care about privacy and human rights and a $1,200 phone.  Or you get Satya Nadella who writes a book which is really, I believe in human potential and I believe in distributing opportunities equally.  And I also believe that we're in a post desktop world.  Or you even get Google CEO who's like, yeah, I will go to the airport and wave a sign around when a travel ban comes down.  And then you get Zuckerberg.  And I don't know if he doesn't know the optics that go with being a CEO or he genuinely doesn't care.  But I wonder how much of the Facebook trust problem is Zuckerberg's perceived reaction or response.

I think he's a true believer that life is better when you're connected, blah, blah, blah.  I don't think he thinks he can do it better.  He does have a PR problem.  There's no question.  Five countries now are demanding he testify on data misuse.  It's a joint international grand committee of members of the UK and Canadian parliaments investigating disinformation and online election influence campaigns.  They've added Argentina, Australia and Ireland.  He's been invited by British and Canadian officials to attend the first joint hearing in November, but he's declined.  I don't really feel like it.

Transcript:  I went to Puerto Rico and toured via VR.  It's not possible, wrote Facebook officials in a letter, for Mr. Zuckerberg to be available to all parliaments.  Okay?  Why not?  The parliaments wrote, we are very disappointed with this dismissive response.  Five parliaments are now calling and you do the right thing by 170 million users in the countries they represent.  This is a, but you know, I mean, I guess you could take sides in this.  You could be on Mark's side and said, well, you know, come on, this is just a lot of grandstanding by politicians in these countries.  After all, he did testify before the US Congress in what was completely a sham.  Right?

Start time: 4793.72
End time: 4814.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it points to a fundamental disconnect between, again, with the tech industry, things are its priorities and its messaging versus what people who are not in the industry may be receiving.  Because I also would argue it's a failure on the part of the staffers for those Congress people to adequately write questions and educate them on here's what you have to ask and why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I mean, but but that's but if you going back to the PR issue, that was a good thing for Mark because all the focus was on the dumb questions, not anything bad that Facebook did.  And if he read the room right, especially in the European Union, they feel that they have no control of all these American tech companies that are taking control of their citizens.  And if he refuses to show up, which he already is doing, they have more ammunition to feed the narrative that they don't care about us over here.  They're going to do what they want without any thought that we could do anything against them because they feel that we are so dependent.  He should show up. He should say, you know, I want to hear you.  You're very important, whether it's true or not.  If if people if you look on both sides, it would have been better.  It'd be good for Mark and it would be better for these politicians to figure out for them to even say that, hey, we care about you.  So we're bringing Mark in and Mark says, hey, I care about you.  So I'm going to go and he's not reading the room correctly.

And so I thought, oh, the bathroom would be a really nice place to have a clock.  But I don't want this camera.  So I took it apart and I completely covered up the camera on the inside with a piece of electrical tape and then put it all back together.  And now the camera even because they have a camera off button, but I'm paranoid.  I'm like, I don't trust that camera.  Jeff Bezos wants to watch you poop.

But by that point, you've already seen it twice and are clearly committed to it.  It's in my head.  No, that's advertised.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He was in Austin at the time.  But you know what?  We could find out because we're getting all of the Echo stuff.  A judge has ordered the Amazon handover data in a 2017 murder case.  They have a suspect who was pleaded not guilty.  There will be a trial in May.  And so what the police asked for is not only all the Amazon Echo audio files, because frankly, I don't know if that would be useful,  but associated data which might be like what phones were paired to the smart speakers.  So you could know.  Does Amazon know when you're home?  Yeah, because your phone arrived.  Right?  Prosecutors believe there's probable cause to think there's evidence on the Echo like audio recordings of the attack.  When you're getting murdered, you don't go, Echo, record this.  No, you don't.  It was.  That's not likely.

Start time: 5744.84
End time: 5752.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what I find interesting is Amazon's official policy is, well, we didn't seek to obstruct justice.  We're just protecting the privacy rights of Echo users.

Start time: 5752.96

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. So they fought it.

Start time: 5754.90
End time: 5766.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the thing is Amazon has never really explicitly outlined what your rights, privacy rights are as an Echo user or specifically what the relationship is with your data.  So what rights are they protecting?  Have they defined those rights to begin with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Remember, the same thing happened in Arkansas and Amazon refused and eventually didn't have to hand it over because they had other evidence that was effective.  I feel like police are going to, and I don't blame them if they're trying to solve a crime or trying to build a case.  This in this case, probably the prosecutors trying to build a case, ask for whatever they can get.  Right. Go to the phone companies to pin all the phone records.  They don't know if there's anything there, but they're going to find everything.  And that's kind of the issue.  And this goes to another case we talked about last week where a judge ruled that you can't force somebody to give the password up on their phone unless you have a specific bit of information you're looking for.  That there that there is a I think that there is this notion that you're protected against law enforcement or prosecutorial phishing expeditions.  Well, there might be something there.  Let's just see what we can find.  You know, maybe there'll be something there.  That's not it.  This in this case, the judge said no.  And so I don't know how much the prosecutors told the judge like they said there's probable cause to believe there's evidence on the echo.  How would they? Why would what's the probable cause?  Echo doesn't record everything.

Start time: 5861.14
End time: 5880.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It only would be a lower bar to say, can you show me if the echo was triggered and for how long it was in that way?  They can get information to know like, oh, well, we know the murders are here or the alibi for the suspect is for this period.  And so that's the only snippet that could pertain to this case instead of asking for the whole day.

Start time: 5883.81
End time: 5911.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but it doesn't sound like that's what they said.  They said we want all the recordings for, you know, for that time as if they knew that the victim shouted echo right before she was stabbed.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I worry.  I worry about.  See, this is the problem because we have all these technological marvels in our home that are that do have information and I worry about police just saying, well, we might as well just ask for it.  Let's see what we can find because that's not actually supposed to happen.

It pauses the music, turns on, do not disturb, sets the brightness to zero so they can't  see what my phone's doing.  Yeah, this is from this.  This is not the ACLU app.  This is a Apple Siri shortcut.  There is an ACLU app.  This isn't that gets the current location, sends a message to my wife saying I'm getting  pulled over.  My current location is here.  Latitude and longitude.  Then it opens the camera up.  Start shooting a video, saves that video to the photo album and then sends that to my  blog.  Here's a video of the police interaction.  Robert A.  Peterson put this up on Reddit, uploads the video to the iCloud, into the Dropbox and  I have to give it access to Dropbox.

Transcript:  I get it.  Well, I would, a little off topic.  So my sister went through the police academy, and the paramilitary style training that they  give cops is that they always perceive that there's a danger.  Yes.  Better go to court than come home in a box kind of a thing.  And I think that persistent drilling of people are dangerous.  And the scenarios they build up is inherent to the system.  And the way they're set up, it doesn't matter if what color you are, but it amps up people's  perception of there might be danger.  And so if you see someone who is disarming, then you're like, OK, well, I can relax for  this person.  But if someone who is remarkably matches in your brain could be a danger, it's no longer  a five.  It's now a ten or a fifty.  That's right.

Transcript:  That's right.  There was, there was in Petaluma, there was a law enforcement officer some years ago  shot out in the country.  My wife, a day or two later, was driving in that area.  You know, clearly not a threat, but was pulled over by sheriffs, all five of them with guns  drawn and aimed at her.  Whoa.  And it's exactly that.  It's amped up, right?  You know, she didn't, she doesn't, I think, look like a threat in any respect, but it's  amped up because they were nervous because somebody had been shot a couple of days ago.  And that's inherently a dangerous situation if you've got five people with guns trained  on you.

Transcript:  And the, the authority is the biggest hammer that they have saying, do what I say.  And if people say no, they feel like, well, I said to do it.  So people's rights get trampled all the time because people feel that their authority is  being questioned, even if the law is not being broken.  And so that's also extremely scary.  There was like a, a teacher who was told to get out of the car and she says, she asked  why.  I think she was maybe 120 pounds and she got yanked out of the car.  And that happened here in Austin just because she asked why.  And just questioning authority sometimes can just feel like an escalation to someone who  feels that they have every right to tell you what to do.

And we only know this because we've seen the bills.  $22,000 since June for video recording and reproducing equipment.  $28,000 from, that was for, that was for the DEA.  $28,000 from ICE for the same period of time.  So just be aware, it's probably not illegal to put hidden cameras in streetlights.  They also apparently are placing covert surveillance cameras inside traffic barrels.  You can buy this.  Here's an ad for the covert traffic barrel shell.  It's a PTZ camera, which means they can aim it.

They have to spend the money where it makes sense.  The problem is that you can't just trust the government to have this information.  You have to trust the government not to ever lose this information.  And so if anybody cracks their system and gets access to this data, it could  and how ubiquitous, ubiquitous like machine learning and facial recognition is to the  general public, China could get it or whatever and be able to pull in a whole bunch of  information.

Transcript:  I want to my ex-wife's been driving down that street.  I want to see where she's going.  Exactly. Yeah.  We're putting cameras in the chat room.  Somebody said, yeah, I think that's a good idea from now on.  We're keeping an eye. I'm keeping my eye on you.  I have a camera on my front door.  I think the other side of this is it's nice as an individual to have cameras on your  property. I was never a big believer in that.  But I have camera on my front door.  I have a Ring video doorbell.  And that's been very useful to see when somebody comes to the door to know when people  are coming and going. When packages arrive, I know that they're there.  When somebody rings the doorbell, I can answer them even if I'm not home, which adds to  the security of my house.  Now, Ring's, you know, besides reinventing the doorbell, they've got the new home alarm  system. This is awesome.  Ring is one of our sponsors, I should mention.  We all know traditional alarm companies make their money not so much in the gear, although  they do seem to love having an installer come out and charge you thousands of dollars to  put this stuff in. But then then your troubles begin because they put you on a two or  three, often three year contract at forty five dollars or more a month for their  monitoring. Ring has decided to change that entirely.  The Ring system is easy to install.  You could do it yourself.  And by the way, it's easy to remove when you move.  So it's great for renters.  It's an affordable home security system.  There are no long term contracts.  You build a system that's right for your home.  You can have it up and running in minutes with a base station that keeps your alarm  system online and connected to mobile devices.  A keypad, which arms and disarms your alarm system.  Contact sensors for your windows and doors.  Motion detectors to keep an eye on hallways and a range extender.  So if you wanted to reach out to the garage or the shed, you could do that, too.  And the Ring alarm security kit is very affordable.  It gets you started with home home security for ten dollars a month.  No long term contract.  Professional monitoring.  Ten dollars a month.  I love my rings.  And this is a great alarm system for anybody, renter or homeowner that wants to  protect their family, their loved ones, their house affordably.  The Ring alarm security kit available at Ring.com and retail stores all over the country.  Everybody knows and trusts Ring.  Now you can get whole home security from them for only ten dollars a month.  Go to Ring.com slash twit to learn more.  Ring.com slash twit.  We gave you the bad news.  I'll give you some good news.  This is actually this is great.  So Virus Total is a company owned by Chronicle, which is owned by Google.  And it keeps track of.  It's also playing music in my ear.  Keeps track of malware.  And the U.S.  Cyber Command has now started uploading.  Malware samples that they collect from overseas, if you will, to Virus Total.  And already Virus Total says this is amazing.  We're getting some.  They're we're getting some stuff we've never seen before.  The first submission for something called low jack malware included files that  weren't previously in Virus Total.  You know, we've talked before about how exploits created or found or discovered  and weaponized by the NSA and other government agencies have leaked out.  And that's not good.  But this is good that they're at least keeping an eye on this stuff and then  sharing it instead of keeping it to themselves, sharing it to help us all be secure.  So U.S.  Cybercom's decision to provide these malware samples to Virus Total and let  the world know about it is probably a good thing.  Although there are those who are saying it's part of the new name and shame  effort on the part of Western governments who have lately been very active.  And maybe this goes back to the Bloomberg super micro case in exposing and  indicting Chinese, Russian, Iranian and North Korean hackers.  Sometimes I worry we're being manipulated a little bit.  You know, there's a real threat out there.  We've got to do something about it.  I don't know.  Who's would be doing the manipulating?

You know, we talk about this super micro thing, you know, ad nauseam when it  happened, the Bloomberg story and how all the companies involved denied it  vigorously, demanded retractions.  Bloomberg has stood by its reporting and has not retracted.  And we're really this kind of a stalemate right now.  There is the possible theory that Bloomberg was played by U.S.  intelligence officials who wanted to scare us about the supply chain, in  particular about stuff from China.  Holy moly.  I talked to Huawei the other day.  You know, they make a really nice laptop.  It's a Chinese company, I think part owned by the Chinese government.  So they're not necessarily our firm.  But they make a beautiful laptop.  They make an amazing phone.  We're going to talk about that in a second.  But that phone isn't sold in the United States because even though they were  about to do a deal with AT&T and Verizon, the U.S.  government scared AT&T Verizon off, said, no, you better not carry that  Huawei Chinese phone.  And Huawei's decided not to sell it in the United States because without a  carrier deal, it's very hard to succeed.  They don't want to spend the marketing money to just, you know, create  demand for a phone they can't sell.

So they can see when the credit cards are coming.  It saves you some time.  You'd have to go through a bunch of mailboxes.  Just go right to the ones with the credit cards.  Um, fraudsters were also observed on criminal forums discussing using informed  delivery to surveil potential identity theft victims.

Because right before I had moved in, we had had someone, um, come through and  like steal a neighbor's birthday card out of their mailbox.  And so I immediately became kind of, you know, suspicious, Oh dear, if that  male theft comes back, I want to know what male actually showed up and what doesn't.  And there's a link in the email where you can say, Hey, I didn't receive this  piece of mail, uh, and then they can sort of help you try and figure out what  happened to it.

And according to, uh, the results sprint, the only one throttling Skype at the  moment, 34% of Skype calls were throttled, slowed down in the case of a video call.  Uh, the video quality be much poorer, poorer than what the network supports.  In other words, the network could do it better, but doesn't sprint.

Transcript:  And I have been hard on Agipi, but I'm going to give him some credit because he  has stepped forward and said sprint and a few other U S telecoms have to do better  fighting robo calls.  And by the end of next year, he wants to implement a scheme, believe it or not,  called shaken and stirred.

Transcript:  This is not, this is not a martini.  It's just very interesting acronyms for essentially a certificate program.  Of course.  So that, so they love their acronyms.  They love the acronyms.  So the idea is that a outgoing call would get authenticated, would get it up.  It's basically private public key crypto would get the shaken stir framework.  Would validate handoff of calls because the outbound telecom would give it an  authentication saying, yes, it's from our network.  It's this person.  And then the incoming call could verify that it was from the person making it.  And the theory being, well, you know, spammers, robo callers, aren't going to  use real authentication.  The problem was shaken and stirred sprint says it's very expensive for us to  implement and it won't work because until every telecom in the world uses it, no  one's going to turn on shaken and stir because they will, they'll, it'll reject  international calls and things like that.  Right.  Because not that these are bad callers, but because they're not authenticated  because they're not using shaken and stir.

If you could do me a personal favor, go to G2Crowd or Trustradius and just put in a review  or rating.  I would highly appreciate it.  If you need links to those, just hit up my Twitter link and it would do me a world of  good if I can get at least one review on either of those sites for any IBM systems that  you currently own.  Any IBM systems?  If you're on the mainframe, which is Z Linux 1, if you're on storage, especially if you  have flash storage of our flash systems, we're looking for more reviews.  And if you have any of our servers, which is Power9 specifically.
