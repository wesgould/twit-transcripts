Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  With all the things you do, that's what they remember. Oh, man.  Scoble and I go way back. He used to run my chat room when I did a radio show in  San Francisco in 1990. Was it four, 95? They had chat rooms then? Way back. Way back.  We're writing for Gannett.

Start time: 209.32
End time: 215.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We sent you that headset, and you just didn't want to use it ever.  Yeah, you know, kind of. I'm not a big headset guy, so.

Start time: 231.68
End time: 248.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People don't understand that we carefully think about every  twit episode and who we have on it. It's like wine and cheese.  Sure.  Robert and I think of Om as a good Pinot Noir, maybe 1998 Pinot.  Exactly.  Maybe Opus One.  A little bit of an earthy flavor.

Start time: 248.08
End time: 248.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, earthy flavor.

Start time: 249.10
End time: 282.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then I think of Robert Scoble as kind of that.  What is that stinky cheese that that you put pepper in?  Not Brie. Soft.  No, much stickier than that.  No, like a Gouda maybe?  Anyway, it's good to have you all here.  And just real quickly, if you've decided that this isn't the show  for you and you're watching live, don't worry.  You could still tune in the Mario Marathon 4.  It's going on right now on Ustream. Watch that.  There's some people.  They're drawing pictures on their heads.  They're playing Mario and they've raised $61,000.  Those guys are amazing.

Start time: 282.14
End time: 292.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They also do the Desert Bus for Hope charity every year  and they do these video game marathons.  They're amazing, but they raise money for a good cause.  I only show this to show you that there is, in fact,

Start time: 292.12
End time: 299.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a show more annoying than twit.  No, this is good.  I wanted to give them a plug.  Yeah.  And by the way, just for those in the chat room

Start time: 299.30
End time: 312.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that were wondering where my place in the metaphor  of the wine and cheese, I'm a warmed over can  of Pabst Blue Ribbon.  That for some reason has been waffled around.  Off in the corner.  Yeah, exactly.  I like it.  I like it.  Sure.

Start time: 313.44
End time: 351.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I'm a piece of ham, so it all works.  It works so very well.  You did a very interesting,  there was some really interesting technology news.  We don't very often get big innovations coming at us.  A lot of times they are seemingly innovations  like the SED TVs that we were all excited about  some years ago.  They never, never happened.  But there were a couple of announcements this week  that I thought were very interesting.  One is this new camera that apparently has multiple lenses  and multiple pickups in it and allows you to refocus the image  on any point in the image.  Have any of you actually seen this?

Start time: 352.28
End time: 373.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I got a tour of this back in 2007  when it was a Stanford lab project.  They're putting a grid of micro lenses over the sensor  and they're bending the light to hit different pixels.  And then the processing takes place  and takes only the fourth pixel  and that will be one focus point  and the fifth pixel will be another focus point.  And it's pretty damn cool.

Start time: 375.00
End time: 393.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's L-Y-T-R-O, the Lytro Light Field Camera.  That's the technology they call it, light field technology.  I look at something like this  and I'm always a little bit skeptical.  Like, oh, come on, we'll get one and it's going to be,  there's going to be something wrong with it.  There's always a catch.  There is a catch.  There is a catch.

Start time: 394.36
End time: 417.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the catch?  You give up a little resolution.  If you have a Canon 5D with a 22 megapixel camera in there,  you're going to lose one,  you're going to get one quarter of the resolution  on that sensor because they're taking four of the pixels  and putting a little lens over it.  That makes sense.  That's the catch.  You give up a little bit of resolution  to be able to refocus the picture any time after you take it.

Start time: 418.68
End time: 429.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I'll tell you what I'm really excited for  with something like this though is  that this kind of technology comes  to where we're seeing the most input on sites like Flickr,  which is phones.  You know, when...

Start time: 429.34
End time: 431.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The number one camera on Flickr is an iPhone 4.

Start time: 432.32
End time: 440.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely.  This is a super cool innovation,  but I don't know how much it's really going to get its due  until it gets to a more consumer level where...

Start time: 441.36
End time: 446.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Could you put this in a phone, Robert?  Absolutely.  I expect to see this in phones.  You can't?

Start time: 447.34
End time: 457.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can or you can't?  You cannot because in order to put this thing,  the phone's size has to increase tremendously  the depth of the phone.  Yeah, that makes sense.  Because they're putting little lenses

Start time: 458.38
End time: 459.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and taking away pixels?

Start time: 459.54
End time: 476.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, right.  There's a lot of stuff which...  You know, there's a lot of press about this company  over the last four or five days,  but not many people understand this aspect of it  that they needed a dedicated camera  to get the technology rolled out.  It's not just a lens.

Start time: 477.36
End time: 479.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, it's a big unit.

Start time: 479.44
End time: 495.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's a software play.  I mean, it is also...  There is a certain kind of software  which is getting embedded in your Facebook streams  and all those kinds of stuff.  So it is not as easy as it seems.  I think it's a great technology.  Not at first, Om, but I remember

Start time: 496.44
End time: 513.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  when a Wi-Fi modem was this big.  I saw the first prototypes,  and now it's a quarter of an eighth of an inch  or something on your little cell phone.  Aren't these going to be miniaturized  and the processor is going to be miniaturized  so that they eventually can get into a device  the size of the phone?

Start time: 514.52
End time: 593.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So a couple of things there, right, Robert.  You talk about the Wi-Fi.  The companies which came out at that early days,  remember Lucent, Orinoco, Wi-Fi?  Where are they?  They don't make money.  The guys who make money were Atheros,  who made Chipset,  and now they're part of Qualcomm.  They took a few years for companies  to start making money off their Wi-Fi technology.  And I think same thing is with this company.  They may have a great technology.  There is a big difference between what is technology  and what is a business.  And I think that is an issue.  There is another company out there.  You should look them up.  And I wrote about them about six months ago  or something called Pelican.  And they have a slightly different approach  to doing similar kind of tricks.  But they were optimizing their experience  entirely around the mobile phones  and making mobile phones with higher megapixels,  higher quality, and a much thinner phone.  So I think my view is that any technology  which has to succeed has to succeed inside the phone,  not as a standalone camera.  I think the era of standalone camera is gone.  Really?  Yeah.

Start time: 594.84
End time: 609.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's always going to be a market for it,  but I'm totally on team home here.  That's where you're going to get the most use  and people are going to see it a lot.  And the technology is going to be understood  by the mainstream.  I'm still taking my 5D to the shuttle launch.

Start time: 609.56
End time: 612.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not going to take it.  Yeah, if you go to a shuttle launch.  But this is interesting.  Look at this.

Start time: 613.62
End time: 615.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the Pelican that Om was talking about.  That fits inside a smartphone.

Start time: 616.86
End time: 638.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Robert, I think the key thing is just as  there are people who still write with an ink pen  and there are still people who get their clothes  made bespoke, there is going to be people  who will buy dedicated cameras,  but that market isn't that huge as it seemed  like maybe five, six years ago.  And I totally agree with you.

Start time: 638.60
End time: 663.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if I was going to buy a camera that I was  going to carry around, I'd probably buy a DSLR  that had the high resolution and still put up  with the focusing.  Yeah, it's not so hard to focus.  And you know, I'm renting a 600 millimeter lens  from Keeble and Schuckett in Palo Alto  and you can go to a whole bunch of rental places.  This is an $8,000 lens and it doesn't work  on this camera.  These companies are not meant for the professional

Start time: 664.66
End time: 684.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  photographer or even the prosumer like you.  But the vast majority of photography is done  by people who are taking snapshots of their kids,  snapshots of their dog.  They're out of focus.  The dog moves.  And I think if you get this in a form factor  in a phone size form factor.  But I think Ohm nailed it.  The camera in your phone is good enough.

Start time: 685.68
End time: 692.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are people going to carry around a separate camera?  People complain though.  I have to, no, I agree.  I think you're right.  I don't think people will.

Start time: 692.68
End time: 710.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that right now they've already, we see it.  That's why we see that on Flickr.  But they always complain about how slow the camera  is to take a picture.  They're putting up with it.  It's convenience over the camera.  They're putting up with it.  It's convenience over quality.  And this isn't an ideal situation.

Start time: 710.80
End time: 725.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me ask this because I'm not super up on the tech  specifically on this.  But could you simulate what's going on software wise  by taking multiple photos at multiple points  like digital HDR does?  I mean, could you?  Yeah, I don't know.

Start time: 725.76
End time: 729.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could.  But my baby by that point would have moved.

Start time: 730.92
End time: 735.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, hopefully do one of the points in which  the picture is taken if you're taking multiple pictures.

Start time: 736.22
End time: 745.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then on-wise is another, I think, very important point,  which is you can't just look at these pictures on a website.  You have to have playback software.  It doesn't just go on Facebook.

Start time: 746.42
End time: 752.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although you could, as a photographer, decide  that's the focus point.  And then image it.  And capture that.  Yeah, render it out.

Start time: 753.74
End time: 843.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we also have to think in terms of how as a society  we don't really care about a lot of things.  And one of those things is just taking pictures  and just uploading them.  Because we don't really think a lot about  storage space anymore.  We just kind of, you can take a lot of pictures on your phone.  And pictures are not, they don't have the similar value  in our daily life as they used to have when we were kids.  And somebody would come and take the family portrait.  Now, pictures are just like sharing experiences  on a rapid-fire basis almost in real time.  I mean, look at the crappy quality of photographs  we share on TwitPic and Viafrog and all that.  That's true.  You know, as our idea of what a photo is,  is changing as rapidly as the technology itself.  And I think there is a bigger challenge.  So look, I'm not trying to diss this company, not at all.  I think any company which tries brave new technology  is a good thing for Silicon Valley.  Especially in a world where we are overrun by Groupon clones.  But I really do believe that people need to think  in terms of how do you get this technology to market?  Like, what is it that is going to put this  in millions of people's hands?  And I don't know if anybody is going to spend $400,  $500 for a dedicated camera.  Even $200 for a dedicated camera.  Is this another Foveon?

Start time: 844.50
End time: 863.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Remember how everybody got excited about the Foveon ship  that was going to give us such, you know,  it was a whole different way.  Carver me to figure it out, to take pictures,  and we don't see Foveons anywhere.  Is it like that or is it, you know,  because it certainly happened before  that we've had these great tech.  And this is why I wanted to speak.  This could be because, you know,

Start time: 863.92
End time: 883.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm looking at the pictures I shot at the beach today  and they have almost infinite depth of field on my iPhone.  I mean, I'm sitting right next to my son.  Everything's in focus.  Yeah.  And, you know, so do I feel the pain of focus  that I need to go and buy one of these cameras?  I don't myself, but maybe somebody does.

Start time: 884.34
End time: 890.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess that's the thing is that it is this  this technological leap forward on something  that is not aimed at the market that would use it.

Start time: 891.20
End time: 898.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's an invention that's so cool they couldn't resist it.  Yeah.  But it doesn't solve a problem that exists.  I'll believe you.  I'll buy one just because I'm a geek

Start time: 899.04
End time: 900.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and I want to have something that nobody else does.

Start time: 901.00
End time: 916.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I'm with you on that, Robert.  I am going to spend money on this camera  whenever it comes to market.  If nothing, just to support the company.  I mean, yeah, you've got to support the tech,  especially people who are trying new technology.  We need that kind of innovation.

Start time: 917.28
End time: 921.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Trey Ratcliffe told me he's got one.  He's going to get one.  He got one because he was.

Start time: 922.48
End time: 925.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He said that he was going to pick it up in San Francisco.  He's hoping to have it for the launch.

Start time: 926.04
End time: 951.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, we're going to use that to make different kinds of images  inside the building and stuff like that where you can refocus.  And there it might make sense as a documentary kind of thing  where you need a little bit different kinds of technology.  But for the shuttle launch itself,  I'm not going to use that camera because it's going to be a  it's not going to have a good enough lens because we're  forced to be about half a mile away from the shuttle launch.  I'm going to have a 600 millimeter lens.

Start time: 952.61
End time: 958.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what?  You're not going to take a camera picture  because you're going to be standing next to Trey Ratcliffe.  He's going to be killing it right next to you.

Start time: 959.22
End time: 962.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to bring all sorts of gear.  We're going to have a lot of fun.

Start time: 962.08
End time: 967.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I'm just saying anybody who takes a picture  from the same vantage point as Trey Ratcliffe  is just asking for trouble.

Start time: 967.18
End time: 976.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's going to be showing everything like, oh, I got this.  I got this.  You want to see my picture?  Let me see your picture, Robert.  I got some gum stuck in the lens.  I'm going to be filming him on the tricks he uses

Start time: 976.28
End time: 985.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and the f-stops he uses.  I'm telling you, if you saw the pictures.  Believe me, it's like a college level course  in HDR photography.  Trey's the best.  Just hanging out with the guy for an hour.

Start time: 985.60
End time: 1015.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I promise that as soon as Trey can review that camera,  he will do it on our Twitter photo show  because he's regular on the show  and I cannot wait to see.  And I can't wait to see his pictures from the launch.  He did some great pictures of the last launch.  It's pretty awesome.  I led with this story, and I'll tell you why.  Because for the same reason, Oum, that you're going to buy this,  I want to support these guys.  I think this is exciting.  And then there's another technology  that you kind of broke, Robert, at building43.com.  You got one right there, don't you?

Start time: 1015.57
End time: 1022.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I have a...  They left me one of the explanations  of how this technology works.  This is the video that you shot

Start time: 1023.18
End time: 1037.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  if you go to building43.  Let me show this, and then you can show us the light.  But the idea is you change the way...  The LCD panel, the LED behind it,  those are the same, but you change the way  that the light gets to the LCD panel.

Start time: 1038.05
End time: 1042.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's what this shows.  If you see...  So he's using a standard gallium arsenide

Start time: 1042.40
End time: 1048.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  LED to light these fluorescent tubes.  They're efflorescent in different colors.

Start time: 1048.22
End time: 1068.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, same color light, same blue light,  but as it goes through the materials  that bring the light to your monitor, to your eye,  the better you do those materials,  the richer the color.  So what they did, they came up to my house  and they had two iPads, one with the standard  iPad 2 monitor that mine has in it.  Unfortunately, you can't tell on the YouTube video.

Start time: 1069.26

Transcript:  You really can't.

Start time: 1071.87
End time: 1076.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But when you see it, it's stunning.  They put a red tomato up and it's like,  holy shit, that's cool.

Start time: 1077.32
End time: 1081.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what I gathered from the video  is that the color is more true.

Start time: 1082.60
End time: 1097.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not just more true.  It's deeper.  It's red.  When you see the tomato on the old iPad,  it's a little bit orange.  And when you see it on this new technology,  it's red.  It's beautiful.  So did they say...  It's like when I first saw a Kodachrome film.

Start time: 1098.97
End time: 1100.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like, wow!

Start time: 1100.38
End time: 1102.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It gives us this nice bright color.

Start time: 1102.30
End time: 1106.21

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  as what it costs right now.  So they said there won't be any increase in price.  The battery life won't see any increase in battery life.  Although they said it will increase  over future technologies  because future technologies,  you could get maybe 10% more battery life  by using a technology that doesn't have the color.  And I think that's why they came out to my house  was to sort of spark a conversation.  Do consumers want these really hyper-rich screens  versus another 20 minutes of battery life on their iPad?  I think so.

What's really interesting is today I just learned  from this VC, and I forget her name, I'm sorry,  I'll find it out, that there's another company  that has even better technology in the wings.  And so there's going to be a fight over these new monitors,  which is really exciting.  And I can't wait to get one of these new hyper real  LED monitors.

Transcript:  It's one of the things that's really great about  the tech sphere and it's fun to cover tech,  is you never really know where the next innovation  is coming from.  And when Apple came out with the Retina display  on the iPhone, I think that suddenly started a race  that could end up with these super hyper realistic  displays.

Start time: 1221.86
End time: 1269.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Keep in mind, the technology I saw was on a standard,  was on the same resolution display.  So they said if you put this behind a double pixel display,  a Retina kind of display, you'll see both the higher  resolution and the better color.  When I saw this, when they brought it to my house,  I was like, man, is that the Retina display?  Is that because it looked sharper?  And they said, no, it's no difference resolution.  It was just better light coming through the LEDs.  So the colors were richer and the blacks were richer  and the reds and the greens and the blues.  I mean, it was just, oh my God, when you see them  side by side, it's like, oh my God.  In fact, you were at the Consumer Electronics Show.  Did you go by the LG booth, Leo?  I did.  Did you see the monitor that they were saying  this is a futuristic technology that's coming  sometime?

They said sometimes the colors can be too saturated.  And I said, I've seen it.  I put my own photos on it.  I want one, so put it in there,  otherwise you guys are going to be looking really lame  when there's a screen next to it.  By the way, they can make this for a huge LED,  65, 75-inch LED monitors.

Two very exciting innovations.  Now we get to the meat of the matter.  The FTC is investigating Google.  We've got more hacks.  But also word that LulzSec is retiring.  A LulzSec arrest.  Could it have anything to do with that?  The Winklevies drop their lawsuit,  then bring it back.  There's lots more to talk about.  But that's all coming up in just a bit.  First, and smoke them if you got them, guys.  We're going to take a little break.  I don't know why.  I just assumed.  You saw the new warnings.  Oh, yeah, no.  We're going to have the...

So apparently earlier this week  British authorities arrested a 19-year-old kid,  a kid, Ryan Cleary,  who people now say,  he's not a big shot,  he just ran one of our many IRC servers.  Others are saying this kid has Asperger's syndrome.  The British serious organized crime agency,  Soca, went after him because he hacked  or somebody hacked Soca.  And they got him.  LulzSec said it ain't us,  it's just a minion.  But then,  shortly thereafter, LulzSec says  and by the way, we're retiring.

But it's very, very interesting  to see what  they had a little bit  of a keener kind of PR  for their stuff  than some other hacking operations have.  And that's how anonymous has always gotten  attention, but they had  that little wry, wink-and-a-nod  sense of humor even when they were doing things.

Start time: 1912.62
End time: 1951.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  thing is, in terms of them,  what I think got them  as much attention as they have  is they kept hitting on things that are  in the zeitgeist of popular culture.  At the end of the day, what we will most remember  them for is when they hacked PBS  and put the Tupac Shakur is alive  in New Zealand.  That's the thing.  Sure, if we all sat down  and said, the security  matter, do we want to support an organization  that is their only goal  is to destabilize any measure of security  put on in the internet, you would say  of course, I don't support that.  But at the same time, if somebody puts up the  Tupac's kicking it in Auckland,  we're like, that's hilarious.

Start time: 1952.48
End time: 1975.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I also think one of the reasons it's interesting  is because they, unlike most hackers  who seem like vandals,  kids who are messing around,  or people who are just interested in learning how things work,  these guys were fairly political.  I think we first learned  about them because of their  defense of WikiLeaks. That was the big thing.  I think that's kind of intriguing too  that we're seeing hackers act  politically.

Start time: 1976.70
End time: 2003.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The problem with that is  when it comes to them  just hacking into the US Senate  site and getting usernames  and passwords, it's one thing.  If you get into national security  and if they go, because politically  they are anti our incursion  into Libya, we have to answer  for the fact that  this group has compromised  a military effort and put American lives  in jeopardy, which is  not great.

Transcript:  Leo, I remember one of my first celebrities  interviews was with Waz back  in 89 and we talked specifically about  this issue and he says  it's actually good for society to  have people trying to break in stuff like this  because it makes these systems  more secure over time.  That's a compelling argument for me.

Start time: 2022.88
End time: 2058.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's a larger argument. I think it's good  for society to have outcasts, to have  rebels, to have irritants  because that's where  innovation happens. It doesn't happen  from the people who are comfortable and happy  and just trucking along doing their thing.  It happens from people who are on the fringes  on the outside. This is the kind of irritant  I mean we don't know what LulzSec will  spawn or create and I  admit that there are moral issues about  loss of life associated  with information they release  and yet I think society needs  people like this to stir things up and I kind of  feel like that's what they think too.  That's why they are in it for the Lulz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

No it seemed to be all over the place.  It's just like hey I can break down this  so I'm going to do that.

Transcript:  I think they have opinions and I think they hacked on them.  What was funny to me is  you had another group  that thought that LulzSec was getting too much  publicity and then they were a bunch of script kiddies  so they hacked into PBS  just to show in a more difficult way.  It wasn't that hard.  They're not as good as they think they are.

Transcript:  We were talking about this on security  now on Wednesday but  Twit got hacked.  A very minor hack  they were able to change  we have three servers running  live.twit.tv  they were able to change a line of code  in the jQuery library on one of the  three servers  and I think we ferreted it out  I don't know if we have yet found  how they got in and I think that's one of the reasons  we've gone real public with this.  Fortunately there's nothing on that server  it's completely isolated.  If you had a chat login  that you were using you might want to change that password.  Well and certainly if you  were silly enough to use the same password  for Twit chat  that you used to log into your bank  you might want to change that.  Other than that I don't think there was any harm.  But the point being  we have very good sysadmins  and people are always trying to crack into our systems  we're very alert, we're constantly  updating software keeping everything locked down  and even with I think highly accomplished  experts we still got hacked  it's not possible to seal everything down.

Transcript:  of him. Oh it looks good  in the ASCII. Here's my favorite part about  this story is that they're like Tony  Blair is a war criminal and he has murdered  civilians and he needs to be tried  in world court which  is why we're releasing the number of  his dentist. Finally  this criminal will be brought to justice.  There were some members of parliament in there as well.  There were members of parliament and they wound up calling  I guess it was a number for number 10  Downing Street which some member of Gordon  Brown's entourage  got a call and they're like is this number 10  Downing Street? Tony's not here anymore.

Transcript:  to it. I'll tell you what bugs me  and it bugs me because it affected me  Tuesday morning  the FBI raided a data center  for a Swiss company called  Digital One.  The FBI said it was a move to  quote thwart international cyber  crime rings  distributing scareware. Now I'm not a fan of scareware  this is the software that says  you've got viruses buy our  program and we'll save you and  you know it's a real problem but  unfortunately there was a bunch of it was a bunch of  blade servers and the FBI  apparently couldn't tell one from the other  so they took three  racks of servers  including Instapaper  not knocked offline because Marco was smart  enough to be distributed to various other places  but he was slowed down a little bit  and the delicious  replacement that I use  pinboard.in was off  they were running from backups in fact I think  they're still down  so really  kind of an unfortunate move by the  FBI they've not apologized nor explained  although apparently some of the  servers are now back up I think the Instapaper  server is back up  but you know this is just to me  this is a brute force  blunt instrument and it's just  appalling

Transcript:  here's the only thing that we don't know  about this and I was talking to Andrew  Mayne on the way up here he made the point that  we don't know whether  it was an FBI  thing that they just grab whatever they want or  it was the server  the places where the servers were being held  that when the FBI shows up and says we need to pull  these. They said well that's over there  go just take everything it's ok  maybe it's a poor record caping thing maybe they just  folded

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they shouldn't just take everything  maybe they were told  oh it's over there it's on that take that  if they're told  you take three racks  that's a lot of servers  and as Arment says  the FBI now  presumably is in possession of a complete copy  of the Instapaper database including a full  list of users and any non-deleted  bookmarks passwords are hashed  on Instapaper good news I presume the same  on pinboard that's just good policy  so those passwords would not  be available to law enforcement unless  they really attempted a hardcore brute force attack  on them and the email addresses are  in the clear on  Instapaper as well as the contents of the bookmarks  so there you go  Rackspace would  never have let that happen

Transcript:  so I think it's almost like  you know how we  with the iTunes we went from  buying random albums to  buying the songs we love  but we can't buy everything  we just cannot  afford to own every single  track we like however  with spotify with the subscription  service what you have  is the ability to listen to the music  you like get the playlist  you create on any  device on any screen  in any environment whether  it's at home, work  you don't really have to reinvent  your music experience for different  devices and I think that is  a huge reason  why spotify is going to become  really popular in the US  I mean look at us we are a  society where we have two or  three different screens already  we have a laptop, we have an  iPhone slash Android device  we have a TV  we have your  digital music player like  Sonos so you have a whole  bunch of devices where you need  the content  to be delivered to and I think spotify  has taken the right approach  I think Netflix is  one of the main reasons Netflix  is popular is because you can watch  it on any screen  anytime and you don't have to  worry about oh is this  the same playlist? No it's not  or not so I think it's that  experience is what travels  with you not the physical  music right?

Transcript:  I don't know  I kind of feel that  what's your  engagement level  I think a lot of us  for me first 4 or 5 days it was  extreme amount of attention to this service  and then I found the amount of balance  which I needed like how much time  I want to spend on it  for me this is just discovery  of music it's so much better  than trying to figure out  what to listen to next  or put my  Spotify collection on  randomize  this is a lot of interesting people  sharing interesting tunes  I like that  I'm a little bummed out about  this whole  access to  overseas people being denied  access to turntable  because I was listening to music  recommended by folks from Brazil  from other parts  of Latin America  parts of Middle East  I never heard these songs  I like listening to  global electronic music  it was great to discover those tunes  so there you go  I think this is  the way music industry  has to think of this as a discovery  mechanism not as a way to  destroy  it's not a service which is  destroying value it's actually  creating more value because I found  so many songs which I ended up  buying on iTunes mostly because  they were available  they sounded great  some of them are on  Spotify some of them are not  so I'm actually spending  money on more music it's just like  listening to music on radio  I hope these guys figure it  out the turntable goes  global because  the beauty of turntable is that it can  actually make  global music listening experience  very local  and very personal  they also need a mobile  that can come too  but for now  I think if we are happy with  just this one  the listening aspect of it  but I'm just a little bummed out about the  whole international shutdown

Transcript:  I have to say though that's obviously  the issue that the music labels  don't cross borders  and that's why Spotify wasn't  available in the US they had to negotiate  their deals and vice versa  but I do think that for people  who for a long time were looking  at the music industry and saying these guys don't  get it they don't understand  the internet they don't understand what's going on  they're prosecuting people instead of trying to find  a new business model this is the new  music industry and it seems like they kind of  do get it and they kind of have  a new business model and it actually gives me  some real hope for the future of  music isn't this great for artists?

Transcript:  At least  if you really look at the  hard numbers of how much artists get paid  for streaming services  Spotify they make very little money from  Pandora they make very little money  I'm sure turntable isn't much much better  just because that's the operation that they're running  it's a smaller economy  and the labels on some level  have to look out for those kind of rights  I would say though that I would be  way more excited to see Facebook  integrate with turntable than I  will be Facebook integrating with Spotify  because I think that those natural  friend groupings that I have on Facebook  I would love to match up  with some of my friends there and easily  integrate that into that experience  than necessarily just get another music streaming  service that I could get elsewhere

Transcript:  I wrote about this yesterday  there is an artist in  San Francisco  called Olga Nunez  and she played a set on turntable  and then she shot up to  number 2 on Bandcamp  Wow!  Right there because I think there is  nothing more engaging than  an artist showcasing  their own music  and the music they like  and that's what  there is nothing more  there was a series  of albums which came out  in the late 90s  early 2000 which basically had  people like Massive Attack  and REM playing some of their  favorite almost like  creating a mixtape  and I always bought those mostly because I was  surprised by the music they listened to  and I think that made me relate  to them a lot more  than just their  cookie cutter albums  and I think that is what music is all about  I think the Soundcloud  is another service which is out there  and the music industry is  changing and I think the idea  of what was the old  rules have to change otherwise  absolutely  I mean the artists have to take more control  I mean they have to, makes life a lot  tougher for them but  it also is  their battle to lose

Transcript:  so I actually wanted to  just complete the circular  I wrote a post  about  7-8 months ago  called There is no new media  it's all new consumption  and I hope  I think the point I was trying to make in that  is that we have to stop thinking  in terms of  isolated products  and isolated devices  and isolated sales channels  and we have to think in terms of  a bigger ecosystem and build a business  based on that  I think somebody like  Amazon in my opinion  should start a physical store  which showcases their digital goods  and creates an experience  around that and I think that is where  we will end up  this is very painful

Transcript:  again you are thinking about  Amazon store  as an experience  of buying physical products  what is it that  Amazon can do  it can provide an Amazon space  where people can engage  with Amazon services  whether it's tablets, Kindles  whatever it can provide a place  where its authors can go  and give talks  and read from the book  I mean look those things are very important  for publicizing a book  and for getting a book  in the hands of people  is the book tours  or having an unplugged performance  of an artist  in an Amazon space  who is trying to sell digital music  on Amazon.com  Amazon will have to do it  as it will become more and more  important in our life  as a company it needs to  have that local presence  and also remember  we are living in a world where  we have an iPhone  or a smartphone in our pocket all the time  so for the retailers  itself it's a very competitive  market like  there are apps which can basically  let you check the price  and order it online  while you are looking at it in a store  so the stores have to think in terms of  what is the plus experience  they can offer so that people  come to the store and buy their things  and same is with  Amazon too they need  for people to keep buying  from them but they need to create a whole experience  around it  I'm clearly  maybe a few years too early on this whole idea  I think you are a few

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but apparently it's so different  from the last version of Final Cut  video and film editors all over Hollywood  having a very hard time adjusting to it  well our editors here  at Conan are some of the best in the business  they actually like  the new software, in fact they prepared  this video statement voicing their  support for the new Final Cut Pro

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 5923.20
End time: 5928.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 5929.60
End time: 5946.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and really this is a logical replacement for that  yeah  well I think that's the biggest thing  for professionals who love Final Cut  and live on Final Cut  this was a super jarring thing  I think David Pogue did a great job  of listing  separating what actually is not on Final Cut X

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the measure of Walt's allegiance  I've switched from Pogue to Mossberg  but the measure of Walt's allegiance  do you have to declare?  no you don't  yes eight ball in the corner pocket  in fact Steve Jobs  eight ball in the corner pocket  I'm on team Walt  Mossberg!  I got the Pogue man!  so it's the way he treated  Steven Sinovsky of Microsoft  when he was talking about Windows 8  it was just you know now that we've seen the video  it's not a very friendly reception to Microsoft  on the stage of All Things D  and I have to feel like it was just a little bit of bias  to be honest

Start time: 6417.30
End time: 6440.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean it's hard  I think in general with journalism  we do ourselves a disservice as readers  to think that anybody is truly objective  everybody has their points of view  everybody has their biases  if you think that you can go to one place  and just be like well they tell it like it is  then you're always going to be fooling yourself  and you're always going to be disappointed  read everything that you can and then make your own decision on it  you agree?

End time: 6549.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know what  you know  Walt and David do  or how they interact with  with Apple  but I think from my perspective  the way I see it you just have to do the right thing  you know  every single time  as a writer your only allegiance is  to the readers that's it  you know sometimes  yes you have  your own biases and opinions  you got to let people know  that those are your personal biases and opinions  and that's all  people are smart  readers are smart  they know what to take  at face value  and what to take with a grain of salt  I think we kind of tend to  over generalize and you know  don't give readers that much respect  I personally believe that  our readers are smarter than  the writers themselves  period  that's the end of story  in my opinion  you have to make sure that you're living up to  their expectations every single time  and it doesn't have to be  about a story  the fact everything has to be measured in  with that lens  so sometimes you don't succeed  but most of the time  one has to aim for that  and I think that's what all our senior guys do  whether it's Pogue  or you know  Markov or you  we've learned from guys like you  so we can't really say  anything the other way  I mean I've seen you guys  how you've done it  and have basically taken a cue from all of you
