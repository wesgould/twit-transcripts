Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is TWIT, This Week in Tech, Episode 17 for August 8, 2005.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, it is another TWIT episode and a jam-packed house tonight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Kevin Rose is in the house with his t-shirt that says, TV makes you smarter.  Is that a Jinx hackwear?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  No, no, I just found this in the mall.  That was funny.  He makes you smarter.  He used to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You just look at it and you laugh.  Patrick Norton is sitting right next to him.  Hey Patrick, he's got the Madonna mic on.  His t-shirt says, home brewed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  And he doesn't even drink anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Open 24 hours after this is a skate shop on Long Beach Island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Also on Skype, we've got a big crowd, John C. Dvorak, who figured out what was wrong  with his mic and he's too embarrassed to tell us.  No.  From all the way from Irvine, California, home of the big disc drive manufacturers.  Aren't they all down there?  Steve Gibson, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, all the router manufacturers are down here.  Lynxist and D-Lynx.  That's right.  Netgear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, D-Lynx and Fremont.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, there's something of them down here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They have their little Irvine operation down there.  And Robert Heron, who is of course one of the former lab rats now at PC Magazine.  And you're in the East Bay, yes?  Yes I am.  All right.  And Roger Chang, who is just...  Always around.  We just call him Yahweh for short.  Hey, if you want to...  This is I think the largest group we've ever had.  Seven geeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I got the story of the day.  Biggest story of the week.  I'm going to read it straight from the press release from the FCC dated August 5, 2005.  FCC eliminates mandated sharing requirements on incumbents, wireline, broadband, internet  access services.  Decision places telephone and cable companies on equal footing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it puts the small ISP out of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, FCC today adopted policies that will bring more and better broadband services to  consumers by eliminating facility sharing requirements on facilities based wireline,  broadband, internet access service providers.  Now who wants to translate that into real speak?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What's it mean?  What's it mean, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I mean basically it means the baby bells no longer have to allow line sharing for smaller  DSL companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it puts the people like my local ISP Sonic Net in deep, deep trouble.  It's actually very bad news for them.  Sonic...  You don't get that for a fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't...  Just because they don't have to doesn't mean they won't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well that's the...  I mean that's the interesting question I think right there, you know, is whether or not,  you know, large the baby bells will in fact shut off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well I'll tell you my experience from Sonic Net, which is right up here.  We've had Dane Jasper, their CEO on the screensavers.  He's a...  He runs CISPA.  He's one of the members of CISPA, the California Internet Service Providers...  Independent Internet Service Providers Association.  He says SBCs would try to put him out of business for years and you bet SBC will not come off.  Now you're sitting in here right now with a SBC provisioned line, but a DSL Extreme  provided connection.  Let's see how long it takes before SBC says you've got to go with Yahoo or nothing.  Don't you think they'll do that immediately?  Why do the FCC do that?  They've always done that with cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The FCC sold out.  They've sold out years ago.  It's a pathetic organization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Yeah, I have to say I agree with you.  Yeah.  Ever since they did the whole selling off the frequencies five years ago or six years  ago, it seemed to go downhill from there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What happened essentially is that DSL lines are considered an information service, not  a telecommunications service.  So that's how...  How does that work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I get a DSL signal.  Where's the information?  There's nothing on it.  That's a good point.  That's a good point.  This is going to go to court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is not going to last.  This is going to go to court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is going to go to court.  This is not going to last.  If this is going to get overthrown, I guarantee it.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Next topic.  Next topic.  Well, that went down fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  TPM, trusted platform...  What is it?  Trusted...  No, I can't remember.  I know what TCPA is, Trusted Computing Platform Alliance.  Trusted Platform Module, I guess.  It's the chip that...  Well, all right.  It's Palladium.  Let's call a spade a spade.  This is the Microsoft Dark Horse that they floated a while ago and when everybody said,  Whoa, they said, oh, it's not Palladium anymore.  It's a industry-wide consortium of people who are looking to protect you from yourself.  But the reason it surfaces once again, Microsoft's kind of shut up about it, but all of a sudden  there's rumors that Apple has put a TPM chip on the motherboard of some, apparently not  all, but some of the developer boxes they shipped out.  Now, why is that a bad thing?  Well, because TPM not only provides built-in hardware copy protection, but it also provides  built-in hardware copy protection, but it also allows people to do things like, for instance,  destroy a song that you don't own by reaching into your computer and pressing a button in  effect.  It also allows a company that makes a program, say a word processor called, I don't know,  Microsoft Word, to prevent anybody else from reading files created with that program.  It is a serious, I think, invasion of the user's privacy.  Any thoughts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is BS.  This is going nowhere.  It's a dead end.  It's never going to happen.  No, I think it is.  And I think, here's the irony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think Microsoft realized it was a bad idea and just like you, backed off.  But then Apple said, well, wait a minute, we've got some way, we've got to some way  figure out how to protect OS X to keep people from installing it on Dell.  TPM, hallelujah, we're saved.  Well, isn't also the bigger reason is they're looking for a more secure way if they do plan

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  to move forward with a movie version of iTunes?  Even the TPM people say it's not very good for copy protection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It actually isn't a good technology for copy protection.  They're better DRM systems.  It's really designed to do things like prevent you from running applications on your system.  Yeah, it means essentially it's a dongle on the motherboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, it's exactly what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And by putting that dongle on the motherboard, Apple can ensure or at least attempt to ensure  that you don't run OS X on it.  So has there been any software that's tied in with this or is this just a copy of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  kernel or is this just appeared right now but nothing has actually been written to tie  in with it?  Some say it's in the kernel.  Oh, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But this is no problem because you can't get straight answers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's a good doubt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Why don't you buy this, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's because it'll get hacked out.  It's not going to work if they think they're going to do this just to protect OS X from  going into the wild.  I mean, they've got to have their heads up their ass.  There's no way that this can't be stopped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, that's, but I mean, they're going to try, right?  Or are they just going to say, oh, forget it.  We can't stop it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why should they even be trying?  Why don't they just take the maybe Steve Jobs should take a look at his bank account and  compare it to Bill Gates's and say, well, hey, maybe maybe there's something to this idea  of like selling an operating system into the wild.  Yeah.  I mean, we could probably get 100 bucks a pop for it.  I think there's some money to be made.  What is the problem?  I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, because Apple believes it's a hardware company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  They are.  It's a solutions company.  That's ignorant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That really is.  So basically the exact you know what this model is.  I don't know if anybody goes back this far, but there used to be a company called North  Star Computers.  I had that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm going to go back that far.  I had North Star.  North Star or Northgate?  North Star.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Or CPM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a long time ago.  Oh, CPM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Competitor of a CPM.  And they had their own OS, but they didn't, would only sell it with, you know, some of  their hardware.  They were tied to the hardware and it was like the company's broke.  Now, does Apple want to go this way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Nobody even remembers North Star.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, nobody remembers Osborne, you know, once you get outside of a certain user group  either.  What's wrong with Apple trying to protect the operating system and tie it to their hardware?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think they have to.  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's BS too.  I think this is nonsense.  They can still sell hardware.  People are still going to buy the Apple for this brand name and they can also sell software.  What's wrong with having two income streams?  I just don't understand why they have to lock this thing down.  If you put it out into the wild, you're going to have a heck of a lot more developers working  on it, that's for sure.  I agree.  It's going to get critical mass.  It's going to blow away Microsoft.  But, you know, they're just afraid of it.  They're afraid of the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Wouldn't that really kill their PowerBook and their Power Mac sales though?  I mean, if you can build a PC for $600 and throw an OS X on it for $100, then you have  a $700 machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People who are going to buy a cheap machine are always going to buy a cheap machine.  People who buy those PowerBooks like them because they're cool.  I mean, I would probably buy a PowerBook as opposed to one of these IBMs or Lenovo or  whatever the heck they're going to call it.  And Apple stuff isn't that overpriced anymore.  That's what they keep arguing.  I agree.  Maybe it's $100.  So what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm looking at both Kevin and Patrick who are sitting here with their ThinkPads.  We both have Lenovo's right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Well, you know, I mean, I think maybe because Apple got burnt on the whole kind of Mac clone  that Scully put forward and they were hoping to expand Mac user base but ended up eating  into the existing Apple.  I like this theory though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What if maybe Steve really does say, we know we're going to be a software company?  This is just, you know, this is the future for Apple.  Then there's no TPM.  So why do you think they're, are they playing with TPM?  Just as maybe it is to protect movies.  Maybe it is to try to protect something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Maybe they're just trying to multiple solutions to see what sticks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe they're trying to piss people off and get that guy on boing-boing to remove his Apple tattoo.  It really does strike me as a secure platform for multimedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's really the primary focus of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but does anybody still believe because most of the, most of the online systems for  distributing media now are all based on regularly changed encryption or regularly, you know,  rotated encryption that's being done for, you know, temporary online distribution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Everybody agrees you've got to change the encryption a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, because Hollywood, you know, I think Hollywood probably learned its lesson from CSS at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It could also be that they're applying a unique identifier, a really good unique identifier for everyone's system then.  So that even if the file still goes, you can at least say who grabbed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Every Intel chip has a unique identifier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, every grab, every Ethernet card has a unique identifier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but you can, you can spoof a Mac address.  You can't spoof the Intel chip as far as I know.  You can't spoof the Intel chip ID.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Well, I don't see why anyone's so pissed off right now.  I mean, they're just playing around with it.  Obviously they haven't made any firm commitments, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree with that too.  I mean, why should we jump to conclusions?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because that's what we're here for.  Our job is to jump to conclusions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did you see that?  Great. We're the Fox News of tech coverage.  We decide.  We do innuendo better than any other tech journalists in podcasting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We decide you shut up and sit down and listen.  And we'll tell you what's.  Hey, did you see the new Trio 670 on a gadget?  Oh, I did.  That's cool.  Is that true or do you think that's a hoax?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I hope it's true.  I'm tired of the pommel ass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  A Trio running pocket PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Wow.  Well, was it, didn't they recently just split off or someone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I don't get it because isn't Trio made by Palm?  Yeah, but didn't Palm, Palm like.  Palm, Palm, split Palm one and Palm source into two divisions.  And then has recently renamed them.  I don't know if they're reunited, but they're all Palm again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Aren't they going to be Linux based now?  They're coming out with a new OS.  It's very confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But all right.  So if you had your choice, a Trio 670 based on Palm or pocket PC, which would you choose?  Is the pocket PC going to have any battery life?  Yeah, let's say it has battery life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, say we can get a decent eight hours of battery life out of it.  It's tempting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Maybe with the pocket PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Although, you know, Kevin, what was your reason for hating the Trio 650?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I just personally didn't like how bulky it was.  It was a little clunky for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now, Steve Gibson is such a Palm fan that he actually has tungstins in his freezer.  How many tungstins do you have in your freezer, Steve?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think I have about six or seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're going to have to explain to me why you've got seven tungstins in your freezer.  You can't just leave that one laying there, Steve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm totally addicted to reading books on my little T, on my Palm tungstins.  I think it's just a fantastic book reading platform.  I carry it around with me all the time.  And I didn't like what I was seeing Palm doing.  I mean, who knows when they were going to just give up and disappear.  And just like, you know, Northgate keyboards or HP 35 calculators,  I mean, I fall in love with these particular devices and I don't want to ever be without them.  So this is just a long-term inventory storage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  By the way, he has Northgate keyboards and HP calculators in his freezer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have one Northgate keyboard yet that I won't even type on.  I'm saving it for like the day I start my novel.  How many do you have, Steve?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How many what?  Northgate keyboards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The good news is I used to have 23 employees and every single one of them had a Northgate keyboard.  I got rid of the employees and I kept their keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Here's a man who values their keyboards more than the values of his employees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have Northgate keyboards all over the house and my garage is full of them.  And I mean, it's just the best keyboard ever made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why don't we take the whole TWIT organization here, form TWIT keyboards.  So just go to, one of us can go over to Taiwan and we'll do a deal and we'll make the damn keyboard again.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's more profit in it.  But now what makes a Northgate keyboard so much better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the ALPS key switch.  The key switches are from a company called ALPS that was the, it's just the best feeling key.  However, it's expensive because it's not one of these membrane keys that you're able to just spit out of the production line.  However, there is a company producing something called the Avant Stellar keyboard.  If you put Avant Stellar into Google, it'll take you to like CVC Inc. or something.  And they're ex-Northgate people still in Minnesota that are making these keyboards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, Minnesota. That explains it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Have you seen the new OLED keyboards?  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The mock-up of that one's pretty cool.  Beautiful.  It's also incredibly expensive.  I don't care. I won't want one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What about the Matthias Tactile Pro keyboard?  Anybody heard of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Avant Stellar or Stellar?  It's CVTinc.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  CharlieVictoryTangoInc.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now I have to tell you, the Tactile Pro uses ALPS Mechanical's key switches.  That's tempting.  That's a good start.  It looks just like the Apple, it looks like an Apple keyboard.  It's basically the old Apple keyboard, once again.  Because Apple's extended keyboard uses the ALPS switches also.  It's only 99 bucks too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Does anyone use those ergonomic keyboards anymore? The split ones?  Yeah, I did. I used one that worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Really?  All of them.  I hate those things.  Actually, I know some people who use them.  I actually use it so long, I'm used to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They make me nauseous.  I mean like this?  Yeah, like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  You get nauseous?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I know a couple people who use it.  I know one guy who's hoarded a bunch of the old, I can't think of the name of it, Lexmark split keyboard,  which is the ugliest keyboard ever made, but you could infinitely adjust the angle.  And he says it's the only way he can keep from going back to carpal tunnel surgery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is a Microsoft Natural Keyboard Pro, but unlike every other keyboard I have,  it has two health warnings on the back of it and a health warning on the cord.  Like this keyboard, this healthy keyboard, actually is more dangerous than the other ones I've got.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or they just knew more about lawsuits at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, my Apple stuff doesn't have any warnings. I don't see keyboard warnings anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The problem I have with getting used to a wacky keyboard is you can't always find one.  I mean if you're going to use a laptop, it's going to have a straight across keyboard.  It seems to me it's better to get used to something that you're always going to be able to use universally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there's probably one in your freezer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Does anybody ever use one of these bat cording keyboards or any of these wacky?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, I have a friend of mine who's a programmer and who basically had the choice between learning how to use one of those and never programming again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because he had carpal tunnel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Bad. If he types for an hour on a normal keyboard, he's done for a couple of days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They look like giant piano keys. There's several of them. There's not very many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a couple of them. There's the chord based keyboards and there's also the ones where you actually kind of sink each of your five fingertips into and you can move them up, down, and left and right to tab the keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  He's just learning a new keyboard.  Do they look like stenographers? Like a court stenographer's keyboard?  Yeah, kind of.  Because I used to have a class with a girl who was deaf, but she actually had a stenographer that this school sent with her.  So she was like she would literally take notes in class and I like bumped the notes off her after.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's a really good deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Who's played with the Mighty Mouse?

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Here I am to save the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Anyone?  I ignored it at the Apple store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We should have bought one. We're trying to find one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  I was trying to play with it, but a bunch of people were hovering over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Steve Jobs, the king of one button mice, finally gives in and makes what?  Like a five button mouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Thank God.  Yes, finally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's instantly sold out everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It is. You can't find them.  Yep.  Just shows you.  Steve is one of those people who says, I know better than 50 million other people.  And some of the time he does.  Well, some of the, maybe, I don't know, 50 million is a lot of people.  He's telling basically an entire world, no, you want two buttons, but you're not going to get them.  Finally gave in.  I wonder, I got to wonder who is it at Apple that went to Steve with his design and said, can you imagine Terror?  His wife.  Mr. Jobs.  I've got this mouse.  No, don't get upset.  It still looks like it has one button.  Yes, right.  You can't tell.  You can't tell.  But people want the multi button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Probably the only thing you had to do was to show Steve how many people were running Microsoft mice on Macintosh machines.  Like me.  Everybody.  Exactly.  And then he said, OK, no more of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  First thing I did every time I get a Mac is I go out and buy a three button mouse, you know, scroll wheel.  Now, so nobody's tried this so we don't know how this little.  No, I play with it.  What's the nipple?  How does that work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  It's like a little tiny track ball almost.  Oh, it is?  Yeah, it actually rolls like a little track ball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it lets you go left, right, up, down and diagonally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Right.  For all those diagonal scrolling that you need to do.  Is it a good gaming mouse?  I don't know.  I haven't played with it for gaming.  But it still only has one moving button.  Right.  It's really strange because you're so used when you grab an Apple mouse.  You're normally, you know, you're pushed down for that single big huge click.  But this you kind of have to rotate to the right a little bit.  It's weird.  But I'll tell you what, after about five minutes of playing with it, I got used to the right click.  But you shouldn't have to go 60 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's not wireless.  Forty nine bucks.  Forty nine bucks.  It's recorded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Here's something interesting though.  It works with Windows.  Does it?  Yes.  Out of the box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes.  You have to install drivers on the Mac.  You have to install drivers for this thing?  Not for the three button, but for the additional features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like, it's great.  It's like click.  Single button looks multi-button charm.  Click, squeeze, roll or scroll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Now, do those love handle buttons?  Is that just the squeeze?  Is that just one button or is there one on each side?  The squeeze is weird because you don't feel anything when you squeeze it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  There's no click-like feel to it.  You just squeeze and then nothing happens on the screen and you wonder what you're doing.  Instant collector's item.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Apparently out of the box, both buttons do the same thing.  You have to reprogram it.  Is that what it is?  I was squeezing it and I was like, okay, what's this thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I think Heron just hit it right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is a future collector's item.  Nobody's going to use that in a professional day-to-day basis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's sold out.  Well, that's a...  Hell yeah, because it's new and it's Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The Apple Army is amazing.  It is amazing.  They'll buy anything.  It's almost like the Twit Army.  I do think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  I would just think the Twit Army is a little more selective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I would hope so.  Look at our keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why?  And the fact that they ever sold some newtons demonstrates that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We have.  Although I have to say, I've been bit twice because I also bought a tablet PC, which is  essentially just a newton.  Why did you go out and do something like that for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Actually, didn't you find it useful for doing the television stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought you were going to say...  Because you were like, finally!  That's why I bought it.  I found a use for a tablet, Patrick, other than browsing the web on the toilet.  I was like, what's wrong with browsing the web on the toilet?  It's spending $1,500 to browse the web on the toilet for an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But the idea for TV was, yeah, here's no keyboard, you just use a pointer.  Remember, we always try to do telestrators.  The problem is, there is no...  I thought there was.  Only in PowerPoint is there kind of telestration capabilities.  They're all built into the operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you guys ever had any contact with that OQO, that little QO Windows thing?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You've just nailed it right there.  It's a very cute little Windows thing.  I can't imagine anybody buying that.  And everybody wants one, and then...  Until they get it.  I know a couple people who have bought them, and it's like, it's really cool.  I'm now going to have an entire desktop installation, and they can carry it from place to place.  And you look at them, and you kind of say, well, why not a notebook?  And they go, this is smaller.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's about six inches by five inches.  You can see they're ahead of the time, too, because eventually everyone will have something they can't carry around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I disagree.  No, because the user interface device doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The keyboard has to be a certain size to be usable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But say like a USB thumb drive that can contain not only all your information, but your favorite OS,  and you could just plug that easily into somewhere that allows you to give your video and your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You guys are missing the point with the OQO.  What's the point?  The thing's really not designed to be used as an everyday computer.  It's really more of an embedded system.  You put it in some sort of an inside of an airplane or something,  and you only use the keyboard to reprogram something that's running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but they have embedded systems that cost a lot less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, they do, but they don't have embedded systems with all this I.O. and with the keyboard and with the little screen and all that.  That's the whole point of an embedded system is to avoid all of the desktop stuff you don't need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So John, is anybody buying this and using it that way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think NASA's got a bunch of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who's buying NASA?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did they send you one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you know what? Let me tell you that story.  Not that I'm complaining.  About four years ago, I first got a hold of these guys.  I said, oh yeah, yeah, we're going to come out with it any minute.  This thing's taking forever to get onto the market, by the way, after David Ditsel first showed me one of them.  And then a couple years ago, finally, I said, oh yeah, we're going to get you one as soon as it comes out.  I never got one.  And I don't think they...  This is one of those things.  I don't think they're going to stay in business that long because they're very much both.  And the other one is Paul Allen's got a clone of it, which is like this is another brain dead idea.  Paul Allen took on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  What's the name of the Paul Allen computer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a little bitty thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember seeing that.  Lots of money and then it just drops off after three years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It gets bored.  A computer that gets bored and goes away.  It sells itself for below market value.  That kind of a computer?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Does anybody have any burning questions or should we go to our burning topics or should we go to their...  Are you okay, Patrick?  He just lost a lot.  Or should we go to our questions from our Twizzins?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have another item here that needs addressing.  In fact, it's on my blog if anyone wants to jump in on this.  Apparently there was a very obscure in the Portland Business Journal, a very obscure interview with Jeff Hawkins.  And I have this actually on the blog now.  I was reading that last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hawkins says that he's got something else up his sleeve.  He says his first invention was the handheld PDA.  Then they put the phone.  Now there's something new.  I read this and read it over and said what the heck could it...  I mean there's nothing out there.  There's no...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You should explain to everybody listening, John, that for those who don't know who Hawkins is,  he essentially is one of the big founders at Palm, slash Palm One, slash Palm whatever it is this week.  And he's now the CTO.  And he invented graffiti.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Although then got sued saying somebody else invented it like Xerox PARC.  Oh well, never mind, I didn't invent it after all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's beside the point.  The thing is he is considered the father of the modern PDA.  Yes, I agree with that.  So he's got some new thing he's supposed to blend the next generation.  And so anyway, I have an open forum.  If anybody thinks they can figure this out, I'd be interested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think it's called IT, maybe Ginger, and it's going to revolutionize the way cities are built.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's got to be voice recognition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think he may have stumbled upon a way of doing voice recognition because he's a neuroscientist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's really the big leap right now for all small devices.  Samsung even showed off a CES, that one cell phone that incorporated a voice recognition system  where you didn't have to do text using the keypad.  You could actually text message other people just by speaking the words themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, you talk about making devices smaller.  Exactly. I mean what's the limiting factor?  It's the keyboard. It's 19th century technology we still use for data input.  But the problem with voice recognition is are we going to have a world of people walking around talking to their computers?  We already know.  People do that to their cell phones.  Well, this is going to make it worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  No, it needs to be some sort of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm sitting in here with two guys typing on their computer.  I've got a computer in front of me.  If we were all talking to our computers, it would be nuts in here.  Yeah.  Imagine any office.  Imagine airplanes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Imagine somebody talking, quote unquote, to themselves when they have an earpiece.  At least you hope they're doing that.  Speaking of which...  I'm a ham-free kid here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it would be cool in the office because you could come in there with a megaphone  and then yell at the top of your lungs, format, 5C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Oh, what if he is typing...  Well, my question, what if he has to punch in a password?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  My password is...  I do on a tablet PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If we're talking about sci-fi, how about a little band you wear around your neck  and then you just sub-vocalize what you want?  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or if you just have one that has ESP and just reads your thoughts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Or like an aircraft pilot microphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I need a babel fish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But do the aircraft pilots talk?  Yeah, they still have to talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They have to say something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Hello to it.  My name is Kati and I'm calling from...  Congratulations on winning the podcast awards.  I'm really impressed with your program.  You guys have a lot of fans in Germany, so keep going.  I have two questions for you.  Question number one.  The Sony PlayStation 3 has announced to support both Linux and Macintosh OS X.  And having a highly advanced system configuration,  do you think that this is how the future of computing is going to look like?  Not a steep drop.  And question number two is...  How soon is Microsoft going to die?  Thanks.  I love to hear your opinions on this.  Bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Thank you, Kati.  That's good.  So we were just talking about that.  That's a good point.  OS X as well.  But Apple will never let OS X ship for the cell processor.  But it's interesting that it runs on the cell.  Yeah, that is interesting.  That's what, you know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  I wonder if it runs directly or is it running through an emulation layer?  I think it will because it's a PowerPC.  Yeah, that's what we...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hi, this is Michael Haratani from Las Vegas, Nevada,  calling for some help, you guys.  But before I ask for help,  I need to congratulate you guys for your two podcast awards the other day.  Way to go, you guys.  Anyways, my question is this.  I downloaded Suzy 9.3 Linux.  I'm a newbie.  Problem is I can't play audio files or MP3 files on it.  It doesn't recognize it or something or I'm missing some kind of plugin or download.  And the other problem is when I listen to KFI 640 today,  it says missing plugin, can't find it, and I need your help.  What do I do?  Thanks a lot. Bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That should work.  I don't know why it's not working.  He just needs the MMS player.  Yeah.  With Linux, that pretty much does it all.  You may need some plugins, but if you go to their site,  they tell you all the plugins you should get.  XMMS.  XMMS is wonderful, yeah.  It's great.  Hey, I should mention that two people now have mentioned in a row,  we should probably say that we did win the People's Choice Podcast Award for  the People's Choice, which I guess is the best podcast of the year,  and Best Technology Podcast.  Yay.  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  And we only begged a little.  And then you're going to go pick those up, right?  I hope you all will.  Yeah, we should go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We should all be there.  I'd like everybody to come down.  We'll foot your bill.  And yeah, November 11th in Ontario.  November?  November 11th.  Ontario, California.  Sorry, don't get your hopes up.  Oh, I love that airport.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  It's like a bus station.  Winter in Canada, yeah.  No, Ontario, California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's the Podcast Expo.  It's the first podcast trade show.  Boy, that should be fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I'm keynoting it, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, my great fear is that the whole thing will be over by the time the  expo happens and we'll be moved on to the next thing, right?  Podcasting will be dead and it'll be just kind of pathetic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  It'll be like current TV?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, TV makes you smarter, don't you know?  It's current TV even.  Hello, this is Jason Boston.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Email address is twitcommander at yahoo.com.  I think I found the MP3 player that I'm interested in.  I wonder if anybody has any experience with this card.  Their website is pogoproducts.com.  And the player is called RadialYahwayLX.  I got one right here.  It has a built-in AM and FM.  Yeah, I got one right here.  I'm holding it up.  It kind of looks like an iPod, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, it looks just like an iPod.  It's got AM, FM radio, but it records.  It's got like a little VCR capability.  You know, I don't think it's the greatest MP3 player in the world  because it's SD-based.  So it has some internal memory.  How many is the biggest SD you've got?  A gigabyte?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, two now.  Two? Really? Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How many can normal people afford?  Well, even a gig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, that's some music.  Think of it as a solid-state player with radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can get two gigabytes of flash on a keychain now for about $150.  You're kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Ouch. $250 for this thing though with 512 megabytes of memory.  Yeah, I think it's a little pricey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're kind of out of touch.  Yeah, John, some people buy their stuff.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, it is strange. I don't understand it myself.  Some people just, I guess...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, the whole point of that thing would be the AM and FM recording.  That's the whole point.  You may as well just buy a Radio Shark from Griffin Technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but what if you don't have a computer?  I just did a radio show and I tuned into this at the radio station and I recorded it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I got it. You just laid that one in the road and I got to run over it down the truck.  What if you don't have a computer?  They're not probably listening to us and they're probably not really interested in moving content onto a portable video player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But some people would... This is like a transistor radio. It has a speaker.  Sure. Okay.  And it has headphones and you can record and listen back without ever having a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So for the people who want to do time shifting on a portable digital device that don't have a computer,  this is definitely an option and you should tell them about it.  And have 250 bucks to waste.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What recording formats does this support?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because that was one problem I ran into with the last AM FM recorder I looked at was that it was using voice recording quality rather than audio.  This is MP3. This is MP3.  This is MP3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  MP3 up to, I think, 128 kilobits.  Up to 256.  That's nice.  Yeah, so it's a real recorder. I record AM radio shows at 64 kilobits and it sounds great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Hello, Leo. This is Brian from Hoboken, New Jersey.  I was wondering if you and the gang could tell us a little bit about Ruby on Rails.  I hear it's the successor to PHP and the future of web development.  But what do you guys think?  I love this.  Thanks a lot and keep on tweeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I love this study that just came out from a proprietary programming company that says PHP is dead.  Yeah.  Don't use PHP. It's dead.  Use our product.  I've used Ruby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's on Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Ruby comes on OS X, actually.  Yeah.  And Ruby's actually pretty powerful. I like it a lot.  I haven't used Ruby on Rails. There's a good Ruby's on Rails podcast.  Well, it's good if you can, the problem, they have audio quality, like I should complain.  Audio quality issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So for those of us who avoid programming the web possible, what exactly is a full stack open source web framework for Ruby  and writing real world applications with joy and less code than most frameworks spend doing XML sit ups?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So a programming language like Ruby is useless without frameworks, which basically give you high level access to things like networking.  Ruby on Rails is a set of frameworks that make it easy for you to write quick networking applications.  So it's a really good way to cobble together fast applications.  But you know, any good modern programming language is like Pearl's got a CPAN, PHP has tons of modules, any modern language is going to have a lot of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I've heard good things about Ruby on Rails. This is done by those guys, 37signals, the same ones that do the Basecamp, if you used Basecamp before.  It's kind of like a project management application for the web.  They also make another one called Backpack.  Backpack's great, I have used Backpack.  Yeah, Backpack's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Amber's a big fan. Amber turned me on to Backpack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I think she turned me on to it too.  The audio was actually coded in Ruby on Rails.  There you go, that's a good example.  But I hear that, you know that company Silver Orange, a design company, they're coming up with a kind of like, I don't know if they're going to open source it or what,  but it's kind of a competitor to Ruby on Rails but for PHP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do we, oh interesting, so a framework that works for PHP.  That would be nice because people use PHP so much now for web programming. I don't think PHP's dead by the way.  By no means.  Far from it. Is DIG in PHP?  Yeah, it's all PHP in my scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  And it scales well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, we're having no problems right now anyway.  Yeah, well I'm sure you're getting a lot of traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Oh yeah, we're on multiple machines and it's all on how you code it though, you know, it only scales as well as the coder behind it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Smart coder makes a big difference.  That's true, very true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  Hello, my name is Jay Beeman. I'm in San Francisco.  So Prager's borrowing, using, stealing internet from his neighbor.  I have been doing this thing for a long time and I'm moving into a new house,  set up my own Wi-Fi network and want to leave it open for the Prager's of the world that live next door.  Let's give us a dress.  I don't have to worry about security issues, should I not buy anything online?  That's what I want to know. I want to leave it open. Sharing is good.  Should I be scared? Thanks guys, I love the show. I'll talk to you soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think Steve Gibson has a good answer for him because you've been playing with the OpenWRT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, okay, he's going to have to be very careful if anyone is going to be hooked into his network no matter what he does.  But he could certainly put an access point upstream of a NAT router.  So have two separate devices, have whatever wireless access point he wants to use  and then protect his internal network with a nice lock down that router.  And he's going to be pretty safe. But things like email, for example,  where your passwords in the clear to your remote SMTP and POP servers, that's still going to be a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know anybody who's ever been packet sniffed like that or just data has been monitored to the point where they were being attacked.  You were at DEFCON.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's kind of funny is the whole point of the wall of sheep at DEFCON is to point out that you are sending out your password in an open network.  And this is a sketchy and dangerous thing to do if someone decides to attack the system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the question pointed out. For shopping though, with a secure browser on a secure site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, you're safe there.  I think he should be more worried about. I mean, I think part of maybe what he's asking about is, you know,  what if somebody's using my open, you know, WAP to download some files off the MP3.  I believe there's someone sitting in this room who was creating a four terabyte mobile peer to peer sharing system that he could rotate from open access point to open access point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Just a technology demonstration, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it proves the point that concept, you know, you will wipe it well as someone who maybe, you know, he may be less worried about, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, that's why I'm recommending this open WRT with this, you know, the Svea software and open WRT allows you to create basically a I think secure access point that people can log into.  You could validate that you don't have to have them.  You don't have to have them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but you see, I don't want to be, you know, the problem is, there's two other problems before that is one, you don't want to be responsible for what people download your system.  So you're either going to be ignorant or not.  Two, there are ISPs out there that are looking at traffic and if they think you're consistently downloading too much traffic, they may say, hey, or more is more than one person using your, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And that would be our first advice. Check with your ISP. Make sure it's even allowed to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, because pretty much nobody but Speakeasy and some other smaller local ISPs, you know, are OK with you sharing it.  Are most of them ever going to notice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's no way for them to figure that out, though. Not behind a NAT router.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not by, I agree, not by the NAT router, but they are, they are looking, you know, they are looking at your traffic to see what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In some cases, they're also, by the way, wait.  But they're all advertised to be unlimited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, yeah, and that's, you know, that's where it gets really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know nobody that this has happened to and I'll be honest with you, I leave file sharing applications running 99% of the time.  I look at my last upload status and it's it's approaching 500 gigs of uploaded.  Wow, you gotta be careful. Some of them have restrictions. Absolutely.  Who cares? Well, that wasn't when I signed up for, you know, my cable down.  It's like, you know what? You quote unquote guarantee this download bandwidth in this upload.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You gotta look at you gotta look at total bandwidth there. You read your user, your end user license agreement.  You may have a limitation on how much bandwidth you can.  I mean, not not who cares. You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Robert, Robert, you'll care what the care is.  The bill is going to make you care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm switching providers and suddenly I've got another three months at half my rate.  So they want to keep me more than they want to hassle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Well, that's the way it's always if you're doing 500 gigs a month and transfer and paint 1995, something tells me that eventually they might not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not paying 1995. I'm paying closer to like 60 bucks a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Cable. Yeah. Well, the other interesting question is, you know, it would be really interesting to find out whether or not they're paying more attention to that in suburban areas or urban areas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And if they even notice, they can't. There's just too much data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think they're monitoring it. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is what commander.  I would call her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You heard Twit Commander. Let's move on.  I think people are taking this just a little bit too seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  Under his breath.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Hey, Twits. This is Brian in Pittsburgh.  I hear a lot of things about the Mac Intel switch, but nobody's really mentioning the fact that there's so many x86 ports of open source applications out there.  Do you think this had anything to do with Apple's decision to switch to the Intel platform?  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you know what else?  We also think that IBM claiming that, you know, Apple never asked them for a low power chip and that the three gigahertz chip is just around the corner.  That's bogus, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hi, my name is David from Houston, Texas.  I go to the University of Cincinnati, which requires that I buy a digital camera.  I also want to start learning how to do video editing.  I was wondering if there's I haven't been able to find any combination visual camera and video camera.  Good combinations where you get high quality of full.  Do they just not exist?  And why hasn't market gotten in on this?  All right. Thank you.  Bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got an answer to that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Fire it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a Samsung just roll out a camera that's exactly what he described, which is a digital.  It actually has two lenses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but the problem is, he wants one that's a good digital camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it's got two lenses, so it's got one pick up for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, actually, the sound I shot a couple of pictures with is not that bad.  It's a five megapixel digital camera, and then it's also a DV camera.  And it's all fits in the palm of your hand.  It was I thought it was reasonable.  It was, I guess, like three hundred four hundred bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's a lot smaller than the last one they did with the rotating lenses that weighed like eight pounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, it's not like that.  These are two fixed lenses.  They're they're they're both zooms.  It's a weird looking thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it's weird looking.  But the reason is because the CCD for a digital camera has to be much higher resolution than the CCD for a movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you can get around if somebody would use the foveon CMOS.  What's the deal with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Why is nobody going with foveon?  Nobody. Polaroid said they were going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've been you want to hear what the insiders at the company would tell you?  Yeah, they would say that they've been squeezed by the big CCD manufacturers because it's one of those deals like Intel.  You know, you want to buy AMD chips.  Well, maybe you're not going to be able to get any of our chips at all.  Yeah. So there's nobody that unless they went one hundred percent foveon, which nobody's going to do, it becomes like it's all political.  The relationship companies are just they're all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, there was there. Who was that camera company that was doing all the foveon cameras?  The SLR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So again, they were the only one who ever released.  They still do.  This is Carver Mead's invention.  Carver Mead's a brilliant physicist and it's a it's a brilliant idea.  And it would be a real shame if these market forces are keeping something that's a major innovation off the market.  It's kind of sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Was what course is he taking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They require him to have a digital camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was interesting.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, I one other product that's going to be kind of interesting, this new JVC Vario.  They've been doing a number of solid state.  Right. I saw that at CES last year.  And they have a new one that's a very high resolution that should be out pretty soon, I think.  Is that the CineCam one?  I don't remember the model number, but it was kind of neat.  There's a tiny two.  I think I saw it at PMA in Florida.  Yeah, it's it's a solid state DV cam.  I think it has a three or four megapixel still camera, the same lens, very small, much smaller than a DV cam.  And they're going to be using MPEG 4, high quality MPEG 4.  So you get some decent video out of these.  You know, up to now, the solid state camcorders are terrible.  But this is supposed to be.  It looked pretty good.  I was impressed.  This is an interesting email we got.  Well, actually, there's a recording here.  Let me see if I can extract it.  It says, Hi, guys, I'm a wannabe techie.  And I just listened to your podcast 16.  You guys were talking about podcasts.  You should be thankful you're on iTunes Music Star.  I would have never found you otherwise.  But I enjoy the show.  She's an American who lives in Australia.  She's at the Division of Neuroscience at John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National University in Acton.  And she listens to our Tweetcasts.  And here is here is her thing.  Play your question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  This is Amy from Australia.  I would like to know how do websites like audible.com, which sell digital books, security protect their files?  And how do they know when you're if you log on to someone else's website, log on as a different user and try and download their books?  How do they know you're trying to download that book to a different computer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, that's DRM for you, baby.  It ties itself to your your your your user ID.  So you have to authorize it in order to listen.  I cracked all my audible stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  How do you crack audible.  There's an application that does it.  It's really easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, do we want to traffic in explaining how to bypass copy protection so we can all be sued under the DMCA.  Hell yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  How do you besides Leo can edit it later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I use J.  I'm not asking him to strip the stuff out of it.  Yes, it will use a different kind of right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  It's a separate application.  I'll get the link for it and give it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't put it on the website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Patrick's worried we're going to get sued because we're Patrick's a big wiener.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's because I have your money for lawyers, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We don't need we don't need a sneaking lawyers.  We just need to run very fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I've run for other things, Roger.  I'm old and I'm tired and I don't like running.  I'll get you a wheelchair.  I haven't hit my second win like John has.  John's probably been young and feisty since he was two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, we.  We've just all been crushing since.  Andrew Lydon sent me a kind of a cool thing.  This is podcast directory dot com slash map in our RSS feed.  I don't know why, but one of the things Feedburner lets you do is put your longitude and latitude near RSS feed.  So I do.  And this podcast directory dot com has locations of all the podcasts on a Google map.  And if you it's kind of a big cluster in the San Francisco Bay Area, but but we're in there.  We're in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  So what's the what's the highest density of podcasts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know. This is I'm looking at California and LA and San Francisco certainly have quite a few podcast directory dot com slash map.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's going to be that the ebooks that I download from e-reader dot com that I put into my Palm Pilot.  They're unlocked by providing them with the credit card number that you use.  Oh, interesting.  And so, you know, that's something you don't want to divulge to anybody else.  And, you know, so it's sort of a nice way of saying, look, don't share these.  But, you know, you want to have access to them on any machine.  When you buy an e-book, you're able to read them on a palm, on a pocket PC, on a Windows machine, on a Mac or anything else that will run the e-reader.  So you do get multi platform freedom and you want to keep your credit card number to yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think that's a good way of solving it right now with Audible.  You have to authorize machines and they don't say what the limit is, but there's a certain number of machines you can authorize and then it'll stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It just feels wrong to do that.  It's like, you know, you you purchase the thing, you want to be able to use it and listen to it where you want.  Yeah, that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you read e-books on a notebook screen or do you have a handheld device?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He's all right. He's PDA. He does it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm PDA. I didn't download the Windows reader just to sort of see what it looks like.  And it's like, pretty cool.  It's OK. I use it on my tablet PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  As much as we make fun of the tablet PC, that's what I'm really waiting for.  It's good for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The battery life on the tablet PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Some kind of wireless display or the built in media card reader with a great looking screen that can match somewhat, at least as close as possible to print quality like on paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I can't I can't sit for long periods of time and read from a computer from an LCD.  When is e-paper coming out? When are we going to see that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The one decent e-paper based digital book is the Sony Libre.  And the only way you're getting it is importing it because they seem to have no interest in selling it over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  A paperback book is pretty much a near perfect delivery mechanism.  It's cheap, it's effective, it's portable.  The batteries won't run out.  I mean, you don't really.  The only drawback is you have to have one per book.  Yeah, I've seen the Libre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I would love to have just one device and you could have 50 books with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think it's going to happen.  50 books at once.  Well, I have on my iPod because I listen to books on tab, tons of audible books.  I have probably 20 or 30 audible books on there.  And I'll just jump around. I'm listening to 1776 right now.  That's great. Good book, David McCullough.  Have any of you guys ever read any Stephen Baxter science fiction?  No, no.  I have.  I love it.  Yeah. Why?  This guy is a former aerospace engineer. He's a brilliant guy.  Very, very good writer.  And he writes I think some of the most intelligent, interesting science fiction out there.  Really good hard sci-fi.  Hard sci-fi, yeah.  Evolution is maybe not the most plot compelling book, but a fascinating idea.  The book starts with the comet that hits the planet and kills the dinosaurs and ends 10 million years in the future when the last hominids finally die out.  It's an amazing, amazing book.  And I'm reading Coalescent now, which I think is really beautifully written.  He's a philosopher as well as I think is a very good scientist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And when we're off topic, has anybody rented?  We just went through the whole DVD collection of the short-lived series Firefly.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Don't get Patrick started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That thing is fantastically...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's amazing.  But do you know the story on what Fox did to it?  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Before you give me that story, let me just say this thing ran what, two years ago?  I never heard of this show.  I mean what kind of marketing idiots are working at Fox?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, tell them what happened, Patrick.  Okay, so what happens, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do you know the producer, the brains behind Firefly?  Do you know what his background is?  He did Buffy.  Yeah, and so, you know, they saw the initial...  So what you saw is the premiere or the opening, the pilot episode, that two-hour opening episode.  They showed that 11th.  If you look at the back of the DVDs, they show the actual order they were broadcasting.  And the last two or three were never even broadcast.  The morons at Fox didn't understand it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They aired it out of order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it was playing too well on Friday nights with adult women.  And that wasn't the audience they wanted.  So they, but they, he made them that second episode where they're robbing, the train robbing episode.  That was the premiere episode.  So everybody saw that and they're like, what's going on?  Why is this, what is this space opera western thing?  Well, I have to say this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If anything deserved to kill the show, it was the soundtrack, that theme, like, which was only topped as bad by that Star Trek Enterprise.  I was just going to say, that was the second worst theme song.  The worst.  No, this was the Firefly one, I think is actually worse than that.  But this thing should have gone, it should have been a syndicated show.  What did they run it through Fox for?  Fox was total idiots.  I mean, I was stunned by this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So this sounds like a must-rent DVD.  It's, it's, it's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because the character development is phenomenal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And the, and the movie, of course, is on its way.  When is that coming out?  Serenity.  This fall.  This fall. So that's exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Leo, do you remember that last time I came out and visited you in Toronto, I had the entire DVD set on two 1 gig SD chips and was watching the episodes on the plane of effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This man is mad.  What do you, what do you use for compression?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The, the, the, the compressor does a really, really good job.  Divx.  And there's that Divx player for the Pocket PC and that, you know, allows nine frames per second playback and perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Speaking of Toronto, I want to update people.  We are going to do a Toronto meetup.  Kevin will be there.  I will be there.  Amber and Andy will be there.  Michael will be there.  We're going to be doing it at 730 at No Regrets.  That's this Thursday, August 11th.  And please go to meetup.com and RSVP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  We have how many do our speed pizza for over a hundred and 160 some now we can get plenty more.  Yeah.  I actually talked to Alex Albrecht and coming to see how it's coming.  Yeah, he's coming.  You can't know we're going to shoot an episode of Dignation up there as well.  Patrick, are you going to come Patrick has to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Come on.  I just started a new job.  Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right.  We'll see.  Well, there's another chance everybody can meet us and I might as well make the announcement.  And this show will probably be the end of the reason we're going to do this.  The audio on this is so awful.  We're going to be doing it live in Noonan's restaurant and NONAN's restaurant.  It's on Luxor Landing in Luxor, California, starting September 18th at 4 p.m.  We'll broadcast.  Well, we'll podcast, record it live.  Actually, we may have a deal to do it broadcast as well.  And we're inviting people to come to join us.  One of the reasons we chose Noonan's is it's right off the San Francisco-Larksburg ferry.  So if you're staying in the city, you can take the ferry over, a beautiful ride, and be there at 4 o'clock Sunday afternoon.  It's also equidistant from you guys in San Francisco, me up here in Petaluma, John and Robert in the East Bay.  So please, everybody, come on out.  We'd love to see you starting September 18th and I think every Sunday thereafter, unless we decide this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I'll bring the camera too so we can shoot it.  Shoot the video online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I would love to get online video of this.  So this is exciting.  Ooh, I can bring a camera.  This is the next stage of development for Twitter.  I'm thinking of it, John, I think you'll recognize this.  I'm thinking of it as the Algonquin roundtable of the geek generation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's one way of looking at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right.  Shut down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Hi, Leo. Hi, Leo. Hi, Leo.  This is Mark. This is Mark. This is Mark.  I really enjoyed episode 15. I really enjoyed episode 15.  Except for...  I know where he's going with it.  The Echo was very entertaining. The Echo was very entertaining.  All right, I get the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No Echo in this edition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There were some significant audio problems with that episode.  Between the whining, somebody was breathing into their microphone most of the time.  You know, the last episode, 16, was good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it was because it was just a handful.  It was better.  Small number of people.  And Skype works much better with a small number of people.  And I can control it better.  But that's one of the reasons we're doing this live.  Is because you'll all be in the same room.  And we can control it. I think it'll sound much, much, much...  On a set of regular speakers, it wasn't so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But when I had my headphones on and listening on a small player, everything just seemed...  I ended up focusing on the noises in the background or electronics distortions.  Wait until you hear this one, Robert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But I am going to run this through Soundsoap and see if it sounds any better.  There are a couple of plugins out there that are...  Who's typing? Is that Dvorak? I think it's Dvorak.  Wasn't that him? See?  That's the problem is we can't control you monkeys.  So if you're all in the same room, I can at least say something.  Stop it!  I'm blogging this.  I'm blogging this.  Get him the t-shirt.  Blogging!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My name is Chris from Sherman Oaks.  My niece wants to buy an iBook.  And the thought scares me because I'm a computer repairman and I only know Windows.  Now everyone raves about Macs, but what are the downsides?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What are the downsides? We never talk about that.  About a Mac?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, that's not true. What about the entire generation of iBooks that disintegrated and it took months before Apple owned...  I had one of them.  And I still have one of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Weird firmware updates for their different...  Are there any five year old iBooks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No. There aren't.  And I think now they're okay.  Yeah? Don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. I think they're great. And the prices just came down. They just upped the processors.  Okay. What do you run into?  In a few years, Apple will draw a line and your hardware will no longer be supported with the new operating system.  Maybe.  No. That pretty much happens every few years. I don't see why they're going to back away from that now.  If there is some incredible flaw in the hardware, it may take them an incredibly long time to own up to it, but eventually we hope they will fix it.  Like they did with the problem with the chips on the motherboards for the screens on the iBooks.  Right.  Other than that, you have to do something really creative, like physically break the computer.  Because it's almost impossible to do anything in software that will mess the computer up.  Yeah. I think it's very robust.  At least compared to a Windows box.  Yeah. It's very robust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Anybody else want any other negatives? Any other reasons?  I mean, we could go on and on about, you know, spyware and viruses and so forth, not being part of the problem.  If you're gaming on a mobile-type basis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There are no games for the Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Hey, I play World of Warcraft on my Mac. It works great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. There's games out there. You're not going to play them on an iBook.  I play World of Warcraft on my PowerBook.  But that's it. That's not a...  But the other thing, you're not going to play Half-Life.  Yeah. High-end 3D games on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. I want that Age of Empires 3 when it comes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But I mean, that's true, by the way, of PC notebooks. There's very few that'll play 3D games well.  Agreed.  I mean, that's just a notebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hi, everyone. This is Rick from Redmond, Washington.  Oh, we know where Rick works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I was just wondering what your favorite wireless router brand was.  And I'm shopping for a new one, and I was looking at the D-Link DI624.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Does everybody who lives in Redmond have to work at Microsoft, or are there people who actually don't?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, somebody's got to sell them coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So he's either the coffee guy or he works at Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I used to like Linksys, but I don't anymore.  You know, I'm hearing bad things about that.  No, get the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Get an Ergo-based pre-end wireless router. You'll get more distance and more speed, and they're backward compatible. They work great.  Get the Belkin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree. I would agree on that.  Well, Linksys makes an Ergo-based pre-end as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is the build quality good on that Belkin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Apparently, everybody I know loves it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm running it now. It's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, we had one on Call for Help. We were very happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they have a very nice kind of a way, kind of a setup that works very...  For people who don't like to know how to set these things up and don't want to go into the router, I think the setup is one of the best I've ever seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know what they've got now in the Linksys? They've got a button on the front that you push that says, secure this router.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Are you serious?  Yeah, I don't know what it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It goes off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Which model is that? They've got so many wireless routers now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I just saw that at Camp USA the other day. You press the button... or no, Best Buy. You press the button. It's got this security button. You press it and you're secure.  What could that be? It must turn on WEP, but then it... oh, I know why. You have to buy the matching Linksys device for your other... and they all have the button.  So it's turning on WEP with some password that everybody knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  That's because for the average user these routers are so...  Too complicated.  Too complicated. But I'll tell you what, if you're looking for an advanced router and you want to stay away from the pre-end stuff, I really like Netgear. They have some really cool options. If you're getting port scanned, it'll email you and let you know.  That's so nice.  There's some cool stuff Netgear has built in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Netgear and the others too have done a much better job with the configuration menu John was mentioning. They also immediately check the firmware for you and make it very easy to download and upgrade the devices themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let me ask you a question guys about this pre-end stuff. If I have all B equipment, do I have to upgrade it to get the advantage of the pre-end? I know I won't get the speed, but will I get...  You'll get a little more distance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will get more distance?  Yeah. But you won't get any more speed, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Has anyone tested in real life how fast is pre-end? If I drag and drop a huge ISO file to somebody else that's on a wireless network, how fast are we talking?  100 megabit.  100 megabit?  If you're close, you have to be within a few hundred feet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. If you go out further out, it still gets you pretty damn good speed. It'll give you better speed than anything else.  Oh, it's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Latencies are less and the distance is better. Those are the two big things.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Limo is a huge breakthrough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, how's everybody doing? This is Twit Commander at yahoo.com.  He's back again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Twit Commander.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Kids, one question a month, okay?  Nice thing to identify himself.  Well, yeah, thank you. Yeah, we got to thank you for saying your name up front so we can cut you off.  That's handy. Let's see. I don't think we've heard from Michael.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Hey, guys. Love the podcast. Keep up the good work. Just a quick question for you. I am wondering what kind of recommendations you would have for a mid-price range cell phone. I'm looking for something to replace my dying Sony RXMT 610.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What's a good cell phone? Let's just go around and see what people use. What are you using now, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Right now I have the Samsung from Verizon with the built-in 1.2 megapixel camera. It's the SCH-A890.  That's supposed to be really nice.  It's nice. The camera's amazing. The video's not too bad either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I was all excited about the new LG 8100 because it's got the little MP3 playing buttons on it. It's got a 1.3 megapixel camera and everything.  I called Verizon and they said, oh, we haven't enabled the music playing yet. So you get this phone with the buttons on it but it doesn't do nothing.  There's got to be a hack for that, though.  Well, I think they're trying to figure out what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Firmware hacks can be really... Firmware hacks on cell phones either work really well or they do a horrible thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  What's that application like PIM something you guys know I'm talking about for hacking the cell phones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it's only for certain models of cell phones.  What does it do? Unlock it?  It's supposed to unlock it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yeah, it allows you to hook up the data cable to your cell phone and it works with just a ton of different cell phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It does everything from allow you to write your email. It's supposed to work with the VX6100, the LG phone I have, but it wouldn't recognize the phone.  That's strange.  So, you know, it's on my other computer. I can't think of the name of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What do you use, John? Do you use a cell phone? Oh, no, that's right. You're not a cell phone user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got a bunch of them, but they're all moaners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just buy the I buy the cheapest cell phone that'll do what I need it to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I like my sidekick. Exactly. I like my sidekick too. I'd still recommend that. I think the keyboard on that's nice. It's got email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is the Razor from Motorola. That's a very nice phone.  It's pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know. I got some friends that just bought two of those and they're real divided on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think they break really fast. How about you, Roger? What are you using?

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  I use this Motorola piece of junk until my contract is up and then I'm going to find something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Roger recommends the Motorola POJ32.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Well, the biggest plus is it's a GSM phone. So if I can pop out the SIM and get a decent phone.  But I'm one of those. I'm like Patrick. It does what I need it to do. And I don't want to spend more money than I have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hey, we got to answer. Oh, I didn't ask Steve Gibson. What do you what do you use, Steve?  I use the Motorola Razor.  He's a Razor man. Yep, I like it. Happy with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not a major phone user. It's sitting by the door with the battery out of it because it tends to drain the battery slowly.  And so I stick it in if I come to Toronto. Otherwise, I just really not like it.  It's his phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got some advice for you, Steve. Put it in the freezer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We got to answer this next one. This guy, Mike, is a police officer in Brooklyn. He says if you don't answer, I'm going to put a warrant out for your arrests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hi, my name is Mike from Brooklyn, New York. I'm a police officer for the NYPD.  My question is, I'm looking for a program that'll let me do partial word searches within Word documents.  We have a large database of information, but everything is hyperlinked. And if I move a file, we end up losing the hyperlink.  I tried MSN. I tried Google. I tried Yahoo. I tried a program called Dismayda. They only allow me to do full word searches.  And I have a hard time finding anything that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If I use X1, which is the Yahoo desktop search, and you type the first three letters, it finds the first three letters.  It doesn't require that it be a full word. So I don't know. Maybe the Yahoo version does do full words only.  But Mike, I think you could use X1.  How does Spotlight work? Does it work in Word documents?  No. Well, let's see.  No. Yeah, see, it's not...  Well, of course, he's on a PC.  Is he talking about reading documents online?  He's talking about searching his computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  He wants to search in the document without actually having to open it up.  Inside the text. That's what X1 is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If it was within a webpage, Firefox built in, there's search.  Oh, that's really cool. Yeah.  It's key by key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's how X1 works. And it's super fast. I love X1. X1.com. I think that's really a great product. I think that'll do what you want.  You could certainly try it before you buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does this slow down your machine you're talking about on a PC, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, on a PC. You know, I did take it off my tablet PC because I thought that it might be slowing it down.  Yeah, it slows it down when it's indexing as any search program will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was using Blinks for a while, but it seems to have all kinds of problems.  This is the second time I've tried using it.  It essentially stopped indexing after it got to so many files. I got like 200,000 files.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think X1's been doing this longer than anybody, and they really seem to know their stuff.  They've gone, by the way, they now have an enterprise search. I think that's going to be a huge category.  This search is across all the computers on your network.  I think the whole point of this is people got so much stuff and they cannot organize it anymore.  It's like moving from Yahoo to Google.  Which one was that?  X1.com. They have an enterprise now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

I don't have to warn you because you're sober.  But all the rest of the guys, this Noonan's, they have a full bar with all sorts of exotic spirits.  Of course, it's a brewpub, and they're very famous for their old Dipsy barley wine.  Barley wine?  I will buy you all a round of old Dipsy barley wine.  Have you ever had barley wine?  No, but I understand this will knock you on your key.  People react strongly to barley. Barley wine is like cider.

Transcript:  Does anybody here use Plaxo? Does everybody here trust Plaxo?  I hate Plaxo. I can't get an email.  A lot of people use it.  Yeah, and it's like...  I ignore those, don't you?  Yeah, because I don't want my information. It just seems like a great way to centralize all of my information and give it to people I don't want.  I use LinkedIn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Transcript:  Hi, I'm Jefferson calling in from Curaçao, Netherlands, Antilles.  And I'm planning on buying a new flat screen.  I was looking at the new Dell Ultrasharp 20-inch and I was wondering if I can use it as a TV and for my computer work.  And also what TV tuner cards you guys recommend and which software to record my TV on my computer.  I hope you guys can help me out. Keep on the good work and I love the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now this guy is calling from Curaçao, the Netherlands, Antilles.  Which is in the Caribbean.  And his handle is ghetto cash.  I don't know if there's anything to be said about that.  What should we... You can use it as a TV and a monitor if it has the appropriate inputs. It's all about the inputs.  Now, you may be unhappy with it as a computer monitor if it doesn't have the resolution. It may be only 1024x768.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Did he say the Dell? Is that what he...  He said the Dell, yeah.  Yeah, I love Dell's LCD. They're so sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay, we got one of the rules, by the way, of the Twitcast is we have to keep it under 70 minutes so people can burn it to a CD.  That's, as far as I know, the only hard limit to the length of the show.  Because many people do in fact burn it to a CD and listen to it in their car.  It's 73 minutes right now.  I know. That's why I'm saying this, Robert. I'm going to have to stop this wonderful, wonderful time.  I need to get running too.  Yeah, it's been great talking to you, Robert. Thank you very much.  Thank you.  John C. Dvorak, always a pleasure.  It's always an audio adventure with John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, well, we'll get you some Cabernet, both of you. I hope we can't get you up from time to time.  Cabernet out.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  Roger Chang, always the all the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sorry about that. I should have, you know, it kind of came together at the last minute.  Well, maybe you can change your flight. It'd be fun to have you. Anyway, I know a lot of people would like to see you.  Patrick is not going to fly up. He has a job.

Transcript:  He has a day job now. It cuts into things.  You're tied down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Thanks to you all. I apologize in advance for the audio quality.  One of the reasons we're going to do this live is because we don't have these issues.  I hope it's been worth listening through the mud on behalf of all the Twits.  Go to the website, thisweekintech.com. Contribute. That's one of the ways we keep this commercial free.  Thanks to our good friends at AOL Radio for providing the bandwidth for this.  They've really stepped up to the plate and made this possible. Otherwise, I don't know how you'd be getting this show.  What is it? Is it AOLMusic.com? I think that's the URL.  Anybody else have to thought? We'll see you at noon. Keep that date open.  September 18th and from then on, at 4 o'clock on Sundays, we'll be doing it live.
