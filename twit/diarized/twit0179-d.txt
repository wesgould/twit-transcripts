Transcript:  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See you there.  Now he hears me.  Now he hears you.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's johncdivorak.org slash blog.  Or actually, we should say channeldivorak.com.  We're going to start using that as your CG.  I saw somebody wanted to know if Eric would give out the code for that.  They really liked how he did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Eric's coming up with another project that's kind of interesting  that will kind of self-create the code.  Oh, neat.  So just hang in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cool.  Eric's a good web programmer.  Also with us, we've missed him.  He hasn't been with us since last year.  Mr. Will Harris.  Hello.  Channelflip.com, our resident Brit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's lovely to be back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I have a feeling since next Sunday, we'll  be recording during the Super Bowl that you might be back next Sunday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What's the Super what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly.  We're going to be looking for people from Australia, any country  where they don't play football.  American football.  American.  American football.  Any country where they don't know who the Steelers are.  You have to say it like American.  American football.  American football.  Also with us, the disciplined investor himself, Mr. Andrew Horowitz  from disciplineinvestor.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hello, nice and warm here in South Florida.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Shut up.  It's nice here.  How is it in Britain?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's pretty fricking miserable.  I will be 100% honest with you.  It is not pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Californians are so mean that way.  Floridians probably too.  We always say, how's the weather?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're sitting here in nice, pretty weather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How's it there where you are?  Is it OK?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You OK?  I like asking my Wisconsin friends that question.  How's it going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How's that weather thing doing for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We're scheduled for snow next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, Monty Python's pretty happy.  Did you see this?  That's exciting.  They have a Monty Python channel on YouTube  with some of their best stuff.  It's a really nice channel.  They've done a nice job with it.  I grew up in upstate New York in a small town.  And I was 16 years old.  Oh, David Hyde Pierce talking about Monty Python there.  Automatically started up.  I didn't really want him to, but he had to.  So it's a beautiful channel.  They've done a really, really nice job.  You can go there.  And this is the thing.  You can get all their best bits, right?  So guess what?  As a result, you'd think maybe to cut into their DVD.  No, their DVD sales are up on Amazon.  They're now number two on the Amazon DVD list.  They have like 23,000% increase in sales.  I'm always looking for stories like this,  because I'm always up with the opinion.  I think the record industry ought  to sit up and take notice.  You give stuff away, it comes back.  It's the old, you know, cast your bread.  Well, I think it really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If it's quality, it sells, right?  You can have a restaurant in some hole in the wall place  that you can't even get to, but the food's good.  People are gonna go to it.  But if it's crap.  This is the opposite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is like saying, put it out.  You know what I liken this to?  In New York City, all of the little shops, corner shops,  have fruit out in front where you could just walk by  and steal it, easy, right?  First of all, there's the owner's system.  They know karate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They know karate there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you could, I mean, you could light finger  Louis take it with you.  But the point is it sells the fruit.  They sell more fruit than they lose, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Same thing here.  People could say, oh, you know, we're gonna lose all of our,  nobody's gonna buy a DVD when you get on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I think what's happening is it's a different audience.  You know, I have to imagine that the demographic  of people on YouTube is a heck of a lot younger  than the sort of people who would be already familiar  with Monty Python.  So my hunch is that it's introducing like an entire  new generation of kids to Monty Python,  which of course is classic, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  230 times more sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think there's some amount of honesty  that's going on too in the fact that, you know,  it's the guys who are in Monty Python  who are putting their shows out there.  And there's a quote that's on YouTube that says,  we're letting you see everything for free, so there,  but we want, you know, we want you to buy stuff in return.  Support us.  We'll give this to you for free,  but buy our DVDs and buy this stuff.  And, you know, and what do they say here?  And soften our pain and disgust at being ripped off  all these years.  You know, which is just fabulous.  It's just honest and people,  I think people really appreciate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  John, can only somebody like Monty Python do this  or is this a pattern?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think, Leo, I think you could do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm doing it.  We give everything away for free,  but we make decent money in advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm just saying, no, you can do it.  You can sell discs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know who just did that?  I should say that Susie Orman,  he just gave away her recent book  on the Oprah.com network or something about,  I don't know, upwards of two million books were  downloaded for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See, that's crazy.  Think if two million people bought that book,  she's, that's millions of dollars she gave up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is in a way, I guess,  but at the same time, it's great advertising.  It's this wonderful thing.  Oh, what a great person she is,  and she's just trying to help everybody.  And I think that it gives the people,  it's only a short period of time,  and don't forget, they're also buying emails, right?  In a way, when you do that,  they require you getting information,  and they're required to fill out some form,  and then they can market to you.  So what better way to find a very targeted audience  that wants the material than to have somebody now in it  and give them some kind of a present on the back end?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and then also supports the public image  of that person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think we have to have new models  for how you make a living, I guess.  Susie is a great example of somebody  who pulls every string and lever.  I thought she lives at CNN.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.  Ha ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'd have lived there.  But that's how you build that, isn't it?  That following, and then you make it up in volume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, so it's from how you do it.  Apparently, her theory is that you use as much man tan  as you can get a hold of you by the cargo,  and then you get all the tooth bleach in the world,  and you just gargle it nightly.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Looking good.  Not a big fan of the old Susie, huh?  In other British news, this one from our friend,  Mr. Will Harris, Jonathan Ross introduces Twitter,  along with Stephen Fry to over 4 million Brits on TV.  Would you explain what happened here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, this is quite cool.  So I don't know if you guys have ever heard  of someone called Jonathan Ross.  No.  Who over here is, well, over here,  he is probably the most famous TV personality  as a TV presenter.  So he's like your Jay Leno type, maybe?  Yeah, that's exactly who he's like.  And so he recently got banned from putting a show on TV  for three months after sort of hurtling obscenities  on a particular show.  So his big comeback watched by 4 million people.  Well, he is, which is on Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's another way to get a lot of fans.  You don't have to give it away on YouTube.  Just get banned for TV for three months  for swearing your head off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And he has just started doing Twitter.  And so he is at Wossi, which is W-O-S-S-Y.  And he had Stephen Fry on.  Stephen Fry, of course, another prolific Twitterer.  And the two of them spent about five minutes discussing  sort of how amazing Twitter is  and how it's impacted on their lives,  introducing it to probably the most mainstream audience  in Britain going.  And Wossi went from zero to 14,000 followers

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  in just a few days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, before we get into the news,  which I hope we do shortly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wanted to mention something I think is kind of peculiar.  Everybody, my Twitter numbers have frozen  for about five days, which is weird  because they have never frozen.  They always go up or down.  I've got so many people,  people who are going to be bailing out  or they're going to be joining or whatever.  I've got 38.  This is a 38,049.  It has not changed by one.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This has been happening lately on Twitter a lot.  It happens, it's happening to me right now.  It happened to CNN Newsbreak.  Just welcome to the top echelon, John.  It means that you're big now.  And now something has to do with the Twitter database  gets screwed up.  Then you'll jump real quickly.  And that's what happened to CNN Newsbreak.  They were flat for a week.  And I thought, finally, I'm beating them  because I actually went up ahead of them.  And then they all of a sudden,  they got 12,000 people like in a day.  So it'll happen to you too, John.  It's happening to me right now.  If you look at my Twitter counter, it's flat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, you talk about this advertising  and the situation that you're mentioning, Will,  and where you have a real,  somebody doing something outlandish.  Do you see these Miller commercials  These one second commercials?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now this is interesting.  The Super Bowl commercial is 30 seconds for $3 million.  3 million, right.  Right.  And nobody's buying them.  And nobody's making the big expensive commercials.  So are you saying they sold one second blipverts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is fantastic.  I mean, this is great.  So Miller goes ahead, I believe it was Miller Beer,  and they go ahead and they're going to do  a one second commercial.  And they developed an entire marketing plan  and a whole advertising campaign  around the one second commercial.  Like, you know, at first when you think about it,  you're thinking, what can you do for one second?  I mean, what are you going to say?  No, you know, Miller, oh, no, you know,  they got this whole thing.  Miller, all you can do is say, Miller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's one second, it's not two seconds, it's one second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One second, they're going to send.  They're going to be first.  Drink Miller.  Drink Miller.  Exactly.  But it's not a great idea.  I mean, think about it.  It's getting people talking about how crazy it is,  how ridiculous it is for the pricing of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you remember Max Headroom, the Blipvert?  That was the whole thing on Max Headroom,  was these Blipverts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they're not the first.  There was another group last year  that they had a normal commercial,  and then at the very end, there was their one second commercial.  And I can't remember.  Oh, I remember that.  It was a wraparound.  Yeah, and it just went really fast.  And you're like, wait, there was a whole commercial there.  And I remember stopping and trying to use my TiVo  to slow motion frame by frame  to actually see what was happening during that one second.  So I was like, whoa, what is that?  What's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The radio station, a company I worked for,  a Premier, which is on my clear channel,  tried this last year.  They called them ad blasts or something.  They sold five second ads, maybe less.  And it was very disconcerting.  You listen to the radio, all of a sudden you hear,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  doh!

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's, but see, that's all you need, isn't it?  And then they say like, doh!  7 p.m. on Fox.  And that's all you need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But what could you do with Miller?  Imagine a few of those in a row.  I mean, that would be enough to,  I guess, make you drink a Miller.  Don't eat that damn, drink Miller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't believe it, right?  It would be not so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not so good.  Oh no, I totally want a beer now.  It is absurd, the pricing of things.  You want a beer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She does, she wants a beer.  I totally want a beer now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We only have wine and sake.  I don't know why we're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Another reason to speed watch the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  John, you said you're gonna, what is speed watching?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You record it on a DVR, you get out about,  the games usually take about three and a half hours or so.  You get out about, you record the first two  and a half hours or so.  And then you start watching it and you just.  So you get out ahead.  You get to get way out, cause you wanna catch up  so at the end you actually get to see the game in real time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You wanna be live, cause yeah, you don't want, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so then you pop through the,  unless there's a penalty or unless they're playing  no huddle offense, generally speaking,  once the guy hits the ground with the ball  and it plays over, you hit the 30 second button  and it takes about 30 seconds for him to hike the next ball.  So you just blow through these,  through the plays, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.  And then when they take a break or go to commercial,  you shoot through those, which takes up most of the time  at the beginning of the game.  There's about one minute of commercial  for one minute of action.  It's just a terrible game.  And so then you plow through those  and then you get to halftime, you just plow through that  cause that always sucks.  And then you get back to the game and you go bang, bang, bang  and you catch up.  And then you're usually with about five or six minutes left  and you can watch the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, do you ever, with the speed watching,  as you're speed watching through the game,  do you ever stop and slow down to watch the commercials?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I used to be a big fan of those commercials  like back during the dot com era  and we knew there's gonna be a lot of creative commercials.  But now they're all previewed  and they show up on regular programming.  No, the commercials aren't that good anymore.  They're not that interesting.  So I don't bother watching any of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Andrew, do we know who's gonna buy commercials this year?  Have they announced that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, there's been some of the majors  and some of the beer companies.  I mean, I don't think we're gonna see  any car companies being buying this year.  No.  Anything I don't think.  Remember they did those truck ads?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They had the last time they had the user generated content  for the ads for the truck.  They won't be, I guess they won't have those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're probably not gonna have that.  They're probably not gonna have many finance companies  doing anything on there.  I don't think maybe the credit card companies  are gonna back off a little bit.  But those are the ones with the major money.  As a matter of fact, there was some interesting statistic  that I saw how when you look at the advertising out there,  the majority of advertising is by the automobile agencies  and the automobile companies.  If they're gonna back off, there's a big problem there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the ad thing for the Super Bowl  reached its peak around 2000  and it's never really recovered fully.  I think it's just overrated.  Ooh, the ads for the Super Bowl, they're gonna be so great.  We should all watch advertising.  It's just nonsense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like it when they do that  because it makes our piddly ad rates seem so good  when it's three million for the Super Bowl.  Three million dollars in ads would get you  five years of twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Every show, every day.  What happens when they take it down?  What happens if somebody negotiates  and takes it down from three million?  I mean, what happens then?  I mean, is there gonna be some major change  in the way advertising now goes on a negotiated basis  on these kind of shows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  So, I mean, it is just a rate card.  I presume it's negotiable.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, rates aren't supposed to be negotiable, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ah, when you don't sell out, what are you gonna do?  What are you gonna do, put PSAs in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I bet you there's a lot.  You know what, I remember last year at Super Bowl,  there's a lot of house ads.  Really?  Way more than there should have been.  Oh, interesting.  And there were some PSAs.  This ad brought to you by the Ad Council.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All the ad space, though,  was bought several months in advance.  It should all be done by now.  It should all be done  and unless companies that bought it went out of business,  their ads that they've been planning on running  should be running.  And it'll be next year, maybe that'll be the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they have a promotion, the GoDaddy people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're gonna do an ad?  Oh, dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have a user-selected ad they're supposed to do,  but I think they got most of their action  from the promotion itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what they did last year, right?  They did all these sexy ads.  They always say, oh, they wouldn't let us run these on TV.  Come watch them on godaddy.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So, listen, guys, I hate to point out  the bleeding obvious,  but was there something that happened this week  that might have a huge impact on technology,  news and policy for the next four years, maybe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not aware of it. No.  Carole Bartz, CEO of Yahoo.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Some black dude.  How come, oh.  We don't say that anymore, Will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nobody will say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We can't say that anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you can start a war between us again, Will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody pointed out that if there was any  blank spaces for advertising,  the US Army gets those spots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.  Well, by the way, have you seen these ads?  I went to a movie, a couple of movies this week,  and there is a preview ad  that's maybe three minutes long or so  that is totally not only sensationalizing,  but making this incredibly romantic styling  for being in one of the Army,  or one of the Navy, or one of the Marines,  and making it look like you really want to join this thing.  And I was disgusted.  Well, it's nothing new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the way they've been for years.  That's disgusting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's how they do it.  They've got a woo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  With my kid, we're watching this horror movie.  I'm like, don't watch that preview.  Whatever you do, don't watch the preview.  I don't care about the naked stuff.  I don't care about the slashings.  Don't watch the preview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My son's 14, and he's already started getting male.  Have you thought about what you're gonna do  when you drop out of high school?  Oh, that's encouraging.  You can't take wood shop for the rest of your life.  And it's a little,  but we have volunteer armed forces.  They need to recruit because it's volunteer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think people should go, if you want,  if you have the smart money out there,  go volunteer to work for Blackwater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, there's where the money is going.  No, I mean, I think it's reasonable,  but I think it is kind of unfair  to downplay the risks and dangers involved.  I think if they play up the honor involved,  I would have no problem with it.  This is an honorable thing to do to serve your country.  But not to say, hey, you get to see the world  and meet lots of chicks, that's kind of irresponsible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they had this slow motion thing going on,  the guy like kind of dodging bullets  and rescuing women and children.  I think that's going down the wrong road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think you do what the Marines did for a long time.  This is an honorable way to serve your country.  And I think that's completely appropriate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But maybe that's not the thing  that's going to sell people on it.  It may not work.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We got tons of them.  Twitter raising 250, I'm sorry,  raising more cash, evaluating themselves at $250 million.  They're going to raise 20 million,  more than the 20 million they've already taken  in the two previous rounds.  Who are they going to get to give them money?  First of all, are they going to get the server out of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How about Ford Motor Company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  They raised, let's see, in June of last year,  their last round, $15 million from Spark Capital  and Bezos Expeditions, Union Square Ventures,  Digital Garage, increased their investments.  Would you, at this point,  would you put another 20 million into Twitter?  For sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Really?  Come on, really?  It's the fastest growing communications platform  practically. But they have no revenue.  But the revenue's coming.  How?  How?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's revenue for everybody else.  I mean, there are lots of brands that are using it  for advertising, for public,  to improve their public image,  to use it to make revenue.  But I haven't seen anything  that's showing that Twitter can make revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You've got celebrities, you've got Britney Spears,  you've got Steve Fry and CNN and Leo Laporte.  But how do you make it for them?  It's really mainstreamized now.  It's huge, and it's going to grow even faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But that doesn't matter.  I saw a rumor that in the next few days,  it does matter, ultimately,  but I saw a rumor that in the next few days  you will see ads on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can believe it.  But what does that do?  How many times do you click on those ads?  Well, this is where Twitter might work  if they're in the stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, if they're in the stream.  I'm not talking about Google AdSense on the side.  That's not going to work.  But what if they start to put them in the streams  and they make them good ads, compelling ads?  That might work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What good ad, compelling ad have you ever seen online?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or maybe if they could create different ad streams  that are specific to people's interests,  and you could-  They know a lot about us.  Yeah, and you could choose to follow a specific ad stream  that would tell you things that you like.  Zappos is smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They've been using Twitter very intelligently.  What if Zappos has a Zappos account and they say,  hey, right now we're going to give away  three free pairs of shoes to the next 20 people,  click here, that's going to work.  Don't you think people are already conditioned to click?  They're already reading those ads.  If it's done with an eye toward the culture of Twitter,  so maybe it is worth $250 million,  but I would submit, Will,  that until they show that they are willing to do that.  See, I think they're afraid to.  I think they're afraid people will leave Twitter  if they start monetizing.  Yeah, because that would get in the way of the conversation.  What are they doing it for is a good question.  What's the point?  They do it in Japan, they monetize in Japan.  They do that exactly what I just talked about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I got to tell you,  we've talked about this and we've gone round and round  with this, I tell you, if anybody would sit down  with a business model that was taught  in any business school, whether or not that's good or bad,  I mean, there is no business model anymore.  It's all about build something, good or bad,  put the word beta on it,  and then hopefully we'll see people come,  and then hopefully you'll sell.  It's the most ridiculous business models  I've ever seen.  You'd be laughed at if you were gonna actually  talk to somebody about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, a lot of people are laughing all the way  to the bank who scored on this deal.  You know, it's interesting.  I think they were saying the same thing about YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll never make any money.  And Skype, Skype's the other one.  I think they're making any money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  These guys, it's still all in the come.  Skype is not making any money.  It's beside the point, the guys who started it.  So we got a guy in the chat room  who's got a site, twitterfall.com.  It's very cool.  These are the people who are gonna make money on Twitter.  It's people who are making Twitter, you know,  front ends, he says,  we're gonna put ads in the Twitter fall.  You know, I was watching during the inauguration,  I was watching a really interesting site called Monitor,  where you can have up to three keywords  and geographic restrictions,  and you can watch in real time the feeds come in.  A lot of people are doing very interesting things  with Twitter.  Now, Twitter is responding, by the way,  by cutting back, the API calls it, you can make,  slowing them down.  I think more and more,  what you're gonna see is it's gonna be a fight  between Twitter, which has yet to monetize,  and third party tools, which are monetizing,  and taking all the value, all the air  out of the room for Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, how about if Twitter charges for the API access  and then put some special links?  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There you go.  Hey, I have a crazy idea, crazy.  How about the people that use Twitter get charged  an ever so small fee?  I mean, that's crazy.  I realize it's crazy.  It'll never work, it'll never fall.  No.  You guys talk about this all the time.  I would leave Twitter in a heartbeat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've been dying to, give me a reason to leave Twitter.  Don't forget, Leo hates Twitter.  What's the alternative to Leo?  What's the alternative to hate Twitter?  That's all I ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So next news story,  I wanna get to that Carol Bart story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, we will, but can I ask one question?  They wanna raise money.  This begs the question, is there money to be raised?  Are venture capital, there is money out there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If you have got a relatively late stage company,  if you're a startup or you're an early stage, forget it.  If you're a late stage or an existing thing going, then yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, let's translate that.  With a business plan and with an opportunity soon  to be capitalizing on some type of income stream,  would you agree with that?  I agree with that.  You have to have a business plan.  Right, nobody's just gonna put money,  the money that was there has evaporated,  if anybody hasn't noticed, by the way.  There's been this, or it's been extinguished,  or however you wanna look at it.  So when you look at the money these days,  people are in a much more of a conservation state.  Nobody's just taking a leap anymore  and just throwing it out the window and hoping to come back.  The money's just not there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, we're gonna talk about John's favorite topic,  the new CEO of Yahoo in a moment.  I don't know why he's so excited about this.  Carol Bartz, she's the Autodesk CEO,  she's now running Yahoo.  And you've got to hear what her company-wide first memo  to the company is.  And what she warned people who release things like that,  she would do, before we do that though,  I wanna mention the folks at GoToMyPC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  GoToMyPC, we love them, it's Citrix,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  you ever use GoToMyPC?  It's so cool.  Don't look at me and say no, there's no reason not to.  You go to gotomypc.com slash twit right now,  and you get 30 days free, okay?  This is plenty of time to see what you can do.  Here's how it works.  You go to gotomypc.com slash twit, couple of clicks,  it'll be installed in your system.  Now anywhere you go, your internet cafe,  the airport at home, by the pool,  as long as you can get online.  You go to gotomypc.com, you enter your login name  and your password, you are instantly connected securely,  128-bit encryption to your office PC.  You can surf, you can access any network resource,  you can run any program, you can send and receive email.  It's just like your desktop from your office  is on your screen, you're there.  Now you've probably used remote access before,  I know you're saying hard to configure,  you've got firewall router issues, it's slow.  Not go to MyPC, they've eliminated all that.  It is technically the simplest, easiest,  but most powerful system.  That's why PC World gave them their world-class award  for best remote access software.  I've used it for years, I want you to try it free.  For 30 days, gotomypc.com slash twit.  You'll think of a lot of ways you can use this,  but you won't be able to use it until you try it.  Go to mypc.com slash twit, give them a shot.  I think you're gonna like it.  So Carol Bartz is now the official, her first week.  Obama gets inaugurated, is there a swearing in for CEOs?  Do they have to use a Bible?  Is there, do they raise their right hand  and say, I, Carol Bartz, preserve to protect and defend  the purple and gold?  Is there anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thinking no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love this, so they have a all hands meeting,  their first meeting of Carol Bartz and the staff.  And she says, according to several people  who reported this, according to Kara Swisher in Boomtown,  she would drop kick to effing Mars  employees who leaked to the press.  Which of course is immediately leaked to the press.  I love that.  I will drop kick.  There you go, Carol's a sailor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, she does have a reputation for swearing like a true.  Does she?  Yeah, at Autodesk, she was legendary  for just expletive filled meetings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I could just see her up there.  I will drop kick to effing Mars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Any one of you that leaks, you mothers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow, she's like a drill sergeant.  Yeah, absolutely.  Okay, then she sends the most breezy.  This, do you think this is,  this is also leaked of course immediately.  A memo to the entire staff.  Friday, January 16th, breezy.  My first Friday, it's like a diary entry.  It's Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow, this week has gone fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought I'd give you a quick idea  of how things went for me this week.  First, a big thank you, blah, blah, blah.  I know you, I told you at the all hands  that I was gonna be bringing my lunch.  That was before I saw the cafeteria.  It rocks.  Forget that leftover stuff.  It's very breezy.  She says nice things about Yahoo.  Smart, dedicated staff.  Lot of great energy, can do attitude.  Okay, maybe there's some sucking up  because I'm the boss.  But impressed the heck out of me.  I wasn't too happy to see some inside sources  quoting my all hands comment to the outside press.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm gonna drop kick you mother to the F.  No, stop it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then she says I'm pumped up and proud to be here.  I'm gonna spend my weekend shopping for something purple.  Great excuse for a little retail therapy.  Kate Kirsten, you're a woman.  Yeah.  Do you think that's, it seems to me,  I can't imagine a man, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A man writing an email, a memo like that to everyone.  Yeah, I don't think a man would.  That's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it weird?  Is it unprofessional?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think it's unprofessional necessarily.  I think it's, I think it's, I think it's,  she came in tough and she came in with the  I'm gonna kick your ass mentality  and tried to show her tough side  but now she's coming back with a okay,  but we can work together.  Are we in a post-fandom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Some circles they call that schizophrenia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But also isn't it really harsh?  Like I mean she put a complete freeze  on all salaries for her staff.  She's taken a really huge package for herself  and then to go and say actually I'm going out shopping  this weekend is a bit like in your face  I've got tons of money, you're all stuffed.  That is kind of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She already cusses like someone with a big package.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just, maybe we're in a post-fandom.  Maybe we're in a post-feminist.  Maybe we're in a post.  By the way, you're right,  that's the title of the show, Carol Bartz's Big Package.  We'll be guaranteed to get sued by Yahoo within minutes.  I guess you can't get sued for something like that.  Free press man, power to the people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Free press.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are we in a post-feminist era where a female CEO  doesn't have to take a gender role  or pretend that she's not a woman.  She can say I'm going shopping and it's okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's important that a woman does  because I mean so often the only way  that women have gotten to positions of being a CEO  in control of a corporation is by being hard as nails,  you know, an absolute B word.  And I mean they have to be like that.  And to be able to try and show that that's not all I am,  I'm a rounded person and I can be tough  when it comes time for it, but I'm also a woman  and I'm also, I can be friendly, we can talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey John, John do you think that it would have been  interesting for her to come out with a maybe,  I don't know, a recovery plan for the company?  Or maybe instead of her shopping plans?  Yeah, I'm thinking that whether she's a woman or not  is really not the issue here.  It's the responsibility of CEO,  whether or not she feels like sharing  and feels like you know, blogging her day.  Sharing and caring.  Yeah, exactly.  And you know, I think it's her responsibility.  Just like, to be honest with you,  did you see the stock market drop last week  when Obama was sworn in?  Aside from the fact that he had that little run in  with the swearing in ceremony.  The fact is he didn't say anything.  He didn't tell us what we want to hear.  We need somebody to tell us, hey things are gonna be okay.  Is that why the market went down?  Oh yeah, we hit that market hard as soon as he finished.  Second he finished, we shorted the market right then and there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because he didn't say, he didn't step forward  and say this is what I'm gonna do.  Yeah, it was another flood parade.  But you know what he's gonna do, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, we don't, it keeps on changing.  It's like a moving target.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to say it, you gotta say it,  you gotta repeat it, you gotta say it over and over again.  And Carol Bartz has said nothing.  She just took a big package and now she's going shopping  for something purple which is kind of an insane color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's gonna be really interesting  to see how she actually is able to perform  not coming from an internet background.  I think that's the biggest question.  She has no experience in it and I mean,  Yahoo needs to be able to bring all of its disparate  little arms together somehow and  they should be able to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Autodesk actually sold something, right?  I mean they have an actual product that they have to sell.  Yeah, what is Yahoo's product?  I think that's the, I mean the rationale that I read  was that Autodesk before Carol Bartz came in  was a complete mess of a company  and she was brought in to restructure, bring it together,  get rid of the idiots at the time  who were running it into the ground  and that this is why she's been brought into Yahoo  to restructure, reorganize,  ditch all the people who are dragging it down  and put it into good shape for  either saleable or for somebody else  with an internet background to then come in and CEO it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's tough times all around  and I think no matter who you are,  Barack Obama or Carol Bartz,  no matter what you say in public or in private,  it's still, you can have the best plan in the world.  It's gonna be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should have a positive message.  You gotta bolster the troops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's what we're doing here.  But was there any message here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, there's no message.  There's no message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's trying to, there's nothing that's,  she's gonna look good at her job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, which reminds me, if you haven't noticed,  I mean, I had Carol Bartz on my show  when I was at Tech TV.  I don't know, she looks like she's lost about 15 years.  She doesn't look 60.  No, she looks like she's, she obviously had,  look, not this, don't notice her fat.  Oh, now you're really getting digging a hole.  I would just say it looks as if she's had some work done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, John, I'm gonna go right out there  and say she had pretty bad cancer,  which I think caused her to lose a lot of weight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, she's got, her face is a lot different looking.  Ouch.  I think cancer will do that.  I didn't know she had cancer, so I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm,  I'm remiss. I don't know why

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  what she looks like is even an issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you. No, if you're,  if you're an old lady in the office of the CEO  of a hot internet company and you look like an old woman,  like you're 70, you're not gonna get,  it's not gonna work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does anyone know how old Terri Semel was?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No one knows how old Terri Semel was.  Terri Semel looked like an old lady.  See, that's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what you look like, I mean, that does, I mean,  that's not gonna make a difference  in your ability to organize.  You know, I disagree 100% with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People judge you by your looks, whether you like it or not.  But if you come across professionally, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  then that's what you are. Steve Ballmer,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there's a good looking man.  Look what happened in Microsoft stock  when Steve Ballmer came in.  That's exactly what I was gonna say.  Good looking fella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I'm not gonna say that what you look like  doesn't have anything to do with it  because you're absolutely right.  I mean, there are many scientific studies  that show that, you know, better looking people,  more attractive people do better in life  and blotty, blotty, blotty, blotty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Doesn't the tallest candidate always become president?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, usually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the one with the most hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really? It's hair and height?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Although John Kerry violated that rule.  He was such a loser that he couldn't even beat George Bush  with better hair and taller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And better hair.  And ever since, I think ever since the onset of visual media,  the more attractive candidate has usually done it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Abe Lincoln would never have gotten elected in the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wasn't that a big issue in the Nixon debate?  Where he looked really bad.  Remember that?  He had to change things around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He won because he was a good looking guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry I went in this direction.  I'm apologizing now profusely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why we're all on audio podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We just go, we fall off the track so easily.  It's like any excuse, we're off on the road  and you know, with the local...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We're talking about companies that are on there,  I'm not gonna say Death Watch,  but in serious straights this week, Microsoft.  Oh, not how many layoffs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, now to be fair, 5,000 over 18 months.  Only 1,400 today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but they had quoted 17% previously.  There was some discussion about 17%.  So I'm not sure what's going on.  And my understanding is from some people I know that...  Because 5,000 is only 5.5%.  It's not...  There's more coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right.  They had some pretty bad results.  Disappointing earnings.  They had an income of 4.17 billion.  Sounds okay to me, I'd take it.  But that's down 11%, I guess that's the fear.  The big losers were Windows and Office.  The winners though, interesting,  Xbox 360, 3% increase in sales,  six million consoles in the quarter.  Actually, 3% increase in revenue, I think.  15% increase for the server business.  I guess it's not a huge business.  The real issue though is Vista is weak.  And I've been calling for Microsoft to free Windows 7 now.  And I wanna...  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wanna reiterate.  The other thing that's interesting here  is that we also had the same week,  we had earnings from Google that came out.  And there's an interesting exchange going on right now.  We have Apple that beat, we have Google that beat,  we have Microsoft that's suffering terribly.  And I think it's really interesting  that when you look at this,  eBay is also suffering.  It's kind of like a change happening  as far as I can see. It's the new generation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But Apple, it's funny, Apple really isn't the new generation.  But they've reinvented themselves, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but did you look at,  have you seen the new Hitslink,  or some of the Hitslink numbers in terms of browser uptake?  Since February of 08 through December of 08,  the Google has gone from 77% of the search,  I should say this search now, to 81%  where MSN went from 3.5 to 2.96,  which is a big percentage change that is.  That's a billion dollars.  Yahoo went from 12.5 to 10.  And Microsoft Live went down almost a half, 40%, 2.49 to 1.5.  And some of this has to do with, I think, the Google Chrome,  because obviously you have Google Chrome people  using that now.  And that's gonna take you right to Google,  instead of a few percentage points.  Chrome's just a few percentage points.  Well, who's gonna, who's gonna use it?  No, no, but that's gonna,  just a small amount, just a small amount,  will tip the table a little bit  towards the search on Google is what I'm saying.  But doesn't everybody,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  well, no, that shouldn't say that.  Everybody you know and I know,  as soon as you open Explorer and it says,  what do you want your search engine to be,  immediately switches to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, do you know what?  I think there's an interesting thing,  which is that Google has obviously taken the market share  at the cost of Yahoo and Microsoft.  And so you've gotta think,  well, where is Google coming in more?  I think Chrome is such a small thing at the moment,  it's not gonna be there.  But if we look, it sort of coincides  with the rise of netbooks,  which all come pre-installed with Linux and Firefox.  And so I'd be really interested to see  if you plotted the growth of Firefox in the same timeframe,  if you're gonna end up with the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They go over to Hitchlink,  go look that up Hitchlink,  they have all that data.  We're actually gonna put out all these tables this week,  but all the trends are in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I wanna, I have to back up the show for a second,  to make up for my, what I thought was a faux pas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is that Carol Bartz had cancer and beat it in 1992.  I ran into her in 1997, five years later.  She didn't show any evidence  of having any illness at the time,  and now she looks 15 years younger.  I don't think cancer had anything to do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cancer generally does not make you look better.  And you're right, Kiki, she's probably best just,  you've dug the whole, just sit there for a little while.  Just saying, I'm just saying,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  somebody brought it up in the middle of the conversation,  I think it was Kiki.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kiki has every right to do that.  Now, I might mention,  as long as we're talking about the big C word,  that the SEC is now investigating Steve Jobs  over an apple over this.  Now, I don't wanna pile on, we love Steve,  I don't want Steve to be sick, I wish him well.  And you know, Andrew, we haven't had you on.  Look, you're the disciplined investor,  you're the guy who watches the stock market.  We've talked before about this.  Now that we know that Steve is really seriously ill enough  to take six months off.  Is Apple liable?  Has Apple underplayed what's going on?  Is the SEC right to be investigating this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is something strange going on.  I mean, they're still not being forthright, are they?  I mean, it still seems that they're coming out  with this information that is,  first of all, they weren't forthright before,  why do we think they're being forthright now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can I say the elephant in the room?  And I'm gonna be the one to take the heat on this one.  I think Steve's dying.  Okay.  Isn't that what we're all thinking in the back of our head  is he's not coming back, he's dying.  They want him to have this time in peace and not be bugged.  But I mean, I realize it could not be the case  and I certainly don't wanna jinx it  and I want it to not be true.  But isn't that the elephant in the room?  Isn't that what everybody's thinking but unwilling to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Leo, I think it's only an elephant in the room  if you're not already plugged into most of Silicon Valley.  Everyone that I'm talking to in Silicon Valley says that.  It's like an open secret.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, nobody will say it in a forum like this  because we don't wanna be ghoulish,  we don't wanna be mean, we love Steve, we respect him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Listen, clearly, clearly, no doubt that the guy's amazing  and he's done amazing things, but I think you have to say,  there's no way, the poor guy is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It seems to me that, here's the scenario,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and maybe this is what you're talking about, Andrew,  that everybody's thinking maybe is what's happening  is that Apple knows this, Steve knows this,  we all, out of respect for Steve,  want him to have this time privately with his family,  but what is their fiduciary responsibility  to their stockholders?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me just be unfeeling, uncaring for a moment  and forgive me for this,  but we're talking money here for a second.  We're talking the fact that we're juggling with people's  wallets and not coming out with full disclosure  that is, at one time I said on the show that, you know what,  in a way it's private and the personal discussion  of his health could be private, but you know what,  we're at a point right now that the movement of the stock  is so tied to Steve Jobs' health,  because if you looked at what happened  when they had that discussion and dropped out eight  or nine points and then they came back when they  kinda smoothed it over and didn't make any big deal of it,  as a matter of fact, they were kind of coming out  with something that they didn't,  and in full disclosure, by the way,  last week we shorted the stock, so we're short Apple.  Not that I'd like to be,  I love their products, love their products.  You think it's going down.  But there's something not right about what's going on here,  and I'm not willing to be involved in the long side  of Apple, considering all the different economic  information's going on, and I'm pretty hard pressed  to find out, John, you and I were talking about this,  how in the world did they beat in this kind of economy?  It is kind of unbelievable to begin with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, this is so sad.  I hate to have money, and I know this is what's going on,  Trump, you know, human, just human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not that, no, that's what they're doing, though.  See, that's not what's happening, that's what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You think they're covering it up,  not to protect Steve's privacy.  Well, we don't know that they're covering up anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's a correct statement, that's a correct statement.  I think you have to, although we don't know, John,  you have to kind of like, if past performance  is any indication of future,  then you have to say they've been so, so iffy  about the whole thing.  I mean, you know, Dan Lyons really hit it on the head  when he went on CNBC and just said,  look, guys, you know, why would you ever assume  that these guys are telling you the truth  based on everything they've done for the last nine months?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, the problem that Dan Lyons had on that,  and I think his position wasn't very,  considering he writes for Businessweek, he, you know,  How long, how long?  He doesn't write for the newsweek.  He doesn't write for the mirror.  He doesn't write for the Sun,  he doesn't write for the National Enquirer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's not gonna be in Newsweek much longer either,  I could tell you that right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it Newsweek or Businessweek?  Newsweek.  Okay, well anyway, I'm just saying, you know,  it's fine and dandy to have all these beliefs  that you think one thing or another  when you don't really know,  and then to just put it out there  because it's really kind of, you know,  it really gets a lot of attention to you.  I mean, you draw attention to yourself  if you pull a Dan Lyons, let's say,  and you make all these assertions,  it's not based on fact,  but it's based on just basic gossip, rumor, and innuendo,  and in fact, he doesn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you don't know, you don't know.  It's one thing for us to do it,  but another thing for him to do it.  I mean, Twitter's not Newsweek, it's not the, it's,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well actually, we have a bigger audience than he does,  so we probably shouldn't be dipping into that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, the difference is disgusting.  Well, and I, boy, I wanna just clarify this  because I am not saying I know anything.  I don't.  I'm not wishing this to be true.  I'm wishing quite the opposite,  but I, but nobody, people in the mainstream media  and myself too are very reluctant to bring this topic up  because it could be, what if it is the case?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But isn't the point we brought up?  Well, what is is always the...  The thing is though, that when we're talking about  a publicly traded company now that is producing information,  and if in fact that company is producing information  that is somehow either sugar-coated or not entirely true,  and that information does make a big material difference  in the performance of the company itself long-term,  now, that's a lot of ifs, right?  But if that is the case, then there's something to be said  about the SEC investigation.  I don't want it to be true either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not a formal investigation.  We should make that clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just wondering though, is it their responsibility  if he is really ill, is it their responsibility  to replace him sooner rather than later  in stringing us along?  Well, in effect, have they not?  I mean, they already have, but that hasn't come out as...  Not permanently.  Yeah, it's not permanent,  and it hasn't been an official change.  And also, I mean, is it,  the question hasn't really been answered  as to their actual responsibility.  Who's running Apple? What's their plan?  Yeah, and their responsibility.  I mean, sure, maybe Steve Jobs,  he's tied himself personally to the brand  and the success of the brand and therefore the stock.  So is it, I mean, this is,  I think it's a really new question  and an interesting question  because I don't think there's precedent for this  in a product, in a publicly traded company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not absolutely sure that's true.  I think there may be precedent for it.  I just think we've done the research.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other thing is, you know,  they're coming out with,  you mean when the stock was doing well  and when they came out with new innovation,  new products for just time after time,  it kept on, everybody kept on saying,  well, it's Steve Jobs and he's the one behind it  and Steve Jobs touches everything,  he approves everything.  And, you know, nothing gets past Apple without Steve Jobs.  Now all of a sudden, well, Steve Jobs isn't so important.  We have this guy over here that's taking over.  We have a little bit of things taken care of.  Really don't worry yourself about it.  I mean, they're talking about both sides of their mouth.  And again, the problem just is if there is something here,  it goes to, again, the same transparency  and the same discussion that we had  with the finance company.  I mean, what did you know?  Did you know Thane is buying $1400 garbage cans  and $30,000 credenzas while this all is going on?  I mean, was somebody supposed to disclose that  or were we just supposed to find that out  on our own as shareholders?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, it makes me queasy even to bring it up,  but I think it's something we gotta address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And send your email to Leo.  Yeah.  At.  No, you can't.  At don'tsendmemail.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I deserve it, but I think I also think,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  somebody had to bring it up.  Okay, the next topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He deserves a privacy, but at the same time,  it is an important story.  Let's take a break.  Maybe I shouldn't take a break right now,  now that everybody's all upset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going home.  Let's have a happy time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm gonna cry.  I'm gonna cry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wanna cry.  And this is when the Leoville cheerleaders come in.  It is, yeah, I know, I need them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is, okay, here's an upbeat story.  It was 25 years ago Saturday that the Macintosh emerged.  In fact, there's a great video on YouTube  everybody should watch.  It's hysterical of Steve in the Apple Auditorium  introducing Macintosh and all the Apple employees  on their feet going, yeah, when Apple,  the Mac talks, you need to send that guy in, right?  And it's just, it's 25 years ago.  It's been an amazing 25 years.  And look at it.  I mean, Apple's doing really well.  25 years later, they had the best quarter ever.  It's kind of an interesting, it's been an interesting trip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, I discussed this in a recent column  in MarketWatch about the company is overly dependent  on one person for its, as its taste maker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's difficult.  Speaking of videos, did you see in the New York Times,  Randall Strauss writes about it in the Sunday Times,  the Microsoft ad for that song, the music stuff.  Oh!

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh!  Fill in, fill in.  Okay, Microsoft Research Labs came up with,  what's the name of the program?  Is anybody?  SongSmith.  SongSmith came up with a program that writes music.  You sing into the computer  and it writes accompaniment to you.  Sweet baby Jesus.  Pretty much that's it.  And Microsoft decided this is not a product.  By the way, rightly so.  I'm gonna play a little bit for you  and you'll understand why.  They said, this is not a product  and decided not to sell it.  The research lab pooled its money and made a commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hope is it.  Is that how that happened?  Because we blogged that,  I never could figure out where it came from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not, it's their own.  They did, two of the guys in it are the guys who wrote it.  They hired a company, video production.  They made their own commercial.  And now on YouTube, there are parodies everywhere of it.  People, you can get the software.  I think it's 40 bucks.  My wife came in.  I guess she didn't read the New York Times column  too closely, said, hey, we need to get this.  And I said, no, no.  She said, listen, honey, listen to this and then decide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like my old Casio keyboard.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Microsoft research presents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  First come up with a campaign for glow in the dark towels.  I wouldn't even buy a glow in the dark towel.  But if I don't come up with something today, I'm done.  I'm singing with my laptop,  making up new songs.  What are you doing, Lisa?  I've never heard you sing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, I just want to point out something.  Lisa's on a Macintosh.  They've covered up the Apple,  kind of not completely with a sticker.  This song is, this is not a Macintosh program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm making songs with song Smith Dad,  cause it's the cool new thing.  You're writing music?  When did you learn how to write music?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not exactly music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You sing into a microphone while the drummer plays along.  And then when song Smith makes the music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe she talks like this all the way, all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now song Smith comes up with a music that matches your voice.  This is just how I go through my everyday.  Yeah.  Singing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Also, it's a pity song Smith can't tell you his rhyme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sing with song Smith everyday,  cause it makes a new song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's actually a girl that's flat in more ways than one.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, but the best part is all of the,  so now apparently the best one, according to Randall Strauss,  there's a Sergeant Pepper.  I'm gonna see if I can find this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Song Smith with.  I mean, it's, I mean, just even the words don't rhyme.  And then, you know, at the end of the advert,  the, you know, the guy, the guy wins his pitch  with song Smith.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right. Let me, let me play this for you.  This is Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  as performed by Microsoft song Smith.  It's pretty good so far.  It's got that mellow sound coming to you  from the Highlighter Lodge,  beautiful downtown San Francisco.  The song stylings of Dr. Kirsten Sanford and a band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It was 20 years ago today.  Oh, oh, oh.  I thought you were the only man to play.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They've been going in and out of style.  But the guy needs a band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's worse than the other one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that's not from Microsoft.  That's just people are buying songs with Zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just imagining like, this is the new music mashup.  Oh, I hope not.  You know, like this is gonna be the new DJ dance music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, people are linking in the chat room,  like, you know, Roxanne by the Police  is performed by song Smith and more Beatles.  And so they're playing the audio tracks into song Smith.  Into song Smith.  And then getting back what comes back.  Yeah. I mean, it's hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm gonna go get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you seen this photosynth program?  Now that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think photosynth is awesome.  And what they did with CNN did with the inaugural moment  is very cool.  So explain what happened there, Andrew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, first of all, the photosynth program,  you pretty much can do, you take pictures,  you know, take all sorts of photos and you do it  in like a panoramic mode,  but you don't have to be as careful as you would  if you're doing a real panorama.  That's right.  With a tripod and all that.  You just start clicking away, clicking away.  And then you upload all your pictures  up to this photosynth site.  It's free.  And then it comes up, it does this amazing job  of joining the photos from end to end  and from place to place doing overlap  and coming with almost a three dimensional walkthrough.  So you can imagine doing it in a museum, for example.  You can pretty much do a whole walkthrough  of the museum virtually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they have St. Mark's Square on the photosynth site.  It's amazing. Amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But there's a couple of problems.  I mean, you can't just do it privately, I don't think,  and you can't have it your own.  But anyway, so I mean, that's a,  I don't even know how they do that.  It's an amazing program that does that.  It's stitching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the idea-  You usually get thrown out of museums  and take too many pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think it was inspired of CNN to say,  well, look, we're gonna have a moment  in time where we're gonna have millions  of people taking pictures.  Let's see if we can get them to send it to CNN.  We'll use photosynth to stitch it together.  So they said when Obama raises his right hand  to take the oath of office,  everybody snap a picture and then send it to  momentatcnn.com.  And they've been slowly improving it.  And it's been getting bigger and bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of cool.  It reminds me of that movie with the perspectives.  You know, they give you the movie that they had with,  they put the same scene over four times.  Roshamog?  From different-

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, the one with the guy,  the president gets assassinated,  Porch Whitaker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, the whole time,  I'm thinking, oh my gosh, I hope that,  you know, what's going on here.  I think that thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Could be pretty neat if they could add tags to the,  if you have tag capability also.  So you upload your photo with the tags  and then it- And then stitches it together.  And then you have the completely,  tags environment.  Yeah, it's so neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But once you have the GPS capability in all cameras,  then you really have something.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly.  Hey, we're going to take a break just to cheer you up  a little bit of Roxanne.  This is the police as performed by Microsoft's soundsmith.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.  Hey.  How are you?  Oh, I' extremely fine.  Okay.  At this moment,  feel a little bit of 꺼.  Okay.  All right?  No?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You don't have to say goodbye to the night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got to disagree with you, Leo.  I think this is a fantastic program for parties.  I love it so much.  We talk about laughing in stereo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I didn't know there were steel drums in that song.  That's wonderful.  That's so wonderful.  Hey, we're going to take a little break.  We'll come back with more hits from SongSmith and more hits from the news.  But first, I want to tell you about audible.com.  I've got two great audible offers for you.

A good one to pair with that might be that outliers book that we've been talking about  from Mackle and Gladwell.  That's such a good book.  Did you read that?  Isn't that good, Kiki?  It is such a good book.  I'm reading it right now.  It's just fascinating.  It talks about Bill Joy and how Bill Joy became a brilliant programmer.  And his point is that, yeah, talent and everything, that's great.  But unless you get the breaks, unless you get the chance to take the time to spend  10,000 hours to learn your craft, whatever it is, you ain't going to make it.

I listen to all of Richard Dawkins books on Audible.  I love him.  I'm a Dawkins fan.  Why are you looking at me like that?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm like, wow, great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's good stuff.  He's a little harsh sometimes.  Oh, you're talking about The God Delusion.  Yes.  He's a little bit...  He's a divider in that book.  Yeah.  He is a bit pedantic.  But then again, many scientific types are quite pedantic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can get The Origin of Species by Charles Darwin on Audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is a fantastic book.  I've read it and it just...  You go through it and...  It's not dated.  No.  It's such a wonderful piece of writing and to see...  I mean, it's dated a little bit.  I mean, there's a lot of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You like it better than Voyage of the Beagle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's another good one.  That's where he finds the finches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's where he finds the finches.  But I don't know.  I like On Origin of Species just because it puts out his theory and it's almost Darwin's  birthday, by the way.  Is it?  Listen, this is a...  ...and the grinders flat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  David Kis.  And serviceable for masticating the food.  Since they were not made for the sake of this, but it was the result of accident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, it's such an incredible and inspiring theory that you just go, wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  Richard Dawkins does a bridged version.  If you don't think you can handle the full 1850s writing, the abridged version might  be a little bit more palatable and Dawkins does a great job of reading it.  That's cool.  There's some more books you can listen to.  Thank you, Doctor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Brian Greene, The Elegant Universe.  Oh, I haven't read that.  Yes, it's on Audible.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  G-R-E-N-E?  E.  See, I'm adding...  What I do is...  It's good.  He's...  Ah, I love these.  The Elegant Universe, Super Strings, Hidden Dimensions and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

We return now to your regularly scheduled masticating already in progress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry, what'd you say?  I said...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sergeant Pepper, just to go on the Malcolm Gladwell thing, was written 10 years into  the Beatles since they were founded, right about when they had 10,000 hours of practice.  That's when you've mastered whatever it is you're doing.  Could be music, could be painting, could be hockey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That software is like, I'm thinking clockwork orange, you know, you make sure that your  ears are open, you put something in a room, tie them down and just play that over and  over and over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So speaking of the inauguration, Obama got his Blackberry after all.  He was able to talk the Secret Service into letting him have his Blackberry, but I guess  it's a much...  Does anybody know?  It's not the...  It's another Blackberry tool.  It's not the sectarian.  It's not the sectarian.  It is the sectarian.  It is, yeah.  No, he's got both.  He's got an actual Blackberry, I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they're not going to allow that.  They're not going to allow...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you can run it through a proxy or something.  Somebody sent me an email saying the only reason that everyone got all bent out of shape  about his Blackberry was because it's obvious that the NSA or some other agency already  cracked the Blackberry system and they probably have been monitoring everybody's calls and  they figured that if the NSA is doing it, Russia is probably doing it and everybody else,  so they can't afford to have this guy on that system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you also have...  John, you also have the situation with the Freedom of Information Act, which  is required...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's the Presidential Records Act, which does require Freedom of Information Act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which, by the way, didn't they mysteriously lose Bushes?  Yeah, they tried to.  Whoops.  What's going on here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nothing ever really gets lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Misplaced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just doesn't get found.  What they're saying...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So here's what Robert Gibbs, the Presidential Press Secretary, said.  He said, President Obama gets to keep his Blackberry.  Only a few people will be a new address.  Only a few people will have that address.  Those people have to be briefed by the White House counsel before they can send him email,  before they get the address, so that they know that they can't say,  hey, Barack, did you see these pictures of Lindsay Lohan?  And they have to be...  Because everything's going to be public record.  I got the impression that he's going to get to use that.  He'll still have the secterra edge, this $3,000 General Dynamics shoebox phone.  That's what he uses to call the General, the Chiefs of Staff on.  Because that one has...  You press a button and it's encrypted.  But he's not going to use the Blackberry as a phone.  But I got the impression he's still going to get a Blackberry.  Hey, look who's here.  Seamus.  Hey.  Hey, last time we were talking to you, Seamus, you were having a diaper emergency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is Patrick still coded?  Patrick is here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He actually came into the studio.  So nice to see you, Patrick.  Yeah.  And Dr. Kiki is here.  And Seamus, the baby, is here.  Is the lovely Sarah in the vicinity?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She's actually enjoying a fabulous dog and baby free afternoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A dog and baby free...  Did you bring the dog?  The dog's in the car.  Dog's in the car.  Well, bring the dog in.  I don't mind a dog.  How big is the dog?  Will he knock over the camera with a wag of his tail?  Yes.  Okay, never mind.  It's an enthusiastic dog.  We've got to get a mic for Patrick.  You know, if you're going to be in here, I think what we're going to have to do is...  There goes Seamus.  Seamus is...  I'm actually just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, I'll ask you one question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  Kiki's going to share the mic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So isn't it interesting, though, that the emails were lost until people started scanning  and they're basically in a court battle, escalating,  basically going through the court system?  Is it the Bush emails?  The Bush emails.  Basically, the last one was the judge was like,  you thought you'd be able to beat having to produce these emails in court,  and now look, I'm saying no, you have to produce these emails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So now they're looking for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And they've been finding a lot of stuff from what I hear.  And it's an interesting idea about transparency.  And it's interesting.  It's going to be interesting to see how this all looks in four years or eight years.  Also the level of transparency that the drug forced down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  On the one hand, you want the chief executive of the United States of America to have the same  technology, the same advantages that Carol Bartz or any other chief executive has.  You don't want to say, sorry, you can't use a laptop, you can't use a cell phone,  you can't use a BlackBerry.  And I think Obama very reasonably says, look, I don't want to be in the presidential bubble.  I want to be an effective CEO here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I think it's great that he wants to be an effective CEO.  But if he manages the nation into a corner, it's not like there's going to be a billion  dollar, 30 billion dollar bailout while they wait to redesign Chrysler or GM to better  serve the needs.  You know what I mean?  There's higher stakes here.  There's the level of security.  Well, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they're all the more reason that he has more equipment and technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I want the, yeah, I know, but it's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's the whole point of it.  Higher stakes.  Higher stakes.  I remember, didn't some guy, one of the Bush IT guys get committed suicide by airplane or  something recently?  You know, the, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what they call it.  Oh, yeah.  That's the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, how can you say that this, there's a difference between Carole Bart's, first of  all, they don't shop in the same place, I don't think, but that's different.  Sorry, okay.  Obama looks great in purple.  What are you saying?  But there's a difference.  There's a, figuratively, there's a button.  There's a difference between the two of them.  We're talking about one person is dealing with Yahoo, which arguably may be in the same  financial shape as the U.S.  Right now.  But nonetheless, the fact is that there's a tremendous difference.  And he, you know, the communication that Obama can have at any given time is incredible.  He doesn't need to necessarily have his Blackberry.  And I'm trying to speak for him, taking away from him.  I mean, but at the same time, he is president of the United States.  And that is a little bit different than you and I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But are you saying he has to go in the sit room to send an email to his buddy from college?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I don't think that's the case.  But there needs to be some kind of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I question this myself.  And one of the things that I always think about is that you have to have all this transparency.  And every time he sends an email, it has to be recorded and put away somewhere so they  can retrieve it if somebody has a Freedom of Information Act request.  But what about if the guy's whispering to somebody?  You have to document every little conversation he has.  Where do you draw the line on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, but the record keeping is like the same for any corporation.  It's easier with a Blackberry.  It's easier.  You keep it all in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because everything's written down.  That's not a big deal.  Well, clearly, he shouldn't be saying...  Other people think they're feeding Pakistan on the Blackberry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's probably not something you should be doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But remember, President Reagan was on mic when he said the bombing begins in 20 seconds.  I mean, presidents have said...  You know, he can't joke anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't even make a good of Snyder.  That was actually a pretty funny joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It wasn't well received by the Russians.  You can still make snide remarks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And people have been making snide remarks for generations in the White House.  It's just the only people who normally got to hear them would be the Secret Service,  who are pretty good about keeping that stuff for themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the point of the discussion to begin with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, my point is that we've got to find a way to get modern technology in the hands of the  people who need it most.  You make the point that he's got an important job.  Yes, that's why he needs to have modern technology.  And if Blackberry helps him stay in touch, then if he wants to read RSS feeds it with  his morning Cheerios on his Blackberry, more power to him.  Look at his desk.  There wasn't a laptop on it because now he has a private office, which is not publicly visible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Unlike most corporations in the United States, he also still has secretaries and layers of  administration because he's dealing with the most tightly scheduled out of control job in the planet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You guys are saying he doesn't need the Blackberry because he has all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  His support staff.  But his support staff is lacking stuff also.  He wants to get out of the bubble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He said, I don't want to be isolated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, in which case, you go for it, you bring it top down, you try to introduce new technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe it's not a Blackberry, maybe it's something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The guy's doing his fireside chats on YouTube.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, in order to do that, they had to change policy.  They actually had to change a privacy policy to make it possible to post stuff on YouTube.  Look, and as you said, Kiki, they came into the White House with and what do they have?  They have a bunch of PCs with XP on them.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've got six year old technology and people don't have enough laptops to go around.  Only specific people get laptops.  How are we going to have proper organization if they can't even be up to date with their technology?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Presumably, they're going to spend some money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How many of us have worked in organizations with more than 500 to 10,000 people?  I have.  I have friends who run IT in larger organizations.  Right.  You know what?  One of the most impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Get right in there on the mic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sorry.  One of the most amazing sales groups I ever saw was working on Lotus Notes.  Email is essentially StoneAge technology, whether you're using it in a group environment with  Lotus Notes or not.  And XP, well, half the machines in my house are still running XP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't need-  I thought there was a positive, not a negative, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, one thing that- there is a culture shock.  No, there is a culture shock because the Obama campaign was running on Macs.  So there's some culture shock.  I think some of it's just whining like, oh man, we got to use XP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about this?  I'll give you a deal.  You get the economy back on track, I'll give you two Blackberries.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I mean, the thing is though, he's the president of the United States.  If a president can like- I mean, look at the executive powers.  Surely he can basically sign- if a president can sign an executive order to raise mayhem  or to drill baby drill, certainly the president can sign an executive order that says,  I want some delete ex-pilots OS-10 in my White House.  I think they could do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Although the outgoing Bush IT guy said, oh no, they're stuck with Windows.  I do have one question.  I do have one question for John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I was going to- but before you asked that, I was going to say at least,  the most important thing, of course, for Obama, if you do have XP,  will XP run the teleprompter?  Because that seems to be the most important thing.  That's why I still have-  That's why I still have-  Oh, groan.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We go to my- we go to my change- my change joke now, but I don't think we will.  Oh.  John, what country is the Blackberry-  Canada.  Canada.  Canada.  Canada.  Oh, that's interesting.  That's interesting.  So not to spit on anything in Canada, but not even a US company that we're dealing with  here on this.  Is that a problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would think it's a promotional problem.  In fact, he should be pushing US products.  He should be going for the 1971 and funding some sort of IMAC map.  I got news for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Every member of Congress is using a Blackberry.  Everybody in the FCC uses a Blackberry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And by the way, do you see how much leakage of information there is?  A lot of the work that happened, all the problems that happened during last year's disgusting  passage, not passage, passage, not passage of the bailout and the market movement was  because there was all sorts of leakage.  There was a meeting they took, they said, everybody come in and put your phones in this  basket.  We're taking away from you because you can't control yourselves, children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, not only that, but if you're using a Blackberry out of Canada, that means the  information is crossing international borders, which means the NSA can tap all that information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can fix all that though, presumably.  Why would you want to?  Well, you just use a Blackberry information server that's running out of the executive.  And I don't think you have to worry about Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just saying.  You say how many people do you think that are in Congress know how to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, they do.  I'm sure that the stuff from Congress is not going through Kirchner, Ontario.  I can promise you it's going to a BIS server in the basement of the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A BS server, yes, you're right, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But the White House has a...  The White House webpage has a whole new look as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like the new webpage.  Which is quite interesting.  It looks like he's running for office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The first thing he does is he comes in and he does a blog and he does his Blackberry  and he's worried about his computers and he doesn't say one thing about how to fix the  economy.  I'm impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's working on fixing...  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want him to say something.  I just want him to say something because this thing is getting a little out of hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But you know what's interesting?  If you look at the last eight years and the previous eight years before that,  it looks like half of the job of the president now is staying more popular than Congress.  And he's already in a battle with his own congressional leaders  over the economic package.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, this is where I think you're going to see him use his social media like Twitter  and the email lists that he's composed and the SMS lists.  You bet he's going to say, hey, we want to get this stimulus package passed.  We're getting some trouble with these senators.  Would you please write...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Send a telegram to your senator.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's already changed the basic components of it already.  We're into a $300-400 billion tax cut... tax rebate now.  Well, guess who...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We saw how well that was in the past.  Guess whose idea that was.  That's their...  I don't want to get in a political discussion here, but that's to appease...  Too late now.  ...the congressional Republicans.  That's not...  And let me say one other thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, of course it is.  But it's just like we had $150 billion of capping in the last go-round of this ridiculousness.  And now we're going to have to appease...  I mean, when did...  I mean...  Well, because it's politics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Welcome to politics.  He's not a dictator for life.  He has to work with Congress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And he's been a dictator for four years.  I think there's one really key question here.  And that's who's got the bigger package?  Is it Carole Barks or is it Barack Obama?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Facebook is nearly twice the size of my space, according to a new study...  Moving on.  Facebook in November 2008 drew 200 million unique...  200 million...  In one month, 200 million unique visitors.  Facebook...  Let that sink in.  200 million in one month!

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's two-thirds of the population of the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  More than one in five people who access the internet in November visited Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Intentionally or accidentally?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In December, 222 million.  10% growth!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My whole entire house is on Facebook the whole time.  My wife found this.  She doesn't leave it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are they making money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Don't you think?  I think they...  I heard they have some trouble lately.  Really?  Yeah, because the advertisers...  Back to that again.  What about the federated media?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They laid off people?  It is tough times right now for banner ads anyway.  Our advertising base is still very good, but I don't know how much longer that's going to last.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, what's happening though is a lot of companies that have traditionally concentrated on  banner ad type media or pre-rolls and post-rolls are looking to do with a lot of podcasters and  video podcasters have already done, which is integrating the...  Basically, going to that 75-year-old radio tradition...  Yeah.  Integrated ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've been doing that since day one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Everything old is new again.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's so devoid I can't skip through me to find out who won the Super Bowl.  So how far ahead, John, would you recommend?  So how long before you start watching?  Two hours at least.  Can you give me a more concrete...  I mean, I want to be able...  So the idea is that you time it so that you're live at the end of the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the idea.  You want to be...  It depends on how much of the game you want to watch.  You want to watch six minutes, you want to watch 15 minutes...  I'd like to get the last 15 minutes live.  I think you can probably go two hours and 15 minutes and probably pull it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  So the game begins when?  Is it five Pacific times, something like that?  Four?  Right.  So I'm going to wait till seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's from kickoff, by the way.  So you got to be careful because they start the game.  You know, all the games get thrown in at five, they don't kick it off for an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So do we wait to the lion roars two times or three times?  And then when do you start the...  What are you laughing at?  I'm just trying to get it right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Dr. Kiki and I are like, is this Super Bowl this month?  Stop tickling over there.  Who's playing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are you not football fans?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't even know who's playing these two.  Patrick's a...  I want you to get a room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's a rugby player.  He plays rugby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Listen, I think you could...  I think you've got to be able to do the same with Twitter.  Like if you tuned into Twitter at 3 p.m.  Then you get like the intros and then like the topics.  And skip the politics.  Watch it, Will.  Watch it, you Brits.  And then get in for live at the end.  Perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If the Cleveland Browns are in the Super Bowl, I'm totally watching Cleveland Browns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, then you're never going to watch the Super Bowl in your entire life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a bet there, John.  I bet if we bet on that, they'll be in the Super Bowl next year.  Are they still a team?  They are still a team, in fact.  They have fans.  Enthusiasts even.  Uniforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like the...  I'm a fan of the Patek at Red Roosters.  Are they going to have a make it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How about the Detroit Lions?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Lions, that's sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did you read the Sports Illustrated column about the Detroit Lions?  No.  Detroit being sort of peed on.  I'll forward it to you.  It's sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's very sad.  So what other news do we have?  I see the chat room going nuts over the sports.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Who's going to come up with the first service so I can tweet  and then it'll automatically be faxed to my congress critter?  That's a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Tweet.  Tweet.  Tweet.  There is...  Oh, wait a minute.  Tweet facts?  You know what?  Tweet facts?  There is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  And there will be no business model with that either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This isn't about business model.  This is about affecting positive change in my government  because I'm tired of taking it.  Delete, expletive, delete, expletive, delete, expletive.  Did you see what the Times has done?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is very, very interesting.  Go to the New York Times Open column.  They've written a congressional API.  No, this is fantastic.  They are scraping data from the Senate and House webseats.  They are parsing it using XML.  They are turning into RSS feeds.  They are making a database that you can plug into.  You're going to be able to, using this API,  get a list of members for a given congress and chamber,  details of a specific roll call vote,  all with standard XML calls, biographical information,  who voted for what, when, the most recent positions  for any member of congress on roll call votes.  I mean...  This is epic.  This is epic.  This is a complete computer automated API into congressional.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder if there's going to be any indicators on it  in such a way that when the email is sent out,  it can be just filtered and thrown into a spam box,  because it sounds to me like a spam generator.  The funny thing is, people who study this,  email doesn't have much of an effect on these people.  You have, if you sit down and write a real letter on a typewriter...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know why?  They don't know if you're a constituent or not.  So they look at the post office...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you sit down and write a real letter on a typewriter,  you'll get further.  But I wanted to get back to some tech stuff,  because I wanted to get something in before the show was over,  which was...  I got a G phone, an Android phone.  Oh.  Did you get one?  Or did you get it?  I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I thought maybe you had actually been so impressed.  You had laid down your hard-earned filthy lucre on the phone.  I bought a G phone.  You'll buy any phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, to cover it...  And by the way, John, I got it the minute it was available.  It's nice of you to join the party two months later.  Well, hey, what did I pay?  I paid 200.  What did you pay?  Nothing.  I didn't pay anything.  Nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a developer's phone, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you got the G1.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't get it to work right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It doesn't work.  It doesn't work.  It never works.  It'll never work.  That's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The tubes are stuffed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It won't take my Google account information  and then hook me to the server.  It says, ah, the server doesn't...  You know, it's down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mine works great.  But the battery life is like four minutes.  It's terrible.  That's the real problem.  Apparently, there were two different battery ships.  So some people are getting better battery life,  but it's not very good battery life.  But I'm impressed.  It's a great operating system.  That phone has a nice keyboard.  But you know what?  I still carry the iPhone.  The iPhone has yet to find a competitor.  I'm looking forward to seeing the Palm Pre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo, I did jailbreak the phone a couple of times very successfully.  Jailbreak the iPhone or the Android?  The iPhone.  It was pretty easy to do.  I mean, once you kind of get through...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the key is that you have to wait a little while  after the new firmware comes out.  And then the jailbreakers have figured it all out.  And then usually it's very straightforward and safe.  I had a kid, an 11-year-old kid, call me on the radio show today, say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  is it okay for me to jailbreak my iPod touch?  My mommy says it would be bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I said, go ahead, do it, kid.  Love it up.  I said, when I was your age, I'd taken apart 15 watches,  never got one of them back together again.  This is how you learn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But if you break it, don't tell your mom I told you to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I said that.  And I might as a disclaimer, I'm not responsible.  Please don't call me if it doesn't work.  I did say that.  No, it's fun to...  That's the whole point of this stuff.  We wouldn't have the internet if people hadn't broken stuff.  You got to break stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, we wouldn't have the internet if people didn't want to blow stuff up  and have a functioning communication network afterwards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank God for that.  Thank God for the urge to blow things up.  We wouldn't have an internet without it.  We love dark.  Hey, Leo.  Andrew Horowitz of the Discipline Investor, give us some discipline now.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One, two, three, four.  Get your stocks off the floor.  How's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Andrew's written a white paper on technology stocks for an Obama recovery.  This is what your prediction for the stocks that will do well  under the existing stimulus plan, things like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, what's going on, obviously, just as a point of reference,  I... we've been more than skeptical about the markets,  and the markets have been skittish at best.  And fortunately, we stayed out of the way of most of this.  All of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm thinking about retiring when I'm 80, and you're calling the market skittish.  I like that.  Skittish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo did well.  I told Leo to get out of the market.  I told... didn't I tell you right to the right time, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You told me you gave me the right timing.  If I just listened about getting back into the right time, I'd be...  No, you know what?  You saved me $70,000 by saying get out, and I followed your instructions.  That was very nice.  Is that right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  Did you give him a piece of the action?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He tolerates me on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He gets to be on Twitter.  He tolerates me on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He gets to be on Twitter.  No.  There's your commission.  I so much.  But you know what?  I bought back...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, double up, Leo.  Double up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thanks.  Good advice.  Did I get two 10s or what happened?  Did I get an ace?  I did get back in because then I read an article in the Times.  It says, well, don't try to time the recovery either, though, because...  But that's what they all say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait till you see.  I have your friend, the jingle-butt man, John...  Not John.  Who does the jingle?  Jeff Smith.  Yeah.  We wrote a... I wrote a song.  I have a parody coming out next week.  Really?  Yeah.  It's going to be kind of funny.  I've been in a big fight.  You know, I do that MSN Strategy Lab.  So listen, anything can happen anytime.  But I'm up 13.5% since August.  Everybody else is down anywhere from...  You're up on this market?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it all by shorting things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  Both sides.  We went back in at a certain point.  Right?  Probably a few weeks after we talked to you.  But then we put sell stops and got out, back in, back out.  We shorted things.  I mean, we're all both sides.  But you just got to be...  Unfortunately, this whole idea of buy and hold  and never get...  I've been in so many arguments lately with people.  It's just unbelievable.  And the idea that, first of all, the markets aren't rigged  and you have a chance is...  We need to take that out of the discussion because...  Right, John?  I mean...  Wait, wait.  Let me...  They're totally rigged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I want to get this straight.  You're saying the market is rigged  and an individual investor does not have a chance.  Correct.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sounds right to me.  Thank you.  I'm sorry.  I mean, I don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I don't...  Yeah, that's absolutely the case.  So why do you play it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because I make money out of it.  Because you're smarter than everybody else.  Well, yeah.  Not at all.  Isn't that what every guy going to Vegas thinks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I'm not smarter than anybody else.  Not at all.  But you know what?  There are ways to work this market and to protect yourself.  The big thing, the big issue that doesn't happen  is that people don't protect the downside.  And if all you did simply was to every once in a while say...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's why I sit on this blue ball, by the way.  I'm protecting my downside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  But most people don't.  And they fall right on their arse.  How do you protect your downside?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By diversifying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it didn't work lately.  Hedge funds?  Not hedge funds.  Shorting oil?  Hedging.  Shorting or hedging is one way.  Sell stops is another way.  You have to be careful with that.  And not listening to all the noise because everybody always  talks about just staying in, but they have an axe to grind.  John Bogle the other day talked about just stay in.  Brilliant guy, by the way, from Vanguard.  What do you...  But he needs to stay in.  He has a reason why he wants you to stay in  because he makes money when you're in the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's a zero-sum game and you only make money  if somebody else is losing money.  But let me ask you this.  Is it not true that it's hard to time?  That's not true, by the way.  It's not a zero-sum?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's not an up market.  I buy something for 10, I sell it to you for 20,  you sell it to somebody else for 30,  he sells it to somebody else for 40.  Who's losing money in this deal?  Only as long as the market continues to go up.  Well, I'm saying if it goes down, then everyone loses.  It's still not a zero-sum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but there's two sides to the market.  Unfortunately, everybody believes you only make money  if things go up, and that's just silly.  Just silly.  Make money if the markets go down.  I'm not suggesting I want to make the market go down,  but if we found a stock, I'll give you that example again.  VMware last year, a great company that had a product  that was amazing.  Did they take it?  But why did it?  It was so easy to figure out.  We plugged it at over 100 in December.  Why?  Because Microsoft was coming out with a competing product.  Now, whether or not Microsoft's product was good or not,  it was going to be embedded in the new Longhorn server,  and it was going to be free.  Right there, we have a problem.  So the days were numbered for VMware under that scenario.  Not to mention, there was talk that people thought  their pricing was too high and blah, blah, blah.  Anyway, bottom line, we shorted them.  Made 50 points on the down.  Let me ask you this.  Did you think that eBay, we wrote an article a year ago  pegging $10 on the price for eBay.  Every single time I tried to sell my N95,  which I bought because of you, by the way.  I loved it, but then I couldn't deal with the keyboard.  And bad battery life, by the way.  Every single time I tried to sell it, I got intercepted.  By somebody somewhere in the world  to try to scam me out of it.  Five times I tried to sell it.  I'm not selling it to eBay anymore.  So you say short eBay.  We did short.  Not anymore.  It was already over.  It's down.  So it's over.  Yeah, we wrote about this weekend  before the earnings came out.  What a disaster.  Which is a company, by the way,  that should be doing extraordinarily well  in this market condition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you'd think.  Andrew told me about the eBay thing,  I think over a year ago, when this book,  I don't know, what was it?  $30, $40, $50 a share?  It was about, yeah, $35.  And it was like, you know what I say?  I was going to go to $10.  And I started thinking about it  because Eric, our programming friend,  my stepson, had a little business going  that relied on eBay.  And he set me aside and read me the riot act  about all the screw ups that they're doing.  That they're pushing this buy it now thing  with this Chinese junk.  And he's had to close that business down  because all the eBay policy changes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, well eBay and PayPal have never been,  or at least in recent memory,  have not been particularly in favor of the consumers.  And the consumers drive the business,  whether they like it or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That happened well after this whole  Zimbabwe, Nigerian rings came in  to totally try to rip you off.  That was well after the fact  that when they changed their rates  and when they changed the whole premise of what they were doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I actually had,  people were scamming five years ago.  Somebody tried to take me on a-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now at this level, not like now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I'm not saying-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's too late now,  so give us one we can use today.  Let me ask you this question.  You sound like a racetrack tout.  I feel like you're the guy out front of the racetrack saying,  I got one that can't lose.  This one I never lose.  I learned my lesson betting on horses.  And I lost my shirt.  I never do it again.  And I feel like the stock market's the same exact thing.  I got a bunch of guys with tip sheets saying,  oh no, you can't lose with my system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but some of the tip sheets-  That's a tip sheet.  That's a whole different situation.  That's the old model.  What's the new model?  The new model is to work in a-  Well, let me ask you this question.  Let me ask a simple question to everybody here.  Do we think that the economy in the next six months  looks even reasonably like there's going to be any kind of uptick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes? Who said yes?  Spank.  Who said yes?  Take him and spank him.  Who is that?  He's too big for me to spank.  That's what he wants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He wants to be spanked.  Don't let him get away with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is Will still there?  Because England's looking worse.  Or did he get sucked down into the economy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You say that.  I like to be eternally optimistic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what? That's great.  Be eternally optimistic, which everybody wants to do,  and then just take your portfolio down by half and then get all pissed off about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What should I invest in?  I don't want to invest in the stock market.  It's going to tank.  So what should I invest in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you can invest in the stock market.  You need to be careful about it.  Right?  I don't have time to be careful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo, I think you should just start buying the land around you.  That's what I'm going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going to buy land and I'm going to buy Krugerrands.  You know what, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, they say all the books that you read say in a down market,  you should invest in yourself because it's the only sure bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Their books say that.  I thought Jason Calacanis invented that.  You mean he stole that?  So, Patrick Martin, thanks for coming by.  Patrick's leaving us.  Take care, Seamus.  Good luck in the market now that you've got these great tips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, yeah, I put down, I put up this, I don't know, six or seven page piece.  Everybody can grab over at the disciplineinvestor.com.  Just go over there.  It's on the top post, I think.  You can download it.  But basically, you know, what my big contention here is that there is going,  you see how Obama's really into his Blackberry?  He's really into his computers.  Well, he's going to try to, I think, as we know,  make that a very big component of this next plan and something that I'm  calling access ubiquitization, which is he really wants to have  tremendous amount of access to all places that we can't,  and we're so far behind anyway.  Leo, what's the rest of the world looking like in terms of  download bandwidth and capabilities compared to us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's certain areas that are definitely much better than us,  and there are lots of areas that are much worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're still 16th in the world in terms of average speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's pathetic.  We're not supposed to be number one, are we?  Or are we up there somewhere?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're not even close.  Hey, by the way, what, not you, what is this supposed to be?  We are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I read it somewhere.  I read it somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I've heard.  I want to be on the phone.  You mentioned, by the way, I just want to throw one thing.  When you mentioned the, you know, to Will about England,  I just checked out what the pound is going for a buck 37.  It's pretty grim.  Oh, that's unbelievable.  I'm getting over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it's yeah, if you're an American coming over, it's great value.  If you're like me and you're planning your next few trips to the States,  it's slightly catastrophic.  Well, it's about time, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is the euro weakening as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, the euro is staying really strong and the pound is going.  Compared to you, because you're taking it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's compared to us, it's weakening.  Oh, okay.  Dollar to the dollar twenty-nine right now.  Dollar twenty-nine, really?  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it's, it's almost one to one now, the pound of the euro, which.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have never, I have never seen in my life, and I used to go to England quite a bit,  and I have never seen it so high and then so low ever within, and it's all within one year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, we've, is there a tech angle on this?  Because it is supposed to be this week in tech.  Yeah, there is a tech angle on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the tech angle?  The tech angle is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By your computers in England.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  What brands are there again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I'm going to let you go.  I have to let you go because the noise from across the pond is getting really bad.  I don't know why it is, but it's just, it sounds like static.  Maybe we're on Wi-Fi or something.  I don't know.  But Will Harris, hey, thank you so much.  ChannelFlip.com is the place to go.  Lots of great entertainment.  You're reinventing television and doing a great job, and it's a wonderful site.  Thanks, Lee.  It's easy.  I'm going to call you in again probably next week because I'm never going to get  any Americans on on Super Bowl Sunday.  So we're going to get a bunch of Keeks and Brits.  Yeah, you don't care, do you?  Kiki, will you be on again next Sunday?  We'll just do this without the football fans.  Thank you, Will.  Yeah, that's much better.  Oh, that got better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The game starts after the show's over, so it's not a big deal.  Oh, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, we could have like the pregame show.  It'd be fun.  You know, it's like the transatlantic cable was like messed up or something there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, Leo, just to finish up on this point that we've gone around and back and forth 20 times  here, but there is the white paper has all the technology stocks that I think will do well,  and the sectors, what they'll do well in this next, we'll talk about the 12 months,  considering there's going to be, oh, I don't know, four or five hundred billion dollars  spent on many of these areas or, you know, entirely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can I just like put my money in a savings account?  Yeah, you'll get like what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One, two percent.  That would be good, but it's better than losing money right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Paying attention to this stupid stock market.  My land.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People hire like really, you know, they hire professionals instead of just  thrown into a mutual fund.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but isn't the history of professionals just as pathetic as?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is what the information is put out by the mutual funds is.  Oh, they're lying to me?  I'm telling you that this is going to be the greatest thing that's going to happen from this  is going to be that there's going to be some eyes opened into what really is going on behind the  scenes and all this.  The idea of the 20 year histories and all the different statistics, the people.  I mean, it's just unbelievable that the mutual funds listen, let's put it this way.  They've lost some of them have lost 50 percent of their money.  Now they're hiking their fees because they're not making enough now.  Well, guys, do me a favor.  Next time you have this concern that you're not going to be making as much fees of assets  go down, maybe protect my money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's this guy named Bernie Madoff who has this really great investment fund.  He's a winner.  Tell me, tell me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thinking of trying that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He says he's going to do like a steady 10 percent a year.  I'm feeling pretty good about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But but that's this is the this is the time we're going to see all of the rotten stuff come out  and purge itself and the you know, the real let me let me say this.  Did you really think it's that easy to stick your money somewhere and you're going to make  all this money forever on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you really think that people like to believe that they hope they hope.  Yeah, it's depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't have time to manipulate to manipulate my stock market.  I all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, then don't then you know what?  There are mutual funds that at least go halfway.  There's a few funds that that that do on downside protection that they're not just all about.  You go up and you make money.  If you go down, you'll lose a whole heap of money.  And I got to tell you something.  I've been harping on this lazy portfolio discussion where people just put their money in and they've  been saying, oh, that's me.  Oh, you know, I made 10 percent better than  the S&P last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My Z portfolio.  That's me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I call it something different.  You want me to tell you what I call it?  Yeah, idiotic investing.  Thank you.  That's me.  You're welcome.  I'm sorry.  I won't be fighting back.  But here's the point that you know what?  I think that you think that you're okay that you that you made 10 percent better than the S&P  500 last year.  So you only lost 25 percent.  So you're happy about it.  Oh, my.  I mean, you know, people are not going to like me saying that they haven't.  But the truth of the matter is that that's why if you look since since August, I'm up 13 percent  in the Amazon strategy that's right there.  It's going to be up the next three weeks.  I'm going to win the competition unless I do something dastardly stupid.  And, you know, the thing is that you have to if you want to invest and make money,  your money, you have to work on it.  It's a kind of unique thing for us these days, I guess.  We have to work for our money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google is about to launch a very controversial service.  Are you ready for this one?  It's called Google Drive or G Drive.  It would allow users to access their personal computers from any Internet connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What does that mean?  Is that like a competition to go to meeting G Drive is expected to be launched later this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is from an article in the Guardian.  You got a code that you can and I'm sure that it was one of the stories that we'll  want to talk about with us.  And I'm sorry that we lost him.  According to the news website, TG Daily, it's the most anticipated Google product so far.  It's completely cloud computing.  That's cool.  You know, Microsoft's kind of doing something similar with mesh and Sky Drive.  But the idea of it is essentially you put everything on your hard drive on Google's servers.  This is something John's always hated.  What?  Cloud.  What's the idea of like thin computing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I've always hated it.  You can buy a hard disk for ten dollars and fifty cents.  It holds 30 terabytes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I think the answer I think what's going on, though,  we got a call in the radio show this guy said, you know, I have a computer here,  computer there, a laptop.  It's not so much the hard drive issue, the storage issue.  It's the mobility issue is that I want to be able to access my data everywhere I go  with a variety of different computers.  And have it all synced.  Yeah, I think that's kind of what people are looking at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't mind syncing something in the cloud, but I still want to keep my data primarily local.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, until they can come up with some kind of security that's really good,  that's just impenetrable.  And the fact that assure me that it's not going to be down ever.  We haven't had many downs on the Amazon site lately, right?  On the S3 or this whole.  Yeah. Well, not lately, but it was we had some real problems earlier.  Right. Until I can find assurance.  I'm not I can't.  Yeah, I can't guarantee my own service sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are there any questions being brought up at all about the privacy issues?  Because Google has, you know, looking through the Gmail,  looking through Gmail to find keywords to bring you ads.  Are they going to be looking through information that you store on their hard drives?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's really Google's bid to say I want to control this whole thing.  Microsoft's doing the same thing with mesh and their services.  I think everybody's going after this business and I don't we've talked about it before.  Just thought I'd mention the story that G drive is imminent.  Just to get us back on tech because we're going to wrap this up.  Imminent.  Imminent.  John C. Dvorak is available at channeldvorak.com.  The place to go to find out more about what John is up to.
