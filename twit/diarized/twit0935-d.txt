Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's great. If you're lucky. Well, you know 90% of trips are under 30 miles. So that's good  That'd do it that'd do her  So we were joking around at the beginning of the show about threads  I think that's really clearly the top story of the week and I  Mean, okay, I have mixed feelings about it, but let me tell you what happened and we've been teasing this  So as meta for some time that they were gonna add a Twitter like  platform to Instagram  The name is threads. They did it this week. They said they were gonna do it on Thursday  They jumped the gun and launched it Wednesday night and  Even though I got on as quickly as possible. I was the in the five millions of  new people Mark Zuckerberg  Posted this I think was Saturday or Friday that they have 70 million. I'm sure it's higher  I'm sure it's over a hundred million by now. So it's probably the fastest growing app of all time  It is very I'll show you it's very much like Twitter  And it has a couple of advantages  well one advantage is Twitter is rapidly swirling the  drain but the  but the other advantage is it's just like Twitter and  you join it by going to Instagram and it imports your Instagram follows and  followers and  Your handle and you're pretty much on and going the other thing they did that was brilliant  Was instead of doing  The Twitter style following feed where you have to follow people before you see their posts. It did a tick-tock style  algorithmic feed which when you first join it is brilliant because you're instantly you're seeing a ton of content and  If the algorithm works content you're interested in and so you could quickly add people  It immediately caught on with not just regular users, but brands and celebrities  Everybody there's a OC. There's Howie Mandel. There's been par. There's everybody is on here and  I think this is a very interesting play now. It's missing a lot of features  It doesn't in fact have a following feed, you know, you're stuck with the algorithmic feed  It does not have direct messaging  It does have quit quotes quote tweet tweak quote tweet tweet quotes  Oh threads, you know where you quote you can say look I like this  I'm going to retweet repost it and I'm gonna put a quote in above it  You know the traditional quote tweet that mastodon refuses to do because they don't like it  It but it is missing some other features that Twitter users might like  It certainly doesn't show you how many people have looked at your post which was a late ad from  Elon Musk it shows you though how many replies you've gotten how many likes and you can see on a lot of these  There are there's a lot of engagement a lot of engagement  May have been you were very good picture of a picture that I think Mark Zuckerberg would prefer not to see  Oh, it's a link to some  Of himself as I don't know what  We get juggalo there he has a juggalo I think you're right there I'll show you I will go to the  The app store to show you the thing that most people you know before it launched come complained about which was the  Privacy settings it it has the same privacy settings as  as Instagram  And I presume is the Facebook app in other words it sucks it all down, baby  including health and fitness  In theory we don't know in practice what they're gonna do but in theory they could know for instance if you were if you were pregnant  If you didn't like to exercise if you like to eat donuts it knows your purchases your locations your financial info  Your sensitive info basically they get they get everything I  Thought maybe that would slow down adoption clearly it has not  Nor has the relationship to meta I think there's a lot of people I don't I'm not on Facebook  I don't want to have any to do with Facebook  but for some reason Instagram never bothered me and  I don't I know use Instagram anymore because it's turned into some sort of weird shopping mall  But I but threads was easy to join and I love the engagement so Ben  What's happening? Why is threads?  People are just over overruling their own better interests and joining I

Start time: 691.22
End time: 764.48
Speaker: Ben Parr
Transcript:  Mean there's one main reason that threads is taken off and it's Elon and  Elon ever since he took over  has alienated a large section of  Twitter and I think you know now we know how clearly  That happened and it was a lot of people more than would say the Elon stans would  be willing to admit and the result is that people were flocking and looking for a place where they  didn't feel like  They would be trolled all the time or have those issues and look I love Twitter  And I like so love the community there, and there's a difference between the two, and I think what will end up happening is that  Threads will become the more mainstream app with a little bit of the more mainstream conversation  Just purely from the fact that's connected to Instagram  And Twitter will have a little bit more of a business bent and maybe a little bit of a right-wing bend  But reality is like Elon made missteps and it turned people off and they're looking for an alternative and  Macedon wasn't really it and blue sky wasn't really it  But meta just knows Mark Zuckerberg knows social you could hate on him as much as you want  He knows how to build social media companies doesn't quite know how to do metaverse

Start time: 764.76
End time: 823.38
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But you know social media and he has nailed it and by the way as proof that Elon is feeling the pain  He immediately July 5th  Sent out a cease and desist email from his attorneys  saying that a  threads is a copy of Twitter and  B that they hired a bunch of former Twitter employees people Elon fired I should point out and  Is using them to copy?  Threads Adam Asseri who is the head of Instagram and the head of threads said no in fact  We are not using any Twitter employees on threads  And who knows if this cease and desist will actually carry a lawsuit behind it  But it sure is a direct sign of Elon's  serious pain  He is not happy and of course he probably sees what's happening, right?  I mean, we don't know the numbers. We know how many people have joined threads. What we don't know is how many people have  Abandoned Twitter in favor of threads. We may never know that

Start time: 824.96
End time: 858.50
Speaker: Ben Parr
Transcript:  well, there's always these little signs happening right now of  People banded again like Elon  At least resetting or you could say panicking one example was I think today  They brought back tweet deck, which was a favorite of power users of Twitter including myself  I was so upset when they removed tweet deck, which was before Elon's time bringing it back  That's the kind of thing that could bring people back  My general thought hopefully is that this spurs real competition?  Which means better things for users because competition is always good for the end user

Start time: 859.62
End time: 885.30
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's my hope at least this is how fast the story is breaking. We would have reported the story that tweet deck no longer worked  Because of the rate-limiting  paywall and then this morning all of a sudden it starts working again and  According to one developer Twitter switched to the old version 1 API to get it working again  Don't know how long it will work

Start time: 888.26
End time: 908.56
Speaker: Seth Weintraub
Transcript:  The old tweet deck is actually kind of more important because you can you can act as different sites  So, you know me as a publisher we have a bunch of different writers that have a bunch of different  accounts and the old tweet deck was the only thing that we could get to you know, multiple users using multiple accounts plus you

Start time: 908.58
End time: 938.92
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Could schedule posts to right which I'm sure was useful for you  Yep  Yeah, I agree I that was the only way I use Twitter I loved the old tweet deck  So Twitter clearly is  reeling a little bit  But threads is missing a lot of features. There's no web interface  I have to show you on my phone because I can't put it up on a well, you've got a hack I guess been but  normal people can I mean look the

Start time: 939.14
End time: 1012.20
Speaker: Ben Parr
Transcript:  The  The the story is that they rushed to get this out early  It was gonna launch probably a full month from now with more of those features  But when the rate limiting thing happened, which was just like the cherry on top  Mark told  Adamas area and the team launched now. Yeah, and I think his instincts were right  Most people was looking for an outlet and look now every day they're gonna launch something that is just a basic functionality  You now have the ability to have multiple feeds you now have lists and people will be excited over it  Just as I like side that we are like just it's the great  Elon is the greatest PR person Mark Zuckerberg has ever had like think about how we talked about  Zuck a year ago. Yeah, no years ago. No yesterday. Yeah  What it's it is  Such a power move because I don't know if we like the for he treated for the first time in  Ten years when he launched threads and it was just that spider-man meme of like pointing at each other  He's having a blast. He's having the best weekend ever. It's good. She paid whatever he's having the great time

Start time: 1012.82
End time: 1040.50
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How quickly we forget though that metas?  Long-term strategy was to find something that was succeeding on the web and if they couldn't buy it like Instagram  they would copy it like snapchat and  How many dozens of clones has met a maid over the years, but this one took?  Unlike all the others this one took although I guess you could argue Instagram's reels probably did hurt tick-tock a little bit  Reed are you on threads?

Start time: 1042.30
End time: 1096.74
Speaker: Reed Albergotti
Transcript:  Yes, as I said before I am on threads I've played around with it. Do you care you think that there's I did I mean  Yes, I obviously I agree with you. It's the top story. I think there's this like  Question though. I have in the back of my head like has anybody ever been able to launch a successful social media app  Like with this kind of fanfare based on just sort of people wanting to leave another platform  Well, I'm not Facebook my space  Reddit dig yeah, that was not I mean my space was sort of like it wasn't like people said  Oh, I don't like the people running my space and I'm gonna go to faith  I mean, that's just it's it had a better kind of rollout on college campus  I mean it there's always these things always kind of happen like  organically and not to say that this this won't have  Staying power, but I do kind of wonder whether we're whether this may be kind of a flash in the pan

Start time: 1097.74
End time: 1109.52
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's hard to get I'm not sure if you get 70 million or a hundred million users  That's critical mass, isn't it? I mean  Yeah, but it's like a lot of that is like a lot of that is just their their ability to leverage that Instagram, right?

Start time: 1113.37
End time: 1135.34
Speaker: Reed Albergotti
Transcript:  You know graph I guess if you will so I don't know if it's like a pure 70 million like and it's and it's like  What does it actually mean for Facebook? And what does it actually mean for for Twitter? Like I don't know if this will meaningfully  Change Facebook's or Metta's, you know underlying business and I don't know like we'll see what is

Start time: 1136.60
End time: 1138.36
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Business by the way, do you is it?

Start time: 1140.14
End time: 1174.74
Speaker: Reed Albergotti
Transcript:  You know, it's still just selling ads on Facebook, right and they want it to be good  They want it to be you know a different sort of you know, they're looking to the future  That's the other part of it that I wonder is like is this really the future like is the future of?  Tech and media like just another just more and more copycat apps of sorry  I'm like shaking my camera are there there like more and more copycat apps that just do the same thing  like I sort of I'm kind of wondering whether  Gen Z is going to like start using something completely different and like what is that?

Start time: 1175.14
End time: 1259.00
Speaker: Ben Parr
Transcript:  Like how is how is Gen Z communicate? It was tick-tock and they that did create a new paradigm  But unfortunately some of the other new social networks they've tried to do  Like the Twitter copy real for example  Oh be real was like a new idea and like that completely has lost all momentum and I agree with you that you know  so the only reason threads works is because of what Elon has done with Twitter and like the like response to that he  Market launched threads a year ago. It would have failed two years ago would have failed  it would only work right now and he knows and they could think the reality is there will still be two and  He can convince these specific celebrities who are not tweeting anymore to post on threads because it's part of Instagram  So there will be an audience and both are gonna still be there and survive  I actually think that it will make Twitter better and  Like thread person will make Twitter better and threads will have an audience and it's not like my guess and I can be wrong  Is that it's not like Clubhouse?  And it's more has more real staying power, but it's purely by circumstance in a lot of ways and look, you know  If it works don't I sometimes if it works don't try to like reinvent a wheel just because you can  It would be interesting to see if there's like another generational shift in the way social media works or something else  That is like the hardest thing to predict all I can say right now  Yeah, Elon if Elon messed up

Start time: 1260.40
End time: 1276.04
Speaker: Reed Albergotti
Transcript:  We should and when I say Gen Z it's like tick tock is like the older Gen Z  Slash millennial I feel like the younger Gen Z what a 20 year old yet. Yeah  Yeah, I think I think there's gonna be something else and it's and it's not gonna be threads

Start time: 1276.42
End time: 1322.90
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So that's like one thing that this has done a couple of things come to mind  One is we were last week all proclaiming the end of social media those articles look have aged like milk  To  It's still the same people use Twitter  It is not the general or maybe it is I don't know but I don't think it's the normal  Group of people it's journalists. It's influencers. It's brands. It's celebrities  The the same group that use Twitter. We're looking for a Twitter replacement, but that is still a fraction of the total world  And then the third question I have actually Seth this might apply to you because you have a bunch of brands. I presume  Because you you know, you're doing brand marketing you're gonna immediately join whatever network is

Start time: 1324.92
End time: 1348.72
Speaker: Seth Weintraub
Transcript:  People are on right? You got a sure. Yeah, and we join threads right away and we immediately saw like some big engagement  And also like, you know as Ben said like Twitter had been really rough on us recently  You know, we can't auto tweet anymore. They pulled our tweet deck like and we're and we're verified  And we're verified so like I don't I don't know how people are being treated that aren't you know

Start time: 1349.70
End time: 1352.98
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, they only can look at 600 tweets and that's that and you're done and goodbye

Start time: 1353.66
End time: 1374.80
Speaker: Seth Weintraub
Transcript:  Yeah, so we we were treated pretty poorly by Twitter and you know, every every author there has to like, you know  Go through with these extra hoops  To tweet or reply or whatever. So when threads came up everybody's like let's just do this, you know, let's let's be there  Let's see if this is the next thing and and  The engagement has been great. Yeah

Start time: 1375.66
End time: 1403.76
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What does this mean from your point of view to for blue sky t2 spill?  I mean I can go on and on and on  I'm gonna leave Macedon out for the moment because there is a further story with the Fedaverse  but what is it with the all the other Twitter clones are they I  Mean they were in the same position. They didn't they didn't have the Instagram social graph to glom onto  But I think is it done for blue sky for instance

Start time: 1406.36
End time: 1411.46
Speaker: Seth Weintraub
Transcript:  It feels kind of done to me I yeah like I don't think I've checked blue skies I haven't no

Start time: 1412.00
End time: 1425.48
Speaker: Ben Parr
Transcript:  It's it's hard for me and post news and like look, you know, it already killed itself. I'm sorry post was already done  Guy did just announce a new funding round they had they think they have a very small loyal audience

Start time: 1425.76
End time: 1441.40
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But I mean those people went to blue sky because it wasn't Twitter and now there's something better and they're gonna go to threads  There's no reason there's no stickiness to blue sky or t2 or any of the other. Yeah  You just go where the people are and it's the people have voted it seems like

Start time: 1442.48
End time: 1452.02
Speaker: Seth Weintraub
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean threads suck the air out of the room for all the you know, Elon hating Twitter people like they're just all over  Doing their thing

Start time: 1453.46
End time: 1466.48
Speaker: Reed Albergotti
Transcript:  Well, Elon hating is interesting cuz like there was we had what like six years of Zuckerberg hating right now  Which is crazy like like you were saying everybody really loves the guy now. You think that's okay was unmerited

End time: 1521.38
Speaker: Seth Weintraub
Transcript:  So, I mean, I don't know what that means I don't know what that coming out of coming out of there  So it will keep an eye on it. I guess like  Ben said I I think competition between the two hopefully keeps them honest. Hopefully keeps them, you know  You know fighting each other and making the user experience better but I mean, you know Facebook and Instagram have not been great  users or  When they're in the position of power, they're not great to users or publishers or anybody. Yeah

Transcript:  So I  Left out mastodon because there is one I think fascinating element to this that still remains unknown  before they launched feds  Threads they promised that they would federate that they would support activity pub  Which if they do it means  That we know we run our own mastodon instance at twit.social. I could follow anybody on  threads  safely without joining threads on  mastodon  Which means all the brands and celebrities that refused to join mastodon and the subgroups like black Twitter that wasn't  Didn't feel safe on mastodon they joined they've all joined threads  They could all be followed from mastodon now. There are a lot of mass for some reason  I'm not sure I understand why a lot of mastodon admins say we'll never  Federate with meta we're gonna affect. There's one guy said I just blocked it already. It doesn't even exist. I already blocked it  But as a mastodon admin, I I think it's great you gene rock Rochko who wrote  Mastodon wrote a blog post this week what to know about threads in which he said  Exactly what I've felt which is it's not there's no risk to mastodon from threads. There's nothing but benefit  Threads meta doesn't get any of your data  You won't see ads. There's no embrace and extinguish going on  The activity pub is open and is out there and is not gonna disappear  So this is very good for mastodon, which makes me think that  Meta will absolutely back down as promised and will never never  They have there's no reason for them to they've been successful so successful. They don't need to right

Transcript:  So, you know, it doesn't it's not all mastodon by the way  That's just a small fraction of it  You can follow people from any part of the Fediverse to any other part if threads joins it. Yes  They'll be by far the largest social network in the federation, but that doesn't mean they take it over  It merely means we have access  To me the best way to use threads the privacy forward way to use threads would be to join a mastodon instance  and follow Ben Parr and you know and  Kim Kardashian and and you know cheetos and just follow them on a mastodon  Then you get exactly what you want and no more no less there  There I think there are some other issues and I really do wonder if Mark will just say  Yeah, that was a good thing to say when we weren't sure if if it was gonna take off  But we don't need we don't need them now

He just says  I said I might as well do it anyway because it doesn't really hurt doesn't hurt that meta  No, no, the only way it hurts them is they if a large percentage of their users are  Looking at threads from another mastodon instance and they can't serve ads  That's how it could hurt and that would be the reason they wouldn't do it. But who knows I  Would love to see it. It should happen. Will it happen now?  He's not thinking about that at all. The Fediverse would be a symbiote

Transcript:  Somebody needs to needs to come in and make the Fediverse sort of accessible to everyone right and mastodon is just not that  It's it's never gonna be that but yeah  something needs to happen to kind of get that idea off the ground because it's it's so ridiculous that if people people have this network that  they've built up for years on Twitter and  You know, they all of a sudden they don't like Twitter anymore. They can't just take that network  And go somewhere else and still be able to access it. Right? I mean that's  Like you really don't own your contacts.

It feels like 4th of July is a long time ago  Yeah, yeah, and like we have no news. Yeah, but you just threw giant news  Well, we have to wait a couple months to see if it did  Sticky, okay, right and what's your prediction?  My prediction is that threads and Twitter coexist threads is slight is bigger  How much bigger I don't know threads is just a different kind of conversation a little bit more  To hick talk like a little bit more unhinged less business and Twitter becomes a little bit more business and  Twitter's a little bit more like politics and  Twitter gets better because of this. Those are my safe predictions  Does to those threads get to a billion users by the end of the year? I don't think so, but we'll see

Transcript:  This is where the Fediverse is kind of interesting too  It's like if the world is really scattered and there's like 18 different social networks that you're using at any given time  It just becomes really unwieldy and like then you sort of need something to kind of like unify it  I've been I've been using this app called beeper  Which is kind of interesting that like takes all your messages  I'm just playing with it but like, you know, you have slack and I message and you know every  You know LinkedIn whatever it's all like in one place and it's it's really useful  I mean, it's just it's so hard to keep track of like everything that you've you know

Transcript:  Does hoot suite work with threads? I mean, how do I I was just gonna comment on that  doesn't yet and  You know like it's just gonna become more complicated like it we're going in that direction  It would be nice if there was like a hoot suite type top-level thing  That would shoot out to all the you know other stuff and maybe meta will make something like that that does its programs and then  You know Twitter and and some other groups will do something else  You know, it's hard to say like right now. I know that  Threads is here to stay I think it'll be around for a while. I don't think it's gonna be like Google Plus  And I think that and meta I know I don't think I don't think that is gonna give up on give up on anything  I'm

Transcript:  Unashamed that I loved Google Plus  And I look I look they gave I got half a million followers on Google Plus, of course, I loved it  Please that I am NOT above being on a suggested user list. I'm not above begging  Google if Google had just not turned that off and had just kept going with it  It could have taken advantage  Like it Google could have absolutely done it too. This is just timing  But the reality is mark like Google is not an expert at social networks meta is that is their core competency

Start time: 2110.09
End time: 2199.08
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah  But ironically the one thing that made threads take off is something they stole from tick-tock  Which is a pure algorithmic feed as the default feed and go you know it had had people known about that in  Google's time Google Plus time. Maybe they could have saved Google Plus with that  That's how YouTube works when you go to YouTube  You don't have to follow a channel before you can see the videos it recommends immediately  so maybe YouTube gets credit for inventing that certainly tick-tock perfected it and  Threads is doing exactly what tick-tock does which is you don't have to have any friends on threads  You just go and there's stuff already happening. You can see people you can add them easily  They have a everybody's head has a plus sign in it, which means you just tap their head and now you follow them  They if anything meta has learned the lesson  From tick-tock and Google and what Twitter did right and what treated it wrong and this is the neck to me  This is next-generation social  Using everything we've learned over the last 10 years Google Plus didn't have the advantage of that they were at the other end of those  10 years I  Think in my opinion threads  by  Cleverly using they can go wrong and they still have a long way to go  But I think if they make the right steps this is the next big thing I don't have any doubt about that  Seth you to have a prediction yet.

That's the problem  I  Will all be paper clips  all right, yeah, I I have to say having seen quite a bit of this in my  30 or 40 years covering  Technology this is I've never seen anything quite like threads and I've never seen anything be quite so appealing  So quickly I joined Instagram on day one and it was very appealing very quickly, but it didn't have the same kind of  Resonance and I think partly it's because we already know about we know Twitter we understand that and it's like a Twitter done, right? I  I do disagree with you Ben. I don't think Twitter has a history a future. I think it's over. I think I think

Transcript:  Oh, that's like nice and that's a nice spicy take. I I mean look I I did the Twitter is the next gab  How about that I  Do disagree but it's it depends the way that Elon  Responds and I think Elon is competitive.

Transcript:  There's look look look  I'm gonna try to give some credit even though like overall like I like embrace threads because I was unhappy with the way  Like there are things he did like being able to see the number of impressions on a tweet that were good moves that did  help engagement and I posted the exact same thing on both threads and on Twitter, of course, this is a weekend and  My Twitter went super viral. My threads was like minorly viral  and so there's a bunch of people who aren't gonna change behavior and it's really hard for them to change behavior and they're not gonna  Go and do it or they don't trust meta  So I think there is a world for both now does do I think that threads will be bigger than Twitter?  Yeah, I do. I think that's what will happen. But I do think that there is a war like Elon's too  Proud to give up like that. He's not gonna go and shut it down  Like I just can't imagine Twitter going away at least in the next ten years. I'd have to take I  Don't know you'd have to burn all the servers, which I guess is not out of the question

I mean I guess I'm on it what the numbers will be  I guess I'm on grandpa's med has got the mind shit Facebook has a mind share and I say this is as somebody old enough  to be a grandpa, but  Twitter's mind sure was all with the kind of didgeridoo  You feel politicians too, yeah, no, that's true, but I know politician wants no no  Non-right-wing politician wants to be on Twitter anymore, right? It's become a it's even for the right  Which isn't gonna bode well and you don't get those people back AOC is not gonna come.

Transcript:  One thing here that we are also still forgetting which is threads is still mostly us  It's not even available the EU and when that happens  It may never be a available the you because of privacy concerns and and if it is not available the EU for some reason  Then Twitter still does absolutely have a future. That's a good look  They're gonna figure it out threads will be there at some point. They will figure it out. It's just gonna happen  But in the interim, you know Twitter like there's reasons why Twitter will still be around and even if it's just internationally in certain countries  Twitter is just immensely popular in places like Japan and who knows like if threads will become popular in a place like Japan  I don't know enough for the numbers.

Transcript:  We used to have a pretty good relationship with Tesla and and Elon as well and  we wrote something about when they put out the  hardware 2.5 so  That's just going in the weeds a little bit Tesla's had  When when the model 3 came out the hardware for like self-driving was 2.5, right?  And when that model 3 was launched Elon and Tesla even wrote a blog post about it said  Every car we build from now on is going to be capable of full self-driving  Well, you know, obviously that didn't come true. But in the in the interim  Tesla released a  3.0 version of the hardware that everybody was getting and actually did full self-driving a little bit like that  You know the beta stuff that you know, you only crashed every 30 minutes or whatever. So  We wrote a story saying hey, you know Tesla promised this in  2018 said every car being built from now on is gonna have full self, you know the Cape hardware capable of doing full self-driving  what are you gonna do about it because  that was you know, that was what you said and  that that day  Elon blocked electric blocked the wrong writer, but  one of the writers of electric and  Never like we were like persona non grata.

I said that  Wired magazine says  Today why we don't recommend ring cameras  Kind of a big deal wire does testing kind of like the wire cutter and everybody else  They say well, yeah ring cameras from Amazon are affordable and ubiquitous but  We don't think homeowners should be able to act as vigilantes  Yikes  When you set up a ring camera says wired you automatically are enrolled in your in their neighbors service  You can't turn it off. But of course  It's the default so nobody does  Neighbors, which is a standalone app shows you activity from all nearby  ring camera owners  and  And a safety report that shows how many calls for  Safety services were made in the past week in your neighborhood  It also allows you as a ring owner to send videos you've captured with your doorbell  to law enforcement  Um, and they say hold on hold on there that's turning everybody into vigilantes  We believe this feature should not exist  Uh because of course, uh, the biggest problem is it increases the possibility of racial profiling  Makes it easier for both private citizens and law enforcement to target certain groups  For suspicion of crime based on skin color ethnicity religion or country of origin  Thoughts  Ring says we do it because our customers love it and they're probably right.

I mean it just seems like it's a problem  It is a people problem  People are terrible, but it's it's like  People just people are people right like they're you know, whether they have the ring camera or not.

Transcript:  So I have a google one. Um  Just because we have you know a bunch of google stuff  Um, I so I think the problem here is that it defaults to  Sending video to the cops, right?  Because we know like for instance, I was told  That if the default on your license was organ donor and not not organ donor  That we wouldn't have any organ donor problems because everybody would just be like, whatever they do the default. Yeah, right  So the default is a big deal like, you know the default web browser on a phone or a default search engine  That's that is, you know the search engine  So I think ring could probably say hey look, let's just not make the default or during this setup. You can choose one or the other  um  But you know, I think the default people know that everybody's going to be sending their video to the cops  Um, maybe cops in some certain areas aren't you know, the the the best uh civil rights, uh people  uh, so  you know, I understand like why it's concerned that  A lot of cops are going to probably get a lot of footage that maybe they shouldn't have the right to have by default  so  the easy fix is ring could just say, you know during a setup to say  Send it to the cops. Don't send it to the cops

What is he doing? What is going on?

Hey you kids get away from there  uh  Among other things, uh, it does face recognition  It's uh, it starts to notice  Sometimes when kids gather and when certain kids gather maybe that's a  I think some of this is a response to all the school shootings, right?  In andy sanchez who does sales  For the robots distributor in north america team first technologies  Says in the case of an active shooter the robot could alert the security team  It could move toward the intruder and transmit video footage that informs the officer's course of action. It's not armed  But it can confront intruders  And human security team members would be able to speak to the intruder through the robot's communication system  Uh, they did have they turned them off weapon detection features  Uh, it does not have face recognition I should clarify that  uh, and the high school  maintains control of the footage it doesn't go back to the  home office  The robot according to the journal has not yet detected intruders on campus  But it has alerted the security team to new workers entering the school's construction site  individuals attempting to open locked doors  In harmless attempts to enter buildings, I might add it's good. It's not armed  Its cameras have also caught faculty members waving  And students making peace signs in passing  One student said, uh  I don't think the robot will change our behavior. It'll just be funnier just different  And a drama teacher says I already feel safer  Oh, no, i'm sorry.

Yeah, right  so it's it's it's the form factor that like  Gets people and that like maybe you could turn it into a puppy. I don't know  uh  But it's gonna it'll be tested more and more. Um, and it'll get more and more sophisticated  It'll get cheaper and cheaper, but to be widespread adoption feels  decades away  uh  if ever because like the other pieces like  Robot can't solve some of the human problems  That people have so interesting supplement interesting experiment  Biggest one is it's a sad indictment of the state of american safety in american schools.

I I don't we're kind of distant from san francisco. I did see I was in the city yesterday  I did see quite a few  Uh waymos and uh and cruises and they do see but see if you just put a cone  It's  Just find a traffic cone they're all all over the place of course, but don't take it from anywhere important  Then gently they say place it on the hood  And uh, you know as long as there's nobody in the car, obviously if there's a safety driver  He'll come and take it off the hood. But if if it's just driving by itself

I guess they were training on the hills  Would we just were all over the place then there are people who live in san francisco on cul-de-sacs  And because the cruise vehicles  follow traffic laws  You know any any any human will just go, okay  I am turning left here because i'm not going down that cul-de-sac  But these vehicles go down the cul-de-sac make a u-turn and then come back out so they don't make a left turn  They only make right turns and it and they've been lined up in the cul-de-sac  Like dozens of them making this this crazy turn. I think they must have fixed that because I haven't heard about that in a while  but  Yeah, they're not it's not merely that oh the it creeps me out  They can cause problems

They're just  They're there's more of them at night. I just see them all the time and yeah thing. I keep thinking is like  When are they going to have these in other cities, right? Like how how hard is it to bring this now to like every major?  metropolitan area and I think that's  The fact that it hasn't happened yet is like it's either because they're worried, you know  That there's going to be some safety issue, you know and something bad's going to happen and just going to shut the whole thing down or  You know, they've like those little edge cases in san francisco  Are in every single city and they're different and so it's just going to be so difficult to  To scale this, you know to to other places

Speaker: Ben Parr
Transcript:  Oh  I'm sure in some cities there are some because of very unique circumstances  Like snow is probably a very unique circumstance  Note all the cities we talked about austin others are not usually snow cities. They are warm cities that don't have a lot of snow  Snow is your biggest problem where like cuts off all the lines and things

You can still see the lines like it can detect right like in three to sixty degrees  It's when snow completely covers  Uh like the middle lines and the sidelines and like humans can kind of understand  Where like the edge of the road is by feel right? Uh, the machines  You know, that's just a much harder problem  So when you start seeing self-driving cars in the middle of winter in the twin cities, that's what you know

Transcript:  The technology has done it right and I talked to someone at cruise. Okay, go ahead. No, no  I I was just gonna say I talked to someone at cruise about it the other day and it was like  I I think the message was  you know  Don't underestimate how difficult it was to to make it work in san francisco and you know how long that took  and sort of  How bespoke it is I guess?  um, and I I think I think that's an it'll be interesting to see  um  Because nobody wants to like  None of these companies want to just invest  All that manpower in every single city like they want to they want to figure out how to make it turnkey

Start time: 4321.54
End time: 4334.86
Speaker: Leo Laporte

It's going to be turnkey

It's probably bad for although  Uh, I I think about we were talking about this, uh earlier  I think about what happened in new york city when uber took over it didn't get rid of cab drivers. It just  Meant there were far more cars in the street  And and it was worse for everybody except  I guess it was probably was good for subway use  Uh, we got really gridlocked for a while because of all the ubers on the city streets  Uh gizmodo, uh  another publication are you do you uh, do any of your  Publications seth use ai to write articles

We have no plans to do anything like that  Um, we know that some of our competitors are doing it. Um, you know red ventures and cnet have they love it

Transcript:  Uh, like we had connie gregiamo on uh, right after that came out and she said well, these are articles  No human wants to write they were in the personal finance section  Basic stuff that no person wants to write so we have the ai write it and then we have an editor check it  Uh, but what did come out later was there were some real concerns about accuracy  Yeah, there were big big mistakes. Yeah, so here's the story, uh from the washington post about  An ai written star wars story  At gizmodo  Now one group you don't mess with  Is star wars nerds, right?  uh  A few hours the story goes after james witbrook clocked into work at gizmodo on wednesday. He got a note from his editor in chief  Within 12 hours the company would roll out articles written by artificial intelligence  Ten minutes later a story by quote gizmodo bot end quote post on the site about a chronological order of star wars  movies and tv shows  Whitbrook who is a star wars fan and writes about sci-fi among other things at gizmodo said he cataloged 18  Concerns corrections and comments about the story in an email to the editor in chief  Noting for instance that the bot put the star wars tv series the clone wars in the wrong order  Emitted any mention of and or  in fact completely, uh  And the 2008 film entitled star wars the clone wars inaccurately formatted movie titles and the story's headline had repetitive descriptions and contained  No explicit this is the biggest problem in my opinion explicit disclaimer that was written by ai  Um the story was error riddled and more importantly to the staffers actively hurt our reputation and credibility  They used google bard and chat gpt to write it red ventures has its own  wordsmith ai to write its articles  Whitbrook said I had never had to deal with this basic level of incompetence with any of the colleagues that i've ever worked with  That's the biggest thing that i've ever worked with  If these chat bots can't even do something as basic as put a star wars movie in order one after the other  I don't think you can report it use it to report on anything else. I think it's got a point  I mean that's a factual matter  Um  You cover ai  Can you defend gizmodo ben or was this just an inappropriate use of it?

Start time: 4616.44
End time: 4747.12
Speaker: Ben Parr
Transcript:  Uh, it's a bad use of it because there are much better uses and look look like  Uh, I thought a lot about ai and journalism, uh kind of over the short and long term. There's this great  Report from before chat gpt came out by the ap showing where ai is already being used for certain things  So, uh, and so i'll give you my general stance, which is like, uh, we're already seeing ai being used for  The really like straightforward stuff like if you're reporting on a local sports game  Like the format is straightforward put in the numbers, you know, there's names of players  Those things are already automated a lot by ai and it's in part because there are no local reporters to report on those things anymore  Right, which is unfortunate, but the reality and so there's a whole world of that  Uh, but we're definitely going to see more of it and like it's in its infancy  But it is also the worst it will ever be and so  We're going to see more experiments like this. This is a not a good experiment because they didn't have the support of the staff they  Uh didn't do any fact checking out which you must do with ai  The ai's of today don't fact check. They're not that smart  But there's definitely like but this is why the writers for example are striking in hollywood right now  Because the future could very well be that more newsrooms do use more ai  My i'm going to plug my fiancee deborah because she wrote a play was why was and sonoma last year her play last year  Called atlas the lonely gibbon was about two journalists one of whom lost their job to ai and the other was desperately trying to keep his job  Uh, he was a cyber security reporter in this play  And it like that is kind of what the real like it's that's kind of what the reality is going to be  I think down the line for certain types of reporters the types that are going to have jobs long term  Are the ones who are doing investigative journalism because  The ai cannot do that cannot make the phone calls  And those who are like on the fourth in terms of columns and opinion because ai's don't have strong or good opinions  and it's not going to be some immediate change or like half the jobs are going to be gone, but  More of this experimentation is going to come just because the economic incentives are unfortunately there

Transcript:  Yeah, it's just good at certain things and the you you can get it to a point where it'll do that  Not in chat gpt  You're gonna have to like build your own side thing like my co-founder matt and I built our own  Like side stuff just to like do very specific ai things for our company and for ourselves  That's the only way we could get it to do those things  It's just a lot of tweaking to make it work for very specific use cases  But ai is not yet at the point where you could just be like fix this and it fixes it like a human would  That's what it has to get to  It but it will at some point. I do believe I just don't know  the time frame but  Some point but it will not be making the phone calls building human relationships  Uh sourcing reporting out of google or tesla or meta or  The u.s. Government and that's where we need more reporters focusing more of their time. Anyway, actually and we need those local reporters

Transcript:  Yeah, we need those. Yeah, and there's no money for those  uh, it strikes me actually the  Ai might be a good reporter. We I was playing with a friend  Yesterday, uh was a former facebook engineer  Here we were we're having a conversation the three of us and he put a little recorder on the table  And he said watch this and he had it set up so that the recording would automatically go to dropbox  Where whisper ai would turn it into a transcription?  And then chat gpt would take the transcription and return  notes  On the conversation and action items on the conversation exactly the notes would be the kind of thing a reporter would do on a you know listening  Uh, and the action item is the kind of thing you might do in a business meeting and it was really it was quite good  It was almost instantaneous  We finished the conversation and he said okay now here's the notes then it was actually really good  at picking up, uh  You know tidbits, I guess there's a lot of judgment  For a reporter on what to keep track of so maybe it would lack that  But it might save some time on that end. Maybe it's better on that end than on the writing end

Transcript:  Well any profession you should be you should be trying to figure out how to use these tools, right?  Yes, because that's right. I mean that's right. You're gonna fall behind and we've we've been using like you said then like we've been  Using ai for a long time if you define it that way, right?  It's really machine learning but like I remember I mean when I was at the washington post like I trained an algorithm to scan  Apps in the you know tapped into the api that you could scan um app store reviews  And we were trying to find like certain  Oh, that's interesting certain types of content. Huh, and it works, you know works incredibly well  It's a powerful tool and all these large language models will be  Very powerful as as well. I when you're talking about it being a good reporter  It kind of makes me think how like a lot of there's like the linkedin era sort of journalist and  There's the strategy of just basically linkedin messaging like every single person who could possibly give you information  Like that actually very good at that  Yeah, I mean and then the people who respond the one out of whatever 20 people who respond like you just  You know you then you start talking with them. Do you identify yourself as an ai?

Transcript:  There's already companies  Automating using ai to automate like all their outbound email. I know it's happening to success for some  There's all sorts of crazy stuff happening  Like, you know superhuman the email app now has like ai feature  I have it you click a button and it like will write your range from your random thoughts into a pretty yeah  into a decent email, so it's like  Like you have to just expect that what a quarter of the emails you write or at least  50 percent quarter percent at some percentage written by ai  Uh a whole different topic of once like most everything is just written by ai is talking to other ai's

I thought this would be a great thing to do with all our podcasts  We don't have the manpower to do nobody would lose a job because we don't have the manpower  To have somebody take really thorough show notes and publish them  But if an ai could do that quickly and easily and basically for free  That would be a huge benefit to listeners  made me think

Transcript:  Here's I think go ahead. I think I think one thing that  Like it's it's kind of scary is like what does  In a world look like you know publishing world look like  When every single publisher has access to a you know, fairly good ai  so  We could publish 750 articles on you know, the new iphone  in a second  and you know all of our competitors could do that and  500 blogs and publications that we don't even know about could do the same thing  So then all of a sudden you have a glut of content that all kind of looks and acts, you know, very generic and very  Similar theoretically  That's not going to be good for anyone like  Who's going to want that like google certainly doesn't want that like google would become useless at that point because  Anybody who's doing original reporting is going to be buried under 700  Different ai is doing, you know  Like large language model reporting  so I think the human piece  Is going to be more and more important as you know  That's the senes of the world go in and just you know lay off their writers and and build up an ai

Speaker: Reed Albergotti
Transcript:  Here's I think I think that what you're saying is true. It's true, but I think  to me the natural conclusion there is like people are just going to crave places like the information right that have  You know, it's a paywall, but it's differentiated content that you know is going to be high quality  You know, I I worked at the information for four years so full disclosure, but  I think it's great  But I you know, isn't that what's going to happen?  Like like I think you're right google's, you know  If the internet's just flooded with this stuff like google's going to be in trouble  But it kind of it's kind of been moving in that direction anyway, and like for sure ai is just going to like finish the job

Transcript:  I mean look we're ending in a world of lots of behavior change right now  there's a lot of articles about how gen z their first instinct is not to  Uh go and search on google. It's to go on tiktok and search and like you know  That's going to be made by a person for the most part. Although that might not be true to a couple years  Uh, but you can go and like find travel tips on all sorts of things and that's like how they find their information  Now you have a chat gpt and all sorts of things and then you have a generation where  I wrote about this on benpar.com how the new generation is  Uh solving their education problems like trying to solve a complex like how do I solve this math problem instead of going asking a student  Or googling they just ask chat gpt  And it's really good at that sort of thing giving you an explanation of the step by step of what you should be doing  And so just dramatic behavior change happens and I think the reality is that  Long term we are probably entering an era where the google search  Uh will be on a very very slow decline and this is an existential crisis for google  That's why they rallied so much. That's why they're investing in bard  um, and it's not going to happen overnight, but it's  Yeah, the behavior change i'm already changing my behavior. I just google results are less useful for me than they used to be  and results from uh ai's and results from tiktok and  Other places are much more useful to me. Yeah

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean  It was really interesting. I was in I was in london  And meeting with a bunch of ai companies there, which is you know, if you don't know london's like a big  a big hot spot for ai. It's where deep mind  now google deep mind  started  and I met with this sort of  interesting company that I you know, I think few people have heard of called causal lens. Maybe you've heard of it then but  uh  It was a really interesting conversation about what they're doing which is like very different from these large language models. They're  They're trying to tell you know companies  um  You know predict like predictive analytics, but then like give them suggestions with these sort of frontier  Kind of cutting edge ai algorithms that determine cause and effect relationships  and that's something that um large language models cannot do right now, right and that's  To you know the stuff we were talking about earlier, you know  it gets all these things wrong and that's because really what it's doing is just sort of  Trying to predict what the next word should be based on billions  Of other words that it's scraped from the internet, right? It's it's kind of a you know in that sense. It's not very intelligent  um, and and if you  This idea and it's sort of a science fiction kind of idea at this point, but like if you could somehow  combine  Causal ai where like, you know algorithms understand can sort of you know grasp  And the grasp is the wrong term right because these are not brains. These are just math problems  But you know math problems that can determine  um  Cause and effect relationships you combine that with large language models  You get something that is is much more powerful than than anything we have today. So  Give me an example of how that would be used  Well, I mean right like basically, I mean what they're doing right now is  Actually the founder of causal and had this great this great example. It was like an analogy but um  sort of made-up example, but like you know, if you go to like, uh, you know bondi beach in sydney and you look at ice cream  sales and shark attacks  Those two statistics are correlated right like when ice cream sales go up  shark attacks go up  obviously, they have nothing to do with one another but  You know, there are more people in the water in the summer when it's hot and they're buying ice cream so they get you know  But if you run sort of traditional  Predictive analytics it might not figure out that that that correlation is completely unrelated  With you know causal ai you can sort of say, okay  You know  When should I increase, you know, you know buy more ice cream for the ice cream truck and it will  It will understand. Um  You know that it has nothing to do with shark attacks, right and it will and that and therefore will apply like anywhere  um  Not just in sydney, right? We often where they're even we often make that mistake

Start time: 5873.38
End time: 5890.16
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, I we often have to say, you know correlation does not equal causation  But when it comes to I mean people make that mistake all the time when it comes to diet  And all sorts of things they they go. Oh, there's a correlation there. It must be the cause  So you're saying this ai is smart enough to know the difference

Transcript:  Right, so they had a customer. I thought this is an interesting anecdote. They they had one customer  um where they  They were trying to figure out why there was all this churn like why customers were were leaving right after  They their usage went up. It was a sass company. So they they'd start using the product more and then they would leave  That's not good. They were like, well, how do we like how do we sort of solve this problem?  Like we we can predict when people are leaving but we don't really understand why we don't really know what to do about it  and it turned out that they were  They ran these numbers and turned out that they were um giving people like free  That their their own algorithms the company's existing algorithms were predicting people would churn and then they would automatically get these like  Free credit. Oh, they were causing the churn  So they were sort of yeah, they were predicting the churn  But then they they had this number it turned out to be completely unrelated like it had nothing to do with  interesting what they were, you know trying to solve and the and the  the the solution which you know came out in these algorithms was that  Actually, you know, maybe they should offer some other you know  Some other solution that the free credits were not working  Like, you know give them a phone call and there was another one with a bank where they were trying to figure out  It was kind of the same thing like how do we not lose customers?  and it turned out that some of the customers that they were called they would like call these people  And try to like touch base with customers and it turned out that that actually was causing people to leave  I was chasing them. There's like this  there's like certain there's a certain customer that like  If you call them, they will actually like they'll think about it and they'll leave but if you just do nothing  Yeah, and they'll just they won't forget it or that I don't know for a reason don't remind them

Transcript:  So they saved this bank like 250. So the I mean those are some examples  but I think that that what's fascinating about it is that it's this idea that like I mean  Understanding cause and effect is like a it's an essential part of intelligence, right?  And if we do want to get I don't think that we're going to get to a gi  As we sort of been joking about on the shit like I don't think I don't think we're getting there  But if we do want to make these  Tools much more powerful and and much more, you know  I guess trustworthy useful  Um, there are gonna have to be breakthroughs and I don't think it's just gonna be  You know large language models getting bigger and bigger. I think it's gonna be other areas of you know  artificial intelligence where there are breakthroughs  And those things sort of combining I agree

Start time: 6054.56

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think that's the risk of the success of chat gpt and large language models is that people will then focus on these  instead of trying to be think of more appropriate and better use of more useful ways  To use ai than than the ones that everybody's all excited about, you know  There is a big risk. I think in that and or worrying so much about  You know existential  Hazards to humans  That you miss the fact that they I love this they they call these you have this in your interview. They called the  The customers who were just kind of happily paying for something sleeping dogs  And you don't want to wake the sleeping dogs up with a call saying  How do you like our service because well better let sleeping dogs lie, right? You know, I think it's actually very clever  But it's that's that's something I mean, I really believe in the use of ai for analysis of existing data sets  You don't get the hallucinations  Ben you must I presume you're going to be looking at this and I I hope we look at it  We're going to do an ai show in the club  With jason and jeff jarvis. I hope you'll be looking at this too though these other kind of non llm  Uses of ai. I think some of them are even more interesting, but they're more narrow so they don't have the broad general appeal

Transcript:  Uh generative ai is just one subset like one approach  uh and large language models just one approach of  using deep learning and machine learning which is like like I I'd have to like put up like the graph because you have like  ai is this weird umbrella term for all these different terms for machine learning neural networks those sorts of things  And then you have like, you know machine learning neural networks within it deep learning within it  And one piece of that is the generative ai slash large language models is a subset of that  And they're very good at a very specific thing and like I can go into the explanation of embeddings because I just find it fascinating  But at the end of the day, it's just a predictive technology to predict the next most likely word and it doesn't really well  Uh, but that is not enough of an approach to approximate a human for example, the hei discussion  You have to have other types of learning  Uh causal ai is one example of that  Um, and as you know generative ai has lots of weaknesses. It's not very good  At doing math it was not made for that for example, and so  It can guess a number but it's not doing actual computation, but there's other ai systems that actually can and causal ai  Uh can actually like find cause relationship in a way that generative ai can't so at some point like  If you think of a human as just a bunch of ai is like a bunch of uh, the i's and ai's put together  you know, there's like 170 of them or some ridiculous number inside of our brains and  Generative like the ability to predict the next most likely word is probably one 170th of human  capacity and potential so  We need more of those. It's that the causal is very interesting in particular, but I think we'll see more  Uh fields of ai start to pop up  As we hit the limits of what you can do with the large language model

Transcript:  I put this in the show notes and it's really too much to ask anybody to read and it's certainly far too much for me to  comment on on the show, but I encourage uh our listeners to read it. It's from  An engineer at deep mind in uh in london jendong wang  Uh, he posted uh last month why transformative ai  Is really really hard to achieve  And he also he's saying the same thing in a way he's saying people are very optimistic that uh,  that ai is a kind of a different category of innovation that it that it's uh, it's it's going to transform  Things in a way that other great inventions  didn't and he cautions people that  probably  ai will be transformative in the same way say the internet was or the industrial revolution, but he said  Uh transforming transformative ai is very difficult. He brings up three arguments  Uh, why one is that the transformational potential of ai is constrained by its hardest problems  He quotes a well-known  aphorism  From uh, it's called more of x paradox. Steven pinker wrote about it in 1994  The main lessons of 35 years of ai research is the hard problems are easy  And the easy problems are hard  and I think we've we're already seeing that with but with self-driving vehicles and  Uh handwriting recognition face recognition. He also says despite rapid progress in some ai subfields major  technical hurdles remain  And finally, and this is I thought the most interesting even if technical ai progress continues  Social and economic hurdles not technical hurdles, but social and economic hurdles may limit its impact  And he uses as an example  uh  how the industrial revolution  has  You know technology has reduced the price of a huge number of goods and services new cars household furnishings clothing  cell phones computer software toys and tvs  but  it hasn't had an overall impact on inflation because  non  non-technology supported  Products like hospital services college tuition medical care  Food and beverages housing have gone up  commensurately  So there's this kind of perverse  Cycle that happens, uh that yeah your ai is bringing down the cost of these things  But it's bringing up because it's not solving heart other problems is bringing up the costs of those things  So really good article. I don't we don't need to debate it. But um,  I thought i'd put it in people's  Tray in tray inbox to look at I thought was quite good and given its uh author  As a deep mind engineer is obviously deeply involved in this  Very provocative. He has a good picture too of king charles operating the london  tube  And he points out that uh train drivers are paid close to twice the national median in in london  Even though the technology to replace them wholly has existed for decades  Even king charles can drive one of these  but uh, you know, it could easily be automated but it hasn't for a variety of uh,  social reasons and other reasons

Even though I use it every day in the newsletter. It's just  It's just like it's not intelligence. It's automation and right  like I think ben the one thing I disagreed with what you said was like that the brain is like, you know all these different algorithms put  together because I just  I don't think we have any idea how the human brain works and  I and and yet all these ai  technologies so or automation technologies are like named after the human brain like neural nets and you read it all the time like  Neural nets are like it's it's a architecture based on how the human brain works and it's like it's really not I mean it has

Transcript:  I'm trying to talk to all the smart people I know and I don't know a lot of smart people  And that's one of the questions that I have and there really are two answers to this  I mean, you know people like  Uh ray curse while who say the singularity is near who really does believe that an artificial  general intelligence will be he defines a singularity as  Indistinguishable from humans so that we won't really know if it's a human  It's not merely the Turing test, but they will literally be  You know human so human like that. We won't know the difference. I said, but they're not human, right?  He said but it doesn't matter if you can't tell  the difference  Uh, and of course the real threat there is once they become  Uh that adept then they can design themselves and their acceleration  And advancement of a and I think this is what this whole you know threat to humanity is  Become so fast that we don't you know, just they exceed us by by such a great margin so quickly that we're just little worms to them  Uh, I think there's a and and this is really what it comes down to i'm curious what you all think  I think there is a gap and i'm  I'm not a religious person and i'm not talking about the soul, but I think there's a gap  between the most that you can do with a kind of a von neumann machine with  uh a mechanized intelligence  There's a gap between that and what we do as humans  Now some some of my friends steve gibson our security guy says no no  Consciousness is an emergent property. You just have to get the intelligent machines fast enough  Give them enough ram and they will be conscious. They'll be indistinguishable. We're just machines in other words  I am not religious, but I don't  I don't feel like that's true. Where do you what?  What do you think of that? I mean, let me ask you seth. I don't think it's true. You don't think it's true  Reid says no

Transcript:  Yes now I will point out that and this is from scientific america a 25 year old bet about consciousness  Has finally been settled a brain scientist and a philosopher 25 years ago made a bet  the uh,  The the brain this was at an event called toward a scientific basis for consciousness  Christoph cock was the neuroscientist david chalmers was the philosopher  The neuroscientist  believed  You know that it's that consciousness was an emergent  Property and that we would crack he said we scientists would crack consciousness  By discovering its neural underpinnings  Or correlates by now  Uh, the philosopher said  Neither 40 hertz oscillations or any other strictly physical process could account for conscious  sensations  And that consciousness was was not something we would solve he won obviously we don't know what here we are 25 years later  We are no closer to understanding consciousness than we were 25 years ago in 1994  Uh, so so actually, uh  cock paid paid that wager

If you if the language you're using to describe your field is like neural nets and you know, all this brain related  They painted themselves into that corner. Yeah  Yeah, I think you start to you start to believe  That you're creating consciousness and that's like it's a very powerful thing and it's very emotional and I think  But like if you look at the way this technology actually works, it's like it's so clearly  Not it's mechanistic, you know headed in that.

Everything's a subscription including microsoft office  Um had they done it, you know recently it might have not been in such a negative  But I think it really hurt them back when they did it.

I like obsidian  I've been using a free open source product called log seek now for a while lo g. Seq. It's fantastic  And it's free  um  There's so many good choices out there and it's come along with this idea of the of the personal knowledge management system pkms  And a lot of people students it started with you know college kids, but a lot of people now are starting to adopt these systems  Uh like zettelkasten which ties your thoughts together  In such a way that you can have you know  You can have take notes on what you're learning and then create new ideas based on the synergy of all these notes  Uh, it's a really interesting  Model these days and I think evernote which really was the first  I mean one note preceded it but evernote was so much better  That's kind of sad.

That's pivot to ai  ai  Uh here in the annals of uh court judgments  Last week was all about the supreme court. This is about a somewhat smaller  Court  King's bench for saskatchewan canada  A canadian farmer was sued for a breach of contract  So the story is it's all about uh flax flax, you know flax  Flax it's like a it's like a wheat thing  Grain purchasers  uh  From a company called southwest terminal. We'll call them swt  Uh wanted to buy flax  for 17 dollars a bushel  For delivery in october november or december. There's a futures contract, right?  Uh after phone calls with bob and chris actor  swt  Drafted a contract for chris  to sell 86 metric tons of flax  for 17 dollars a bushel  And deliver the flax in november  Uh, they had a real printed contract signed in ink  This is where they might have gone wrong. They sent they took a picture of it with their camera phone  It took a picture of the contract sent him the photo  With a message, please confirm flax contract  to which  the farmer responded with  the thumbs up emoji  However  By november of 2021 the price of flax went from 17 dollars to 41 dollars a bushel  farmer decided  No thumbs down  And he he did not deliver  So swt went to court and said well, wait a minute. He sent us the thumbs up and the dispute was  Does the thumbs up emoji?  Bind you to a contract  Contract  The farmer said no, no, no, it just means I got it. I got the contract and i'll let you know i'll follow up  Uh, no the court said no, no, no  That is a that is a verbal contract  What's not it's a thumbs up emoji contract. It's binding  The judge wrote i'm satisfied on the balance of probabilities that chris okayed or approved the contract  just as he had done before except this time he used a  And this is in the actual judgment the thumbs up emoji  In my opinion when considering all the circumstances that meant approval of the flax contract  Not simply that he received it and was going to think about it  A reasonable bystander knowing all of the backward come to the objective understanding that they had received reached consensus  a meaning of the minds  The judge ruled in favor of swt. Yes, you owe him 82 000 for that  Flax contract you didn't deliver on  So just be aware when you use the thumbs up that is legally binding

I mean it wasn't as big as threads, but it was pretty big a lot. It was a pretty big launch  And the whole idea pokemon go was you had to walk around like for reals  My wife has accumulated more than 11 000 kilometers  Searching for pokemon walking around  Uh, and so their claim is this has been really good for people's health and I think that's probably true  I've i've walked.

Transcript:  We had a good week if you like this week in space is a good reason to join club twit  We launched this week in space if you will forgive the phrase  Uh in our club because the club, you know members supported it and it it garnered an audience  We were able to put it out in the public. That's kind of our model going forward as ad sales kind of dwindle  We really rely on you our audience to support our growth  Uh, and we need it because this month we uh, we just broke even we didn't make any money and  That's that's a tough position to be in for any company  We could keep this up, but I don't want to lose money the club twit makes all the difference and it's just seven dollars a month  Hardly anything you get access to all the shows we do including this one ad free  Tracker free, right? So you completely private  You also get access to the wonderful club twit discord, which is a place to hang with other  Club twit members. It's a great. It's a great place to be lots of animated gifts  Conversations about all the topics geeks like and special events that our community manager and prude puts together  We just had stacy's book club. He just interviewed hugh howey the author of wool the inspiration for the apple tv plus  silo series  We've got other events coming up in the in the works  The animated gifts are part of the fun you also get uh shows that we don't put out in public shows  We're launching or trying like hands on macintosh with micah sergeant hands on windows and coming soon our new ai show with jeff jarvis  Just jason howell. Uh, we're in development right now. That's because the club members support it  The the seven bucks a month makes a huge difference to us  If you're not yet a member of club twit, I implore you if you can't afford it. Don't worry  There's plenty of free stuff ads supported still but uh, the future I think  Is going to be with the club so  Get on in there go to twitter tv slash club twit  We have monthly plans annual plans family plans and corporate memberships as well  You can even give a gift of club twit, which is an awfully nice gift for the geek in your life twit tv slash  Club twit and we thank you so much for your support to all the club twit members  Uh, you're keeping us on the air and we really appreciate it  Seth it's so great to have you seth wine trubb is the founder publisher editorial director of the nine to five  Sites and of course electric which I think is the best.
