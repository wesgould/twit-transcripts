Yeah, he's up in the cabin,  but he's on LTE and no windstorms.  So thank you for joining us.  We appreciate it.  Thank you for having me.  Glad to have you back.  Tim Stevens, editor in chief of and Gadget.  Is that me making that noise?  It's back making that noise.  It's not me.  No, it's me.  It didn't fix it.

Start time: 153.74
End time: 159.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I fixed it, but it got broken again.  I can just, I can write it.  Just pop me down.  Yeah, I have.

Start time: 160.40
End time: 171.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have some chat client that we thought had silenced,  but apparently is still.  And now of course everybody in the chat room is going,  Leo, Leo, Leo, Leo.  I haven't muted.  I didn't want to hear it ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Also here, Robert Scoble.  Yay.  Nice to see you.

Start time: 171.84
End time: 178.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, thanks for having me.  In clothes.  In clothes.  Dressed.  I could take off my clothes if you want.  No, we'll talk about that in a moment.

Start time: 179.08
End time: 181.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oddly, it wasn't the first time  I'd seen a picture of you in the shower.

Start time: 181.58
End time: 187.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, there's at least three or four of them.  You and Shell did one.  Yeah, yeah.  I did one when I worked for Dave Weiner too.

Start time: 189.08
End time: 205.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is a habit.  It's a habit.  All right.  Also with us, Ryan Shroud from This Week in Computer Hardware,  Editor-in-Chief of PC Perspective at pcpurr.com.  Great to have you, Ryan.  Ryan, you and I are out in the cold  because those of you watching a video  probably already noticed two of the four panelists  are wearing glass.

Start time: 206.08
End time: 206.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I'll let you try it.

Start time: 206.96
End time: 217.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You guys are glass holes.  So this is my first chance to wear Google Glass.  So Robert, you got yours as part of the, from Google I.O.

Start time: 217.52
End time: 220.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I was one of the first in line.  So I had 107.

Start time: 221.12
End time: 231.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have 737.  I still haven't received my email,  so I'm glad to be able to try this.  And Tim, I saw your extensive review and gadget,  really a good review.  Yeah, it's really-  Thank you very much.  And that, so you got a review unit.

Start time: 232.68
End time: 238.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, actually ours is from I.O. as well.  I was the first in the 700s as well, I believe.  But yeah, that was actually  through the pre-order system as well.

Start time: 239.32
End time: 241.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, some of the press people  get moved up a little bit, but.

Start time: 242.08
End time: 253.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know, since I'm not in the press,  I probably shouldn't get any advanced.  So you put this thing on.  Okay.  And what do you see?  Now you wear glasses, Robert.  So you put it on top of your glasses?  You two do, you also do, don't you Tim or no?

Start time: 254.76
End time: 268.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't have glasses.  I'm lucky that I don't have that issue.  We've been doing quite a bit of testing  to see what frames are working, what frames don't.  If you don't have frames that are kind of square  or that are kind of blocky around the upper edges,  it will usually fit pretty well.  But anything that's got like a squarish frame  will probably have some issues.

Start time: 269.02
End time: 271.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I actually got my eyes checked and went  and got contacts as well.

Start time: 272.40
End time: 282.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm wearing contacts right now.  So in fact, I'm wearing,  I have what they call mono vision.  So my left eye is for reading  and my right eye is for distance.  That's the right way to have it.

Start time: 282.24
End time: 297.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the right way you'd want this for distance.  If you can see a billboard on the freeway  with your right eye, you're ready for glass.  Then this is the one I want, okay.  Now my friend like Thomas Huck is blind in his right eye  and he can't use glass.  They don't make any left handed glass?  No, and I thought they were working on one,  but they corrected me and said, no, no, no, no.

Start time: 298.16
End time: 309.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The thing that should be,  I think we should say right up front  is this is a developer preview.  Google's always said that,  but people are treating it as if it's a product  about to be released.  Well, eight months from now maybe.  Yeah, maybe 2014.

Start time: 311.26
End time: 314.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It will be 2014.  They've said that now.  They've said that now  that it won't be this year.

Start time: 314.82
End time: 327.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, because Eric said it would be,  at first they were saying it would be this year,  but now they're saying not.  So right now I'm looking and I don't,  there's a piece of plastic in front of my right eye.  I don't see anything.  I'm seeing right through it,  although it's not exactly clear,  but I can see through it.

Start time: 327.48
End time: 332.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, when they adjust it,  you're not supposed to be looking through it.  You're supposed to look under it?  Yeah.

Start time: 332.88
End time: 337.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So then I'm supposed to look up to look at the, okay.  And is it off or is?  It's off right now.

Start time: 337.76
End time: 346.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But that's the first misconception I had about glass  was that it would stay on all the time.  It doesn't.  It doesn't, because it eats battery.  Anytime that projector comes on,  it's really eating a little bit of battery.

Start time: 347.24
End time: 350.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's one thing you noted, Tim,  you guys were reporting about what?  Three and a half hours battery life.

Start time: 351.64
End time: 367.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We saw about five in kind of light usage,  taking pictures, doing some searches.  If you're doing actual video recording or a lot of that,  or a lot of hangouts or navigation,  you can easily kill this in well under two hours.  If you're doing solid video recording,  it's somewhere between 30 and 60 minutes actually.  So it's pretty limited at this point.  But again, like you said,

Start time: 367.96
End time: 370.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that's what Scoble said.  He said, I can kill it in an hour easy.

Start time: 370.76
End time: 383.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  While we're talking about the developer edition,  the final shipping product will look different than this.  It'll be snappable to a custom set of frames  that they're gonna sell.  The rumor was Warby Parker, is that true?

Start time: 383.42
End time: 387.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a rumor.  Just a rumor.  I don't know.  We should mention, Robert, you're writing a book about glass.

Start time: 388.20
End time: 394.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I'm writing a book about context,  the age of context, which includes wearable computers,  glass and Pebble watches and stuff.

Start time: 395.12
End time: 405.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Okay, so how do I turn this on?  So there's two ways to turn it on.  By the way, it's in your peripheral vision always.  You cannot, even if it's above it,  I can kind of see there's something there.

Start time: 405.52
End time: 420.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  So there's two ways to turn on.  You can just tap the side  because the entire side is a touch sensitive pad, I guess.  And then you can scroll through.  All right, so now I see.  Actually, let me do something  because I can show the audience what you're seeing.

Start time: 420.96
End time: 430.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What I'm seeing, all right.  So I'm seeing the time and I'm seeing in quotes,  okay, glass, which is what you're,  oh, in fact, I said it and so now it's there.  Anytime you see that screen.  Careful what you say now, Larry.

Start time: 430.32
End time: 432.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me pull up the screen  so people can see what's going on here.

Start time: 433.62
End time: 443.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And now it's saying I can choose from a variety of menus.  We're gonna show you the menu I'm seeing.  It dims right away.  It's obviously really trying to save its battery life.  Yeah, see, it's off right now.  Let me do it again.

Start time: 444.00
End time: 445.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me touch it on the side, yeah.

Start time: 446.72
End time: 462.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It doesn't come right on.  No, you tap it.  Okay, that's what I'm seeing.  Okay, glass.  Actually tilt it this way so they,  I see.  You can see it, yeah.  Maybe get it closer to my head.  Can I do that?  Can you pan down?

Start time: 462.06
End time: 466.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pull back a little bit.  It's so convenient, isn't it?  Yeah, okay, well this is,

Start time: 466.40
End time: 482.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so is this the Glass Explorer app you're running on here?  Yeah.  So it's showing what I'm seeing.  A remix of old sex Ed films play.  I wish it was that good.  How come I'm seeing, this is a search for that?

Start time: 483.18
End time: 490.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because you said okay, glass,  and then you said Google,  and then you said a bunch of stuff  that it converted into that.  Okay, glass.  Okay, let's try it again.

Start time: 490.32
End time: 502.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Robert, you actually have,  if you can see that box in the corner,  can you reach for,  Put that there.  See that box?  No, no, it's right there, right there by your hand.  Your other hand.  What?

Start time: 502.66
End time: 512.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See where my finger is wiggling?  Right here?  There you go.  I'm wearing glass, dude.  Thank you.  Okay.  Got it, okay.  Okay, glass.  I'm like, what box?  What are you trying to,  what are you trying to do?

Start time: 512.32
End time: 512.91
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm trying to get the picture.

Start time: 515.06
End time: 521.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it does it immediately,  and that's the picture it took.  Yeah.  Now, if I were gonna, okay, so now what?

Start time: 521.78
End time: 528.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So let me just show you the UI first.  Yeah, what?  So, just keep it up there.  Okay.  I'm pretty good.  So on this side.

Start time: 528.14
End time: 529.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you're just sliding through the stuff.

Start time: 529.52
End time: 535.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  On this side, you get to see all the stuff I've done,  or emails that have come in.  Hopefully, I don't have it.

Start time: 535.16
End time: 536.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was an email I just saw.

Start time: 536.36
End time: 539.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Video.  Settings.  Okay.

Start time: 540.76
End time: 545.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sorry.  It went.  Temperature and the pedal.  On this side.  This is Google Now cards.

Start time: 545.22
End time: 551.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, so on one side is Google Now cards,  which includes my stocks, my calendar.  There's your calendar.

Start time: 553.22
End time: 561.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Others, other way.  There's the Giants game, the Giants won.  That's good news.  Yeah.  And there's a picture I just took.  So that's interesting.  So now I'm back in the middle,  which is the comments.

Start time: 561.78
End time: 584.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's the cool part of this thing.  When you, like when I walked into the airport last Friday,  it told me my gate number and my ticket.  It knew.  It knew because it's.  Does it pop that up, or does it,  You just scroll through it.  It'll chime at you that there's some new information.  You just scroll through it.  And it really is useful from that.  The remote control is laggy,  so this is not how it looks in the glass  when you're not.

Start time: 584.66
End time: 586.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's pretty responsive.

Start time: 586.92
End time: 593.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Robert, question for you.  Is this, how much more useful is this  than just having Google Now on my Android phone,  where I have these same.  Recorded video.

Start time: 594.02
End time: 607.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, for me, it's really useful  if you're dragging two suitcases through the airport  because you can see something without using your hands.  And for photography, this is.  Mine.

Start time: 607.72
End time: 608.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  10 seconds is the max on the video.

Start time: 608.98
End time: 611.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can extend it, but yeah, 10 seconds is the default.

Start time: 612.86
End time: 614.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then I can play it back by sliding over to it.

Start time: 615.26
End time: 615.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Start time: 616.62
End time: 617.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's recording audio as well as video.

Start time: 618.14
End time: 628.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a speaker in the back.  There's a microphone up here.  There's a front-facing camera, five megapixel camera.  We should have Tim talk,  because he'd read the review about what's in these things.  Yeah.

Start time: 629.14
End time: 638.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Tim, throw in anything you see.  So primarily, it's a camera, it's video.  You get your Google Now card,  so anybody who's using an Android phone  will be familiar with that.

Start time: 638.54
End time: 657.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then you load apps on the app that I'm using.  So I have Path there.  I have a little bit of access to it.  So how would I share a picture to Path?  You just find the picture, tap it, and then choose share.  Okay.  So find a picture.  So here's a picture, share.  Now tap it.  Tap it again.

Start time: 659.48
End time: 665.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, and so.  Sadly, the voice recognition is limited  just to that initial screen.  You have to, you can always say Google Glass,  do something, everything else, you have to do it by touch.

Start time: 666.64
End time: 688.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry, I just shared that.  Yeah, you did.  When did I share it too?  Probably Google Plus.  Okay, sorry.  No, that's okay.  You can see how easy that was.  Yeah.  Nobody's seeing.  That's why there's,  that's why there's so many pictures,  and it automatically hashtags through Glass.  Yeah.  There's so many pictures up on Google Plus,  primarily from Robert, of just as you walk through.

Start time: 689.08
End time: 697.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I find I take about five times more pictures  with this thing on than with my cell phone,  particularly with my kids,  because I can capture moments  that I just couldn't capture with myself.

Start time: 697.98
End time: 702.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now isn't this supposed to be  that you're not allowed me to use this?  No, that's false.

Start time: 702.50
End time: 712.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What are the rules about this?  The rules, I can't let them leave my possession.  So. Okay.  I can let, I've let 400 or hundreds of people try them on.  I was at a concert the other night,  and I was just swore in my people trying to watch.

Start time: 712.94
End time: 732.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, I guess that's now your picture  on your Google timeline is of you in the shower.  Which Miriam took, it was not taken with Glass.  No. Yeah.  With her iPhone, yeah.  Yeah, but of you wearing Glass.  And oh, so that got shared immediately.  Yeah.  That video that I just accidentally shared is shared.  You're on some other mic.  Hold on, hold on.  Look at that.  That's pretty cool.  You guys are all on more Glass.

Start time: 732.92
End time: 734.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody in chat.  Where's your Google Glass?

Start time: 734.54
End time: 740.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat asked  if there were any security measures on the device.  What's that?  Are there any security measures?

Start time: 741.12
End time: 774.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So basically anybody can pick this up and put it on  and start going through your emails  or sharing pictures onto your Google Plus account  or path or anything else.  There's no sort of biometric security or any pin code.  There was an app released that will add in that sort of thing,  but there's certainly nothing built into it.  The only security that's here right now  is the ability to find the location of the device  from the My Glass app.  So if you, if somebody takes it off your face  and runs away, you can see where the Glass is  and you can actually remote disable it as well  if you want to.  Yeah.  and throwing it on their face  and taking pictures and posting them online.

Start time: 775.26
End time: 778.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, that's why it doesn't leave my face.  Again, something easily fixed

Start time: 779.45
End time: 783.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and this is really a developer edition.  This is not what they expect a consumer edition.

Start time: 783.74
End time: 794.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I do use two factor authentication  and I can turn off, it's hooked up to my Google accounts  and I can turn those off instantly.  If you steal my Glass, I'll be on my iPhone  and disable it.

Start time: 794.95
End time: 798.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Tim, how does it, does it have to,  it has to connect to the internet somehow.

Start time: 798.96
End time: 835.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, so it's actually kind of interesting how this works.  By default, it's gonna connect to your phone  over Bluetooth tethering, which depending on your carrier  may actually cost you more money.  I'm on Verizon, it's 40 bucks a month extra for me  to actually be using Glass through my phone.  To have that tethering capability.  Yeah, it appears like a laptop or any other WiFi device  or any other Bluetooth data device.  So if you're on different carriers, the cost may vary  but you're almost certainly looking  at something additional per month.  You can also connect over WiFi if you want to directly  but at that point you won't be able to get GPS navigation  and you also won't be able to get your text messages  on the device but you can still do searches  and look up things and take pictures of course,  even with no connection.

Start time: 836.96
End time: 849.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's Bluetooth to a phone using done,  dial up networking, Bluetooth done.  Or if you're in a WiFi area, does it have its own,  it doesn't have its own WiFi built in.

Start time: 849.92
End time: 858.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's unclear because you have to add,  with the Twitch network, I had to add it in the app  after adding it on my phone.

Start time: 859.12
End time: 867.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So your phone already is on our WiFi network  but the app also need to be on the WiFi network.  That would imply that maybe the Glass itself  is doing something with the WiFi network.

Start time: 867.62
End time: 879.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a WiFi connectivity from Glass.  If there's an open network,  you can connect to it directly from the headset  without having to do anything on your phone.  But if there's a password or something funky  that you need to enter in,  it'll have to go through the app and at that point,  it'll get synced up to Glass and then it'll connect that way.

Start time: 880.60

Transcript:  No, this is very early days.  I think Robert and I are both very excited  about the potential of Glass.  I think there's a lot, but right now,  it's pretty disappointing in terms of the functionality.  But again, this is very early for developers.  Google's trying to get these out in the hands of developers  before the consumer release again sometime next year  with the hope that they'll be able  to do lots of crazy things in apps.  And we've already seen a bunch of cool apps coming out  and there's probably another eight months or so  before the commercial release.  And at that point, I'm sure there's gonna be  a lot of really exciting stuff.

The resolution though, they haven't qualified,  but it sounds like it's 640 by 360,  which is less than VGA, which is again, a little bit low,  but ultimately, I think it looks fine.  It's not gray, but it looks fine.

So that kind of shows the potential  for augmented reality within glass.  I mean, that's the thing that I think  people are most excited about  and the thing that's really missing  in glass right now for me anyway  is any sort of aspect of augmented reality.  There's nothing in here that really  tries to look like it's overlaid over the environment,  but this certainly shows that the potential is there.  So I'm curious to see if we're gonna...

End time: 1189.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This isn't augmented reality,  but it shows that the potential is there  because it can track your head in two axes.  So it means that it could be doing some overlays  over the environment and positioning things in space  that you would try to turn your head to see.

It sounds like something that I would eventually  see myself using, but I consider myself  kind of on the bleeding edge of technology and gadgets anyway.  I think there's a lot of interface issues  that need to be worked out.  I think the biggest problem is battery life.  Hopefully they have a solution.  Three hours of use is not useful.

I'm in the middle of nowhere in upstate New York,  stopped over to buy a drink,  and the clerk at this gas station,  in the middle of nowhere,  an older gentleman, I was wearing this,  he goes, hey, is that Google Glass?  Can I try it on?  I was shocked that he recognized it.  It seems like it's amazing to me the amount of perception  that there is around this device already,  which again, it's not ready  for consumer consumption just yet.

Transcript:  I'm predicting these are gonna be $200 to $500.  And I would not be shocked if Larry Page made it $200.  This thing has nothing in it, technology-wise,  that costs a lot of money, other than the projector.  And I've talked to the Chinese supply chains.  You can buy these projectors for 25 to $50.  Yeah, the teardown was just a hundred bucks or something.  There's nothing in here.  It's a crappy camera.  It's a TI chip with some RAM, with a cheap battery.  There's no cell phone radio in this thing,  so it should be cheaper than a cell phone, in quantities.  Now, they haven't yet been able to make  a million of these things, but next year, they will be.  Do you see people gaming with this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm pretty positive that Google's gonna do something like,  some sort of extension of Ingress at I.O.  here in a couple of weeks,  because they're inviting everybody  who's going to I.O. into Ingress,  and I wouldn't be surprised if we had some  I.O. integration there.

Start time: 1394.24
End time: 1417.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, Ingress is a game that you play  while walking around the world,  so that kind of game is gonna be really interesting here.  I'd love to play a game where you find power outlets, right?  And you get points for finding a power outlet.  That's a great idea.  I'd love to go through the Twitch studio  and just tag all the power outlets,  and take a picture, and sort of tag you  in an indoor positioning map,  and then other people who need a power outlet,  they'll get directed to it, right?

Start time: 1417.78
End time: 1435.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's very interesting.  That's a good use of it.  Ingress is obviously, it's an interesting game,  but it's obviously a Trojan horse  for something much more useful.  Perhaps power outlets, perhaps who knows what,  but the idea of getting people to play a game  that ends up mapping the universe in interesting ways.

You can guess what they're gonna use that for  in the military.  Sending flowers, I imagine.  Yeah, but then they can put virtual actors on the ground,  like they put some trucks on the ground,  and they put gunmen who were running through the trees,  and it was so lifelike, I could not believe it.  I was shaking the binocular around,  and they were staying on the ground like a human would,  and it was like, wow.  So think about version three or four of these things.

Transcript:  This is why this product, and Tim, you might jump in here.  This product reminds me of the Apple II.  When I unboxed my Apple II when I was 13 years old,  it didn't do anything.  It had a cassette tape drive.  How many apps came with the Apple II?  I think there was like two apps.  Basic.

My dad spent three grand for his Apple II in 1977 dollars,  which today would be, I don't know, 15 grand.  So this feels like that.  This feels like the beginning of a 20-year journey  through wearable computers  that we're going to be on together.  Some kids at the concert who were going to Berkeley  came up, and I said, man, this is your future.  Develop for this.  This is going to be like your Apple II.  The Apple II, for me, changed my life  through my entire life, right?  And it took 20 years to realize the personal computer  to where we understand it.

Start time: 1564.74
End time: 1587.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact, when you first encountered them,  for most people, it was like, well, this is useless.  This is stupid. What would you want this for?  But for kids like us, this was something like,  wow, I can see what I'm going to use this for.  So maybe, no, I'll give you that.  I mean, right now, it's a very trivial product  that has very limited use.  It's a little distracting.  It's a little weird to wear.  But I think if they can figure,  I think the interface is really the key.  They got to figure out a way.

Start time: 1587.54
End time: 1626.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's too simplistic right now,  and I understand why they made it simplistic.  So it's this virtual strip of cards.  It's too simplistic,  because I want some of the augmented reality,  some of the gaming stuff.  They had real trade-offs.  First of all, the processor's not all that great here.  The battery life isn't good. It's expensive.  And humans are freaked out by this thing, right?  So the privacy debates we've had about this  and the freakiness debates,  they really, I think, constrain the UI  to keep it from doing things like live streaming.  I'm sure that next year,  somebody will hack it and make it possible to do that.

That's what it needs to do and should do,  but it's the last thing they're going to let it do,  because that's where you really get privacy issues.  Even with the...

You need to go into the idea  of having a single unified source of everybody's identity.  So, Robert doesn't find that information about me  that I don't want him to know.  But the idea of going to a work meeting  and forgetting three of the six people's names  at your table, but have your Google Glass  remind you of that and what projects you worked with them  on previously is a very powerful thing.  And it's something that business computing  has been trying to do for a while with LinkedIn  and all these contact databases and that kind of stuff.  And I see applications in that regard as well as-

Miriam, why do you feel about all of this?  Do you mind that Robert's wearing these  all around all the time?  She says she doesn't mind it.

I wanna ask it, hey, let's go to a Mexican restaurant tonight  and take five people with-  I think advertising might be dead.  I don't know about dead  because there still is something about advertising

That's what Eric's thinking of.  We don't need to do advertising  as long as we know what you want ahead of time  and we can give it to you.  You're gonna say, thank you. That's advertising.  It's advertising, but it's much more effective.  Yeah, it's-

If you give them permission,  I took out all the Apple apps on my iPhone  and put Google apps  because the Google apps are way better.  Right?  What else do they know?  They know every search I make.  They know some of my social behavior through Google+.  They know some of my buying behavior through other things.  So they know a lot and they know my maps.

It's easier for me to keep up on emails  and everything else through my PC.  Right now, no, I don't really feel a need  to wear them day to day.  I still am wearing them a bunch  just because I'm still gonna continue to write about them  and to kind of review them as they evolve.  But ultimately, there's not really a compelling use  for me to be wearing them  if I'm just standing around in my office.  It's a review unit for you.

Transcript:  My optometrist, by the way, I had her wear them  and she checked out my eye.  She said, because the screen is at distance,  you shouldn't experience eye strain  except that it's above you.  That's the problem I have.  The reason you'll have eye strain is interesting.  Your eye blinks less often when you look up.  And so she said your eye will just dry out.  It won't be harmful, but it might make your eyes-  Blink more.  Blink more, look down a few times.  And I think that's part of why  they don't turn this thing on very often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have actually.  I wore them into a few just to kind of see  what the reaction would be.  And I haven't had any...  I'm testing glass, don't hit me.  I certainly do get a lot of questions.  Are you recording me right now?  Which shows that there is a concern amongst people  and people can't tell whether you are or are not.  So I think there's a lot of this public perception.  We need to inform people a bit better  about what they can and can't do.  But still, I definitely think that Google needs to do something.  Even if they just made the screen flash red when it's recording,  I think that would be something a bit more noticeable  than what's in there now.

Everybody has cameras, yeah.  And so they don't complain about using a cell phone.  And by the way, I can record you with this  in a lot more choice ways than, you know,  if I'm going to do this, you're going to know this, right?  If I'm doing that, you don't...

Transcript:  Now, Ryan, you've got something a lot of other people want  is the Oculus Rift.  And we have heard a lot of very positive things about this as well.  This was a Kickstarter project that finally started shipping.  I'm also a contributor to that, and I haven't gotten my Rift or my Glass.  But it's fine because I have friends who can let me try theirs.  This is a virtual reality helmet.  We've seen these before, but this one seems to be the first  really to be super fast, super effective.  You've reviewed it.  What do you think?

Start time: 2431.62
End time: 2546.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what? From a technological standpoint,  it's really, really impressive.  It has the fastest head tracking I've seen  on any of these types of devices.  It works very well. The setup was super easy.  No drivers at all, as long as the game engine that you're using  recognizes it, it just works.  The problems that it has is that right now,  this is again kind of like the Google Glass.  This is a developer kit, right?  This is not meant for consumer usage.  The resolution on the display is very low.  It's 1280 by 800,  which is split between your left and right eyes.  You're getting 640 by 800 on each eye.  It's not super high res.  It's not super high res.  And because those pixels are so close to you,  you get this screen door effect that you maybe saw in very old CRTs  and that kind of thing where it basically looks like  you're looking through a screen window.  And that's very noticeable right away.  As soon as you put them on, you know, anybody that does it,  that's usually the first thing they comment on.  And the good thing about that is you play with it for five or ten minutes  and you kind of, just like your eyes would adapt  to looking through that screen window at your house or something like that,  you eventually, your mind kind of blurs that out  and you see the image as if it were.  It's still a low resolution image.  You don't have the black lines necessarily going through it.  It works really well.  The problem I had personally is that I,  after about 10 minutes of use in a high speed scenario,  like high movement, high speed action, gaming environment,  I got motion sickness. I didn't get sick anywhere.  But I was like, oh, I'm starting to get a headache.  A lot of people have mentioned that. Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. But in a slow moving environment, like the demo that,  the only demo that comes with the Oculus SDK is something called Tuscany.  You're walking through this little house.  It's got a little fire in the fireplace. Nice view. Yeah.  You're walking very slowly, though, is the key.  And I don't think that's an accident, right?

Start time: 2547.06
End time: 2564.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's well, I didn't get sick as long as it was me controlling it.  As soon as somebody was driving me around, I was like, yeah.  If I'm looking around or I'm using the arrow keys to slowly move,  in other words, the reason people get sick is because their inner ear says  they're not moving, but their eyes say they are moving  and that this cord causes illness.

Start time: 2567.92
End time: 2573.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And so your body is trying to make you get sick to get rid of any poison  that you may have had in your body and that kind of stuff.

Start time: 2573.30

Start time: 2576.00
End time: 2623.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's weird. The thing I had the most problem with was when you use,  like if you're playing Unreal Tournament with this  and you want to look to the side to target a character or somebody  and you move the mouse in the same direction or the opposite direction,  but now you have two, like things are moving at different speeds.  Yeah, that's horrible.  My head did not work with that very well.  But like there's like a roller coaster type thing, which is basically a castle  scene where there's just like a fixed path that you go on.  When you're not in control of any of the motion,  you can just control where you're looking.  And that wasn't nearly as big a problem.  So there's some people are saying that once we get higher resolution screens,  some of that will be alleviated.  The other big technical thing.

Start time: 2623.40
End time: 2628.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the more realistic it is, the worse it's going to be.  I don't think it's going to be better. I think it's going to get worse.

Transcript:  Well, we spoke with the Palmer Lucky from Oculus.

Start time: 2633.14
End time: 2646.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We spoke with Palmer Lucky from Oculus and he said one of the big issues  is the walking speed of these games.  A lot of these games, like Unreal, you're walking at 20 to 30 miles per hour.  Really fast.  So your body is completely freaking out because it thinks you're walking  this quickly, but of course, there's no motion.  That happened to me in Bioshock Infinite.

Start time: 2646.68
End time: 2649.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I stopped running around because I was moving way too fast.

Start time: 2649.82
End time: 2657.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So he says as games start to adapt to this technology  and as game developers know about it, as they're developing the games,  that things should get much better.  Slower. Yeah.

Start time: 2657.86
End time: 2681.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The only other technical thing they can change is the input latency.  Like there's a the latency between when you move your head to when the image,  the signal goes away from the sensors into the computer.  It renders an image, sends it back to the display.  And that latency is probably in the 20s of milliseconds right now.  So there's a little bit of delay from when your head moves to when you actually  see the result of that.  Latency is the killer in this.

Start time: 2682.64
End time: 2690.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the killer in this.  And that was why I was impressed with the demo.  There was virtually no latency.  You're saying the more complex the environment, the more latency.  That makes sense.

Start time: 2690.88
End time: 2714.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, sure. I mean, like so you have to wait for the game  graphics card to render that image and send it back.  But if it's a high frame rate, it won't be a problem.  It's it's literally a latency issue of the sensors in the in the Oculus  and then the software stack because it's going through USB.  It's doing a lot. There's some slow things there.  So they're working on speeding that up for the final consumer version.  And that should also help alleviate some of the motion sickness type

Start time: 2715.44
End time: 2734.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  scenario that was I mean, I've worn virtual reality helmets  for almost 20 years.  I mean, I've tried them at SIGGRAPH and for years.  And that's always the issue is latency.  This this even if it's milliseconds between the time you turn your head  and the time the picture moves, that's enough.  What I was impressed with with Oculus Rift is how low they'd gotten.  And it's almost instantaneous.

Start time: 2735.50
End time: 2742.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's why in slow moving environments, that latency isn't  nearly as apparent as it is in fast moving environments.

Start time: 2742.26
End time: 2752.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I don't know its movement, but it's also complexity.  I mean, if you have 18 guys coming at you in Call of Duty,  that machine is going to be working pretty hard to keep that up to date in real time.

Start time: 2753.30
End time: 2788.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep. So I mean, for a $300 developer kit, it's cool.  It's a really cool thing to have, like everybody that comes into the office,  you know, wants to try it on and give it a shot.  And we kind of judge internally who has motion sickness and who doesn't.  So one of the things I'm trying to do is I'm going to try to teach myself,  my body, my mind to understand that there's not an issue by like, right.  Let's let's use it for 10 minutes every day and see if I can teach myself  to get over that motion sickness.  I don't know. I don't have motion sickness in any other facets.  I fly and all that kind of stuff.  All right. So you don't get car sick.

Start time: 2799.58
End time: 2823.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So but the reason I think these both are interesting, glass and Oculus,  is that technology is starting to catch up and starting to give us new forms of input.  Somebody in the chat room said, and I agree that if you could maybe tie this to connect  or some sort of motion sensor.  What an amazing thing.  It's not just the movement of the head, but the whole movement of the body.  So I think we're seeing some big strides and they're working in the right area.

Start time: 2824.32
End time: 2846.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The sensors are coming to that. There's this company called Prime Sense in Israel.  They made the technology that's in the connect.  But the new sensor they showed me at CES is a stick of chewing gum.  So it's far smaller. It's less than a hundred dollars and far more accurate.  They showed it on a projector down on a desk like this.  And it was so sensitive, it could tell how hard I was touching the desk.  It was unbelievable.

Start time: 2846.64
End time: 2868.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Connect is a good example because it's like the glass.  It was I mean, Connect was the fastest selling consumer good at the time ever in history.  Everybody snapped it up.  But just like the Vic 20 or glass or any of these things, they're early days yet.  And people go, oh, that's it, huh?  And they make a decision about how motion.  But we can go well beyond now what the Connect did.  That was a fairly cheap product.

Start time: 2869.40
End time: 2872.58

But but at this point, you know, we're we're still waiting to find out.  Yeah, it's only a couple of weeks away before Microsoft unveils the console.  And I think, you know, learning from the Sony mistake of not actually showing a console,  I think it's pretty safe to say, well, actually see some hardware in the 21st.

Transcript:  I mean, we know we know what the hardware is going to be.  It's going to the computing hardware is going to be almost just like the PS4.  There'll be a couple of little variations.  AMD is going to be AMD based x86 APU type hardware.  Right. I mean, it's  and it's going to create an interesting ecosystem where the bottleneck of development  is pretty much gone across PC, Xbox and PlayStation.  And I think because of that, you'll actually see faster, more robust,  you know, improvements in gaming, graphics, technology, all that kind of stuff  across the board because they don't have to worry about, you know,  what target platform they're going to use, how much of a pain in the butt  is going to be to convert from the power PC to the cell processor to the x86 processor  when all those graphics subsystems and that kind of thing.  So I think I think they're both both of these companies,  Sony and Microsoft now understand that the hardware will matter much less  than the software interface and their services they offer along with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's certainly a challenge to the console market at this point.  Mobile gaming is, of course, a huge development.  And a lot of people are happy to just, you know, play some sort of game.  They don't necessarily need the relative complexity of console gaming versus  mobile gaming. But right now, you know, we're seeing a lot of companies  trying to do some crossover gaming where you can play on a console  or on your mobile device.  And Microsoft is in the best position of anybody at this point to make that work,  of course, with Surface devices and other Windows RT and Windows 8  tablet devices and mobile phones, of course, as well.  So I think that that's also going to be a big part of this is the ability  to play games across platforms, you know, pick up where you left off at home.  But of course, whether that helps the Xbox by, you know,  giving people a better way to take those games home or whether it hurts  the Xbox because now those games are going to be playable on Windows phones  and tablets, that that remains to be seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and consoles, they're down a little bit.  But I think that's only because we're at the end of a seven year console cycle.  Everybody who wants one gaming is not taking away from those hardcore gaming.  It's a completely additional market.  Right. So the cell phone and the tablet gaming can't deny it's huge.  It will be bigger if it's not already than consoles and PCs.  But to automatically assume that because of that,  consoles and PC gaming are declining isn't just is just wrong. Right.  I mean, we we see the sales, right.  There's there's people still investing.  I just said it made it.  No, I said it. But and and.

All I know is when I when I see the when I saw the presentation from AMD  talking about the PlayStation 4 and their their big deal was, OK, here's how  it's going to affect us on the PC side as well.  They're still showing year over year growth on PC software sales,  not on hardware sales, mind you, but on software sales.  And that consoles were stepping down.  But obviously this year and for the next probably at least 24 months,  that will go up again as well.

Transcript:  I think the telling thing for me is that we haven't seen a successful console  release in a long time.  The Wii U, I don't think anybody could call a success.  The PlayStation Vita certainly wasn't a huge success.  You know, those are really nice pieces of hardware that in the past,  gamers would have snapped up, I think that hasn't happened.  So, you know, it could be said that a lot of people are waiting  for the next PlayStation and waiting for the next Xbox.  I think that's definitely true.  But I think the jury is still out on whether or not these are going to be  as successful as the current generation of consoles.  It's possible that, you know, the generation of consoles that we have now  will go down as the most successful generation ever.

I mean, I found some quick numbers where they're talking about, you know,  2012 was 18 billion dollars in PC sales and they're estimating 21 for 2013  and then 22 billion for 2014.  It's still going up and console software sales are down a little bit from like  24 to 23 to 22 in 2013 is what they're saying.  I don't think it's not going where I don't think.  I don't feel like it's getting smaller.  I feel like it's encompassing more things.  I think the software services that Sony announced at their PlayStation 4  announcement are indicative of how can we we maybe have saturated this audience.  How do we bring in this additional audience or how do we introduce new  revenue streams into this audience?  I think that's part of the problem.

But now you're using different accessories like smart glass or the Wii U controller.  And then you're using Xbox or I'm sorry, using Netflix and using Amazon Prime,  using all these other additional services.  I don't I'm not arguing that the console isn't expanding out  only from being primarily gaming focused.  But I don't I guess I don't understand the argument that console gaming has has plateaued.

It's very hit driven.  If you've got a hit, you make a sequel.  That's not going to happen on the on the mobile platforms.  It's cheap and easy to develop a lot of titles.  But that's why you see.

Transcript:  Hey, those big studios are struggling.  EA has been struggling a lot lately.  You know, there's been so much consolidation lately as these big studios  are buying up the smaller ones and then they're shutting down a lot of the smaller  studios that they've picked up.  Of course, you know, there are certainly there's a market for big games  like Call of Duty, but ultimately those markets are based on huge sales  for these consoles.  And if these consoles can't maintain the sorts of sales that we saw  in the last generation with the Wii and the Xbox 360, then then, you know,  things are going to get pretty dark for the big studios like EA and Ubisoft  and others. But we know we've seen that in the movie industry over and over again,

Start time: 3496.24
End time: 3511.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  though, that these studios flop.  There's a history. And it's very it's a hit driven business.  Nine out of 10 movies lose money.  Nine out of 10 games might lose money.  But when you get that game that suddenly is a huge franchise, then you're rich.  The giant by proprietary box.

I'm not forcing you to defend my position because I I  I do think that the hardcore gamers might stay with a PC  and the casual gamers might do mobile.

You can set it up in that way.  We had to tweak some of the settings out of the box.  It didn't look very good with with games, but you turn down, turn off  denoise and turn down the sharpness and a couple of things.  And it produced a really great gaming monitor for thirteen hundred dollars,  which is about the same price of a 30 inch, twenty five, sixty by sixteen  hundred display from Dell.

Great show. Thursdays, right? Thursdays.  Yes. What time? Seven six p.m. Pacific.  Nine p.m. Eastern Time.  Really, if you want to keep up on the hardware.  I used to host that show with you and it was so we got somebody  who knew what he was talking about, Patrick Norton.  But I'll tune in because I want to know, you know, like,  in fact, I'd like to ask you about Haswell because we now have a date  like a bunch of stuff happening with Intel, a new CEO.  We've got HD 5000 graphics.  We've got Iris.  So let's talk a little bit of hardware with Ryan Shroud also here.  Robert Scoble, the Scobleizer from Rackspace, the king of Internet startups.  I try to get not just Internet startups.  You get a whole.  By the way, everybody wanted to know what all the notifications on your phone,  they saw your phone and it's got all across the top bar on your Android phone.  It's like it's like 1800 notifications.  I have a lot of apps. You might  want to clear some of those.  A lot of apps. Some of those out there.  Also with his Tim Stevens of Engadget, he gets to try all the new stuff.  Engadget.com our show today brought to you by the audio book source.  The place to go if you love listening audible dot com.  Everybody who has a commute knows about audible.  Anybody who goes to the gym ought to know about audible or walks the dog or does the dishes.  Anytime you want to read a book, but you can't hold a book.  You can listen to the best books in the world.  One hundred thousand plus strong.  I cannot sell audio books more strongly.  I just love it.  I see Mark Maron has a book now called Attempting Normal.  He's that's I love Mark Maron.  The podcast WTF. Very funny guy.  He's got to have a very funny audio book.  But you can also so that's nonfiction, but there's great fiction as well.  I'm just finished Joe Walton's Among Others, which is a wonderful book about fairies and sci fi.  Right now, I'm listening to a book about  the Hollywood revolution of the 70s called Pictures at a Revolution  that Andy Anaka recommended. Just fabulous.  Thing is, for a while, I didn't have time to read or, you know, I'd try to read in bed  and I'd fall asleep after one page.  And I kind of lost the art of of of books.  And I was so glad to rediscover books about 10 years ago when I commuted two hours a day  to tech TV. Two hours was on a good day, longer in some cases.  And I'd listen to these books and, you know, I'd love it so much.  The community, not only with the commute go by,  but I drive around the block a couple extra times to get to the end of the chapter.  I was so engrossed in these audio books.  I've become a fan and Audible is the way to go.  If you're interested in audio books, there's so many great titles to listen to.  The Iceman. I cannot listen to this.  The Iceman, the true story of a cold blooded killer.  Bronson Pinchot narrating the story of one of the deadliest killers in American history.  Ay, yi, yi.  The Autistic Brain, Temple Grandin's new novel or new nonfiction is out.  The number one download, I guess, because of the movie The Great Gatsby.  A lot of people hadn't read that. See, that's great.  Or Norse. This is good. This is a license plate.  See if you can figure out what this license plate says.  NOS4A2.  What do you think that's about?  NOS4A2. Yeah, baby.  New Joe Hill novel, Kate Mulgrew narrates that.  Best readers, some of the best actors in the world reading great books,  fiction, nonfiction, thrillers, mysteries.  I'll tell you what, I can get you a couple of free books if you're interested.  If you go to audible.com slash twit to you can sign up for the platinum plan.  That's the two book a month subscription.  Your first month is free.  That means your first two books are free.  Cancel any time in the first 30 days.  Pay nothing. You'll keep the books forever.  But I think Audible is betting and I agree you'll never cancel  once you become an audible listener.  It's audible for life.  I've been a member for more than 10 years and I love it.  Audible.com slash twit to two books awaits you.  Absolutely free.  So Intel says June for Haswell.  Is that something?  Let me ask you the basic question, Ryan Shroud.  And then then we can go from there.  Should I? Is it nuts to buy a computer until Haswell comes out?

Transcript:  The seems like it.  If you're going to buy a laptop, probably yes.  Because the main the main advantage of this architecture is not in CPU performance.  You'll see a little bit of an increase there.  But their main focus is on enabling things like connected standby  and other battery saving capabilities as opposed to performance improvement capabilities.  And the desktop side, it won't really be necessary.  It will have better graphical options.  But it's the HD 5000.  Yeah, so they have they have several different brands that they're adding with this.  They announced the Iris and the Iris Pro.  The Iris. These are just these are new names for stuff that we already knew was going to come out.  That used to be called the GT3 version of their integrated graphics.  It doubles the amount of computing units inside that graph and inside the graphics pipeline.  And then the pro version actually adds a large chunk of embedded memory onto the processor itself.  And it's a really interesting thing to have this.  I don't know if I'm allowed to say exactly how much it is, but at least triple digit megabytes of cash on die on the chip with this graphics.

Start time: 4214.30
End time: 4219.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is because they've reduced the process size to what, point two two nanometers.  They've got so much space.

Start time: 4221.56
End time: 4235.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so it's a twenty two nanometer chips.  Ivy Bridge was also twenty two nanometer.  But what they did, what they were able to do is basically their big problem, their big performance deficit in processors has always been on the graphics side.

Start time: 4236.56
End time: 4239.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you wanted real graphics, you'd get AMD or Nvidia.

Start time: 4240.98
End time: 4285.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so and that's also been kind of a problem for, say, ultrabook designs where you have a very, very limited thermal budget.  You don't have very much room to put in a heat sink where you would need to cool two independent discrete chips, a processor plus discrete graphics.  So they're kind of responding to customer requests of, hey, we want to get that same level of performance or as close as possible out of your single chip.  And adding in, you know, the embedded memory doesn't add that much more to the wattage of power consumption required to add it in.  So I think we'll find that this upcoming generation of laptops will have much better battery life than they've had before and much better graphical performance than they've had before using those those higher end options.

Transcript:  They're making billions of dollars, of course, I don't think so.  Their profits are down.  Yeah, most a lot of people's were.  I mean, are we talking about just from what markets they're in from ARM?

Start time: 4301.84
End time: 4306.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The challenge from ARM certainly is not AMD, but from the challenge from ARM, the post PC world.

Start time: 4307.86
End time: 4361.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's not tomorrow.  They're going to announce a new architecture.  And this story is on CNET and several other places on there.  They're going to announce the first redesign to the Atom chip since its release in 2008.  And this is a complete rework.  It's not as we've seen over the last five years.  Take this architecture, tweak it a little bit.  Let's maybe add hyperthreading and see what else we can get out of it.  This will be a complete redesign.  They're taking it from an in order architecture to an out of order out of order architecture.  It's going to be built on that 22 nanometer process technology.  It's built. It was this architecture was built for cell phones and tablets.  It was not a repurposed Pentium design that they have brought down in scale.  And what Intel really hopes is Intel's competition is not really AMD anymore on the CPU front.  It's Qualcomm, it's Samsung, it's all the ARM partners that are dominating that high growth market.

Start time: 4361.82

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is no there is no popular cell phone running Intel at all.

Start time: 4365.64
End time: 4395.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they released Medfield last year, and I think there was one in Europe.  I don't know if they ever released it over here.  There was a Motorola and a Lenovo unit that used it.  But the here's the advantage.  ARM will still have like the maybe a slightly more efficient architecture at its core.  But the advantage that Intel has over everybody else is that they have their own process technology.  They do their own manufacturing.  Nobody else has the expertise at manufacturing that Intel does.  ARM is a ARM is fabulous.

Start time: 4395.56
End time: 4399.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  ARM is ARM is just a spec that others design create chips based on.

Start time: 4400.44
End time: 4460.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. And they have to go to external foundries like Samsung and TSMC to have those chips made.  And they're maybe on 32 nanometer process.  Maybe they're getting close to 28 nanometer process.  Intel is running at 22.  And it's not just 22 nanometer.  It's a really good 22 nanometer technology.  And that is their kind of ace in the hole in these in these kind of battles.  I haven't tested any actual devices yet, but from all all the information I'm getting,  the Silvermont architecture that will be released or announced tomorrow essentially is going to really put pressure on ARM and its partners to come up with new new architectures or new ideas or new products.  And like I said, I can't verify for 100 percent without using a phone and seeing what its performance is like and telling you about battery life or something like that.  But they this is the time where they're actually taking it seriously.  Everything else where they said they were taking it seriously was kind of like they were.  They were really taking seriously this day.  They're holding it off till today.

Start time: 4460.20
End time: 4488.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They were trying. They've been trying with scale.  It's interesting because Intel isn't just being beaten on the cell phone market by others, but on the data on the data center, you forget how many how many computers Google and Amazon and Rackspace aren't they buying x86 Intel chips mostly.  But we're switching over because the work the the power usage on ARM is a lot lower than Intel.  So if you're building a new data center for micro service, what's that?

Start time: 4488.26
End time: 4489.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Micro micro service.

Start time: 4489.66
End time: 4504.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And I've met a 17 year old kid at South by Southwest who's building these supercomputers out of ARM chips.  And it's the it's the ARM chips on the data center.  So if you if you're focusing your ARM chips on cell phones, are you are you going to be able to optimize for both of those markets or both of those?

Start time: 4505.02
End time: 4537.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So that's there's a lot of overlap there.  So the new architecture will have a lot of those enterprise security features that ARM currently lacks, like a lot of virtualization technology and that kind of stuff that they'll put in this architecture.  And this architecture will be built for tablets and phones, but it will also be micro servers.  And I Lord, I hope we don't see like any netbook rebuilds based around or something like that.  But you may see the smallest clamshell machines maybe be able to use this chip for that.

Transcript:  Paul Alderlini did say we're going to see two hundred dollar computers based on Intel processors.  I don't know what that means.

Start time: 4546.10
End time: 4551.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's probably based on this, right?  Because I mean, this is the lowest cost, smallest die that they're going to make.

Start time: 4551.62
End time: 4557.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does Intel want to be in this business, though?  Isn't this a low margin crappy business that they have traditionally eschewed?

Start time: 4558.58
End time: 4607.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but they're being forced into it.  I mean, it's the growth market, right?  I mean, it's you.  If you want to grow as a company with shareholders, these are the markets you have to get into.  You can look at a lot of other stuff that they're trying to do, the whether they're going to make TV networks and all that kind of stuff as well.  But it's it's really all, you know, comes down to this particular market.  It's it's kind of, you know, it's we wish we still had a and B around that.  And B was still a healthy competitor in the X86 market where their processors were pushing Intel to push forward in that regard.  I mean, it's kind of a it's like a depressing sentiment as an enthusiast that we haven't had an Intel processor release for over three hundred and fifty dollars because, trust me, they would love to sell a nine hundred dollar processor.  But there's no like there's there's no performance.  There's no segment for that anymore because nobody has pushed them forward.

Start time: 4608.08
End time: 4613.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So tough road to hope for them, though.  I mean, it's a race to the bottom.  It's not a market they are comfortable in.

Start time: 4614.72
End time: 4659.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not quite like the net top era where you were actually selling two hundred dollars machines.  If you're selling a tablet for six hundred bucks, it is maybe subsidized by Verizon or AT&T.  You're still going to make money. Apple makes their own chips.  They're able to make money off of that off of that part as well.  So, you know, they're they're they're they think they need that market and they're they're really excited about, you know, this this next step that's going to come out.  I just we need to see if it actually delivers.  They said it delivered every step of the way and it just really hasn't.  And the real proof will be if late this year, if we start to see or at CS next year, we see a dozen Intel based cell phones and tablets released in that market.  They're going to keep the Adam name.  Yeah, you know, I don't like that.

Start time: 4659.88
End time: 4663.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a tainted name. That's like going back to the Celeron, which they did also.

Start time: 4663.86
End time: 4684.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I told them that that the Adam name had such a negative connotation in the tech world that they should because the netbooks else.  Yeah, I even said, you know, why not use the Pentium name?  Because then you get at least people like my dad who know what the Pentium is.  And they got that in a cell phone is they got that in my cell phone.  I got a Pentium cell phone. Yeah.  Yeah. Anything but Adam.  And I would I agree with Adam.

Start time: 4684.06
End time: 4686.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they use they reuse Celeron, which was even worse.

Start time: 4687.36
End time: 4691.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess they could not.  They're out of money. They can't get new trademarks.

Start time: 4691.48
End time: 4703.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know. They can't find anybody to do a new name.  Huh? All right.  So we'll watch we'll watch with great interest tomorrow.  Silvermont.  Will be announced and shipping when?

Start time: 4705.30
End time: 4725.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Probably late 2013 for some of the components, I don't really it will vary based on  the derivation of that architecture, so that that's that's the name of the overall architecture.  And there will be I think Baytrails, the name of the chip for tablets and Merrifield for cell phones and that kind of stuff.  Names that we've seen leaked around forever, but didn't really know exactly what they were attached to.

Start time: 4727.02
End time: 4753.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Interesting. It's it feels like a rearguard action.  It feels like a really challenging market for Intel to try to get into.  And I understand they have to, because if they don't, they're going to be left in the dust in the post PC era.  But I don't know.  I'm not. Now, tell us about the new CEO, Paul Adelini is stepping down and we've got a new CEO, Brian Krizan Krizanich.  When is he when is Krizanich start?

Start time: 4755.09
End time: 4803.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. I think I think he actually started already.  He's already working. I think so.  Well, he said blame it on Krizanich.  May 16th. OK. May 16th.  OK. I think I to be completely honest with you, had maybe heard his name once or twice before this.  He comes he comes from the manufacturing side of very much like Tim Cook.  Yeah. And I know a lot of people in the stories like Governing Gadget and the Verge they were talking about.  This kind of doesn't make sense, right, for a company that says they want to change their direction.  They want to become a consumer oriented product company, not a chip company that hiring a guy whose only background is this process.  But making chips like the hard the hard job of actually making the chips is a little confusing.  And I completely agree with that with that sentiment.

Start time: 4804.02
End time: 4807.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's not the big picture guy. He's not a vision guy.  He's a guy who knows how to make chips cheaper.

Start time: 4808.88
End time: 4826.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, he may be and we have no idea, I guess.  Right. But it seems odd to bring in a person who has focused on the manufacturing and process technology for so long to somehow guide the company in a direction where they're trying desperately not to be just a chip company anymore.

Start time: 4826.44
End time: 4835.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, Ottolini was not an engineer.  So it's true in a company like this that the engineers like to see an engineer running it.  Yeah. They want to see somebody who speaks the language and understands.

Start time: 4835.86
End time: 4850.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When you walk through it is a very engineering heavy company.  And when you go up to have you ever visited one of their fabs?  I know it's huge.  It's like 16 football fields and a huge building and a billion dollar cost.  You really understand why these fabs are so expensive to build.

Start time: 4850.92
End time: 4858.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you understand arms advantage to be a fabless technology, although somebody's got a fab at Samsung or Qualcomm or somebody's got to build a T.

Start time: 4858.72
End time: 4892.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's an advantage for ARM on their books, and it's much less risk for them.  But Intel is hoping they can prove that it's an advantage to be the process leader.  So maybe that again has something to do with him coming in.  I think you just nailed it. Yeah, you just nailed it.  They want to bring in third parties to use their manufacturing.  Like, so they want to take this out of market texture and let other people bring in their third party IPs, pair it with their CPU design and maybe make chips that way.  That's something they've announced last year that we're open to letting other people use our manufacturing if we're a part of that licensing deal.

Start time: 4893.52
End time: 4907.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So don't you think the end game, the gold is to get Apple to put our put Intel chips in its ARM based iPad and iPhone?  Isn't that what Intel wants?  They already have a great relationship with the biggest customer.

Start time: 4907.08
End time: 4915.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure. Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, they would love to be in everybody's laptops and cell phones and all that kind of stuff as well.

Start time: 4915.48

Transcript:  Oh, you get an Apple the rest, you know, Samsung copies and everybody else falls into place.  Yeah.  Where is AMD? Are they dead?

Start time: 4923.06
End time: 4965.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not yet. No, I mean, they're discrete.  Not dead yet.  This is actually really good.  They'll have a lot of income from the licensing with Xbox and PlayStation going on for the next five to 10 years at least.  They're going they kind of announced that CES low cost parts to kind of compete in that tablet workspace and they have the advantage of having a really, really good graphics system.  They kind of a lagging behind processors stack, but their graphics stack is really, really good.  So depending on if everybody wants a game on their tablets, like we're talking about earlier, they may make the better chip for that.  We're actually heading up to Toronto this week to learn all about those new APUs, those low power APUs and how they might hope they disrupt the market at least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  I mean, it could.  There have been people who have been trying to develop ARM based architecture, ARM based systems that are much higher performance.  I mean, if they're running in the data centers that Robert's talking about, and in theory,  they could they could be transferred up to higher performance usage models.  But you have the same if the architecture is not developed from the ground up for that efficiency model, it's going to suffer.  Just like when they when Intel has been trying to take these other architectures and push them down into cell phones and thin tablet market.  It just doesn't quite work.  There's too much that's not made to fit there.  And I think the current at least the current generations of ARM architecture, if you shift them up, they become too power and efficient.  And they're going to look they're going to lose on the performance battle in their current form, at least.

Transcript:  We're going to take a break.  Ryan Trout from PC Perspective, Tim Stevens from Engadget, Robert Scoble, the Scoble-izer.  Coming back, we're going to talk a little bit about Apple, some Apple news.  But first, a word from Citrix, the makers of Sharefile.  I've said it for years.  Don't send email attachments.  It's dangerous. It's insecure.  And bounce backs could be a real problem.  Our files are getting bigger and bigger and a lot of email systems won't handle more than a few megabytes, 10 megabytes.  It's it.  Bouncing bouncy Sharefile doesn't is a way to send email attachments without sending email attachments, a secure way to send files in business by sending a secure link.  And it works so well.  It's it's great, too, for industries like the medical profession where you've got government regulations like HIPAA.  It is HIPAA compliant.  In fact, you'll see when you first sign up for Sharefile, you can customize it for up to 30 different industries.  And of course, when you use Sharefile, you can use it on your desktop, but you can also use it on the go, which is fabulous.  It seamlessly integrates into your daily routine, no matter where you are from any device, including a tablet or an iPhone or an Android phone.  I use Sharefile all the time.  So, for instance, I'm sending audio to radio stations for the radio show.  Let's say I and this happens every time I leave and I forget to send a file to one of the stations, they call me say, where's our file?  I've got it on my iPhone.  I've already synced it to my Sharefile store.  I can send a message very quickly from my iPhone.  I don't have to have the file.  I just connect up to Sharefile and it's boom.  It's there. They got it.  You get notifications when the files are opened so you can track progress.  You can password protect files.  You could say how long the file is available a day, a week, a month, a year forever.  You can say how many times it can be downloaded.  It really changes the way you work.  I want you to try this free for 30 days.  Sharefile.com.  Click the microphone at the top.  Now, Chad, don't click that.  Go right to the top there where it says radio listeners.  I know that's confusing, but you know, that's the best that we can do.  Radio listeners, click that microphone, enter TWIT.  T-W-I-T.  Choose your business and click try it.  30 days free.  I should warn you, you will be hooked.  Sharefile.com.  I'm wearing a funny hat because it's Cinco de Mayo.  Are you going to are you going to go have Mexican food after the show?

That's about six weeks. That's not bad.  Surprising, frankly.  They're planning. Now, this is maybe a little less including all surface the surface.

And these are the hot phones.  I would say there are three Android phones that are the top ones.  Nexus 4 is still in there because it's inexpensive and it's a pure Google experience.  And when you play with the HTC One and the Galaxy S4,  you realize what a boon, a pure experience is compared to the crap Ola.  I mean, both of these phones are loaded with, you know, manufacturer customization,  so much so it's hard to get them out of the way.

Transcript:  Tim, tell me this.  Because the 4, when I first saw it,  I thought that is not a mainstream phone.  It's a developer phone.  There's no LTE.  It's kind of low resolution.  It's not.  But people embraced it because it's pure Google.  Do you think Google might say,  oh, maybe we ought to make one more pure phone,  maybe something from Motorola and this Nexus X people have talked about?

Start time: 5873.12
End time: 5910.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah, we've been waiting for that pure Motorola phone forever now,  since they bought the company.  And we keep getting these indications that now it's not quite ready yet.  This could certainly be the time that they drop something on us.  But the Nexus 4 is still a fairly young phone relative to all things.  I'm not saying that we couldn't necessarily see a new Nexus phone.  But if we do, I think it'll be a different device,  either larger and perhaps more premium,  or maybe even smaller and cheaper.  I think a lot of the reason that people are going to the Nexus 4  is because, A, like you said, it's a pure Google experience, which is great.  It's also a very low-cost device, unlocked.  And it works across triggers very well.  So but Google still hasn't quite cracked that LTE nut.  And I think that the technology exists for them  to do that in their next device.

There's been some rumor that they're running behind on it.  In fact, that they're even transferring people from the OS X team over to the iOS team.  A flattened iOS 7, a Johnny Ive iOS 7.

Start time: 5967.74
End time: 6008.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It sounds like Johnny Ive's really ripping the guts out of iOS,  which honestly to me sounds pretty nice.  I'm not a fan of skeuomorphism, which is the attempt at giving a 3D life-like appearance to it,  which is probably best typified in the game room, which I think looks terrible.  So to have all that stuff worked out, I think is great.  And certainly iOS needs some injections and new functionality.  We were talking earlier about the keyboard.  And I think iOS desperately needs a new keyboard.  iOS used to be the great glass typing experience,  but now it's lagged behind Android.  And certainly Blackberry 10 has just come out with a great keyboard too.  I think that's really where a lot of innovation is needed.  But yeah, it sounds like they're pulling out all the stops  and recruiting as many people as they can in the team  to try to get something ready in time for WWDC here in about a month.

Sounds like you're bullish on Google.  I am.  You know, I used to be Apple's number one fan.  I was first in line at the Paul Walton store.  I've been an Apple fan for seven years.  And they've just continued to lose me as a customer.  I mean, I still carry my iPad everywhere.  I still sit in front of my big iMac.  But what was it that turned the lack of openness?  The keyboard.  I am 30% to 50% faster.  I can beat anybody on any keyboard now with SwiftKey  because it predicts what I'm typing.

It's all about your Facebook pictures.  Well, you and I aren't going to be the market for that.  But it's well done.  You have to admit it's smooth.  It's a nice UI.

It's like, uh...  Yeah, all right.  But I like it.  Facebook just blocked it.  It shows what happens when you lock the system down.  This is what happened in the 90s, remember?  Right.  No, I'm with you.  Apple was so far ahead in the 90s over Windows, and Windows just was more open,  and developers could do more things with it.  So it's not...  For me, it's not about Facebook at home.  It's about openness and letting developers do interesting and innovative things.  It'll be interesting to see where Tim Cook takes this company.

Transcript:  The challenge is now, and I think what we'll see at WDC is going to tell us a lot about that.  And I don't...  It's hard for me to imagine what a new iPhone might have  that would make it a compelling choice over the variety of choices that you have on Android.  You agree, Tim?  I mean, you review them all.

Transcript:  Yeah, I'm definitely very interested to see what this new iOS 7 looks like.  I mean, Johnny, it definitely has very strong aesthetic sensibilities.  So I'm definitely very curious to see how that transitions from the hardware side of things  to the software side of things, of course.  But from the functionality standpoint, yeah, I mean, certainly like Robert was alluding to,  there's a lot of great stuff coming from developers now on the Android side of things.  But sometimes that comes at the expense of pure iOS usability and also pure iOS responsiveness.  And there are plenty of Android apps that really kind of kill your phone performance.  And real people don't even think about this.

Transcript:  Right. And so, of course, we're also talking about Google Glass,  but there's certainly a lot of anticipation for a wearable device from Apple later this year.  And that could certainly open up the market, too.  I mean, having something like Glass really requires you to wear something on your face  that is ultimately not the most comfortable thing in the world.  But to replace your wristwatch with something that is far more functional,  that I think is something that will be much more palatable to the general consumers  than kind of a funny looking heads up display.

Transcript:  I didn't bring my basis watch, but I have basis and pebble.  The wrist is interesting, right?  But it's not as interesting.  It doesn't do much.  The problem is you can't do a camera.

Start time: 6334.54
End time: 6354.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It can be a really pretty notifier.  I think it's going to be gig jewelry, right?  You know, there's a lot of people who buy jewelry that costs a lot more than a watch will cost.  I think Apple will sell a lot of them.  Well, we'll see.  As long as it has a cool screen and it has your notifications coming down.  I mean, look at how many.  Yeah, they're going to sell a ton of them.  Really?  Yeah.

Transcript:  And now, if you think about what Apple has, they have the world's best supply chain.  They have the world's best retail channel.  And the retail channel is all small stores where they want a high turn per square foot.  Right.  What would turn faster per square foot?  Perfect.  Watches and maybe something on your face, maybe a small another iPad with a retina screen.

For the house arrest crowd.  The new iAnklet.  All right, let's take a break.  We're going to wrap these up in just a moment.  But I want to remind you to back up every Sunday and tell everybody you got to back up.  And if you're going to do it, do it right with Carbonite online.  Backup.  It's the cloud.  It's exactly what you want to use the cloud for.  If you have a backup sitting next to your computer and there's a fire, a flood, or disaster,  somebody steals all your stuff, your backups are gone too.  The best backup is off site.  And if you've got a laptop, Carbonite's great on a laptop.  You know, 180,000 laptops are lost every year on airport conveyor belts.  It is so crazy not to have a backup on your laptop.  And that's where Carbonite just as great.  It's automatic anytime you're online.  Even at an insecure hot spot at a hotel or a coffee shop,  Carbonite securely backs your data up.  When you change a file, it's backed up instantly.  It's automatic, continuous backup when you're online.  Best of all, $59 a year for everything on that laptop or desktop.  $59 a year.  In fact, when you use our offer code, Twit,  you'll get two free bonus months with purchase.  So it's an even better deal.  Mac or PC, they've got plans for single computers, external drives, servers,  businesses as well, always for one low flat annual rate.  And unlimited backup too.  And I really like that.  Plus it's cloud storage.  You can see your Carbonite stuff anywhere.  Multiple servers, multiple homes.  So you know you're safe everywhere you go.  You got to try it.  Carbonite.com.  No credit card needed.  Just our offer code, Twit.  Two free weeks.  That's probably enough in most cases to do your first backup set  and then just make those changes as you change files.  Two months free when you purchase if you use our offer code, Twit.  C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E.  Carbonite.com.  Use our offer code, Twit, for a free trial.  No credit card needed.

Transcript:  We can stick around after the show if you want to just take  field questions about Google Glass.  Those of you in the chat room, I think yeah, there's a lot of interest in it.  And it's one of those things I think only a small fraction of 1%  of the population is going to get to use until they're a consumer product.  Yeah.

Start time: 6526.28
End time: 6536.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I try to give mine to everybody who I see in the street just so they can try them out  because there's so much interest about it.  And it is a very rare device and everyone's really excited to try it out.  Is the universe-  I've been trying, I know Robert you have as well, which is great.

Start time: 6536.54

Start time: 6540.73
End time: 6582.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  It's definitely wow, which surprised me.  I think that wow factor lasts a couple of hours and then you kind of quickly get over  and then you have to make the broader decision.  Does this really fit into my life?  Is this really worth the commitment of putting this thing on my face every morning?  And then I think that is a decision that's going to be changing over time  as the apps come and everything else comes to the platform.  What's the wow?  Though I was just seeing that display floating in space.  It ultimately is just a display, but to be able to see your information there.  The wow for me was actually the first time I did a hangout with my wife.  I thought that the idea of doing a hangout with somebody who can't see you was kind of a dumb idea.  But the first time I did it with my wife and I could see her reaction to what I was seeing  and see her talking to me, that was my first wow moment.

Start time: 6582.58

Transcript:  Right.  So I was standing on the beach in California and it was a beautiful view.  I thought, hey, I'll give my wife a call and see so that she can see what I'm seeing.  But think about going to a museum with your friends and they can't join you,  but you could walk through the museum and have a conversation with your friends and say,  hey, check out this exhibit that I'm at.  This is really cool.  And they could all join in with you.  That's kind of cool.

End time: 6643.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it works.  Yeah, I saw you take a picture.  The voice and this is a parlor trick.  But the fact that the seven commands that are on this home screen always work with everybody  really gets people like, wow, that is cool.  It's a parlor trick because you have to read the command exactly as it appears.  If you say, okay, glass, take a photo, it does not work.  You have to say, okay, glass, take a picture.  You can be pretty accurate if you have a highly constrained vocabulary.  And that's why it's a parlor trick.  When you actually get deeper and say, try to get directions to an address or something,  it makes a lot of mistakes there, just like your cell phone or Siri would make a mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It depends on the price.  How many people here would buy one at $200?  You guys are the most.  No, this matches every audience.  I've given seven speeches with it.  There's about half of the audience.

Start time: 6667.42
End time: 6693.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I bet half of the audience would pay $50 to try it on and use it for a day.  I really feel like what Tim is saying is like, okay, it's really cool for that two-hour span.  But is it something I'm willing to commit to?  And is it going to change my life in the way that I think it's necessary to wear this  item every day?  I don't know.  I don't think the price really matters at that point.  I think the price gets you in the door.  But it's the usefulness that keeps it on.

Transcript:  And Leo, if I can, I want to plug a project that we're working on right now.  Good. Yeah.  All right. So we've started an Indiegogo project  to try to rebuild all of our studio and set and cameras and lighting  and all that kind of stuff here.  Trying to keep up with you. It's a little bit tougher.  So we started a project. We got some pretty cool...  We got t-shirts and different groups you can get in.  You can join the podcast for an episode and do a lot of cool stuff like that.  What a good idea, Ryan. That's great.  How much are you looking to spend?  So our initial goal was 10,000. We hit that in a week.  But we had planned out there, well, here's what we can do for 20,  and here's what we can do for 30,000.  And we have a much smaller space than you do.  But I think we can do...  I remember talking with people just this week about it.  What can you really do with $30,000?  It doesn't seem like that much money in terms of studio type stuff.  And I look at what...  I think when you were building...  I spent 30,000 on cameras alone.  Yeah. But when you talked about what a benefit it was or how much  the cost had gone down when you built the Burkhouse as opposed to what you did at  Tech TV, right?  And I'm trying to see if maybe we can do it for a little bit less.  More software side of things instead of hardware side of things.  So if you just go to pcpur.com on the right-hand side,  there'll be a weird looking picture of me with a link to the Indiegogo.  Yeah, there it is.
