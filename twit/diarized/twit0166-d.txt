Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  hello

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  from revision 3 she's director programming a community there but also  host of pop siren and of course a long time host of the screensavers in attack  of the show so nice to see you  I can't believe it took this long never been on twit that's weird

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it is weird I think we talked about it and then it you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you're busy man I'm busy busy always busy man so we have lots of stories to  talk about  kind of an infinite number one of the ones that kind of grab my eye it's not  exactly a tech story but it boy it's kind of a shocker  is that the New York Times is in far worse shape than we ever imagined it's a  according to some about to go out of business  well the advertising it's the advertising the online advertising  disappeared the New York Times while it does have some successful online  properties including about dot com you know it was a was it just a couple years  maybe last year that the publisher said will be out of the paper business in 10  years and we all kind of poo pooed that when that happened but apparently the  New York Times is in dire straits Jason is this kind of part of the general  decline or is this something that would have happened anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  this is a a double sort of whammy you have the general decline in newspapers  and their cost structure not being part of sort of the the new news process you  know basically there they spend too much money and then combine that with what's  happened in the markets and the amount of debt they have and their ability to  pay back that debt is very much out of sync so they're going to have to sell  about they've been trying to sell about dot com from what I understand but isn't  that one of their few profitable you know the problem with it is is it hasn't  changed in I don't know six or seven years and all the New York Times has  done since they've got it is really destroy it you're right I don't go there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  anymore I mean I'd go to Mahalo over about you're kind of the same thing yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not saying that because we're quasi competitors but because they really  haven't invested in it and what they're doing is they're putting more and more  ads on it so when you go to the page it's very hard to tell what's an offer  what's an ad and that's when you know something's wrong with the site when you  try to squeeze as much revenue out of it as you can you corrupt the user  experience you corrupt the user experience the users go away which is  how Google has been able to take such incredible market share they actually  show less ads on Google and they traditionally have been showing less and  they call that the investment in the user experience so if you go do ten  searches you may only see ads on three or four you go that's interesting I  didn't know that yes I know this specifically so then what that does is  when they have a down market come in they can actually increase the number of  ads so they have a dial inside of Google from what I've been told by people where  they can pick how much money they want to make exactly because they can just  say oh more ads on so they've been conservative so in a dark period like  this they can actually ramp it up right the really sinister part of it or genius  part of it or whatever is they will show more ads on say a partner site like AOL  uses Google search so they'll show more ads there while showing less on their own which over time convinces people don't use AOL search you use

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google's is this a problem though limited to the New York Times or are all  newspapers about to go out of business all of them are gonna have fundamental

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  problems because you have too high a cost basis people don't look to them first  for their news you right they have a speed problem they have a product they  have a product problem there and then they have a business model problem and  then you have an economic problem at the same time so the business problem is  they don't have any they're competing with Craigslist right which is free  essentially so Craigslist has taken a large revenue share a large revenue  stream and basically decimated it by making it free and then you have blogs  and shows like this and Engadget and you know political blogs basically taking

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  away their readership but it's the Journal of Records still I mean it is  the paper the one paper in the US that is kind of the you figure if all other

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  papers were to go away you'd still have the New York Times you'd have to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that's that's not gonna go around it's not gonna go away I mean they just may  have to sell things they may have to do fundraising so when all this stuff  happens that's when smart people are able to buy things so you know you saw  the Wall Street Journal get bought by Murdoch don't be surprised I mean he  wouldn't be able to buy the New York Times I don't think because of  ownership rules right because then he would own the Post the New York Times  and the Wall Street Journal. All three New York newspapers. Not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We are in a you know in a tech bust there's no question about it in fact if  you go to TechCrunch they have a layoff tracker and according to their layoff  tracker 19,683 jobs eliminated since mid-September that's not including the  25,000 HP is gonna lay off as a result of its merger with EDS it is including  3,000 at Xerox 9,000 at Dell 1500 at Yahoo 1500 at eBay 6 at Mahalo makes  makes you sound pretty good but as a percentage it's it's roughly that you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you laid off about 10% at Mahalo. Yeah essentially you know we looked at it and  said we have three years worth of capital left like we we did something  really smart we raised a lot of money in the up market and so as I always say you  know what smart entrepreneurs do in an up market is raise capital and sell their  companies for the highest valuation possible right and then in a down market  what smart entrepreneurs do is build value and so we raised money when the  market was very hot a year and a half ago and now we're gonna build value in  the down market and not look for an exit or not look to raise more cash position

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it gave gives you what you call runway they call it runway you know how many

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  months can you go without raising capital a typical startup company has  six to 18 months we had three months of capital left we then did a reorganization  slash layoffs looks more like a reorganization but with the intent of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  getting more how much now runway do you have from now we have four years four  years of runway from three months to four years no no no three years to four  years okay yes are you anticipating that this down market is gonna last four years

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the down market is gonna last 18 to 36 months and I would like to have a  year or two of runway coming out of it or the ability to buy companies during  the down market this is a good time to snag some deals exactly so I've been  looking at things and you know we're not in the blog business but we own hackaday  because I we had previously owned it at weblogs Inc. and I didn't sell it to AOL  because they wanted to shut down all the blog posts about hacking time Warner  cable boxes which is quite reasonable considering time Warner is an AOL company  yeah yeah right so we didn't sell to them so Mahalo actually owns hackaday  you know and hackaday breaks even it you know pays for the people who write for  it but if there were other blogs that we could buy I would consider it or other  sites that are search related because a lot of the search companies don't know  how to build a brand and we've actually that's one of the things we've done

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  pretty well you know is is it impossible to get more money nowadays or is all

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that venture money that's gone the venture the venture money is still there  what's gonna happen is venture capitalists are starting to circle the  wagons and so what they what they're doing is they're looking back in their  portfolio and saying which one of these companies are gonna survive I have to  allocate all the money I have left to my companies my children as opposed to  maybe adopting more kids which would be the metaphor would be to invest in other  people so all the VCs are calling each other right now saying hey will you  invest in my B round for this company or the C round for this company and people  are like well I don't really know if that's gonna make it so you know I would

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  say the flip side of that is it really depends on the kind of money that you're  looking for because if you're the sort of person that wants to do a tech company  and it's looking for you know say less than a million dollars to get started  there are still a lot of opportunities to raise that kind of money out there at  the moment because there are a lot of you know sort of high net worth  individuals who are still want to invest angel funding they ain't gonna put it on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the stock market right now yeah I would imagine there's a lot of people

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  sitting on cash looking for so the prospect of investing in an internet  business that's you know probably kind of risky but no more risky than putting  it in the stock market right now and potentially with huge returns it's quite  attractive to a lot of people in the sort of million dollar range what's it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  look like in the UK right now well are you seeing the same kind of people  hunkering down getting ready for the nuclear winner well a little bit but not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  quite to the same degree I think you know I think what's driven it all in the  States has been this huge problem with the with the housing markets and we  haven't had that to quite the same extent in the UK we've had you know the  sort of dodgy loans and banks being bailed out and things but not not the  same amount really so things are comparatively better there's not really  the feeling over here at the moment is that there's lots of sort of hype about  it and lots people sort of saying oh my you know Christmas is canceled and all  you know all these kind of things we don't know that when you actually look  at it people are sort of thinking well actually my life hasn't got that much  worse my groceries went up a little bit but now the cost of petrol is coming  down so the price of petrol here is now like the lowest it's been for us six

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  months same here it's dropping well the cost of oil how much is it there it's  94 pence a liter well 94 pence a liter that's about the same as here it's about  three bucks a gallon how many liters to don't get me doing that  metrics there you're in San Francisco you're part of the kind of the San  Francisco elite elite web 2.0 crowd is it gloomy in the city yeah well okay it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  definitely depends on where you work but but yeah I mean people are worried

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  people are really worried there are layoffs here and there seismic laid off  a few people I mean you these smaller companies but they're still laying off

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  smaller yeah but I mean it's like you know we're all we're all reading the  same valley wag articles I mean everyone knows what's going on you know as it's  happening and and the startup world is definitely shaking in its boots you know  I've not having been to New York in a while I can't really speak for anything  but San Francisco but I can imagine that you know people are worried everywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jason why do you say this is worse than the dot-boom bust very simple if you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  look at the last bubble it was based upon companies having too much money and  spending it too freely so their balance sheets were out of whack they were  spending more than they were making they got over aggressive so you had a large  amount of investment in dot-coms and they were doing things like buying  Super Bowl commercials and renting huge offices and hiring a thousand people  with no chance of catching up to that amount of burn that amount of capital  being spent this time it's not the companies that have bad balance sheets

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and we didn't have all these IPOs this time around I think that would protect us

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it does that's why you're not seeing a bunch of companies laying off more  people that's why you're not seeing a bunch of companies explode it could be  worse much worse absolutely well I mean listen it's not like you know revision  three what do they have what do you have 15 people there 20 people maybe full  time yeah so I mean 30 is actually kind of high for that that size company but  it's not like it's like a hundred if this had been the dot-com error it would

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  be pseudo dot-com let's use Twitter as an example and here's the poster child  for web 2.0 no revenue model none in sight lots of employees doesn't matter

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they have three years of capital I mean laid off a few people not that many but  it's you know they had 80 employees what do they do I mean I mean I like I mean  I you know I think they don't even know what they do and they have more than  twice as much music music music community but they're they're killing it I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  mean I mean has they're everywhere that's for sure they have a huge number  of people coming to that site I mean I'm trying to remember what their  uniques are I'm looking it up on Qancast right now but it's a lot but anyway so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is that enough if you have a lot of uniques if Twitter's got three million  in its community is that enough to survive in other words with the people  and would the people who invested in Twitter or revision three or my meme  would they let it die I guess at that at this point Twitter absolutely not there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  just too many users using it there's too much value there and it's still growing  so no I mean it's not in any trouble so but you asked what was the fundamental  difference so last time it was companies had bad balance sheets this time it's  individuals have bad balance sheets and individuals that you know are two-thirds  of the spending in this country that that's what drives our spending in this  country is consumers consumers got way ahead of themselves a lot of them own  homes homes that are underwater their you know mortgage is greater than the  cost of the home now they can't sell it they're losing jobs all that kind of  stuff so it will take a company maybe I don't know six months 12 months 18 months  to get their balance sheet in order an individual who has got a million dollars  owed on their house and they can only you know sell it for six hundred thousand  or something those people have no hope of ever balancing their you know  balancing their checkbook balancing their their debt which means you're gonna  see a lot of people go bankrupt and consumers are really scared so this is  a group belt tightening effect that occurs so people read value wag or the  Wall Street Journal or TechCrunch they see all the cuts they know friends who  have cut and so I'm sure everybody on this phone call has put off buying  something not because they don't have the money because they wouldn't feel  right doing it and that emotional state is occurring across the entire economy  with even very affluent people who are just like it doesn't feel right to buy a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  new car no you're exactly right you're exactly right one of the things we've  been talking about earlier today is I'd like to have a twit we'll take the twit  house the twit cottage and do one of those big Christmas displays where the  thing goes in sync to the music and I can have the twit album art and stuff it  cost about five grand to do it and and it's not that we didn't have the five  grand but I thought that's I couldn't do it it's ostentatious it's like thumbing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  your nose at people exactly so you know when this this tightening effect is  going to occur where three less people are working at you know a retailer or

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  what will be the bellwether will it be a bad sales Christmas will it be Black

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Friday fourth quarter is a disaster I know already because I know because I  know a lot of people who actually make merchandise and then sell it what  happens is there when you are a manufacturer let's say you make you know  diaper bags or something like that for Target or you know a tea set for Target  you actually have to get you get a letter of credit from your bank right to  float that expense to send it to Target. Target can't move your stuff the bank's  not giving you a letter of credit so there's actually tons of product that  are just stuck like stuck in China stuck in factories stuck in storage spaces  where they're not going to make it to even retail and then what happens is  you'll see retailers go out of business this fourth quarter when the retailers  go out of business they flood the market with inventory so then you know you know  Hank and Barry's or whatever that one is the sports store they went bankrupt a  bunch of people have gone bankrupt then all that product goes on the market and  it makes it really difficult for the strong retailers to compete because this  whole this stuff flooded on the market combine that with people not wanting to  spend because they feel guilty or they don't have the money and it just becomes  a you know this ripple effect and it's already started and it's going to  continue into next year and it's going to be a major disaster the stock market  it's going to take a major hit in the fourth quarter like yeah and yeah so get

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  out of the stock market is that your advice I think the stock market the Dow

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  will trade at 85 I said the bottom of the Dow was 8500 plus or minus 10 plus  or minus 10% I believe is the Dow that's a thing now 10% is a pretty good swing so  that means you know 870 700 up to 9500 it would be in that range for the next

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  two years is my belief I'm hearing a lot of people saying that saying you're not  going to see a sudden resurgence it's going to stay at this whatever bottom is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  at this level for a while but also just to say you know what I think what you  are pointing out Leo which is that as much as anything this is partly a kind  of group think fact yeah where you know a lot of people have still got the money  a lot of people have not been hit as hard as other people you know you've got  your money to do your Christmas display but for whatever reason whether it's  fear of being ostentatious or you know just sort of adhering to mentality is or

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  thinking I may not get my money I may not get them a chance at that money ever  again and better better hold on to it just a case so it's so in some ways it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  not as although it is as bad it's not as bad as it could be I suppose

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Microsoft's quarterly results offer hope to tech sector a rare glimmer of hope to  Wall Street this week what Microsoft's net profits 4.37 billion for the three  months ending September 30th that's compared to 4.29 the year before revenue  15.06 billion nine percent up and yet people are saying still bad news  Microsoft's forecasts are poor Apple had a great quarter Apple said sales of the  iPhone six point nine million they made a you know a ton of money net profit of  683 pounds I'll do that for you will I mean things things are going good and  yet both companies have are saying but don't count on this lasting so I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's interesting to note that they know the headline number for Microsoft is the  quarter one was up 10% right 10 cent in his revenue in quarter one despite you  know vista the sort of so-called so it's a good quarter so why did my why did

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Apple stock tank when that news came out well I mean if you if you look at the  price earnings ratios of these companies they're still in the 12 to 15 range and  during you know like a brutal depression you know prolonged recession they go  down to like eight or nine from what I understand and that would be like the  start buying opportunities and you know they've been trading at 20 GE is it eight  yeah so but that's because we don't know how much their earnings will take a hit so that eight  sounds really low unless their earnings are coming off are gonna fall off a cliff and if that's the  case then the earnings could continue to drop they can continue to make cuts and it doesn't  move anywhere so that shows you how pessimistic people are and in great in down markets great  companies build market share so in some ways Apple and Microsoft will be fine they're both  gonna you know take market share the bottom for me when you see Google do layoffs yeah Google's  just kind of sailing along a Google has never had a layoff ever right and in order to make their  number this quarter supposedly they cut like 250 million dollars in capital expenditures and they  turn that dial well you know he knows about nobody knows about the secret dial but the the the fact  that they cut the way they hit their earnings number numbers from what I've read is by cutting  costs so when you see companies that are great companies cutting costs in order to make their  number as opposed to it being you know growth etc that's when you know there's a slowdown coming  so when Apple and Google start laying people off or curtail hiring which they've already announced  they're going to do that's when you know things that's their way of saying that's my way of finding  the bottom I think the bottom is when Google lays people off so watch for watch for that and now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the New York Times parsed Microsoft's quarterly profits announcement and said here's the problem  the Windows unit reported only a 2% rise in revenue and a 4% decline in operating income  which still means a lot of revenue well yeah in the billions in with a B yeah but what they're  saying and they I think this might be true is that the problem in with is that Vista take  up is not very good and that people are moving to the less expensive netbooks which often don't  run Vista usually run XP or Linux worse for Microsoft so these sub $500 netbooks are becoming  more and more popular about a quarter now of the of the PC although although it's worth noting that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the one of the the best performing divisions in Microsoft that quarter with the entertainment and  devices the historically unprofitable Xbox 360 and zoom market and so the Xbox 360 didn't really  change much from last year but it's but the quote that I'm reading is that the the numbers  were buoyed by sales of software for the Mac and zoom and boba can you believe it so the  entertainment and devices went up 51% 51% based primarily on Mac and zoom you have a 51% of a  buck is only still a buck 51 well it's it's 216 million all right the billions all right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  all right all right well I don't want to I don't want everybody listening to show to get depressed

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so I'm depressed I know it's kind of sad well there's actually a lot of silver linings to it  I mean I'm actually writing an email about this that I haven't finished yet but maybe I'll finish  it after the show today just basically like this is when value is created you know I my first company  Silicon Island reporter I started in 96 and built in 96 97 98 weblogs Inc Gawker Twitter  delicious stumble upon flicker those were all you know 2003 2004 kind of companies again the  down market so you know you can have one of the great moments of creativity comes when people  are unemployed and you know they're not looking to get paid they're looking to or get rich they're  looking to just do something interesting and I think that's what we're entering the third golden  age of technology you know in terms of the internet the first was in 96 95 96 97 when people just did  it for the fun of it 2002 2003 2004 when blogs and social media web 2.0 was built again for the  fun of it just because people were looking for interesting things to do well that's what I've

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  been saying is that yeah okay times are tough but this doesn't mean that innovators the kids  getting out of MIT and Stanford just say oh forget it I'm gonna go work at Burger King they  they continue to innovate they just go into a garage and they invent stuff and you know people  gave McCain a really hard time for saying the fundamentals of the economy are strong but to be  honest the thing that makes this country successful is that innovation that that spirit that doesn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  go away in tough times no actually and then it actually increases because people have more free  time I mean if you look at what happened just in your own world when tech TV imploded that's  when Kevin Rose started doing dig right and built it for $6,000 what happened Peter Ross you know  I think got laid off from red herring or red herring imploded that's when he started gizmodo and then  came to work with us on engadget you know what happens when really talented people have nothing  to do is they build something really interesting and so if it wasn't for the down market the last  time I don't think weblogs Inc or delicious Josh Schecter's company stumble upon isn't that  interesting those things wouldn't have been built because those people would have been busy working

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for the man dig wouldn't have happened right Sarah I mean Kevin can get Kevin invented dig  while he was at tech TV but he would never have had the time to throw into it for he was a G he  was I think was still San Francisco but then he was a G for when you would know that LA he was in LA G

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  before and I tried to be the definitive expert on this I think so he was in LA when he had the idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for dig but it was yeah but it was and he quit shortly after I remember we had he was on the show

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  he said I'm gonna leave I mean there was definitely some overlap when he was trying to figure out if  it was and he not left he would never have had time to make it oh never he had to leave I mean he  wanted to anyway but he would have had to make a choice and obviously it was really really the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  right one in retrospect I guess I tried to buy it from I took him to lunch in Santa Monica and  had sushi like yeah I said I it's that's the sort of backstory to the whole thing was you know I  I realized it was sending like a thousand people to engage it every time somebody got on the  homepage and I was like this will put dig buttons on the entire web logs Inc network which was much  bigger than dig at the time and I was like listen I want to buy half of it two million bucks make it  four million dollar valuation we want to get you know give you 25% cash or 25% you know equity  whatever I wanted to make it a web logs Inc property and he was like well my friend knows  Marc Andreessen and he might invest and I guess that's when he met Jay and lucky for him he didn't  do the deal with me and he did the deal with Jay I don't know so lucky I would have I mean I don't  know he would have definitely if he became part of what's long saying would have made a couple  million dollars but I think he's done much better doing his own thing speaking of Inc he's on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  cover of Inc this week yeah wow first business week and now Inc. Have you seen the other like  the inside the magazine it's the foot does Ian a gatefold yeah well it's one of a fireplace

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  spare skin rug no it's it's a bunch of people chasing him down the street you're kidding no

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  yeah I'm not you see London I was in London with him for FOA yeah and he did a dig you know we  both spoke at the same conference he did a live dig nation and it was packed with people and then  they had an after party and there were so many people trying to get to him and Alex that they  created like a VIP area for him where you know it was along these stairs and a balcony and they  couldn't let him walk through the restaurant alone because it like Bono or Jesus Christ or  something like a hundred a hundred people would collapse on him literally can you feel the jealousy

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  club tremendous amount of money so I think if she stopped doing the book club publishers all  over the world broke down in tears she was making it. She should hopefully do an Oprah version of  the Kindle that comes with hard ten favorite books and charge an extra $99 for it that would  be the dope move I'm absolutely sure that will happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a lot of people who watch Oprah are gonna get it home and go huh I think what the Kindle needs

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  is another spin it needs just another go around the block just a slightly nicer hardware design  and another sort of marketing push and I think I think you know with Oprah it's kind of got like  three-quarters of the way there to mainstream and I think if they just re-spin it and do another  push on it they could really put it over the top you know the iPod wasn't big until the second or

Transcript:  is prop eight oh we get to that in a second I just want to Jerry brace in our chat room said  she auto exec dot batted his head in little does little does humor to make sure that the geeks are  still awake so she control or deleted him Friday probably this is actually a little bit controversial  well with some anyway prop 8 is a California state proposition California we have this kind  of weird proposition referendum thing that is not very hard to get something on the ballot  the problem is that people were upset with the state legislature for not getting anything done so  they put this mechanism in where the voters get to just throw anything up there and everybody has  to decide it this prop 8 is a yes vote on it overturns California state law and adds a  constitutional amendment saying it's illegal for anybody to get married if they're not a man and  a woman in other words gay marriage and this is confusing by itself a yes vote says no to  gay marriage a no vote says yes to gay marriage so that's good this is you already see the problem  here so Apple which Apple you know Apple is a very you know Steve Jobs is a liberal guy and he's a  vegan his wife I know his wife wanted to start a I think I don't know if she did a vegan food  company oh yeah yeah no they're there he's very hip Apple is a very as a is a has always had good  you know workplace rules for what do they call it partners domestic domestic partnership they  have great domestic partnership benefits so they've always been promoted that but it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  not the thing you would you would sort of expect from this company about the same time it's quite

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google also put money into this it's about time because the fact is the fact that we're even  having this discussion this day and age is just people gonna look back 20 30 40 years from now  and be be like how could anybody not speak up when people's fundamental rights were being taken  away from them rights it's unbelievable like but as a business it's a little risky because there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  are some various people there are there are people who feel very strongly about this issue  and I'm sure they're you know the Christian right is big on boycotts I'm sure there'll be a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  boycott against Apple yeah but you know what I think that at a certain point there'll be a  tipping point where it's like okay you have all these middle American folks who you know are  against gay marriage but they have gay people in their families and they watch Ellen DeGeneres  and you know they like Lindsay Lohan if she's in get if she's gay or not exactly is going on  Leo come on oh yeah what's the name of this woman Samantha Ronson anyway oh my god my hopes  and dreams yes yeah she's probably by I think we've got the show by the way Lindsay Lohan is  gay I don't think they're actually going out on part of a land too hard of a limb here you know  the fundamentalists are such a small group of people even though they're vocal you're at a  certain point smart people the world have to speak up and go you know what enough you know like let

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  people they want to be married be married I think there's a great quote from the chat room which  is you know what gay people have as much right to be miserable as other married people I've never

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really never really understood this man as a woman thing you know what they're doing though  in the ads here in California it's one of the reasons this is actually a very close vote believe  it or not the the no on eight people had a strong lead that's been eroded away and the polls say now  one of the reasons they've run ads that are a little scurrilous in which they say hey if this  law passes or rather if it if it doesn't pass which is very confused I mean half the people  are gonna vote wrong just because they don't understand what they're gonna say yes yes on  gay marriage no it's yes vote is a no on gay marriage and anyway the ads say if we don't pass  this then kids as young as you know kindergartners will have to be taught about gays marrying and  that's I guess that scares people I don't know why if you if you had if you had gay parents as a  kindergartner I would think that this would be a good thing right anyway it is I think it's a brave  thing for both Apple and Google to do and do so publicly Apple put a hundred thousand into it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  yeah it's awesome it's to be commended and everybody else should get a line by the way the book I was  talking about before Leo I hate to do an audible ad in the middle of the show but the post American

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  World by Fareed Zakari oh Fareed Zakari is a Newsweek great Newsweek author he has a CNN

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  show that's fantastic this book is amazing I mean he really is breaking down on the book exactly  what is going on in the world and after I just did a three-week trip Athens London Korea man it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is the world is changing radically well you know I I believe that I travel a lot and I'm making sure  my kids travel a lot because I think the world they're growing up into is a global world and  you know our business at twit is 30% of our audience now is outside of the US it's a very  global business and I think this is the future 30% huh yeah we're not talking about offshoring jobs  we're talking about the fact that it's a global economy now we're talking 35% of your audience is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  outside the US I you would not believe people know me as much for the company as I've done or the  Crunch 50 as for twit at this point when I went to Athens they had an open coffee there were 250  300 people there I would say half the people who came up to me said yeah Dvorak slash org.blog when  I was in London people are like after I was at the Dignation recording and like as we're walking  out people like do Dvorak do Dvorak you know it's like I'm like nah I'm not gonna do it nah you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  now I know why John won't be on with you it's that lousy impression. Oh that impression is spreading so much

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's incredible in Korea people are like I love you on twit oh that's really great and I had the same  experience in Australia I told you about the guy who on the plane like it's like wants to take a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  picture with me because he knows me from twit well and I'm not using this as a way to tout  twit but I think it's an example of the fact that if you allow your business to be global it absolutely  will be global and it's interesting because here we are this is an English language broadcast in  many of those countries Korea Greece they don't English is not their first language and yet they

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  listen. For people under 20 years old in those countries they all speak English now and they  want to know about tech. And they're yeah it the the English language the spreading of the English  language is truly gonna be amazing because this is amazing amazing advantage for companies in the  US like Dignation is probably has as many people watching it outside the US as inside. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that's really interesting that Kevin gets that response in London I mean that that's a very

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  bigger response than he would in the US I think. And I should point out the tech TV well I guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  we were seen in Britain but not by a lot of people I mean tech TV was not a particularly  global phenomenon and yet a lot of the people. I don't think we could even get tech TV in Britain

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure that. I remember Malaysia though. We were huge. We were big in Malaysia. And there was a club in Abu

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dhabi. I don't remember that. It was a little tech TV club. Oh really? Yeah they would gather and they would watch the show. Philippines? I remember we used to get a lot of food. We were big in the Philippines, Net24 broadcast. It's a huge business opportunity for

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  twit I mean and for Dignation they had Virgin sponsored they did two shows over there. Right. You could it's  gonna translate into dollars and cents. Well what's interesting is advertising is not yet global it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  very much at best national usually regional sometimes local. And so it's very hard for us to sell ads based on our international numbers we actually cut our numbers by 25 percent when we sell our ads because. It's gonna change. It should. I mean audibles everywhere. Dell was everywhere. Visas everywhere. So they get benefit but they don't you know the agency is only an American agency. So they. No no what's gonna happen is there is actually Google AdSense is operating now in these countries. Overture has been operating in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And there are ad buyers. So I remember at Weblogs Inc. We started getting people emailing us saying can we buy your Canadian traffic from you for five dollars CPM and we'll resell it for you know 25 or whatever. So we started doing that and I basically put out a standing offer. I tell people you know give me five dollars for each unit and you can do whatever you want with it as long as it's you know within you know tasteful means and that's gonna happen. People will come to you and say can I keep compete. Can people download the show or auto install it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then they'll sort the ads that technology is all being built right now. Yeah unfortunately our ads are really based around this kind of live read that we do and that may not translate well to that kind of thing. But I don't care. I'm happy doing what I'm doing. You'll wind up you'll wind up doing you'll have a licensee. So that would be the way to do it. Yeah that's a good idea. Yeah that's that's what we do with the radio show. We license it to internationally and they take the we take the ads out but they put their own ads in so they pay a cash cash outlay for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So if you're a policy or the Guardian or you know the Times of London or any of those people and just say would you like to syndicate the show they'll put it on their website with their ads and just charge them a fee. Yeah it'll work. I guarantee it. And it's going to be easier and easier to do as the infrastructure is built out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've got you know I think for the British ads I actually can do I think I have a I just are putting these bad teeth and I say oh my oh I'd like to sell you some candy. I think that go well wouldn't it well. Hello I'm Gordon Ramsey for Twitter this week in tech. Oh they're so don't be a donkey.

Transcript:  You know 10 grand a month is a hundred and don't confuse this with go to meeting another of their products where you could do this the sales meetings. That's really cool.  As go to my PC. This allows you to access your office computer. Same technology Citrix really. These are the guys. I remember at Yakubuchi for customer support to like your training. Yes. Oh I use it with my mom.  Right. So this we mean that's what I'm talking about. You could go and take over somebody's PC train them how to use the software walk. Oh no it's great for that. And because you know mom's not going to get through the firewall and the security I put on but she doesn't have to go to my PC.  It completely securely configures itself to go through them. They use a very basically a triangle method so that you're outbound on both edges. You geeks know what I mean. It is an absolutely secure safe and easy way. I want you to use it free go to my PC dot com slash twit.  That's all you have to know. Go to my PC dot com slash twit 30 days. Absolutely free. You got a Google phone yet Jason.  I don't have one but I was playing with it yesterday actually. What do you think. It's a beautiful screen. Yeah it's much better than I expected frankly. Great keyboard. I've seen somebody work on these. I love the way this. It feels good. Well you used a sidekick. I was a sidekick user.  Weren't you a sidekick user for a while Sarah? Yeah I was. And it's the same guy. Ruben the guy who designed this for Google. I like this a lot better than the sidekick. It's much better. It's a grown up sidekick. Yeah. Yeah. But kind of the same feel when you slide it up. The keyboard is excellent. The build is good. HTC did a really solid build on this. Android is a good operating system. It's fast. The touch screen is good. I wish there were more apps but that's going to happen soon right. And you know applications like you know that the people at iTunes won't approve will be  available. Exactly. You know it's like this is really going to force. I think there's a serious threat to the iPhone because I looked at it and I was like this is not much different than my iPhone. And if I can get some. I'm telling your wife. Whoops. Just press. She's sorry. She's in Mexico. Press the red button. She'll never know. Sorry Jennifer. The phone rings in Mexico. Don't pick it up. Just Sarah playing with her phone. Yeah it's easy. You see I made those buttons on the front. That's what the program called AnyCut that allows you to dial or text somebody right from the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  front which I really love. So already there's some interesting third party stuff. It doesn't come with a video player. Weird. But somebody wrote one. Somebody wrote. That's the cool thing. Why can't I use you stream on my iPhone or you know quick on my iPhone. And you know it's going to happen. It's going to happen on this thing I think. And you know the iPhone no matter no matter what they do they're still going to start charging 200 or 300 dollars for that device. So this device is going to wind up being free I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's 179 from T-Mobile is the negative because T-Mobile's third generation wireless data network isn't very good yet. Not very widespread. So I'm using edge here but it works great with Wi-Fi. I'll tell you where the real downfall is. And it's the same problem with the iPhone. Three hours battery life. I mean it dies. You can't get it through the day. I mean I can't deal with that. It's a tough problem. I can't. No it does have a USB power adapter as opposed to the proprietary adapter on the iPhone. So I just have little USB plugs everywhere. You can even charge it from your

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  computer but it doesn't have great battery life and I have to say that just kills me. There is something about it too that you know it feels great but it doesn't feel like an iPhone. And I don't I'm not trying to be like a snobby apple person. I don't even have an iPhone. I'm still rocking the Blackberry Pro which is not really working out for me anymore.  Bold comes out tomorrow. The storm will be out soon. Here's the iPhone. Yeah. Compare the two and see you know. There's this. There's an elegance to the iPhone. There's the elegance. Yeah. You know I don't want to say sexiness because everybody says that. No it's elegant. I don't think this phone is sexy but it is elegant. Yeah. I think that's that's probably the exactly right word and that's Steve Jobs. He's got good taste. He's got good taste. That vegan. I hear he's a piscitarian. Has anyone ever gone on a bathroom break during Twit before? Please do. Thank you. You know why when you do take off the microphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. We don't want to. No. Yeah. Too much information. And when we do that by the way I say actually I was the first to do it and all we do is we say another twit is in the can. Let's. Now you were a big G. You were a big iPhone guy. Well are you excited about the G1. Will it be available in the UK. Yes it's available here right now. I am not overly excited because the thing that really gets me going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  About my iPhone is is the iTunes integration. Right. This is not a media. This is emphatically not a media player. And so I've got used to the last. I mean that's over the last couple of years. I went a couple of years last year. I've become used to just having my one device that is my phone and my PDA and my my iPod. And so this is not going to be an iPod replacement. So it's not really interesting to me. It does have. I like this. It comes with the application to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  buy on the Amazon MP3 store customized for the phone works very well. I bought the police for five dollars. You know it's very easy to use downloads right to the phone. The phone stores it on the SD card unprotected easily accessed. So there's an advantage but it just doesn't. The media player is just not as good. And mostly for me is. Yeah. Is that the iPod or rather the iPhone. The advantages in the ecosystem is in the software on the desktop. Well you got to look at the Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's pretty obvious where this is going right. Where Android is going. Oh yeah. Right. I mean this is going to be a desktop operating system. I mean it's so obvious. It already is. Well I mean in the sense that this is I would say this is a great OS. Now it's Linux right. I mean it's not like. It's a Linux. But I mean it's got this whole runtime on top of it. But you know the real future of computing right now is not mobile and it's not desktops. It's it's that space in between. I don't consider the iPhone a phone as much as I consider it like a small laptop.  And these netbooks are people getting excited. Imagine the iPhone with maybe twice as big a screen and you could still fit it in your pocket. That's what's coming. I completely agree. Apple's going to make one. Everybody else is going to make one. And I bet you that you know if you think about people's usage 90 percent of what people do is in a browser. 90 percent. So why do you think that? Which is actually amazing when you think about it because if you consider what we were doing with computers you know 10 years ago before the Internet was sort of mainstream. When you load up a computer

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  now without the Internet you're like what do I do. It's a door who knows what to do when they haven't got the Internet connection. It is. It's a calculator. It's bizarre isn't it because there was a time when we didn't have the Internet and we used computers. You'd open up your book of CD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well you'd open up your book of CD-ROMs and then you would put in your Voyager CD for the Beatles Hard Day Night and then you would look at photos of the Beatles. Yeah it's really. Do you remember Encarta. Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is one application in here that may in a way spell something else. They put a decent phone. It's a three megapixel camera. Three megapixel camera with focus with autofocus. And there are three now barcode applications that allow me to take it into a store scan the barcode on anything practically.  And it then looks up alternate locations and prices for that for that that item. And I think that's very cool. Let me see if I can do that here with this book. So I've got a barcode right there. It takes a second to register it. It buzzes at you. And then now it's going to look up the book. This is compare everywhere. There's another one too. It's going to look up the book. Oh it said it couldn't find it. All right. Let me let me. That's the first time that's happened. But it's it's it's very cool.  Very it's been very good at finding stuff. That's kind of cool where you take a phone into a store you get the retailer to show you some stuff how it works. And they say let me just take a picture of that scan it and then you find out where you can get it cheaper.  And then you turn it over and you show it to the retailer and they give you the best deal. There you go. I like that. So did you know that I can go to this this program it's kind of interesting does in fact because it knows your location say here's the nearest place it's selling it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So and that's pretty nice. Yeah. I mean you've got to imagine that Google is really hot on the location specific stuff in a way that the iPhone is still not quite yet. Well I would say it's a parody with the iPhone on this. I mean you know there's some street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a compass in this too. So the street view it's kind of a maze. Yeah. Knows where you are. That's like the tone she got demonstration from TechCrunch. Yeah. Like it was where you are and it's showing you what's in front of you.  Somebody showed me that yesterday. It was pretty cool. It's very cool. This is no doubt in my mind that this will be a Windows Media Center and a desktop computer in the next year. Interesting. So this is the Google operating system. OK. This is the Google operating system. Absolutely. Just on you know smaller footprint devices. They'll just build on this because they got the browser now. They got the operating system. They got people developing for it. This is this is a shot across the bow of Windows and Mac. You know we're going to compete with you and Google.  Is not afraid to compete with anybody anymore. Now they're like we're going to do a browser. We're going to compete with Firefox and IE. We're going to do an operating system for phones which also happens to run on laptops and will run on your computer television set. I mean it's pretty clear what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know if somebody's only used a phone before when they start to see the kinds of functionality you can get out of something like this. I just looked up a book by scanning the barcode. I found the nearest store that sells it. I've got a phone number here I can call. I can show the map. I can also find a cheaper price online. Where is the nearest store. Well it says it's in Santa Rosa which is wrong. Well it's looking at Barnes and Noble. So the database doesn't have our local independent bookstore which is depressing. That's annoying but not really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's the other thing that's really interesting about this stuff. If I look at people who are carrying around a phone that is just a phone and you think you know you put something you just want to put something in front of them and just say have you seen all this new stuff you can do. I don't think that's true. I think there are a lot of people on the Internet. I think there are a lot of people who just want to make a call. Don't you. Well I think you only just want that when you haven't experienced what else you can have. Sarah doesn't even want to make a call. Honestly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They can call it now and I will not pick up unless I know the caller ID. And if you call me it goes directly to voicemail. The voicemail gets sent to some outsourcing place outside the country and they transcribe it. And then they email you an MP3 file with the transcribed.  How much. How much does that cost. Who knows. I'll check. I'm on the site right now. I think it's 20 bucks a month or something. Here it is.  It is. It is 30. Look at now. Now people are starting to call me. Thanks. I shouldn't have said. How do they have your phone number. I put my phone number out there. This is a 7 1 7 number. So I'm going to send it directly to voicemail.  But 30 bucks for unlimited 40 is 10. That's probably what I would use. I don't get more than 40 messages. You just do it 35 cents a message. If you were to get 20 a month that's seven bucks. You know that's not if you want to.  And then and then you get it as text so you don't have to say I never check my voicemail because the groovy thing is if you put your if you give them your address book they do the caller ID and they make the reply to the email address.  So if I had you in there I had your phone. I hit reply on the message that they send me. Boom. It's got the transcript. You do that with your iPhone. How do you do that. I do it my Blackberry and my iPhone. I carry probably work with the G one. I'm sure it would.  It's got email. It's to say it's doing is forwarding your call to their number. And then some and they transcribe it within like a minute. So you know I'll be in a meeting I'll send somebody to voicemail in the same meeting I go check my Blackberry I see OK my wife called and she wants me to pick up the dry cleaning whatever you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's phone tag dot com. Now is this kind of company going to serve this kind of company has nothing to worry about with a downfall. This company is a revenue. They've got a good revenue model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know that I know that I met the guys from this effort started using it and they're killing it. They're making a lot of money. So they have no problem. How about the shot. Now John was free for a long time. They're now starting to charge for premium. Can you go from free to premium.  Yes you can. I mean actually the person who did it most brilliantly during the Dow market was Scott Heiferman of meetup dot com. Oh yeah. Meetup dot com has been charging. They have I know their revenue numbers I can't say but they're making millions of dollars a year off of their paid service.  And they are profitable. They offer a free and then premium. Is that how they're doing it. No they charge the people who are hosting the groups I think. And anybody who joins the group is free. There goes another phone call. That's great.  And they're doing it. They're killing it. Wall Street Journal has hundreds of thousands if not a million subscribers. They're killing it. So Twitter could immediately Twitter can immediately be profitable if they put ads like the Japanese version has in it.  And they can. I mean I wouldn't tune out of Twitter just because they had ads. That wouldn't stop me. Here's if they want to make money. All they have to do is let people subscribe to a professional version with no ads. Right. So they should put a leaderboard in a medium rectangle and text ads on every page tomorrow. Then you should be able to pay for private groups ie Yammer and you should be able to pay for metrics like being able to and being able to put JavaScript on your page. So I would like to put JavaScript on my page put my own ads design it myself.  Google Analytics on my Twitter page. So basically if you want to soup up your page like you pay 50 bucks a year or five bucks a month. And if you want to. Yeah I like your. I mean they would have a thousand. So so I imagine that they're going to do something like that. We talked last week about ever replacing Alex.  Do you Jack or Jack I'm sorry do you have any insight into what happened there. I know both of the guys over there. I know the investors are over there. I think we've got a firing. No no no I think the company's done fantastic and there are there's a time for a tech based CEO and a first stage CEO.  And there's a time for a second stage CEO. So my guess is you know Jack's done such a great job of getting the company to where it is today that the next phase of it's going to be like the business phase of it. Maybe they wanted somebody who was a little more business focused and tech focused but you know nobody gives them credit for the fact that they've fixed the scaling problem.  They sure have. It works well now. In fact it survived all the debates very well. Yeah. It's a great product. So I mean there's a lot of haters out there. It's like eBay had tons of problem of uptime. You know all the great sites have uptime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Problems are in their peak or almost all of them. So I think they're going to do just fine. There's a guy in our stick him chat is claimed to be Kevin Rose. I have it is it is. Yeah he Twitter. Well Kevin why don't you call us. I know Kevin rock star. Talk to his agent. Yeah.  Oh no he has to have somebody protect him against the crowd. It was crazy. Let me call him. You know what's funny too is that Kevin is always not on Skype. Kevin got on Skype. He's on I am. Yeah but he's not on. He doesn't watch the Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He watches his Skype. Oh man people are putting Kevin's I am in the chat room. Don't do that people. There he is. Well he can turn off. I don't care if people know my I am either. You just turn off everybody that's. Yeah. Yeah that's what I do. Yeah. I mean it's you can guess my I am. Kevin was. Hello Kevin. Hello. Hello. He's always got to steal my thunder. It couldn't let well enough alone. Sit back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We had to be. First of all no no. It's true. Sarah Sarah I am me and she's like you should get in here. Oh lies. It was her idea. Because you you created. So Kevin they were talking about we were they these other guys I wasn't saying anything because I'm just insanely jealous. We're talking about a your ink cover. Pretty cool. Oh thank you. It's respect. Respect. And then the and the incredible Eric Clapton is God like treatment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They gave you at FOA. FOA was nuts. FOA was a lot of fun though. I had you know. Is it getting more. Are you getting is the fan stuff increasing. I was listening to you guys a few minutes ago and I think you're absolutely right that internationally you know there's a there's a lot more fans out there it seems. You know we do stuff in the states and you'll have four or five hundred people come out but you do it over in London and it's a couple thousand plus. That's really interesting. Why. Will why do you have an insight into that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah because if you're in the states and sort of dignations maybe going around a bunch of different states you can wait for to come to your home state in England it's going to be London or nothing. So people travel from all over England to come down also because it's a much smaller and denser place than a lot of places in the U.S. But you don't think that people are more rabid. Well it's also pent up. You got the whole year like it's the one time that Kevin comes over. So you know you get the whole 12 months in a two day thing. You know it was you should have seen it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There were kids like you know a not a 10 year old kids 12 year old kids 14 year old kids like dig you know on their forehead dig shirts dig tattoos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin you need colors so that people can paint themselves the dig colors.  Kevin has anyone ever met you and cried. I've had that happen to me. Have you. Yeah. Wow. Many times. Sarah that happens to you all the time. Please. No you've had it happen I'm sure. They cry. Somebody comes up to you and they can't they can't. They cry because I'm a lot shorter than they thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're my biggest fan. No I think the one thing I get them. You've had somebody walk up to one thing I get is how small you are so much smaller than you look on TV TV makes you big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You look big here because of the perspective you look like you're bigger than me. Well I think the Internet celebrity thing is starting to. I think there's a couple of people like Kevin Perez Hilton who are like starting to cross over like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well that was the interesting thing this week. Britney Spears showed up on Twitter and everybody said OK. Twitter is now that's the Britney moment the transition and she's got like 5000 followers nowhere near and she'll never catch Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She could. No I don't think so. But the thing is that people know it's really Kevin. It's clearly not really Britney. No it's Britney. I think it's somebody who works with Britney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well it's Britney and her PR agency and they all sign it. I think they've actually done something very intelligent when it's her she says it's her when it's her PR person. Look at look at the it's the real Britney. All right. All right.  But I think she doesn't even know the password. I talk about Britney a lot more than I want to. No no I think it's really her. She says like I'm taking the kids to the pumpkin patch now. See but it would be so easy for someone to do that. I don't think Britney's on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's not doing it herself. I don't think so either. I think she will. You will just like I mean the same thing happened with my space but there are they actually for better or worse published their my space blogs without clearing it with their PR people like Lindsay Lohan does that all the time and gets herself in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that where is that how you found out about her thing that she's like dating that. No like low TMS.  No that's like really big news. Well it's kind of old news. I don't really care. But so but I know Kevin's broken up about it. So I just think that Kevin's going to always be bigger than Britney on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know. You know it's 50,000 fans is a lot or 30 or 40 or 50. But when you start talking Britney Spears level like she might have a couple of hundred thousand people in her.  Maybe fan club who don't even know what this yet she might have some of these celebrities have hundreds of thousands of emails on their list or they have I don't know what 500,000 a million friends on my space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well that's going to be the test of Twitter is if you get 100,000 people following Britney Spears if they can survive. Obama by the way crossed the 100,000 mark a couple of weeks ago. Kevin what you up to these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Today not much just hanging out relax and Sunday.  Wait a minute I gotta go get your tea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But your tea smells quite good Kevin. It smells like you. Well it's the ginger. It's the ginger. It gives it a nice fresh astringent smell. My tea has rooibos in it. Oh you have a tea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah I actually had I'm going to point out I had afternoon tea this afternoon. You actually are a tea drinker.  I actually am a tea drinker. And I said you know what I sat down and Alex cooked scones and we had tea out of this exquisite Wedgwood teapot that we got for our wedding. And it was a perfect of a perfect English Sunday afternoon.  And I felt like an outrageous cliche. Isn't that great. I'm a more of a crumpet kind of guy than a scone. I don't even know what a crumpet is. Oh I do like a good bit of crumpet. What's a crumpet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A crumpet is a lovely little baked good. I also like Devon cream and cucumber sandwiches. Can we have that when I come to tea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can. I had Devon cream and cucumber sandwiches this afternoon. So you're very welcome. Oh man. Now is that Eleven's is or no that's. No no that was an afternoon tea. That was like a four o'clock tea.  My parents came down and we had a little thing going on. But what would have been better if I could have had some Kevin Rose tea then I could have served my parents up some Kevin Rose tea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But stay away. You know which one I drink. I drink the matcha green tea.  Matcha is delicious. I like matcha. The ground up leaves and I have like the little whisk at my office so my assistant knows how to make it and I put honey in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it's like. You can't have your assistant making your tea for you. Sure. No no no no. The matcha tea is used in the Japanese tea ceremony. It's something you're supposed to do yourself. Oh really. Yeah yeah totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No Jason he has a special assistant just for making the tea. My matcha green tea and assistant. You don't have one Kevin. I don't. Oh you have to have a matcha green tea because I have a regular tea assistant. I had one with a downturn and everything. The economy. I had the lame hop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How's the fighter jet though. Is that still. You still have that right.  No comment no comment. I'm not. No he had to sell his fighter jet. He's getting a chest. So sad.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes. Sarah was just texting me nonstop. Like I said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wherever I am Kevin sure to follow. He's jelly. He's a little jealous. Maybe you want me on the show too. So Sarah your fabulous parting gift. A delicious container. David Prager the man behind the green curtain tea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's so disgusting. It smells like socks. I don't know what it is. Let me smell it again. I'm telling you. Pipe tobacco. Pipe tobacco. I mean it smells like chemicals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can't give it away. It smells like a cleaning product. It's the most disgusting tea. Kevin Rose tea sold out. Prager tea not so much. That's a bad sign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what that is. Does Alex have a tea too Kevin. Yes. Beer flavored. So does Glenn. It's like a beer flavored tea. All the puffs iron girls have teas. Very hoppy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if there's even any other stories. I just want to wrap it up. Can I just say the other one story I wanted to say was Rackspace by  Rackspace. Of course and I'm pissed off about this because I love jungle disc. Why so? Because jungle disc ties to S3. This is Rackspace trying to create their own storage in the cloud solution like S3.  They announced their own storage in the cloud solution. Is that a bad thing? Yeah. Yeah it's a bad thing because I use jungle disc to go to S3. You think they're going to leave jungle disc as an S3 client.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh okay. So now Rackspace is going to basically kill off jungle disc or at least turn it into a switch. I would if I were. It's going to be just as cheap as S3. They're a cloud thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah but the point is I'm happy with S3. I use S3. I use jungle disc to access S3 and jungle disc. I mean maybe they'll keep it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what the problem is with this stuff is like we started building some applications like Pieces of Mahalo on. You use EC2 and. Well we have we use Hadoop for our storage now and that works fine but EC2 is just not fast enough.  Like if you want to have quarter second page load times you can't really do it with EC2 yet. So storage is fine. Running different instances is fine but.  How about Google Apps? Is that better? No Google Apps is worse. We have a couple of Google Apps and we were blowing out the they have a bunch of limiters on it.  And so it's just not ready for prime time. Nobody's really built the real opportunity. Somebody's got to take a CDN a content delivery network like Edgecast which we use or any of these.  We use Cashfly here.  Cashfly which is really good. Somebody has to take that and build it into EC2 so when you're writing your HTML files you're writing the big home page it can actually like dig could be run or Mahalo could be run on EC2 but it can't be served.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I heard that Rackspace was doing that with Lime.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what I'm talking about. I know exactly what you're talking about. I always want to say LimeWire but it's not.  They're a good CDN actually.  LimeLite.  IT conversations uses them. They're actually very good CDN.  Apparently according to our chat room JungleDavid said they are not going to kill the S3 implementation of Jungle Disk which I'm very happy about.  But I'm not crazy about the idea of it just feels like to me Rackspace moving in on this. I guess competition is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No it's a good thing. It's a good thing. I mean the idea of spending two or three thousand dollars a month renting servers.  Crazy.  It's crazy now and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But wait a minute. Wait a minute. I have three dedicated servers at SoftLayer. You think that I could replace for the twit.tv the leo.com the leo.am for all those sites. Do you think I could replace those with this kind of in the cloud solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you probably will. Yeah. And what's coming.  Why is that better.  Because you never have to maintain the hardware and the hardware will scale. So it's distributed.  And it's distributed. So you'll go down when the EC2 people go down which is fine because it's not going to. They just announced they have an SLA a service layer agreement.  Which is a good step.  But.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because EC2 has gone down several times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's actually a couple of businesses going around pitching themselves now for an idea I had like a year ago which is somebody should make a load balancer that goes across clouds and there has to be a cloud standard. So if you were to build let's say dig or mahalo or Twitter pounce on one of these systems.  What you should have is a load balancer that when people come in.  I would.  If EC2 fails it just rolls over to Google App Engine or if those two fail it goes over to RackSpeed.  Yeah.  And so if that could happen at the load balancer level then you would have sky computing which would be you know multiple clouds and just point your users to whichever cloud happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well you got to believe Microsoft wants to get in this space too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Microsoft's got a big announcement next week about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. PDC is coming up starts tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is this where Skynet comes from.  Skynet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Skynet.  When we did TechCrunch 50 this year we asked people how much was invested in their companies and a lot of them like Metrix was built on Google App Engine or a bunch of these were built on EC2 and we asked them what their costs are and they're like we don't have any server costs we have no office space.  The only cost the marginal cost of a startup today is the person's time.  That's it.  Which means you're going to see a lot of interesting things in the down market when people have a lot of time on their hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In chartered territory now making up history as we went along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Skynet's coming baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You guys didn't get this machine was the only one who measured up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You guys didn't get it did you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Totally on it.  The geeks.  The geeks got it.  So Kevin what are you doing now with dig you still own all your own servers and all that or.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah I mean digs in a little it's a little bit different.  When you serve me Jason you know how this is it's kind of hard to do stuff on EC2 and S3 when you're doing 30 million uniques a month.  You can't do it.  Yeah you can't do it.  So we got our own stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well publishing.  Well it's just not it's not there yet because when you have a site that's this active you have to write the files.  Right.  As opposed to people making database calls or else your server would crash.  So I'm assuming like.  A lot of caching you mean.  Yeah you have to basically go from the system actually writes pages that can then be cached by Squid cache or by your Cisco router whatever you use to do your caching or your edgecast whoever.  You can't really have database calls going out so you have to write the files and that just means you preclude you from doing something like EC2 today.  But I think that's where they're going to go with it.  So you could store all the images or all the data on EC2 from dig or Mahalo or engage it or whatever but you just can't serve it out of there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah that makes sense.  You just are too demanding.  And of course you got Jay who has a lot of experience with this as a founder of Equinix so he knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How many servers does Dig on like 200 I would guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think we ever talk about numbers but yeah it's a little bit more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah makes sense.  And are you in one knock or you're in multiple knocks now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We have a East Coast West Coast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah that makes sense.  Yeah I basically have to.  And you serve people dynamically out of each one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah I mean it's quicker to serve London from the East Coast and Japan from over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I get excited when we talk about big iron like this.  It's just hot.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All that data moving around.  I got like as a little server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who's your CDN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We don't use one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're their own CDN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No but actually the pages on Dig are very light.  They have very few requests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah it's mostly all text you know we can compress the hell out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you all those images on the front page are those served from one sprite or from multiple images.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a good question.  I don't even know what they we use.  What's that distributed file system mogul mogul FS.  Yeah.  But I'm not sure where it's being served out of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah that's the sort of next level when you have all those dynamic images making one dynamic you know sprite out of them.  Yeah.  So you don't have to serve up 20 requests but it looks like 66 requests.  But the response time for dig was point one second.  That's the first request which is extraordinary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Kevin at the beginning of the show Jason told a story about having a meal with you in Santa Monica and offering you two million dollars.  Sushi lunch.  Yes.  Offering you two million for dig.  You remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah absolutely.  That was back even before the redesign.  What did you order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No more to the point.  Was that a tough thing to say no to or was it very easy thing for you to say no to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well if the thing was that there was Jason you had some kind of aggressive terms baked into the whole deal.  It wasn't just like straight up two million dollars cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah I wanted the option to buy the whole thing in pieces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember this.  You actually talked about this.  I do remember this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you it was I don't know how many people were using it but in gadget was much bigger at the time.  Yeah.  So you had just were just you were showing me the version 2.0 at that time which was much more beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah that's right.  That was when I brought Daniel on and had him resign the site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if you talked about it on Twit Kevin but I do remember talking with you I think maybe offline about this and that was exactly why you turned it down as you wanted to retain control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean it was very early days.  Yeah if he had brought a check and written down two million dollars put it in front of my face and I had just started the project you know four or five months earlier I probably would have said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well that's what you see.  That's what I was wondering.  I thought boy that's that's got to be tough to say no to that when you're you know this is something brand new.  And who knows what was going to how it was going to go.  I mean if you had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I knew it was going to be big.  I could tell it was going to be bigger than the blogs it serves because we started to see that it was sending like a thousand people to.  Engage it at a time and I was like oh wait a second this thing is going to be bigger than all the blogs because it's a layer on top of all of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I think this is why I think you'd make a great VC because you found us very early on.  This is like we had almost very little traffic.  Yeah.  And you found us and made me an offer like over a sushi lunch.  It's like what do you ever consider like going the VC route.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know I like to build stuff so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also he knew because he had inside information he knew what traffic you were sending to engage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had the referral file so yeah not everybody not everybody would know that that's what I know.  I mean it's.  Listen I wouldn't give myself too much credit for that one but being a VC is actually kind of boring.  I know that's really boring.  I'm on the board of some companies.  I mean it can make you crazy because you can't tell another entrepreneur what to do and you're really limiting your role.  I'd much rather just build myself.  I love the fact that now I can just build whatever I want and get a large amount of funding for it and take five years.  It's like it's like you know you get to a certain point in your career you can actually build for a couple of years without worrying about it.  It's like how are you doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How are you doing with the economic downturn Kevin.  Are you guys comfortable with your position.  You got enough cash.  You feel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Dig just closed a round of funding for 28 million here about three weeks ago.  So we're in good position.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have plenty of runway as Kevin would say.  Plenty.  I mean Jason would say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Also you have that you guys have a guaranteed deal with Microsoft for your ad inventory which was a brilliant move to sign that when you did.  Turns out.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah we signed a three year deal with Microsoft so they handle all of our ad sales for us.  So really for us it's just like putting our heads down and just you know building for the next few years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does that have a guarantee on it.  I mean do they guarantee you a certain amount of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We can't talk about the terms for it unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I can tell you what the other deals were like Microsoft did.  They did guarantee a CPM when they did a bunch of those deals.  I don't know the dig deal but when they did those deals they guaranteed like typically five bucks four bucks six bucks to make sure that that's how they got it over Google.  So they went and overpaid or you know at least in the MySpace case I think they overpaid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  With Facebook as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Facebook they overpaid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's nice to have a big daddy with deep pockets who wants to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Essentially they're doing it for the data.  So basically they get all the data from the Facebook and dig users.  Not on an individual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's more than just the ads in other words it's a valuable proposition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's their play is they're trying to create profiles so they can serve ads across networks to groups of people.  So that's the big the big land grab today is the data for the profile information which is why Facebook is very valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's getting on to 2 a.m. in the UK.  We're going to let Will Harris go to bed now.  I think he already did.

Transcript:  I have a great investment tip for everybody in the audience which is going to pay huge  returns if they listen to me carefully.  Invest in yourself.  That's the best thing to do in a down market.  Invest in yourself and your own projects because they will pay the biggest dividends.

Invest in your projects you know and you'll be fine on the other side.  Excellent.
