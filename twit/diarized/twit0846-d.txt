Transcript:  That's right. Yes, and she apparently has a CNET sign stapled to her head. So no, no, it's not. It's on the bookshelf  Thank goodness. Okay. I think you should represent I do but that might be going a step too far  Apple had an event this week. So did Google so did Samsung  Let's start with the most important Samsung. Now you can get your flip phone in color  Crickets  Samsung was just a little jealous that Apple and Google we're gonna have events and they said  Let's do something. What can we do?  We could make them in color  Okay, I actually like that flip phone but

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google was rumored to be working on its own flip phone  But they didn't announce that on on Tuesday or Monday Tuesday. I'm confused Tuesday  They announced the pixel 6 and the pixel 6 Pro with absolutely zero surprises  We knew exactly what it was gonna look like what it was gonna be. The only surprise was if you tried to order it  And in which case Google just said no, sorry you can't

Start time: 387.30
End time: 388.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Got a bit on that demand they had

Start time: 390.02
End time: 420.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  According to I think according to CNET. They they are making twice the number of phones  They sold last year quite optimistic 7 million still a low number less fewer phones. I think than Apple sells in a week  But for the whole year, but I think Google really is putting a lot in on  Let's start with this phone because I think we'll get to Apple in a bit and I know Lou you have some opinions on that  Have you Connie of you guys I'm sure you've already reviewed the the pixel 6 by now. Yes or no

Start time: 421.44
End time: 455.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we're playing with it right now and you're right  Google is investing a lot into that phone because they want you to use  Android and be bought into their whole pixel ecosystem  The problem is there's a lot of good choices out there for you right now you mentioned Apple introduced a phone  I mean, this is a good problem for consumers to have you can get a Google pixel or an Apple iPhone  They're both pretty good phones. I'm not gonna comment on the colors for Samsung. I'm not ready to get a flip phone yet  I mean, it's a good problem to have when there's competition and people

Start time: 457.16
End time: 505.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I had a guy called for I had a guy called the radio show today was hysterical call  Jim said I'm an engineer. I'm a ham and I I tried an iPhone  I don't know why anybody would ever buy an iPhone when you can get an Android phone  And I said well Jim sometimes people just want phones to work. They don't want to mess with them  He said well, yeah, there's I was bored. There's nothing you can do with them. I said yes for a lot of people. That's a virtue  So I think it's good to have some choice some people do like to mess with their phones the cameras on the pixel 6  And I you know, it's really early everybody who has one is embargoed and can't yet show  photos until I think Tuesday, but  Somehow some have leaked out and the night shots look spectacular from the pixel 6 especially the pixel 6 Pro

Start time: 506.82
End time: 534.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's gonna be that's gonna be the selling point. That's always the selling point. I don't care what Apple does  I don't care what Samsung does whatever they say the word night. I just hit mute for 30 seconds  I don't hear nothing that they say that their camera does with a night shot compared to what Google does  That is like the camera is Google's bread and butter like do they have pixels really just think that they're photographers  They just want to take that they  Know that they have any uses amazing and their night camera is superior

Start time: 535.18
End time: 577.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It should be even better this time. The sensor is two and a half times larger  I mean, they've really doubled down on this  It's this is megapixels pixel binning they got all this they're doing all the all the things 50 megapixel wide camera with an 82  Degree field of view f1.85. What is the f?  Stop on that fancy new camera lens. You just got for your r5. What 1.2. Oh shut up  So the lower that number the wider the aperture the more light it can gather  The more difficult it is to focus historically small sensors have not had great depth of field  But f1.85 is pretty wide for a camera phone

Start time: 579.36
End time: 582.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That she makes almost worth that notch  Yeah

Start time: 583.44
End time: 599.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let's not forget to that they have their own chip the tensor chip and there's some AI built into this version of the pixel  I'm not going to dispute that the camera is excellent on pixel phones  But they're even pushing the boundaries to kind of idiot proof your photo taking which I'm sure will appeal to a lot of people

Start time: 599.94
End time: 629.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but it's really that you know, that's that phrase computational photography that really is  What this comes down to even if you have these double-size lenses and stuff  They're still tight  I mean a half inch is very big a very big sensor for a camera phone, but it's still tiny compared to  You know your camera doctor or doctor and others  So you do have to do some some processing and that you've got a very powerful computer Connie  It's interesting to see Google do their own chip. Do you know how much of?  their own chip the tensor chip is

Start time: 631.76
End time: 676.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They haven't really given us a whole lot of details in it, but it makes a lot of sense that they would want to do  their own chip, I mean  Step aside from what you can pack into a chip  The past year has shown us that the supply chain around the world is pretty fragile  And if you're relying on Asia for your supply chain and your chips  Solely you're gonna get into trouble if you're making any kind of a hardware device all the shortages  We're seeing in the market today right or chip  Shortages this is you know, I don't think this is the reason that Apple started designing its own chip  It had a whole set of issues with Intel years ago, which is why it went into the chip world  But certainly that is an advantage to them to invest and have the capacity they need to make hardware  So it won't surprise me if they pour even more money into it

Start time: 676.76
End time: 713.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, ironically the Apple's investment in hardware the fab is TSMC Taiwan silicon  Semiconductor manufacturing company it's in Taiwan  No one is admitting who makes the tensor chip, but it's widely believed to be Samsung in South Korea  so neither of these chips are made in the US but if  If and maybe this is why Google ordered 7 million phones if you order enough chips  TSMC or I suspect Samsung is much more likely to make them for you  And in fact Apple famously has pushed everybody out by basically buying up all the production TSMC can give them

Start time: 714.52
End time: 744.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right. Yeah  Owning the line of production that was a smart move Apple did it  I would say like five six years ago  They had so much cash and they couldn't figure out where to put that money in terms of products  And so they started buying up the supply chains in the factory production lines  They didn't build their own factories. They just bought all the capacity  Basically so that they could have at their disposal the inventory they need there's an advantage to and according to Rick Osterloh Google started

Start time: 745.04
End time: 803.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Working on this tensor chip four years ago in 2017  There's another advantage that Apple's really realizing which is if you make the whole stack if you make the hardware the chips the software  the operating system  You can really design something that's purpose-built  That's really optimized for the things your device is meant to do photography for instance  And so, you know, that's a real benefit  It's been a real benefit to Apple on the iPhone than the iPad now on the Macintosh and I have a feeling that's exactly what  Google's looking at and there aren't that many companies  that can do that kind of  Integration vertical integration there not many companies that make every that can make everything  Google's one of the few  Microsoft I guess could do that. I don't you know  I don't want to make you the spokesperson for Microsoft Lou because you're not  But that's one of the other few under country companies that could do that. They make hardware they could make their own chips  I think they are working on their own chips

Start time: 804.50
End time: 860.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean all of them use all of them start with a reference architecture and reference product  I think obviously Apple starting with one  Google starts with one Microsoft the SQ  SQ processors are all baseline arm processors from other companies that they basically add  Specialized hardware to define their OS and I think that's that's the key to being successful  I think that's why Apple's being so successful  They've been able to start with a baseline and and and really and really add in there Google's successful because of the tensor process  I'll tell you one thing if you add I think that has three cameras on there if you use the other two sensors for detecting  Light and other things which is what they're doing when they take a picture  So you take a picture with one camera and they detect light and do other things with the other camera the other and then they  Use the tensor processor to process the that data together  That's why they're so good is because they're able to figure all that out and actually have a specialized processor because of it  I think that's why they will continue. So you start with a baseline you add the extra hardware. You will always be number one

Start time: 861.36
End time: 885.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Interesting. Yeah the baseline in this case arm. I don't know how much at this point  I mean Apple has an arm architecture license, which means that they can basically do whatever they want  I don't know what Google's license with arm is they can afford an architecture license. So I presume that they've done that  That means you can customize the heck out of them  Is it fair to call them arm chips even

Start time: 886.02
End time: 904.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lou absolutely, they all they all they all say start with the same architecture and memory model processing unit  Everything's the same and then they just add different components to it to edit the power adjustments  You know special things for the operating system  So they they do they do all start with arm and on the same same architecture for sure

Start time: 904.76
End time: 935.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But why so arm is not you know, you might at then conclude  Oh, well arm is clearly superior to x86 the architecture used by Intel and AMD, but I don't know if that's the case  I mean, it's a risk  architecture reduced instruction set compared to Intel's CISC  Complex instruction set but by and by itself that does not make arm superior in some cases arms left you were talking  I noticed in the chat room earlier  So I'm gonna steal from you that arm historically was not great in multi-threaded performance

Start time: 936.86
End time: 981.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the hard part about arm is arm is what they call a weak memory model  And that means that they don't they have what they call relaxed memory models to how they order the  Instruction sets and so like what happens is if you're a developer trying to do concurrent processing and lock and block on the processor  For things to wait to wait for reading writing. It's really complex really really hard to do  So if you're gonna convert your code from x86 to arm  You have to go back in and rewrite almost all of that code to make sure that it it does it right and I think  It creates a really challenging way of development. And so I would say it's not worse  It's just a lot harder to you and that's where yeah  Exactly, and I think that's why x86 thrived is because it was a lot easier. There are problems with the they call them race conditions

Start time: 982.08
End time: 1000.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When when you can't lock the process and you have two different things happening at the same time  You can have an unpredictable outcome and that is a big problem source of bugs, but aren't there  Languages, I mean Erlang and others that are designed to kind of handle these kind of challenging situations  It isn't doesn't the compiler take care of that

Start time: 1001.36
End time: 1042.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All of them had to adjust like even Java had to adjust they they have you know things like atomic  Constructs in there volatile flag stuff like that that that do adjust but again they had to adjust and they had to optimize and  That's the key like even you know when C++ 11 came out  They were all multi-threaded and all that stuff and I think they had to adjust as well to be able to to handle these  Compilations for you know, especially even the M1 scenarios  So even like like office for instance is developed and it runs  natively on the M1 system and so like a lot of work had to be done to go and kind of  Do a bunch of work to make that optimize and really really fast  I would say the same thing as for all all the apps. Yeah, very yeah

Start time: 1042.08
End time: 1050.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had not you know, you we should mention Lou as a coder  So he's he's intimately familiar with these things and worked on office, right? Are you still product manager?

Transcript:  Yeah, I'm on the Xcel team actually

Start time: 1053.68
End time: 1099.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so is intimately aware of these issues  So I'm glad to hear that I had no idea and so it's fat. That's fascinating to me  There's also the I mean, you know from the end user. There's definitely a marketing  Battle being fought, you know Apple has its own chips. Well, so do we we've got tensor, you know  And I can understand why a company like Google  Doesn't want to say Qualcomm to too often or too loud  The companies are also held back aren't they got it Connie a little bit I think Apple shifted away  Initially shifted away from power PC because IBM just wasn't paying any attention to that platform and Apple was feeling left out the same thing  Essentially has happened now with Intel  Controlling your own destiny. There's a lot to be said for that. You can release products when you want to

Start time: 1100.16
End time: 1130.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and you're talking about capabilities you mentioned Qualcomm, right?  Google used the snapdragon ship from Qualcomm right in the previous phones and it just didn't have the processing heft  That they wanted as they moved into some of this AI processing, you know  Never mind overheating the phone if you're doing all these computational photography  kinds of things as you mentioned  So why do you want your future beholden to someone else's R&D schedule?  You don't especially if you're somebody like Google and you have I don't even know how much cash they have on hand

Start time: 1131.86
End time: 1169.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Plenty would be the operative word. Yes  Actually, I remember interviewing Andy Grove way. I mean this has historically been a problem  I'm we're talking to Andy Grove was the CEO back then of Intel  This must be almost 30 years ago and he was railing against Microsoft saying we make great 32  I think we saying 32 bit maybe he was saying 16  I don't know processors and Microsoft just won't make the operating system keep up and you know, so it goes both ways  Hardware companies sometimes feel hobbled by software companies again another advantage to owning the whole stack  Then you just go down the hall and yell at the product manager for the operating system

Start time: 1170.94
End time: 1196.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And let's remember Google started out as a software company, right? It's got a search engine. That's true  They have all of this home  Devices speakers nest. I mean they have a lot of gadgets and gear that they want to put into your home  So it's not just an investment in the phone  It's the investment in having you buy into their whole ecosystem  Which I mean Apple is trying to do the same and we can debate the merits of their home pod or not

Start time: 1196.50
End time: 1200.72

Transcript:  But Google has certainly been did I say did I mention it comes in colors now?

Start time: 1205.52
End time: 1212.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  This thing is the best thing I got going on in my house right now, what is that thing the little YouTube?  Oh the remote for the Google TV. Yeah. Yeah, I mean it's sensitive is I don't know what but I mean it is it just works  But that's such a Google product because

Transcript:  Google's so confused in life  They had an Android TV and then they said no they had Chromecast. No, we're gonna do this thing. It's Google  What do they call it? It's Google TV now Google TV, but is it and but then the it's so confusing  It's like well, how is what is that? Is that what is that compared to Android TV? Well, it's the same but different

Start time: 1248.20
End time: 1257.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's it's the same with the remote it fixed the problem. I had because it's not  Cast everything now. I could use this little bad. We don't don't try to conflate what they've done with this. Okay, this thing works

Start time: 1258.08

Transcript:  So  Related to this is Intel's decision recently to become a foundry and  I'm really curious what you think of that Connie because  Intel in a way is it looks to me throwing up the white flag saying  Yeah, we just can't get down to these five nanometer three nanometer processes. The TSM sees doing  And our chip design is kind of laggard even AMD is starting to beat us. I know  Let's change our business model instead of designing and making our own chips will make chips for other people even  He said get Pat Gelsinger's new CEO even Apple should they ever?  Want to come to our factories is is Intel saying we're not gonna make  We're not gonna design anymore. We're just gonna make other people's chips. This is their new business model. I think that

Start time: 1355.23

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've been slow in the mobile market as we all know yes  They missed screwing up the mobile market. Yes is legendary. That's that's the subject of many books  I think their decision to announce the foundry ties in you know  I hate to bring it up and be the you know economist on this call, but please do supply chain, right?  Both the prior administration and now Biden care about made in America. You're not gonna make a  Completely replace the chip industry that's in Asia  But I actually interviewed the woman who is the new made in America czar for Biden and what they want to get to is enough  Redundancy here in the US enough supply so if something does happen  You know again some sort of global event that disrupts the supply chain that there will be capacity in the US  So that means that there's investment  That you can go get to go set up this foundry and that's I think part of what  Intel is doing they're playing into this made in America  Help defend the position by again not replacing or duplicating what is being  Manufactured in Asia, which is you know, I don't you can't but just enough  So that you have redundancy here in the US and so Intel becomes your fallback basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's actually pretty smart was this stimulated by the chip shortage or other economic forces?  It was it just oh my god. We better have some own our own capacity of our own

Start time: 1440.04
End time: 1491.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean I think the the chip shortage we're feeling that right now, right people can't buy cars  Refrigerates, I mean think of any  Piece of equipment that doesn't have a chip in it. Everything has a chip in it  So if you can get some of that manufactured here where you're not beholden to  Other supply chains around the world and it's not just making them  You know someplace else it's getting them here transportation, right?  There's a shortage now of shipping containers and truckers  All of that, so it's pulling that  You know problem out of your way at least enough so that you can take care of some redundancy  And that's really what this made in America initiative is part of there's money going into it because people recognize just how much  The us is at the mercy of others to play chains around the world even the defense department

Transcript:  Is in this the defense department enlisted intel to increase american foundry  capacity  They pointed out that 80 percent of the chips that we use are made in asia  80 of leading edge manufacturing capacity concentrated in asia leaving the department of defense with limited onshore access  to foundry technology  And there's this security concern, you know, we  Huawei is a perfect poster child for this. We don't dare use their stuff in our 5g networks  so there is a there is a  Economic reason to do this. There's a  national security reason to do this  and intel's the last  Company in america that still makes chips. So it's gonna it's really natural. It's gonna come down on its shoulders  It's really an opportunity. I guess

Transcript:  Yeah, well let's let's remember the us government spends 600 billion dollars  on parts  That's the purchasing power of the government and they want is that a year?  Yep, 600 billion dollar annual purchasing budget and they now have requirements about what percentage of what you're selling them has to be made  In the us so if intel can capture more of that. It's an easy win  If they can do it. Yeah, that's the big question

You'll be surprised  You'll be surprised what intel will come out with and and you know, obviously we already know the other lake platform is  Almost identical to the m1 platform.

They did that for a purpose and again, we can't forget the amazon's you know, the I think it's the they're the stealth organization out there  They do electronics too and now they're doing servers and and as well as amd. I'm sorry arm processors as well  But the same thing with intel is I think they will figure it out  Will they go arm? No, but I think that they will figure it out and they will make something  I mean everyone talks about mobile processors when we talk about data center  They still dominate and I think amd and intel will continue to dominate  Unless arm can figure out how to be in the data center and to be efficient data center

Transcript:  Great article in ours technica by tim to chant talking about kind of the history of this  And I didn't I wasn't aware of this but one of the reasons tsmc has succeeded  Is because they had so many customers  Because they were making chips for hundreds of different customers  Different customers had different needs  different technologies more advanced technologies and it allowed tsmc  To build skill sets in a broad range of areas in the latest technology to build machines  These are very expensive machines in in in these more modern  Technologies and so when the time came  They were really well positioned  to become  a leader in chip fabrication  We you know, it was our in a way it was our mistake  uh, you know  Not not becoming these a foundry company was a mistake in this country not to not to really encourage these founders. This is a  extreme ultraviolet lithography machine  An example of the very very high tech machines used to design chips  each one of these machines  There's a quote in here costs 120 million dollars  And to be a chip fab you might have to buy a dozen or more every year for the next several years  That gives you some idea of how difficult this is and this is bleeding edge technology. So  Uh, you know, this is one of the reasons we always talk about why didn't intel get past 10 nanometers  Well, it's things like this and why how did tsmc get to five nanometers so much more quickly?  By being a foundry working for many many different companies. They were able to develop that something about somebody else  Yeah, yeah, it's really interesting. Uh excellent article  Uh about this, um, and I you know, I agree with you  Lou I I want intel to succeed I want them to survive just as I want amd to survive amd is a much smaller company  But faced with many of the same challenges  What about invidia? Do you think invidia?  First of all, do you think they will succeed in their attempt to buy arm? It looks like they're getting some severe headwinds in europe  Connie, what do you think of the uh, uh prospects of invidia buying? Um, yeah, I don't know honestly, I think

Start time: 1781.10

Transcript:  I know why they want to buy arm. Yeah for a lot of money, by the way significant  Well, they're looking at the future and they're trying to right 40 billion dollars. Yeah. Yeah  Whether they will or not  That's an open question. There's a lot of I mean this is kind of an aside  But there's a lot of fear of tech companies right now around the world. No kidding  every uh merger and acquisition is getting you know, extra extra scrutiny and certainly the  EU is much more aggressive about scrutinizing all of those deals than we are in the u.s  It's not to say we're not scrutinizing them, but we're not doing it at the level that the eu has been doing it. So that is  I think that is the underlying issue is that they don't can't  That they can't anticipate what they're signing off on and so there's hesitancy to sign off on these kinds of deals. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um, I I have high hopes for invidia. I feel like they're doing a lot of great innovation  They do not make their own chips. However, just like arm  They're a architecture company not a foundry  so maybe this is a nice hand in hand with uh,  intel

Transcript:  I don't know  It's I think they might be too late though  I think you know once when apple bought these companies they started with arm and now they've built their own  Architecture off of the architecture and now they're different from arm in some sense and they don't necessarily have to pay  They don't need arm at this point. They don't need it anymore. Yeah, I think they might be too late  I think that's what I think here interesting

We'll talk about the pro and the max in a little bit  There's lots to talk about  also  A tweet storm about google's ad tech business that may be the beginning of some serious  scrutiny  For google and facebook together  But first a word from my sponsor as they say our show today brought to you by crowd strike  This is to me. This is one of the most interesting security companies  Out there you you know, you've seen us talk. Uh, you've seen the headlines  Security now is pretty much all about ransomware  Ransomware at tech after ransomware attack now they're going after the food supply  If you're a business  owner or a  CISO or a it guy you you probably feel like it's just a matter of time before they come for you  And then you have to make the fateful decision  Do you pay?  Or do you lose everything?  But there is a third option which is to beat them before the fight even starts with crowd strike  You're not alone in the battle against ransomware. It's in the name  crowd strike uses the threat graph from all their users one  trillion signals a day  Seven trillion a week to analyze  See what's going on in the net analyze  Behavior on your devices your servers cloud workflows to find the threats and stop them before they stop you  Crowd strikes falcon platform uses their threat graph power with advanced ai  I actually I was so interested in this.

Okay  But I think tuesday will have a review. I hope so because i'm going to steal it from him  Because i'm going to mexico on wednesday and I want to take pictures  Of the day of the dead stuff i'm going down to wahak and I think with the pixel 6 should be amazing  But watch that's the only camera you'll need do you think?

Transcript:  Let's let's talk. Oh my god was this an expensive week  So I okay  You know what connie?  lou  Owen talk me down  I am still in the reality distortion field  Uh, we watched the event apple announces the new m1 pro and as if that weren't good enough the new m1 max  Double the I mean everything's doubled or tripled over the m1 which was already fast and the memory bandwidth is  3000 gigabytes a second and it's just like what is going on?  Um  I feel like apple is flexing at this point. They didn't announce any desktop computers  They only announced we're gonna ignore the fact they announced colored  Mini home pods. We're gonna ignore the fact that they announced 179  iPod  Thing  Which the air pods for 179 which is crazy don't even go there  but  They didn't know they just announced laptops that these are updates the macbook pro 14 and 16 and they  On paper anyway 21 hours of battery life on paper  These things look like they they speed past everybody else. The only negative thing i've seen and remember nobody has one yet  Review or they have them but they can't talk about them reviews aren't out yet. So we'll see real numbers again  I'm in the reality distortion field  but the worst thing I saw was  Tom's hardware said well  Okay, they're pretty fast but  the gpu on the macbook pro 16 isn't quite as fast as a maxed out  Nvidia on a desktop  Well, yeah, it's a laptop  Um, wow  Okay. I'm connie. Am I nuts? Should I just take a chill pill and relax? Is this not the best thing ever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you should wait for the reviews next I guess so yes  but  To your point are they supposed to be smoking fast or what's apple's expression wicked fast? Yeah. Yeah, I mean that's their whole  selling point the  cpu number of gpu cores  Um, you know starting ram all of that. I mean up up up and why because most people have  Laptops nobody needs this no

Okay, I bought two of the two maxed out  One of them is a gift because I promised a graduation gift to my nephew who just graduated from ireland school of design  He's graphics designer. He needed a high-end laptop. So I promised him  I thought they were gonna come out in june. They didn't come out. He needs it because he's using  High-end graphics stuff. He needs a really good gpu  and then one I got uh for testing here and then see  Maybe kind of doesn't know this but we are stupid we buy everything that we're going to review so, uh  We don't because I don't I don't like apple. I don't want to talk to him. So, uh, we didn't you know  We have people who do this who get loners jason got a loaner the pixel six  I'm sure renee richie has all the apple laptops  But we so I bought one that will review and then i'll give it to our uh, our lead editor  Anthony nielsen because he should probably have this but but you'll be proud of me owen  It hurt I didn't want to but I bought the base model m1  pro  A mere two thousand dollars because I could get that one on tuesday  So they were so i'd have a chance of reviewing it before I left

I'm a big fan actually  Um the the m1 architecture when we first got our hands on that was like ridiculously fast  Like I think we were able to compile a full, you know office client as faster than our azm processors  I'll tell you like it's very fast and and and this is even this is like twice as fast as that was  Even faster than that like it's you're talking about like  seven times more transistors and this isn't even

This is all apple all apple all apple silicon and they went over the top  Also remember apple has suffered with the pro market on their laptops because absolutely more powerful windows machine. No question. Yeah  You know up until they announced this um, people were like it's not worth the money, right?  all of the designers and programmers and  So they're just trying to smoke out the market and  $2,000 for the 14 inch mac pro with all of that capacity  That makes them very competitive now and will they be two years ahead? I don't know. I hope lu maybe he's right  But I don't think anybody can catch up

Start time: 2813.16

I don't it should all be in front of me like a normal band  And uh and spatial is is artificial. It's not it's not how it's not real. It's artificial.

That's why a lot of people have used  iPhones headphones for that reason.

It kind of is this long  uh tweet storm  from patrick magui  Patrick is a san francisco car and spun it for the financial times  Uh, he knows and writes about ad tech and I think in some ways  This might go under the radar because it does require kind of an intimate knowledge of ad tech and how it works  but it is  kind of  I think damning. It's an unredacted complaint from uh, the state attorneys general  This was filed back in december. It was the first time we've seen it without  Any redactions in fact if you want to see how much was redacted?  um  Anything purple has now been unredacted and it's a lot of stuff  But and I don't know if any of you have read this yet  But it's really sounds like google has been  With full knowledge of its illegality  colluding with facebook and others to completely own the online ad tech market  Any thoughts lu you get  Is this something that I mean it's it's kind of beyond my pay grade so

Transcript:  All right, so i'll just chime in here, please connor, you know, you must explain. So yes, so google makes something like  182 billion dollars a year  The most of that money is made from advertising. Yeah, it ain't from search. It ain't from gmail. It's from ads  Correct our ads on all of those services which each have a billion plus  Users, right? So that's a lot of eyeballs that you're  Getting your ads in front of  and what the lawsuit  The unredacted lawsuit again, this is what the state attorney generals it's led by texas  And there's like 12 or 14 other states. I think you said have joined them  I don't know the exact number but it's a lot at least a dozen other states. Yeah have said that  Google is manipulating the ad network in a variety of ways first to give preference sometimes to facebook  Facebook and google according to some of these documents apparently didn't like the fact  fact that apple was trying to  Make sure you didn't know who their users were and protect their privacy  Well when you're targeting ads  And targeted ads are you get a much higher premium when the ad is targeted than if I just show you an ad for  A home depot or something random, you know that you might not be interested in so  Targeted ads means that I need to know who you are then or you know have a sense of who you are  Using all of these metrics that these various companies facebook google and others use and so they didn't like the fact that apple was  Really putting user privacy first  google and facebook and so they were trying to figure out ways to have  Facebook show more ads according to the state attorney generals, of course  Google facebook and the tech companies are going to have to defend this  And the other thing that these documents say and again, I encourage people to read them  I've only scanned them is that google gave preference to its own  ad  Uh, it would bid on its own exchanges and it won a lot of its own ad business itself on an exchange that over which it has  monopoly  Power it sets the price for what?  Uh, you know if you're a small business you want to put an ad on the google ad network  It decides how much it's going to charge you a cut of your ad sales  And so it charges people a lot of money and basically, you know game the system to its advantage  This is what the attorney generals are saying and that's what will be debated. It's misusing its monopoly power  In the ad market of which it is the primary beneficiary. I found a stat that like  75 percent of all  Online ad oppressions in the u.s. During the third quarter were served by google. That's how powerful it is

Transcript:  Google google processes 11 billion online ad spaces every day  11 billion ads a day is that I mean it's dramatic  The complaint alleges and I think it's I think after reading it it might be a fair allegation  That essentially because google owns both the buy side and sell side  On this that they are effectively  Says the complaint pitcher batter and umpire all at the same time  Uh, they quoted a google employee who admitted if the analogy would be if goldman or city bank owned the stock exchange  They are both buying and selling and they're controlling the bidding  To end up in their favor and the only reason that they've dialed in facebook  is  Because they can make more money  There's according to this al again. This is all allegations from the state's attorney general, but I think quite well documented  Google has a secret deal with facebook  They call it jedi blue  They knew was so illegal that it has a whole section describing how they'll cover for each other if anyone finds out  Furthermore, they have a team called g trade that is dedicated to ad market manipulation  Google remember we were all upset about google amp  Google said well, we'll we'll you know, this is all about making the web a better place  All the javascript has to come from our servers all the ads have to come from us all the all the content will will serve  So it's faster. It just makes the web faster. That's all we're interested in  But amp was really about preventing people from circumventing google's ad exchanges  Amp in fact didn't always make things faster only made them the median of sites faster  But they really pressured and I bet you've seen it has amp content. They really pressured the publishers to support amp  Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah, sure did with the promise that you would do better on search results and you'd be faster and your customers would be happier  Uh, your readers would be happier, but really it turns out at least according to this  That it was mostly just about making sure that you were locked in  That everybody was locked in and it's not just bad for  uh  It's it's it's not just bad for other ad companies  It's bad for small businesses that are going to end up paying more and getting less from the ads they buy  You know it doesn't and I think one of the reasons it's going to be difficult is it's hard to show consumer harm  It's a more nebulous thing

Start time: 4529.26

Transcript:  Well, the consumer harm is if they charge more  For ads and companies have to pay for those ads the cost of doing business always gets passed on to the consumer  In the long run goods. Yeah, so yeah, that's the answer there. So this is I mean, you know a lot of um,

Transcript:  I think you for instance, and this is this is the kind of collusion antitrust law specifically addresses  Facebook and google didn't want to compete with facebook over ads the other big ad market, right?  So they built a moat by collaborating instead  Facebook and google in these in this indictment allegedly agreed on quotas  Or complaint not indictment and for how often facebook would win for how often facebook would win auctions the publisher's auctions  literally manipulating the auction  With minimum spends and quotas for how often facebook would bid and win  So they got together. This is directly in violation of antitrust law and colluded  To dominate the market. They said all right, you're going to take this. We'll take that we'll split up the world  That is very clearly bad behavior. I don't think a fine is going to  I don't know what else you can do, but I don't think a fine is going to handle it

That's going to be very difficult for congress to deal with it's a very complicated issue  uh, and and there's evidence on both sides and I don't I  And that requires some deep technological understanding. I think these guys are understand business  And they understand collusion and they understand ad markets. That's not technology. That's kind of basic  Economics and I think I think you could count on congress to understand this issue. It's not congress. This is going to go to the courts  Uh, the courts will decide on a remedy. I don't know what remedy  um, maybe you know you get you get a court appointed, uh  Person um ombudsman representing the people inside or something. That's what they did with microsoft. Uh, I don't know  it's uh  But this is bad behavior  Let me just say very bad it does some evil it does do some evil and I think it's very clear, you know  You could point to it. It's a lot harder to say well, you know is facebook did facebook pull down enough covet 19  Stories to really I mean that's hard.

Oh, the secret british engine came in and blew up the facility. I guess I got a good job  Right like so at some point these people  Who are maximizing profit or putting profit ahead of principle or people  I mean, that's what happened with microsoft. What were they trying to do that? We're trying to mac maximize profit, right and  Ethics were not part of the discussion and that's what we're seeing here  I think to a certain extent extent or certainly with facebook and how it's oh we can make money, you know selling cambridge  Analytica data about users and it's money right like it doesn't make a difference  Who we're selling it to or what the ramifications of it are we're making money and google. Oh, we have an ad network  Let's optimize how we make money at some point that has to  Has to come into consideration  For the people that work there because we're seeing employees become much more  Activist about the companies we work they work for which is why you had a facebook whistleblower  Going to congress with all of these documents  But uh, I just think that you know those those people who work in these  You know factories at some point have to say wait a minute  You know the british secret agent just blew it up. What am I doing here?  And I hope that it's a moment of reckoning. I mean people will come and go right now  We're looking at the trial elizabeth holmes right now in theranos  What she's done sure it's you know, she did something wrong, but she's not the first person to game  What her company was doing I mean we can go to uber and lots of other companies  It's that kind of behavior that somehow is conflated with  You know american capitalism and that is the problem play to win

You know  The last thing you want to do is drive over to the post office find a place to park get in line buy stamps  That's that doesn't seem like a good use of your time  What if what if you could just print all the us postage you'd ever need from your computer with your printer?  No postage meter necessary. That's stamps.com  But it's more than just printing postage. You can print right on the envelope  You could print postage for any kind of package stamps.com makes it easy to mail and ship  Without ever getting up from your desk  You'll save time and you'll save money because you can get discounts from stamps.com.

They've even got a new rate advisor tool because there's so many ways you could do this  You can compare shipping rates and timelines and find the best option for you whether it's usps or ups  Stamps.com has been a partner of twit since 2012  Is that I think it's longer than that even if you haven't tried them yet, what are you waiting for?  Oh, I know they've been advertising on twit since 2012  We've been using them since before it long before then in fact, I just found my leo stamps  I had stamps.com print stamps with my picture on them  unfortunately  They're like 45 cent stamps.

There was thoughts about changing the corporate name to something like fb  incorporated  Or in all caps facebook corporation  Um  Apparently this was uh kc talked to antonio luccio who was the company's former chief marketing officer  That was overruled but now the company and particularly mark are kind of eyeing  The next thing for facebook the metaverse  And maybe this new name will be metaverse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was it was uh  It was a notable day not just because steve jobs was really good at  Doing presentations and keeping the audience enthralled but because it was such a big risk  For apple at the time it was primarily known as the maker of the macintosh and it was 2001  So jobs had been back five years and they were still, you know in financial struggles. They had had the new  Candy-colored imax before but they still you know weren't  You know solvent I would say they were still struggling to make money so for them to take a risk on the  consumer electronics market was a big move and  Jobs started out his pitch that day with an emotional appeal which was  Everybody's into music. This is a market that's never going to go away  People love music. We love music and you should do what you love and he really  Did a good job of keeping the audience  You know following along with him and his logic  Um, there were other music players on the market apple is typically not the first into a new space  But he sold them on how it was going to be apple was going to make it elegant and easy and really fast  to upload music  um  To this, you know  Very cool looking device. I mean I have to admit this is my original ipod I got it that day  Uh, it's pretty good shape not because apple gave away a case. I actually asked jobs about that  I said have you have you thought about making cases and he said what for it fits in your pocket  And I was wearing a skirt with no pockets and i'm like because some of us carry stuff in our bags  So I went home and I sewed my own little case. I found it  It's a little cow  It's a gateway case with uh with yarn from my kids  Uh, you know play thing and that's what's kept this thing in pristine condition, but  It was a notable moment. Like I said, it was a risk  It took a while for the ipod to be a success. I don't think people realized that it was not an instant hit  They it took them four or five years to really sell in the millions of devices. But by then  They'd introduced the itunes store and had taken on the music labels as all of us recall  It was one of steve jobs famous open letters to the industry and talking about why you should be able to buy songs individually  rather than buying a whole cd  And uh, it was just cool, right the silhouette ads. They had a youtube ipod  Bono was there for the launch of that. I actually got to meet bono on the edge  Very cool, and there was a lot of there was a lot of good marketing hype  But of course a thousand songs in your pocket was quite

Oh, yeah on the day they introduced the iphone not the iphone  Oh, yeah, the iphone. Yeah. Yeah, so it was the start of that whole path and of course  Two trillion dollar valuation later.

We you encrypt your mail  No one can read it and we do not keep track of you and they took that off the website when that case came out  but the good news is  proton has appealed  and they just  Won a swiss court has upheld the appeal of proton  Limiting its obligation to monitor traffic and retain data for surveillance purposes  so  Uh good for proton. I want to give them credit because we we bashed them a little bit when they handed that data over  Understanding that you know if you're in a country you have to obey the laws of the country  I think I bashed them more for saying they didn't have to  Uh and giving people a false impression that they didn't have to but the good news is they have continued to fight  and uh  They've got what ndn the ceo says was an important first step  In their campaign to advance privacy and freedom. So  to be fair proton mail, uh has  fought and won  Too late for the french climate activists were never heard from again  But uh  Still that's that's that's good news.

You don't pay for individual things. So it's hard for  Netflix to say that any one show  Had any particular you can't say we made a billion dollars on this but they do measure it assess performance  based on  How it benefits the subscription rate on it and they do have a metric they don't release but they use internally according to bloomberg  Who got to see those figures?

This is the future  the I think that the  Pandemic has really changed how we think of how we think of business how we want to do business  It used to be in the you know, and I don't know the 90s that if you were business  You had to have an email address then you had to have a web page  You had to remember you had to have an answering machine if you didn't have an answering machine  That's maybe the 70s or 80s. You weren't with it  Nowadays, I think you have to have text messaging  That's how your customers they don't want to call you. They want to text you  That's why local businesses everywhere are turning to podium it makes every interaction as easy as sending a text  I mean how often now do we get text saying your your meal is on the way or  You order something and say okay curbside pickup in 12 minutes and then you get a text  But more and more i'll leave the dentist's office. They'll send me a text with my appointment  They'll say hey, by the way, if you like their service rate us on yelp or google  These things are changing business  Because it turns out that open rate for text messages is almost 100 percent. That's better than anything else  That's how I want to interact with businesses. That's how businesses should interact with their customers  They're just podium isn't just a better way to communicate. It's a better way to do everything  Whether it's gathering reviews you can even collect payments  Marketing to your customers. I get a text from our local ice cream parlor. I hate it, but I get it  They say hey, you haven't come down in a while  How about 20 off a pint of hubba bubba ruby road and I have to go down there and buy some ice cream  Podium makes it all as easy as pressing send you won't just free up more time.
