Start time: 364.84

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 371.00
End time: 400.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so the people were there. It was  mostly the exhibits that were, to me,  the most impacted. So I mean obviously the floor  was easier to kind of navigate,  but it seemed like the exhibits were  I don't know what you call them,  the exhibitors. Yeah.  They were definitely, but I will say  for my purposes it was fantastic  because all the stuff that I got, nobody  else got. And so my videos  were great. We got a couple videos that went viral  and I thought it was a fantastic trip.  So I'm hoping that everyone  stays away from CES from now on. I did see a video

Start time: 400.98
End time: 416.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of you from CES doing something a little  odd. Uh oh.  I can't remember what it was. I just thought,  oh there he goes again.  What I really thought was the great thing about  CES this year was you could get those shots.  You could go in and you could ride  the snake or whatever. I can't remember. What were you

Start time: 417.06
End time: 432.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  doing? Tell me about it. I mean literally it  was so easy because there was no, you know,  usually you'd have to go to like, they're like, excuse me, talk  to the press people. You know, you got to get in early.  I didn't do any meetings set up.  Nothing. They're like, oh, do you want to tour a booth early?  I'm like, no, I'll just tour it on the first day.  No problem. Was there anything?

Start time: 433.24
End time: 436.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It sounds like the greatest CES experience.  It does, if I'm being honest. But it doesn't work.

Start time: 436.84
End time: 442.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the problem. It doesn't work that way.  You know what I mean? Like if they did that every year, it would be  chaos. No, you can't do it that way.

Start time: 443.89
End time: 493.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that literally sounds like it just reminds me of the old,  the convention days of yore where it was like very small before  these things became these massive, like, right, consumer  driven. I just remember E3 in like the year 2000, like the year  after the Dreamcast came out or maybe it was 99. Maybe it was  the year the Dreamcast came out. I just remember it was like so  small. Kenchahall was still real. Kenchahall. Do you remember  Kenchahall? Yeah, those were the days.  It was like, I just remember that. I will never forget that  floor layout. They literally had, they had all kinds of crazy  stuff going on there. Like Tecmo had a whole thing with like the  girls from Dead or Alive and like they had just like all these  models and they were all dressed up in all the costume. And it  was insane. Like, I mean, it was really just pure, it was a pure  distillation of what E3.

Start time: 648.40
End time: 663.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that has done like over, I think it's up to 1.2 million views on my Facebook page.  And it's like, people are just debating, you know, whether the truck, you know,  it looks like it was just, you know, if it's going to work,  if it's going to be able to navigate snow sleep. What do they say?  Didn't they say they're going to buy like a,

Start time: 663.84
End time: 667.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  like a hundred thousand of these or something? I mean,  I think they're already committed to that.

Start time: 668.24
End time: 677.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Even more. And it's like 10% of them are going to be electric.  So that's another side,  but it's also been about 30 years since they upgraded these trucks,  which is pretty wild.

Start time: 677.88
End time: 694.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's time. I'm sure they're horrible polluters and all of that.  I guess my point is that it's kind of gimmicky these days, CES, right?  I mean, it's all a little bit of a gimmicky, like the world's smallest dishwasher.  I'm sure they'll make that, but who the hell cares?

Start time: 696.07
End time: 702.30

End time: 719.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like I love CES so much because it's a, it's a, I don't care about the big installations.  You know what I mean? Like the giant stuff, that means nothing.  It's the little things that I discover,  like this dishwasher and like all these other little things that you can wash five dishes in this.

Start time: 719.84

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When you have an apartment that does not have a dishwasher,  your only goal in life is to have a dishwasher.  I guess I'm out of touch.  I've been there.  It's a nightmare to not have a dishwasher.

Start time: 745.79
End time: 753.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got to say, Leo, I agree 100% with Rich.  Like the best part of CES is finding all the weird, weird stuff on the show.  That's what I hate about CES.

Start time: 754.22
End time: 771.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The stuff that's there you can't buy.  Maybe you could buy it in a year.  Most likely you can't.  Every time you do CES coverage, you have to say, well, if you're responsible,  you say this is never going to, you're never going to see a color changing car from BMW.  Enjoy, but this is goofy because, you know, so it's a weird thing.

Start time: 771.86
End time: 773.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  But see, that's the feeling.

Start time: 773.86

Transcript:  People love that.

Start time: 774.84
End time: 778.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know.  Well, that's the only good part because the rest of it, like, it's just the,

Start time: 779.92
End time: 815.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's basically just press conferences and like the companies that know that they can get your attention  will just have their own separate events anyway, which is what they've all done for the last 15 years.  They don't need CES.  They don't need CES, right?  So like Sam, like when all the big people start like pulling out of CES,  like it made the show different and it made it worse in some ways.  But then like, I think that the beauty of it was like, okay, well now we can just focus on the really weird stuff  that you might not ever see or maybe you will.  But like this is why else are you going to show up at this?  Why else are you going to spend five days in Las Vegas if you don't have to,  unless you can look at the really weird stuff?  I don't know.

Start time: 827.08
End time: 839.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like when you break like an LCD screen, you know, it's all like messed up.  Just what you want.  That's where I hit that.  But this car, they said, number one, that there will be color changing cars in the future.  I know that's just black and white right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But here's, okay, here's a couple of real world examples.  Okay.  Let's say you now, here's where it gets kind of weird.  Like if you're driving Domino's on the weekend, right?  You know how to put those little things on the top?  So you could have your car say Domino's on the side.  Now it wouldn't be a BMW perhaps.  Maybe it would be.  So I got a magnetic sign.  When I have to drive for Domino's.

Start time: 873.85

Transcript:  Here's I am an optimistic tech person.  Imagine you're at a resort that you come off a long plane flight and the last thing you  want to do is sit there with someone, whatever you go into this room, you pay the $10, whatever  it is NFC phone.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 965.98

Start time: 972.94
End time: 1021.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I can, I think I can argue this rich rich rich and I share an optimism of tech.  Okay.  So I imagine the use cases.  Here's what I imagine.  These cases.  Yeah, we're tech optimists.  So I imagine a world in which you can very cheaply once these are a little bit more common,  easier to create because one of the things that a lot of massage therapists experience  when they're a longtime career person is a lot of repetitive motion strain.  And so it's hard.  It's really hard on their bodies.  I know it's very hard.  I know that.  So I argue that the premium experience would be getting a massage from a human being and  the non premium would be like, hey, you spend 10 bucks, you get half an hour from this like  robot.  So it's very much similar to like massage chairs at the mall.  Right.  Yeah, it's a massage chair.  Exactly.  Yeah, very similar.

Years ago, I got to control a robot using a headset and I was shaking people's hands  and stuff and that was very weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We should explain.  Everybody knows, but this is Elon Musk's boring company.  They bore a hole.  You may have heard of subways.  No, this isn't quite like that.  There's no escape route.  There's no extra tunnel on the side.  You're just driving Teslas down a hole underneath the Vegas Center.  Go ahead.  Now you can explain how cool this was.

Start time: 1238.28
End time: 1253.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These are built 40 feet under the ground.  The idea was that this would be built all under Las Vegas.  They started with just the south wing of the convention center all the way to the west  wing.  It's basically a 1.7 mile.  It's two tunnels.

Start time: 1259.36
End time: 1293.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This was a proof of concept.  They did do it very quickly with only money that they got from the hotels.  You go to a hotel, there's like a thousand fees for being in Vegas in addition to the  resort fee.  Anyway, they built it and they put Teslas.  It's supposed to be autonomous.  The Teslas can't be autonomous because the drivers will tell you anything, by the way.  They were telling us the inside scoop of how the cars, since the walls are so close to  the sides of the cars, the self-driving system goes nuts.  That's interesting.  You have a Tesla.  So you have to manually drive it?  The proximity alarms.

Transcript:  And so that there was actually maybe even before Omicron kind of picked up.  And I think it was just a good reason for them to say, hey, we're going to go virtual  again.  I think I'm a little like, I don't know.  Now I'm only speculating, but I can only guess that maybe like there wasn't a lot of interest.  And I think that because Sony pulled out of it, it's sort of like CES, right?  So Sony, once Sony pulled out, once Microsoft left, once Google left.  Right.  In gaming, it becomes a different show.

Start time: 2622.96

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Wii U was not there.  I remember that.  The Wii U was not there because they had a separate event and they had...  Even at CES the year the Wii U was out, they showed it to me in a hotel room that was not  part of CES because they didn't want to give the CEA any money at all.  And then that E3...  Because they don't need to.  They weren't there.  Because they don't need to.

Transcript:  Yeah, and I think the problem is...  Okay, so it's like a two-fold problem.  So what you have is you have a convention that used to be like tight industry only and  liars like me and Christina.  So we used to have those, that group of people.  And the 16 year old...  Pretend.  And the 16 year old liars, absolutely.  But overall, like really it was like not super of interest and most of the gaming community  was getting that information in magazines.  They were getting it print media the next month after.  Right?  So now with streaming, now with the ability to live stream a press conference, with the  ability to show off all of your games just right there on YouTube or Twitch or wherever  you want, whatever delivery platform you feel like putting it out on, E3 has become less  and less relevant and less and less necessary to be there in person.

Start time: 2752.04
End time: 2754.74

Start time: 2755.04
End time: 2759.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 2759.88
End time: 2778.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's so many little companies.  And that's really what it's about.  Like anyone can...  I call it bubbling up to the top.  Like any company that goes to CES has the ability to win the show because it takes one  journalist to find something cool.  They blog about it and then a thousand other people do the same thing.  They go and find that.  Like that robot.  That seven second toothbrush.  Yeah.

Start time: 2779.06

Start time: 2824.26
End time: 2881.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But with gaming too, to Ashley's point, you also have competition from like the more enthusiast  consumer shows like Pax, right?  So if I was a big game company, like I would and I one of my enthusiasts there and you  have TwitchCon and you have these other things.  So like E3 as a concept, I think even before Omicron, the big companies were going to do  their own events.  The smaller companies who want to kind of get the fan feedback have better spaces for  that that aren't encumbered by all the E3-ness of E3.  The trade.  Yeah.  The trade aspect, right?  They don't even have to pretend with that because I would much rather go to Pax than  E3 if I'm being honest.  And then it's kind of like...  And then you have gaming has gone into other spaces.  You have Comic-Con, which is just this massive juggernaut of horror at this point, but it's  this massive thing where if you have a big property, I would much rather if I'm going  to put my money into a summer thing in Southern California, I would much rather look at doing  something at Comic-Con.

Transcript:  So Christina mentioned like one of the things about...  You mentioned PAX and Comic Con.  And I think one of the things that happened with E3 is there was a time when all of the  exhibitors because it was industry only and press, it was a place where they could show  you behind closed doors games or even on the show floor games that they weren't quite ready  to show, right?  Everybody else that they wanted you to preview them.  Now the show is open to a small percentage, but still a percentage of the public, which  now that means all of those games either get pulled from the pulled for me three because  they're not ready to show them yet.  And they're not ready to, you know, be presentable to the public who doesn't really generally  understand like, you know, game development and can't quite, you know, judge it properly  or they may judge it more harshly based on what's presented to them.  And then on top of that, journalists are now struggling to get time with games like that  and also all of the games on the floor, because some of these lines, as I'm sure Rich and  Christina can attest to, I remember when Breath of the Wild was on the show floor, it was  a six hour wait and they closed the line off right in the morning.  I mean, it's the whole, it would wrap around the whole entire booth.  And then it was like, sorry, the lines closed for the day.

Start time: 3009.60
End time: 3034.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the thing is, it's not good for E3.  It's good for video games.  Right.  Video games is not good for E3 because of the advent and the boom of streaming and streaming  games.  You don't need a conference.  You just don't need that conference.  And this is why we've seen all of tech do exactly the same thing.  We saw Apple pull out of CES.  We've seen Google, Microsoft, like all of these massive companies.  It's hard to believe.  We're just doing it ourselves.

Transcript:  Video games, and we know this because we tried to do a video game show, is a very fragmented  arena.  I mean, there's console gamers, there's PC gamers, there's casual gamers.  There's no monolithic video game industry.  Not at all.  And frankly, console gamers couldn't care less about anything else.  So PC gamers look down their nose at console game.  So it's so fragmented.  I think maybe it is better just to go direct to those people.  And those people are sophisticated enough.  They're going to watch your Twitch stream or YouTube video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is one thing as a person though, and I will say the...  And this is, as a journalist, yeah, I get to go to these things.  But I think as, even growing up, there's a shared experience, right?  Like a car show.  Oh, yeah.  CES.  Like E3.  There is something as a nerd or someone who is part of a group.  Exactly.  You want to be there.  You want to be with just people that share your interests, no matter what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

I'm not learning anything.  They don't even go to the booths.  I mean they get these things in closed rooms.  I mean it's a whole...  It's really fascinating when you kind of break it down.  So Leo, I do understand what you're saying but there is...  I think the main thing is that these trade shows generate a lot of revenue.  And that's another part of this.  And it's also a big group that has a lot of power.  And so there's a lot of things going on.

Apple's iMessage is winning teens dread the green text bubble and they say the blue bubbles  are bullying the green bubbles of poor people using Android devices.  And this is a silly article, except then Google picks up on it and says, yeah, yeah, Apple.  Why don't...  You're bullying.  Yeah, you're bullying us with your technical superiority and your better sales.  That's bad.  And then I love Ron Amadio's piece where he says, let's call it...  I don't want to say a spade a spade, but I don't know what else to say.  Let's call it as I see it that the real problem is that Google ruined messaging for Android.  Please stop kicking our butts so badly, he writes.  After ruining Android messaging, Google says iMessage is too powerful.  Boo hoo.

If you're in Brazil, 90% of everybody uses WhatsApp.  There's no blue bubbles, green bubbles.  But here in the United States, for some reason, we have this fragmented system.

When you set up your phone and you go through that flow of setting up your phone for the  first time, what does it say?  It says, can we use this?  Do you want to...

Transcript:  I want one messaging system for everyone because it makes sense in today's day.  I use Telegram.  I love Telegram because when I use Telegram, no matter who I'm talking to, I don't think,  oh, are they on an iPhone?  Oh, can I send them a large picture?  Oh, can I send them a video?  Can I do this?  Can I do a reaction?  It just all works no matter what phone they're on, whether you're using a 10-year-old phone.  And I do think there is a point to the whole...  People does like to play this game of like, we want everyone to have access to this.  And then they go ahead and they do this thing where they're holding back iMessage, which  is a great program from other devices except their own.  And they're fully within their rights to do that.  But I do think it's not right.

Start time: 3601.68

Transcript:  And that's the funny thing is most other countries have.  This story, the reason I thought it was kind of flawed is that there are always going to  be in-group signifiers for teenagers.  When Ashley and I were teenagers, did you have a Nokia phone?  Did you wear Abercrombie?  Were you on AIM?  Those were kind of the things.  For a lot of teens now, it's do you have an iPhone?  For 20 years, I actually kind of want to write something about this.  The most enduring fashion symbol of the last 20 years, I was thinking about this the other  day, has been white earbuds.  If you think about it, white earbuds has been the most enduring fashion status symbol of  the last 20 years.

This is like but also Apple doesn't do this on purpose so that teenagers will bully other  kids.  They know.  It just happened.  They stumbled into an extremely sticky thing.

Transcript:  I would argue that Apple can seal the deal by just coming out with iMessage for Android  and desktop platforms.  And then they just own messaging for an indefinite amount of time here in the US.  Yeah, but what do you get out of that?

Start time: 3794.24
End time: 3865.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to say I think I was going to say I think that if they could make the business  case that that was where they needed to be, they would do it.  And I don't even think I don't even think that they're afraid like I wouldn't switch  away from an iPhone if iMessage was available elsewhere.  I would still be an iPhone user.  And I think most iPhone users would be there are just those other things, you know, handoff  their continuity.  There are these other things.  Yeah, there's a lot with it.  Right.  So I don't think that iMessage would be the only thing.  But I personally, I mean, I don't begrudge them for saying, yes, we could completely  dominate messaging if we went to these other platforms.  But but to Ashley's point, what's the business case for that?  Like, why do they need to be in that?  Like, maybe one day they will.  But what's interesting, John Gruber pointed this out in his story.  I think it was Nick here who mentioned this in his in his article, like his blog about  this.  So the iPhone is even more popular in Japan than it is in the US.  But the number one messenger there by far is line.  And so that just to me shows messaging services people are going to use what they want to  use.  I think it is notable that for more than a decade, younger people have in the United  States have been like hooked on iMessage.  I mean, it's like saying, though, the reasons to bully other.

Transcript:  It's not Philip Morris's fault that kids smoke cigarettes.  Here's the smoking gun, literally, or not literally, figuratively from April 2013.  This is the verge went through a lot of these epic discovery emails.  Eddie Q wants iMessage on Android just in case Google buys WhatsApp.  Phil Schiller, chief of marketing, says, and since we make no money on iMessage, what  will be the point?  I'm concerned iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove an obstacle to iPhone families  giving their kids Android phones.  That's Craig Federighi.  I think we need to get Android customers using and dependent on Apple products.  They know exactly what's going on.

Phil Schiller writes to Tim Cook saying, Jaws and I think moving iMessage to Android will  hurt us more than help us.  This email illustrates why.  Instead of saying, oh, this is a terrible experience, they said, see, this is great.  This is keeping people on iPhones.  They not only know it, they embrace it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Would you rather have a world where Google has their messaging system that just works  really well with all the Androids and then this other messaging system, iMessage, that  works with iPhones?  Why?  To me as a tech person, I want stuff that works with everything.

Start time: 4009.62
End time: 4039.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what Google would have done.  Hangouts worked everywhere.  It was always in Google's interest that it worked everywhere because they make money on usage.  Apple makes money on iPhone sales.  So there are two different business models.  It was in Google's interest to make it universal.  Obviously, the perfect world, it would be Signal or some independent third party.  Everybody in the United States would all of a sudden say, let's use that.  And that would be perfect.  Let's all agree on one day to switch.  And I'm cool with Telegram.

They like to get in there and have customized everything.  And they were getting so upset because we would be in a group text and everybody else has an iPhone  and they would have tiny videos and they would have...  Because it's all on SMS.  And so I just said, you know what?  This is an important thing.  So we should just all have Signal.  And so we all have a Signal group chat.  Oh man, I'm jealous.  But it's only for our close family.  And that's fine.  To me, that seems like a happy medium.

Start time: 4107.46
End time: 4120.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you could say, let me help you download Signal.  We'll make that the default.  It would work just like iMessage.  You just wouldn't know you're not using it.  Then it would be doing it.  But Apple won't let you make it the default.  I think that that will change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes and no.  I do think they were emboldened by that.  I do think they were emboldened by that and I do think that it was a pretty strong message  that the court sent out.  But also, I do argue that we are seeing regulation in the EU that is going to come over here.  South Korea.  Because now we have a much more anti-monopoly, regulation strong, FTC.  The future is going to be this sort of dismantling of these siloed monopolies.  Yes.  However you want to call it.  I think we're going to be able to within the next five years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They won't have to.  It's just like you said Ashley.  The time has come.  Yes and I don't think that you could get away with the stuff that you used to be able to  get away with which is something like bullying people into a certain thing.  If you look at almost everything, look at the streaming services.  If you have Fire TV or Roku or Apple or any of these Chrome, Google TV, pretty much you  can get all of the major streaming apps on those services.  Now they try to play hardball once in a while.  But could you imagine, remember the days when you couldn't get HBO on whatever and you'd  be like, ugh, you would just switch.  And with the iPhone, it's really tough to switch because it's a whole world that you're  in all because of this blue bubble.

Start time: 4226.50
End time: 4251.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I do think there will come a point where there is some sort of regulation that requires  all phone makers to allow users to choose a different default app to use for specific  things.  So like, I don't see that happening.  Just like you would on an Android phone.  I think there might, like if the case was narrow enough, I think it could be argued.  No, I'm just saying this is Apple's business.

Start time: 4252.29
End time: 4267.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple's not a monopoly.  It's only 50% of the market.  This is their platform.  It's their business.  We cannot in good conscience tell them how to run their business.  I don't think that works.  You'd have to have them be predacious.  You'd have to find something really evil.  And I don't think that's going to happen.  I really don't.

Transcript:  So by the way, I thought about the way that you can tell people that you've moved to a  service.  Okay.  Let's say you're on iMessage.  Okay.  Instead of switching to like SMS, you can, I thought about this a lot.  You can put on the automatic, because there's no automatic reply on iPhone.  You know, you can't, like on Android, you can set an automatic message reply to your  SMS, but on iPhone, you set up the do not disturb while driving and you can set the  message that it puts in there.  I'm sorry.

I've thought about this a lot because it really bugs me.  It's a little workaround.  I'm sure.  That's a hot tip.  I'm sure Apple will close that off at this point because.  Have you done that on Rich on Tech?  Okay.

There's certain things where as a person who is doing very mainstream tech, you know,  it's, I don't know, it's just tough to do some of the stuff.  If someone asks me, yes, I will respond, but it's not like I'm doing segments on this kind  of stuff on TV.  That is a great tip.  That is a great tip.

He made an app called Wordle, like literally it's called Wordle, and he's donating all  of the current, like it just started spiking.  And so he reached out to this guy and was like, hey, like I have this app and like what  can we do?  Can we work on something together?  And so they ended up donating all of the proceeds, the profits to a literacy nonprofit, which  is really cool.

Transcript:  So I waited for my review.  The Pixel came out, I think October.  I waited to do my review until I think December, like mid-December.  In my review, I said, I love this phone, but there's a bunch of little things.  Love the camera.  Love the form factor.  Battery life is great, but...  Software is nice, but it had a lot of little bugs.  And you can't make phone calls.  I didn't have that problem.  I didn't either.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But no, that is a very sore spot on this phone for me.  It's...  I've heard so many people...  And there's no face.  There's no face unlock.  No.  But I said in my review, like, look, at the end of the day, Google is going to fix this  any day now.  Software.  And by the way, January 14th, it was still a whole month and a half before this software  update, I ended up sideloading the software update that they came out with originally.  And it was quite easy to do, but obviously the average person can't do it.

Start time: 4965.20

Transcript:  So many people had problems with the December update, especially with connectivity, that  they stopped it.  Yeah, they stopped the update.  Yeah.  I did it right before that.  Okay.  And I never got that.  And I've never...  I honestly...  And this is weird.  And I'm here channeling all the people I know with Pixel 6s.  I've had nothing but great experiences of mine, but it's weird that some people have  great experiences.  The fingerprint reader works for me.  The cameras are great.  I've never had connectivity issues or phone issues, but so many people have.  And even that speaks to a problem, right?  Yeah.

Transcript:  This phone should be amazing.  It's Google's baby.  They're a smart company with a lot of smart people working there.  And I just don't think they take their phone serious enough.  Also, can we talk about the fact that the Pixel changes every single time, every year,  it's like an entirely different phone built from the ground up.  How annoying is that?  With the iPhone, it's evolved over 15 years or whatever, however many years it's been  around.  It's pretty much the same exact slab of glass and metal that it started out as, except if  you just put it on a...

Transcript:  We had a sponsor, yeah, who makes a really cool device that is an email server.  It works really well.  That's neat.  Cool.  I'm interested in that.  It's a hard technology problem because Gmail, for instance, won't accept emails sent from  your IP address.  They go, I don't know.  You're a spammer.  Oh, yeah.  The spammers would get this thing.

Start time: 5129.96
End time: 5150.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the way they have to do this...  They support DMARC and the other authentication technologies.  But the way they do it is you route the email through a server.  It doesn't even look at your mail.  It's just routing through IP addresses they've preconditioned to work with email services.  So you need to do that.  It's a kind of a nerdy thing.

Transcript:  I use Hover, which was a Twitter sponsor.  Hover's great.  But by the way, one other thing that Google did do, they nailed, is Google Photos.  But I will say I have a problem with that too because once they got you in there, it  used to be.  The charging is fine.  I don't mind paying because I love what they do.  But here's the thing.  You used to be able to sync your Google Drive to an external web, like a NAS server, and  you could have your Google Photos inside there and it would also sync.  Now they've shut off that functionality.  So if you have photos in Google Photos, the only way to get them out is to do that Google  Takeout.  There's no way to sync that to a third party hard drive.

Start time: 5191.66
End time: 5193.13

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 5245.96
End time: 5255.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a bold claim because I think that there are just a lot of people making maybe not  great decisions.  No, but that's his company.  Is he a visionary?

Start time: 5258.56
End time: 5274.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, this is like my argument, right?  Where it's like even Apple, I think, has this problem where it's like at the top.  Tim Cook is not a visionary.  He's a guy who came up through the blockchain.  He's a really smart guy, but he's not a visionary.  And I don't argue that really.

Start time: 5276.00
End time: 5284.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 5292.90
End time: 5321.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I also argue that you could not have put somebody like a Johnny Iver.  No, I think Apple got better when Johnny left.  You could not have put somebody in that role after Steve died just by proxy if there would  have been too many comparisons.  And by making it Tim Cook, it was very easy for them to just sort of be like, well, I'm  nothing like him.  And that was the end of that conversation.

Start time: 5321.88
End time: 5369.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He said Steve told him on his deathbed, you should not be asking what Steve would do.  You need to be your own guy.  You need to run this company.  But honestly, he's been a caretaker.  Sundar Pichai is a very nice guy.  They're all smart.  He's smart.  I don't think he's a leader.  And I think that's the problem is that you have a headless operation and everybody's  doing their own thing.  That happened at Microsoft.  Let's not forget the days at Microsoft when every division was sniping at every other  division and you couldn't make windows good because the office division said that'll be  bad for us.  And who comes along with Sachin Adela?  And I think everybody would agree he's the opposite of Sundar Pichai.  He took a company, transformed it, pivoted it and has done a brilliant job.  He's done a good job.  Yeah, he's done a good job.

Start time: 5369.86
End time: 5378.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 5416.38
End time: 5425.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pro Max feels better in your hand because it's got square edges and it's not rounded.  It's a little square.  Okay.  Look, Google, just hire me to make the next Pixel.  I will make this phone the best selling phone in America.

Start time: 5426.10

Start time: 5432.40
End time: 5454.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's very close.  You can hold the iPhone easier because the edges don't go off to the...  They don't go...  The rounded screen, people have to round up the rounded screen.  It's a nightmare typing.  You try to type with two fingers on it.  You're messing up the entire time.  You have to go to voice type.  But don't you put a case on it?  It's phenomenal.  Everybody should just have a case.  Yes, but it's still tough to use.  I'm telling you, I test every single phone out there and the Pixel is the phone I look  for to the most.

Start time: 5454.68

Transcript:  Well, you're not alone.  You also test every phone.  I saw that.  Announced this week, he said, I'm finally taking the SIM out of my Pixel 6, putting  in a Samsung S21 Ultra.  The Pixel 6 is just too unreliable.

Start time: 5465.78
End time: 5472.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  Of course he did.  Oh, Marques.  He's a Pixel guy.  He's a Pixel guy.  He used the S21 Ultra until he needed to just to get through to the Pixel.  And then he went back.  He used this big tweet and then Google came out with the update literally 48 hours after  his tweet.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Oh, that's hysterical.  Now I can't confirm that he put his SIM back in the Pixel, but I'm pretty sure he's back  to the Pixel because look, the Pixel, you can't deny the photos that come off of the  thing are amazing.  The software, the way it integrates Google services.  Whenever I use it, I sit there and I realize all the little things that-  No, I far prefer vanilla Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I far prefer it.  Gosh, you know, but I'm with you kind of the-  I'm heated about this stuff.  The experience with the iPhone, as much as I want the, I don't like the walled garden,  is a much more consistent, reliable experience.  It's always a little-

Transcript:  The voice to text on iPhone is getting to be laughably horrible because it doesn't, like  Google, let me give you one example of Google, how they do voice to text.  So if you're standing in front of a restaurant that has a specific name and you say, hey,  meet me at John's restaurant, right?  Google knows from your location when you're using voice that you are in front of that  restaurant and it says, oh, they mean John's restaurant right here.  I'm not kidding.  When I say meet me at whatever, it'll be like navigating to Las Vegas or John's restaurant  in Las Vegas.  I'm like, no, I'm standing in front of this restaurant because Siri doesn't use those  cues that Google does.  Siri can't.  Apple is respecting your privacy.

And you're like, wait, that doesn't show me anything.  So my idea, just one small part of the metaverse is going to be Hilton hotels, Marriott hotels.  Every hotel is going to be mapped virtual for VR.  And you just put on your, you know, your Oculus and you just walk into the hotel and see what it looks like.  You see the view.

I had a, when we were allowed to travel, I had a fairly popular Instagram stories thing that I would do of Christina's hotel tours,  where I would just tour the hotel rooms I would go into.  It was remarkably popular.  Probably one of the most popular things I've ever done.  Shockingly, like I had people who didn't even know me from other ways.  I was like, oh, I love your hotel tours.

Start time: 6565.70
End time: 6589.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I would basically just walk into the room.  I would do like a tour of what things were like and kind of show the whole thing and give my thoughts on where it was.  I don't know why people liked it, but they did.  So to Rich's point, I think...  Because you can't get it.  Right.  I mean, people, I would watch that.  Like before I were booking a place, I would like to know what it actually looks like.  If I could have, if I would strap on a VR helmet to like find out is the room I'm going to be in actually going to be good.  I would do that.

Transcript:  When it's all together and it's like, whoever has the killer app for walking through cities.  It will not be.  It will be fragmented, but it's going to be a thing that you can do.  But then it's not a metaverse.

Start time: 6615.52

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How do you define what the metaverse is, I guess?

Start time: 6619.92
End time: 6640.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, okay.  So Facebook's vision of a metaverse, since we're...  So this is the reason we're all talking about it now, is that, you know, they're going to provide the sort of framework for everybody to build their own thing that is all interconnected, interop.  And that you're going to be able to kind of like go seamlessly from one thing to the next, like in a perfect metaverse.

Start time: 6640.86
End time: 6642.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they provide the framework.

Start time: 6642.86
End time: 6681.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Correct.  They provide the framework.  And here's the problem with that.  We're already seeing that the FTC is already investigating.  There have been news stories about the FTC investigating Facebook's acquisitions of all of these little VR companies, little AR companies, because they're trying to, once again, just like they did before, you know, they started getting in trouble, just like they did with WhatsApp and Instagram.  They're trying to snap up and kill all the oxygen in the room, all competitors, so that they can be the monolith.  And I don't think the FTC is going to let that happen again.  Like, I just don't.  No, I agree.

Start time: 6681.72
End time: 6684.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I don't think it's Facebook controlling this thing.

Start time: 6684.64
End time: 6722.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no. But that's what I'm saying.  It's like it can't be a metaverse, like in the traditional sense of the way that we're presented with it in books like Snow Crash, where it originated.  Like, it's a fully operational, you know, matrix, basically.  It's the matrix. And so I argue that we will never see that because companies are too greedy.  No one is going to want to share their experience if they feel it's really amazing.  They want to own the platform.  And so we're just never they're all going to fight with each other.  This is the friend. These are the real franchise wars in Demolition Man.  It's not the fast food ones. It's this. It's this right here.  Do you think we're all going to be fighting about it?

Transcript:  I don't think Facebook has revealed sales numbers, but they are selling this thing like crazy.  And I have people come up to me like, Rich, this is unbelievable.  And yes, VR is very tough to cover for TV because it's like you just get this thing of like,  but like the reality is every single story I've done with VR that where I see stuff and I'm in this world and it is it is so amazing.  And we're just at the beginning.  So like I said, that one little app that I had is just one thing.  But like, imagine on a Friday night, you can just walk into a bar and sit there with your friends and like you're in different places.  And I get it. We still want to do this stuff in person.  But the reality is not everyone wants to do that in person and not everyone's there's going to be another place to do that.  Like, it's just going to compliment the world.  Not everyone can. Exactly.

And it's all about dystopia, because if it weren't for dystopia, every single I pointed out this before, every single example of the metaverse,  whether it's Snow Crash or Ready Player One or a cyber, it's all bad.  It's Neuromancer.  It's always a dystopia that people are trying to escape from.  Yeah, it's always a nightmare scenario.  You don't want to live in that world.  So you go to this fake world, which I think we're years from now.  I think we're years from it being even close to look every single time they talk about it.  You have to have some way of simulating touch and smell and movement.  Look at that crazy thing they have in Ready Player One so that he can run.  Right.

And it was funny.  But I think about how far we've come in that time.  That's a very short amount of time in the way of innovation.  And I argue that like my kid in 20 years, like I can't even be in a rap.  My brain about what he's going to be playing as games.  Games will be much more vivid.

Really, really lots of fun.  Our show today brought to you by Worldwide Technology and Checkpoint.  Two names you really need to know if you are a business and you are worried about getting hacked,  getting ransomware.  WWT offers security solutions and services to protect your business.  Attackers constantly updating their strategy.  Are you?  WWT can help you.  They can help your organization prepare and combat those next gen threats.  I'm telling you, you want a company like WWT that has the vision,  the services and the capabilities that you need to deliver security controls and reduce  the risk for your organization.  Nobody does it better than WWT.  Their team provides resources and platforms that make it possible.  Three decades in this business, they have a proven track record to help you succeed.  I've assembled a couple of case studies, a healthcare organization.  You'd know the name.  They were ready to move to an electronic health record technology.  They had a good sense to go to WWT to help them do it, to make sure it was secure.  They had to, right?  You've got HIPAA, you've got all sorts of security issues with electronic health records.  Those WWT consultants come in.  They use their expert knowledge.  They use state of the art tools.  They used in-depth analysis.  And they even went so far as to training and repetition with the staff.  They did a full assessment.  They found 90% of the vulnerabilities they found could be fixed just by putting in a  comprehensive systematic approach for patching.  They made it possible for this healthcare organization to safely, securely,  efficiently move to electronic health records.  That's the kind of team you want.  They fire on every cylinder, whether it's risk management, end point security, network security,  identity and access management, cloud security, all the areas these days your company needs  to excel at.  But the good news is you don't have to do it alone.  You've got a great partner.  And those are the words I hear every time.  Great partner with WWT.  See how WWT and Check Point can protect your business assets and your intellectual property  with a holistic security approach.  They know business.  They love business.  They will help you make your strategy, your business strategy and your technology strategy  align.  And they know that's got to both have to work together.  Go to www.wt.com slash twit.

Andy did his Ask Me Anything in our club twit this week and that's available on the twit plus feed.  If you are not a member of club twit, I do want to remind everybody it's a great way to support  what we do.  Seven bucks a month, you get ad free versions of all the shows.  We figure you've given us money, we don't need to use the ads to monetize.  So you get ad free versions of all of our shows.  You also get access to our club twit discord, which is always a great, great time.  That has become more than just a place to chat while the shows are going on.  We've got a whole community going in every area of geekitude and then the twit plus feed.  Stacey's book club is in the discord, becomes part of the twit plus feed.  We have an untitled Linux show, the giz fizz, and soon watch.  We figured that this is the best way to launch new shows.  We've got a new show we're working on, we're very excited about,  which will premiere first in the club twit discord and on the twit plus feed.  So if you're not a member of the club, here's a great way to kind of get inside twit.  Go to twit.tv slash club twit, seven bucks a month, small amount of money.  It really helps us, really supports what we do.  I think there's some really good benefits that go along with it.  All right. Yes, we do have business accounts.  A number of companies now have bought business accounts.  That's all that information is on the page.  Back to the show.  Worldwide PC shipments up big time.  27% over 2019 last year, 15% over 2021.  I mean over 2020.  341 million PCs sold in 2021.  What?  Wow.  What?  The big PC makers, number one, Lenovo, HP, number two, Dell, and then Apple.  Apple had the biggest growth year over year.  Apple now has 8.5% market share.  I have to think the new M1 processors probably helped with that.  Obviously work from home is the driver here, although it's interesting that PC sales were up  in 2021.  Over 2020.  Yeah.

Start time: 7521.74
End time: 7537.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, okay.  So you think about it, you had the M1 that really came out at the end of 2020.  So that drove into the entire year.  And these are a big deal because for a lot of smack users,  we haven't had good laptops from Apple in years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think so.  But then you also had the coalescence of the thirst.  Everybody wanted a graphics card, the rise of PC gaming because people couldn't get,  or even if people could get the newer consoles, PC gaming is really having a moment.  The rise in processors, again, fourth quarter of 2020, probably leading into 2021.  Bigger mobile chip improvements.  So I think there's probably, I think it'll probably be gaming work from home and pent  up demand, but that's my take.  It could also just be FOMO, right?  You can't get a processor, you can't get a chip so everybody wants it.

Start time: 7637.06
End time: 7679.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Me too.  But the problem is even with pre-built is that the companies have learned that people are just  buying them for the card.  And so they either raise the price or they've changed the config of the package so it's not  as good.  So you have to be careful in terms of what pre-built you get because it used to be, you could say,  okay, well, if I spend $1600 on this pre-built, but it has the card I want, fine.  Now, A, you're not going to be spending $1600 to get that card and B, like the rest of what  you get might not be worth it.  So if somebody wants a 3090, which is their most expensive card, well, they just came  up with 3090 TI, but if somebody wants their most expensive card, unfortunately at this  point, my advice is you're going to pay the scalper one way or another.  Find the scalper who's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's a raffle.  So every day or every couple of days, New Egg has a number of products that they make  available for people to get the opportunity to buy at random.  So you sign up.  You have to beg.  Yeah.  Well, then these are the products I would like to buy.  Then you'll get an email.  If you get the email, it's not guaranteed that you'll get it.  It just means you have the opportunity to buy and then you need to click on the buy  button as fast as possible.  Sometimes they let you just get the product on its own.  But more often than not, they have it bundled with something else.  When I got my 3080, which I got a year ago, I got it at the end of January of 2021, I  was able to get it basically for MSRP.  And then it came with a power supply that wound up being recalled.  So that was fun.  I didn't use the power supply, unfortunately.  It was the one that blew up, the gigabyte one that was catching on fire.  So I paid about $900 drive out for the card and the power supply, which was huge because  I couldn't get a 3080 for that price.  Now you'd be lucky to get it for double that price.  But that was a year ago.  And now the whole thing is just much more difficult because supply is still constrained  and demand is even greater.
