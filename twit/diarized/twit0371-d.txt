Transcript:  Welcome to TWIT Show 371. I'm your substitute host here.  I'm taking over from Leo who's at the 49er game. So he'll be you can actually see him tonight on television because he'll be on I think the game starts at five or something like that.  He got invited to the game and I don't know. So they I'm actually the second choice.  Becky Worley was going to be the actual host here and then she bailed out. So I thought I'd come in.  I brought with me people I know well and I can work with well starting on my left with Jolie O'Dell the fabulous writer for Venture Beat.  And if she came in here today it's her birthday. Shucks you told on me.  So that's amazing that she would take time out from her birthday and she's dolled up for it in fact.  And she came in here to discuss the news of the day on my right is Rob Enderly who is the most quoted man in Silicon Valley.  Yeah. Yeah.  Always he has has a he has phones all over his body.  They can always get a hold of him for a for a pithy quote.  He is absolutely low in the dark the best at this.  So if you have a problem you have some story you're doing call Rob and I've worked with him a lot.  And then of course the X3 geek Andrew Eisner's here at the end.  We couldn't get Joe Ango because he's in Jersey which is too bad because we're going to talk about a lot of stuff today including the top of the list which is the iPhone 5 and what everybody thinks about it.  And we might as well start with Jolie who says that she's a big iPhone fan iPhone fan girl love those things.

End time: 297.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But yeah I'm not not a huge fan you know nice product they improved it in all the all major areas.  I was looking at just finished a session with Intel on their tomorrow project and they were talking a lot about how you when you look at a product figuring out what the design elements that went into it who was designed for.  And I went back and looked at the iPhone 4S and 5 and especially the 5 against the Samsung Galaxy 3 small jewel like was designed for a woman.  It was that the design comes right now.  Part of that's good.  Part of that's good because you know often we design products technology products for guys.

Start time: 298.00
End time: 301.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What does it look like if it's designed for a man like a tree trunk.

Start time: 303.14
End time: 320.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is a guy's phone.  It's bigger is better.  Watch Tim the tool man Taylor.  It's you know more power.  But the reality is most of the phones we're going to are larger more robust.  We talk about you know megahertz which is our form of horsepower.  The iPhones on a different path and I actually think that they had a design element there that focuses on a female audience.

Start time: 323.70
End time: 329.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now having said that you know by the way just a bomb to drop at the top of a show to kind of add to that.

Start time: 331.00
End time: 338.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you read any of this coverage.  But Heron said he felt like a piece of jewelry.  Exactly right.

Start time: 339.34
End time: 348.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It looks like a piece of jewelry.  He must not have much experience.  It is even described in this jewelry jewelry like on the edges.  Girl I know jewelry and this is not a jewel.

Start time: 350.07
End time: 372.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All the same I think it's just a marvel of engineering.  I mean there is nothing revolutionary in this but there's just the sum of all these improvements and all these enhancements.  Everything from you know the camera and the sapphire lens.  It's the same camera.  They switched from gorilla glass to sapphire on the lens protector because sapphire is a pure glass.  They actually have a sapphire artificial sapphire.

Start time: 373.10
End time: 375.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A protector yeah.  More scratch resistance.

Start time: 377.00
End time: 385.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They went with you know more microphones.  They went with five magnet transducers.  I mean there are improvements galore on this thing and I think it all adds up.  Five magnet transducer.

Start time: 387.36
End time: 392.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes more power you know.  You have one of these things yet?  You use an iPhone I see.

Start time: 393.02
End time: 396.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I use an iPhone and if my contract wasn't up I'd probably go.

Start time: 396.84
End time: 422.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I found by the way I think I wrote about this in a couple different places.  I believe that Apple this is going to be their last hurrah for these phones because what are you going to do after this?  So they have but it's very important for them to get the line around the block.  They got to get the line around the block.  No they are going to.  I guarantee they will.  They're already pulling out every stop they can.  There's going to be a shortage.  They've stopped taking orders on the phone because they can't get enough of these phones.  An artificial shortage?  Yes.

Start time: 424.00
End time: 428.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That means they're not out.  So I think they just decided to have the shortage.  Otherwise they don't have the lines at the stores.

Start time: 429.00
End time: 432.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If they don't have the line around the block this is going to be considered a huge failure.

Start time: 433.10
End time: 436.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes so they want the line.  They're managing to the line.  They'll have a line.  Yeah I would think.

Start time: 437.02
End time: 449.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The reason why they'll get it is because they waited such a long time to introduce them so there's lots of pent up demand.  Lots of contracts that are available.  And so yes and it's a beautiful looking phone.  It is very pretty.  You're on your own with the.

Start time: 449.10
End time: 456.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are you ready to get a new one?  I'm ready to get a new one sure.  Have you been clinging to the iPhone 4 or do you have a 4S?  I think he's got a 4S.  What do you have a 4S?  4S.

Start time: 457.24
End time: 461.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh okay.  I know people who have been clinging to their iPhone 4s.  I use these huge phones.

Start time: 461.12
End time: 464.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've got your Nexus right?  Yeah yeah right.  Look at that.  It's bigger screens.

Start time: 465.79
End time: 467.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Start time: 468.58
End time: 476.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay well so you think there's going to be a huge hit.  You think it's going to keep the stock propped up to 700?  Oh yeah.  Through the end of the year at least.

Start time: 477.51
End time: 487.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what's funny too.  I brought along that clip of the.  Somebody compiled all the adjectives used.  Oh do we have that chat?

Start time: 488.10
End time: 493.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We got to.  We could talk over but.  You can let him play it.  It's all the adjectives used in the.

Start time: 606.02
End time: 624.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay well that tells us why.  I started summing it up.  This is one of the reasons people are always giving me crap about being a kind of an all  around critic.  This is what does it.  It's this kind of crap they just keep promoting.  They can't even come up with new adjectives.  No.  Well we like those.  How about the word slim?  Is that even a possibility?  It's just thinner, thinner, thinner, thinner.

Start time: 624.89
End time: 627.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Thinest.  Thinest.  It's slimmer, slimmest.  I don't know.

Start time: 628.20
End time: 641.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thin's easy.  So anyway this is how it works.  This is the silicon.  Somebody once told me I was talking to somebody about Silicon Valley being the reverse innovative.  This is years ago.  Innovative and all of a sudden they're like this is bull crap.  They're not innovative at all.  All we do is really good sales.

Start time: 641.94
End time: 670.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well I mean that is all marketing isn't it?  I mean it's all completely relative and do we need thinner faster phones or do we just  need better cooler phones that do something different that have a design language that  isn't five years old and kind of sad looking when you put it up next to a Windows phone  or a newer Android.  There I said it.  I made my big point about those stupid phones which is why doesn't the design language get  an update.  They can be thinner and faster and whatever but why are they still sporting the same ugly  stupid glossy designs for the applications and the OS.  And there we have it.

Start time: 671.24
End time: 673.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're a designated fan person.  There goes her half.  Oh no no.

Start time: 675.20
End time: 677.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Huge fan.  Huge fan.  Of the iPhone 5.

Start time: 678.74
End time: 685.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Alright so what do we think about the dock connector.  Does anybody get annoyed about this but me?  And I think it was a bad decision.  I'm mixed.

Start time: 686.31
End time: 686.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Okay.

Start time: 687.27
End time: 688.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They did one thing.  They changed the connector.

Start time: 689.20
End time: 708.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They did one thing great though.  Why?  Because one of my all time pet peeves about technology connectors is that you can't figure  out which way to plug them in.  Whether it's USB, micro USB.  It's very annoying.  I mean you try them one way but so they finally did it so you can plug the connector in one  way or the other.  Isn't that revolutionary?

Start time: 708.54
End time: 711.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's also faster and thinner.

Start time: 711.72
End time: 720.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You have to replace most of your accessories now.  Run new cables to your car.  I've got to yank the entire stereo out of my car to change that damn plug.  Yeah.  Okay.

Start time: 721.19
End time: 721.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's more.

Start time: 721.96
End time: 751.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So because they thought that this might run USB 3 and it actually is not spec'd out for  USB 3 which is much faster than USB 2.  But actually I was reading that one of the limiting factors on the iPhone is the flash  memory couldn't even keep up with USB 3.  So even if they did make it USB 3 you couldn't get the throughput necessary to take advantage  of it because they got cheaper flash memory.  But there's also just another indication.

Start time: 751.40
End time: 757.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not a new thing.  We've had these ports on PCs forever that can't even come close to pushing out the data.

Start time: 757.38
End time: 778.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it would be nice to have a faster connection when you're downloading videos or stealing  stuff from other people.  But also this is just another indication of how this is just an example of a necessary  connector because how the world is moving towards wireless and cloud.  So basically it's a power.  It's a power.  It's a recharging plug.

Start time: 779.14
End time: 787.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean if they wanted to do something really revolutionary, have a phone that doesn't need  a charger.  Aren't we already pretty close to that with other devices?  The induction chargers?  Fuel cells.

Start time: 788.43
End time: 790.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, an induction charger.  We started on fuel cells.

Start time: 791.29
End time: 792.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would have been cool.

Start time: 792.18
End time: 793.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go ahead, start on fuel cells.

Start time: 793.54
End time: 815.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, the problem with fuel cells is it's always five years off and it's every year  it's five years off.  The issue is you can't get fuel that's strong enough to run the fuel cell that the FAA will  approve.  So you can make one of the things but they never let you take it onto an airplane.  And think about that for all these devices not being able to fly with them.  Some of this stuff's insane.  Yet they will let you have alcoholic beverages on the plane and a few other things.

Start time: 816.54
End time: 820.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think it'd be cool if you could run these phones on vodka.  If you could get the little bottles.

Start time: 821.86
End time: 824.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's been my argument for a while.  Either drink the vodka or run your phone.

Start time: 825.08
End time: 827.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or just drink so much that you can talk into a break and it doesn't matter.

Start time: 828.18
End time: 849.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly right.  And that's going to be the nature of today's episode, ladies and gentlemen.  Episode 371 will be floating around.  It'll be spinning around in a circle.  iPhone 5, wait, here's one.  I don't know who did this rundown but Apple's timid new iPod Nano sidesteps a smart watch revolution.  This must be Chad.

Start time: 850.36
End time: 865.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you want to talk about it?  What they did was, they had this great form factor for the Nano where everybody was making  watch bands about it.  And so what did they do?  They changed it to like this vertical to this rectangular.

Start time: 868.24
End time: 870.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They hate it when people have fun, she says.

Start time: 871.44
End time: 890.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, when it's used for something that they didn't intend, like what camera app was using  the volume keys as a phone camera trigger and they got it shut down because they were  using the hardware in an unintended way?  I remember that vaguely.  Yeah, that was Camera Plus.  And so I think it was just an unintended use of the hardware and they hate it when people  do that.

Start time: 891.22

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  iPhone 5 won't support simultaneous voice and data on Verizon or Sprint.  Well, this is nothing new.

Start time: 900.89
End time: 928.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  LTE is basically, it's data only, it's packet switching, it doesn't do voice.  And this is one of the problems that they thought originally is that it would use up  too much battery because you'd have to have all two radios running and with a dynamic  antenna it'd be a problem.  But apparently they've gotten around it.  Here's the thing, John.  How many times do you want to talk and look up something on the phone anyway?  And even if you did, you'd have to be using either a speaker phone or a headset.

Start time: 928.82
End time: 955.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have enough trouble with a regular old-fashioned phone that has the buttons on the handle and  it says, if you want to do this, press 3.  And so you have to pull it out and push it and then it says something.  What, what, what?  And so then it says, what, what, what?  And so then you just push something.  It says, no, no, no, no, that's wrong.  You want to do it.  And you have to go back to the menus again.  Okay, press.  If you want to do something, press 3.  Okay, 3.  What, what?  Yeah.  Well, the phone is worse.

Start time: 955.38
End time: 958.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  John, you might want to go back to the one that dials.  It probably works.

Start time: 958.22
End time: 980.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have to have them for sale, but they killed the whole dial thing.  I know they don't work anymore.  The battery phones don't work anymore?  On most switches, yeah.  Oh, they don't.  Damn.  Okay.  I actually have an old Bakelite one.  Oh yeah?  Yeah, big clunker.  And it has a really loud bell ring.  And it's Bakelite.  They should go back.  This is what they should be doing.  We need an iPhone made out of Bakelite.

Start time: 980.10
End time: 984.30

But speaking of apps, Bill Atkinson, you know who Bill Atkinson is, right?  Everybody knows him.  Everybody knows Bill Atkinson.  And he's also a big camera fanatic now.  So he has this very cool app.  He's talking about his app called PhotoCard.  Have you seen this?  No.  Anybody?  No.  It's very meticulous.  It pays a lot of attention to detail.  So this app basically uses, you can either use his nature photos or your own photos and  create a laminated postcard.  He'll put the postage on it.  It's actually very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, because you can actually, so now the fact that you can plug it in upside down,  I guess I don't know if it requires more pins or fewer pins, but anyway, so they used to  have an analog out pin, but they went all digital.  So now with, you know, that little adapter is actually, one of the reasons why it's so  expensive is because it actually has a digital to analog converter.  And so it's got active circuitry in the little adapter that then supplies an analog out.  It looks like there's still going to be problems.  So you'll be able to play something through your dock or your car, but you might not be  able to control it.  Oh, through the car.  Yeah, through the car.

There's all kinds of things, different directions we can go, but let's get this out of the way.  iPhone 5, because everybody wants to hear about this stupid phone.  Well, what do you think about the iPhone 5?  I don't think it's a big deal.  Well, you want to hear my opinion?  Let's see.  I think I have a column on PCMag.  Apple's not so...  What a coincidence.  I write a lot of columns.  Apple's not so new iPhone.  Not so new.  Now, I praised it.  I praised the phone.  Did you?  I come here to praise the iPhone.  I'd love to see you criticize.  Yeah, it's all right.  No, it's total praise.  I was...  People said, oh, you know, he's going to say bad things because he hates Apple.  Let me start with this.  I'm going to read from this column.  Okay.  The iPhone 5 is the best iPhone produced yet.  That's a stretch.  Of course.  Thin is fastest.  It's bigger, brighter, faster, and cooler than the rest of the lot.  But so what?  Is when I had to finish that sentence, kind of.  It's just an incremental improvement on the iPhone 4S and even on the original iPhone  for that matter.  And then I go on with how Apple's painted itself into a corner and really can't veer  too far.  And my assertion in this column is that Apple should have some parallel development going  on like they've had with all their other products.  There is no parallel iPhone development that I know of.

And I think Apple probably is doing R&D in the same areas.  And then they'll come out with that.  And that we can call revolutionary and thinner and faster and gorgeous and whatever.

The Docomo phone.  Very good.  And they show all these fancy little moving icons.  Look at this.  You losers in the United States don't even know what a good phone is.

And this is a thing that people don't understand, is that you could use it for getting information  about anything.  I could tap anything in this room and if it has a tag on it, it would give me…  Wow, that's a pretty cool idea.  …an option to just go in and tap anything in this room.

Transcript:  Oh, hi John.  I've just painted my face red and gold for the game, you know.  I'm not here because I am on my way to Candlestick Park, home of the San Francisco 49ers, to  watch us beat up on the Detroit Lions.  But I've come back via the miracle of technology to tell you a little bit about our friends  at Citrix and GoToMeeting.  GoToMeeting now has HD faces so if somebody…  If you're doing a sales call, I just read…  I'm going to pull this up again.  There's a great article I just read about a psych study that Cornell did recently that  was just fascinating about how we decide whether we trust somebody or not.  Let me see if I can pull this up again.  It was something like Robots and how you can trust a robot.  It was in the New York Times.  I'm going to pull it up.  I'm going to show you.  Times Trust Robots.  Who is…  This isn't worked.  That was a good search.  Who is trustworthy?  A robot can help us.  Here's the story right here.  Let me scroll up.  So, the deal is they did this study and it's complicated how they did it and all that stuff.  But essentially, what it came down to is they got some college kids to meet in person  and then play a game that required trusting your partner or not trusting your partner,  making decisions about how… depending on how much you trusted them.  But the key was…  I thought it was very interesting.  They said a person's ability to predict what their partner was going to do was far greater  Face-to-face than online.  Apparently, and they were able to kind of narrow it down, there are cues for specific  gestures that predict whether a person is less trustworthy.  Leaning away from someone, crossing arms in a blocking fashion, touching, rubbing or grasping  hands together and touching oneself on the face, abdomen or other… like this.  So, but here's the point.  When you see somebody face-to-face, you can make decisions and judgments about how trustworthy  they are or how untrustworthy they are.  People make decisions based on face-to-face meetings.  They tried the same thing using instant messenger introducing the people.  They had no clues.  And then they tried it with robots and they found that the robots leaned back or touched … even that indicated the robot itself was less trustworthy.  So, this is a long way around to talk about go-to-meeting with HD faces.  So, we've talked about go-to-meeting before.  It's the online meeting solution from Citrix.  Let's just share screens and do training or presentations, sales, that kind of thing.  But now they've got HD faces.  You can turn on a webcam and they'll see you and you'll see them.  And the point I was making is how important this is for making decisions about the trustworthiness.  If you're doing a sales pitch, HD faces is huge.  You can see how your client's reacting to you.  Your client can see whether they trust you, can make decisions.  It's just fantastic.  And they've done such a good job.  This has been around for a while.  You could spend $20,000 for a big expensive video conferencing system.  But now you can do it with go-to-meeting for $49 a month for as many meetings as you want,  as long as you want.  And the HD faces is so cool.  It's great video.  You can even attend your meeting.  Whoops, the video stream is currently unavailable.  Oh, well.  I guess there's too many people trying it out right now.  Here's what you do.  Visit gotomeeting.com.  It works on an iPad, by the way.  The camera on the iPad and even the audio and video and the microphone on the iPad  can be used to go to a meeting.  You hold a meeting from a Mac or a PC, but you can attend a meeting from a variety of devices,  including an iPhone, an iPad, an Android device.  Here's your deal.  Go to the website.  Go to meeting.com.  Click this orange Try It Free button.  And I want you to enter in the promo code TWIT.  And you can try this for...  Oops, didn't do it right.  T-W-I-T.  And you can try it for free for 30 days.  I'm telling you, this is a great way to meet, to collaborate, to train.  Go to meeting.com.  And the promo code is TWIT.  All right.

Google says do not track option.  I'll get it eventually.  They say that they're going to add a do not track option.  Anybody think this is a big deal?  They should have done this a long time ago.

Transcript:  Okay, that's the end of that topic.  Google rejects White House request.  Oh, this is actually a very interesting...  I actually wanted to talk about this in the No Agenda show earlier.  Google rejects White House request to pull Mohammed film clip,  which is supposedly causing all these problems around the world.  So here's the question I have.  Maybe if they had...  What's his name from Viacom ask him to pull the clip?  They would have pulled it.  It's a bad idea.  What's his name?  Sumner Redstone.  If he'd have made a call, boom, they would have pulled it.

Start time: 2121.90
End time: 2143.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But now they're not pulling it.  You don't respond to violence.  If you respond to violence, then it's a cause and effect.  The next person that's killed to get you to do something is your fault.  So you never respond to violence.  You don't reward this behavior.  So once they killed somebody, they can't pull this clip.  They can be ordered to do it, but they can't do it themselves.  You know how hard it is to get Google's attention.  Where are you getting this kind of theory?  It's the...

Transcript:  My old law enforcement pass has come back.  But it's the same reason you don't pay ransom.  It says once you do it, you put a price on everybody's head.  It just says, okay, you're willing to pay $3 million for that person.  So we want $3 million.  You'll steal another member of your family.  So same reason here.  If you want to get Google's attention and they pulled this,  then it means that Google would respond to this kind of thing.  And so the next country that kills off either a Google employee or a diplomat  to get Google to do something, it becomes Google's fault.  So their best bet is not to do anything.  Make sure it's clear that this particular behavior doesn't work  if they want something to do with it.

I remember when we've had these conversations before  about Google responding to police requests to remove items.  And you criticize them for removing it.  Now you're criticizing them for not removing it?  Sir?

Start time: 2205.98
End time: 2223.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's interesting she'd make this assertion.  No, I'm not really criticizing them.  I'm just saying that Google is quick to remove stuff  when some of their redstone asks for it.  But when their own U.S. government makes a simple request, they say no.  And like you just said, yeah, the police make the request and they say yes.

Besides having over too much color in the wine nowadays,  they also use something called Mega Purple.  And you could use like just a few drops of this stuff  and you could fill it up with water and it looks like a glass of wine.  And so you can go around the party looking like you're drinking a lot and keeping up.  The point of that is?  Being able to drive home.  Maybe that's one good point.  Or also getting other people drunk and then you can...  And also when you say something silly, you can blame it on the alcohol even if you haven't had enough to drink.  Yes. Anyway.  Yes, I was pouring... I pour water in my wine only here.  Okay. So the clip is not going to be pulled.  Did you guys watch this movie?  No.  I didn't. No.  Have you watched it?

What do you really think, John?  So that guy...  Like dinner tonight. We know that.  Well, they haven't invited me so far.  So anyway, the Google guy said, this is not good.  Because they have to plan.  There's a multi-billion dollar company.  They've got to have contingency plans.  I have an idea. Let's just buy up all the dark fiber.  And if these guys do that, we'll just roll it out.  And now meanwhile they can be practicing in Kansas City  how to run an ISP.  And see what the problems are set up.

The coolest thing that actually was sort of the sleeper at IDF was they announced that they had finally  able to put wireless radios on the chip.  Because normally radio circuitry has a lot of analog components,  which are hard to put into silicon.

And it was all their analog chip designers that had a coronary the next day because they said it couldn't be done.  Now it gets interesting.  And so it took them a decade to figure it out and get it done.  They actually did the impossible.  So it's the computer of tomorrow.

Remember that?  That responded to his emotions.  So like a...  When was this?  That was as he opened his talk.  It was the last talk at IDF.  That's the one you can't miss.  It's the one where they talk about the stuff that's coming.  I missed it.  Yeah, well, it was a psychic hit.  You look at him and in the ears he showed his emotions.  I want it for Halloween.

Transcript:  It's very exciting.  You know what?  In retail, it makes so much sense to have an enormous monitor and have people come around  and they can swipe their hands around and they can choose and pick and learn and blah,  blah, blah and interact.  You did exactly right.  Yeah, so for retail, there's a lot of use cases and also for accessibility and for learning  and for people who have like little five-year-old hands and can't type yet.  There are a lot of use cases for Kinect for Windows or other operating systems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And one of the best parts in all of that stuff, since you're not using things people actually  touch, you're in a field, they don't break.  I mean, you think about all the stuff you've seen in stores.  You're going, hey, it's really cool and the last three people broke it all apart.  With Kinect, because you can seal it all in, there's a good chance that somebody, unless  they get really creative, can't break it.

Yeah, yeah, with Windows 8 and Windows RT and all these new slew of, you know, hybrid...  So what do you think is what's going to happen with Windows 8?  I think people are going to gripe a lot about it.  They're going to complain a lot about it.  But then, look, this is the future.  I mean, it's, you know, tiles and touch screens and...

And they can't be bothered with all those consumer tiles and the slipping and the sliding  and the fun.  They need to get their work done.  And they still need a damn keyboard.  And they need to have all their applications where they're used to them.  And I think that Windows 8 is going to get passed over by the enterprise and government  and people who do work.  And...

The web goes viral with complaints about the changes even.  We just don't like change.  And this is a big change.  And I like it.  I actually use it.  You what?  I finally got used to it.

Transcript:  And they brought forward three large companies that just fell in love with Windows 8.  But the funny thing is the one they fell in love with was actually Windows RT because  they wanted it over the iPad.  Pretty much the same?  Well, except you don't have that dual mode.  You kind of live in Windows RT.  You live in what used to be called Metro.  You don't go back to the interface.  And then you position it against the iPad and it's all the stuff they kind of like in terms of  compatibility, manageability, security and the apps they want to use like Office, which  doesn't really run on the iPad, in a device.  And the enterprises like that a lot.  When it came to running it on a PC, they're kind of, we'll wait until Windows 9 and see what  happens.  I mean they're just now deploying Windows 7 in most cases.  In fact, most of them are going to be deploying Windows 7 next year.  So they're always slow on an OS.

Like Facebook has big security problems,  and they have a huge team of white hackers that work there  and that work on people who are getting phished  and people whose accounts are getting taken over.

Well, I mean, there was, you know, on, when was it?  Last weekend?  Or they, you know, basically GoDaddy went down,  or at least the DNS went down.  For a couple, quite a few hours.  Quite a few hours.  And apparently there was first somebody from Anonymous claimed that  they brought it down, and then later in the week,  GoDaddy said no, it was a router that failed or something.  But the interesting thing about that story is that  everybody sort of bought into the idea that, you know,  a hacker would have taken them down because GoDaddy has this reputation,  I mean, for being, you know, sexist, anti-SOPA or pro-SOPA, you know,  the president shoots the elephants.  Oh, that was such a great story.  So everybody sort of accepted that this guy, that GoDaddy is such an  unlikable company that, you know, that they could buy into the being hacked.

So they put a bunch of resources on it.  Meanwhile, these international, horrible international operations,  which should be busted, why has Microsoft had to become  the world's police force to crack down on this?  They're doing it.  I'm reminded of this...

And they don't want the reputation of being the company you can't trust  because these botnets are being used...

Start time: 3718.80
End time: 3730.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, because also of that enterprise relationship and the fact that  they're trying to sell this new mobile phone platform and security  is a huge part of their marketing, they're trying to sell it to the enterprise  on the basis of, oh, this is more secure because we say so.

Start time: 3731.93
End time: 3759.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But the reality is they're standing behind it.  I mean, at least in this particular case, it wasn't like the end of the 90s  where they said, yeah, we're securing, yeah, they really weren't.  Now, at least they're putting resources behind it, making sure they're fixed.  But the good question is that you're asking is why isn't the government doing this?  Because these botnets, they're not anti-Microsoft anymore, they're anti-us,  and there are criminal organizations that are funding it.  It really should be law enforcement taking a much bigger role.  And I agree with you, often law enforcement seems to be spending more time  trying to catch kids that are copying movies  and not enough time catching their professional criminals.

Transcript:  I'll tell you one story, though. I was at a VC Christmas party,  and you know how those are, they're very big affairs.  You went to a VC Christmas party?  Yeah, last year. And I happened to be standing at the dessert table,  loaded with these gorgeous desserts, and I'm looking at the guy's ID tag next to me,  it says, U.S. Government. So I'm thinking either CIA or FBI, so I strike up a conversation.  You sure it wasn't Al Gore?  No, but so I struck up a conversation with him, and I said, you know,  one thing that gets me is why isn't the government doing more to, you know,  prevent spammers and hackers and all that? And he said, we're too busy fighting terrorism.

Start time: 3874.94

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, there's so much terrorism going on.  So I'm reminded of about, remember the story was about two and a half, three years ago,  where some guy was being hounded by a hacker, and he finally, he had to do all the research,  found out where the kid, it was a kid, where he lived, he was in Minnesota or someplace like that.  He found out where he lived, he was in his parents' basement or something along those lines,  and he turned all the data over to the FBI, said, we've got to do something.  This guy's a horrible hacker, he's ruining my life.  And they said, we haven't got time for it. They gave him all the stuff they needed,  and he would do nothing.

Start time: 3905.48
End time: 3912.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, he was a horrible hacker? Was he just a 14-year-old who was harassing someone?  Was he just a troll, or was he actually a hacker?  Because those are two vastly different things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  Well, I had a worst story. I had a guy sent me an email, what was it, last week, and he said,  he had a problem, he has a computer business, there were a couple guys that were doing material recovery,  you know, where they pulled the precious metals out of computers, they were homeless folks,  he let them come in, work in his shop, stuff started disappearing, so he kicked them back out again.  They started posting stuff all over the web that he was a pedophile, aggressive, just destroying his business,  went to law enforcement, they wouldn't help him, and so I put him in touch with,  because I've never actually gone through this process, with a number of companies that specialize in  kind of protecting your reputation.  He found, he called two, one outfit wanted to charge him 10 grand to fix it,  another outfit on the East Coast charged him 2,500 bucks.  He said, not only did they fix his reputation, traffic's gone up on his site, and the rest of it,  I wish I had the name of the outfit, I was going to write about it next week, but I haven't actually written it yet.

Transcript:  So I couldn't find any grease, but I think if I just, if I use a Sharpie and I just put this right under here,  that keeps the glare out, so when I'm ready to receive in the end zone.  Hey, John.  What?  Washable marker.  No, I think, oh dear, it says permanent.  Oh, well, hey, I'll tell you what, I'll defer that for a little bit.  And then meanwhile, talk about stamps.com.  Stamps.com, it lets you send and receive, well, what am I talking about?  Print US postage.  You send mail without going to the post office.  It's like you use your own computer, your own printer, and you print out postage,  print out the mailing labels, all of, you're basically, the post office is here, right here.  This is a post office, and you can wear crazy clothes and have, and it doesn't matter.  I love stamps.com.  I know you're going to love it, too.  The deal is, Mac or PC, you go to stamps.com, and they have a USB scale.  We're going to, you know, we fight over the scale.  We actually got two accounts because we keep fighting over the scale, and I think I've lost it again.  But the USB scale's great because you never overpay or underpay.  You ever put more stamps on a package just to make sure it would get there?  Waste money, not with stamps.com.  I want you to visit stamps.com and find out what they can do for you.  If you're an Amazon or eBay seller, it's great because they'll actually print out the form right from the website,  so you don't have to even, you know, cut and paste or anything.  Always have the right postage on hand, even when the postage rates change.  And it's so cool, you even can get at stamps.com.  You can even get discounts you don't get at, oh, these are actual customers.  So you don't get at the post office.  The 21% on express mail, up to 15% on priority mail.  Never go to the post office again.  Wow, did you see that?  The word post office is trademarked.  That's interesting.  I guess the post office owns the word post office.  Stamps.com, they let you print postage and you can try it right now.  I'll tell you what, go to stamps.com and right there on the front page, you'll see the $80 special offer.  $25 in postage, you get a digital skit.  Wait a minute, we can do better than that.  See the microphone, click that.  Enter the offer code TWIT.  Now watch, watch the magic.  First of all, you get a really old picture of me.  And you get a better value, $110 bonus, $55 in coupons, a free digital scale.  You pay the shipping and handling, about five bucks.  So to make up for that, they get a $5 supply kit and a four week trial.  Stamps.com, you can put it right on the envelopes, look super pro.  Print your own mailing labels and postage.  Never go to the post office again.  Stamps.com.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.  And now, I send it back to you, John C. Dvorak.

Transcript:  Thanks, Leo.  I understand that you're stuck in traffic.  Leo, can you come back?  No?  He's gone.  That camera in his car, what's weird, he has a car with a green screen in it.  So it makes him look like he's in the studio.  He's the only guy that does that.  And by the way, it's not cheap.  So, okay, we wanted, while we were on the break there,  we discussed the possibility of talking about Elon Musk's new ideas.  So he's got this one, which is, I think a lot of his stuff is,  definitely the guy's a big thinker.  And I think this latest one, big drinker?  No, I think he's a drinker.  Maybe both.  Yeah, well, he better be.  So now he's come up with this idea, he says the California high speed rail,  which I agree with him 100%, is a big scam.  He says the slowest high speed rail in the world.  It'll never be built.  Oh, really?

Transcript:  It's just a waste of the taxpayer's money, as far as I'm concerned.  But anyway, he has this scheme, he says it's called, what's it called, the hyper...  Hypertunnel?  It's essentially, you know when you had the department stores back in the 30s?  They had these tubes.  These pneumatic tubes.  These pneumatic tubes, and you'd stick a thing in there,  and it would get sucked down to the accounting office,  and then they'd write down, oh, shoot.

Start time: 4275.87
End time: 4294.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So this works differently.  You remove the air from the tube, and that removes air resistance,  and then you can go supersonic.  Yeah.  And so now you really have high speed train.  I mean, instead of looking over at China and saying, they've got Mag-11,  we've got a train that's probably, when we build it 30 years out of date,  we could actually have something that's ahead of China,  but our government doesn't do that.  We're talking about...  I don't know.

Transcript:  Here's the irony before you go on with your thought, because I'm known for interrupting.  No.  Really? You do it so well.  So here's the irony of this whole thing. Here's what happened.  Amazon is just doing its own thing, saying, well, we're sending all this stuff out,  and then all these brick-and-mortar companies are going, you guys aren't charging tax, you're screwing us,  you guys are the worst, you're miserable, we've got to do something,  let's bring in the legislators and do whatever we can to stop you.  So Amazon says, oh, really? So that's the way you want to play it.  We'll put a warehouse up in Nevada, put one in Sacramento, put one in...  because you're going to charge tax anyway, and we'll do same-day delivery,  direct to the guy's house, and if you're a member of Prime, it'll be free.  You think that's a better idea?  Make that Chamber of Commerce.  So the guys now, all these guys, oh, we didn't mean it, we were sorry, we were complaining.  They're just going to screw everybody.

Transcript:  Well, you know, speaking of Amazon and Prime, one thing that I was surprised...  Are you a Prime member?  I am.  And one thing I was surprised on this fire is that they didn't exploit the Prime subscription more.  We thought that they might offer a subsidized tablet if you subscribe to, like...  So, for Prime subscribers, you get the tablet for $99 or something.  Yeah.  And then you get all the videos you can watch.  Do Prime customers get discounts on anything else?  I didn't quite understand.  Well, you get free videos.

Start time: 4810.70
End time: 4817.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

They're shipping it also with a whole bunch of the new smart TVs  to make them really, really smart.  And I think that that will put them...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

And at this point, Roku is really challenging cable TV very, very hard.  And I think they've designed a product that's much, much easier to use  than any other smart TV platform I've seen.  Easier than plugging in your Xbox or PlayStation.

For example?  And you know, doing buttons on the internet.  You know, gaming it.

I mean, nobody was using it.  Yeah, I remember that.  And then they said, come on, look at this.  This is the next operating system.  Tell us what you think.  And everyone says, this is fantastic.  This is really good.  If Vista was this good, I'd use this.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  And all it was was proving that Microsoft's marketing stinks.  So they bring it up.  It's been done.

I'm here to tell you a little bit about Squarespace.com, everything you need to build an exceptional website.  The new Squarespace is here, and I got to tell you, it is spectacular.  We use it for our blog, InsideTWIT.  And, you know, unlike the very expensive websites we purchased, the InsideTWIT site never goes down.  You notice that? It never has any problems, never has any security issues.  What's the deal? What's the deal?  We should have done everything in Squarespace.com.  Squarespace, you should be doing it.  You start with a beautiful set of templates, designer templates.  And I got to tell you, the best thing about Squarespace...  This is the free trial, two weeks free.  You don't need a credit card, you don't need anything.  You can use Squarespace. Use all the features of Squarespace.com.  Where is it? Whoops. Whoa, whoa. There we go.  All you have to do is provide them with a name, email, and password, and you're good.  You're good to go. You can create your very own website.  Try all the features of Squarespace.com.  One of the features of the new Squarespace I really like is this responsive design.  You know, the whole... It's a new philosophy in web design.  Used to be you'd have a mobile site.  How much do we spend on our mobile site? Like six grand, right, for twit.tv?  Not anymore? You don't do that anymore.  What you do is you have one site that fits all.  It's called responsive design, and it automatically happens with Squarespace.  Every image that you upload, they process it into seven different sizes  so that your site looks great, whether it's a 27-inch display, or an iPhone, or an iPad, or an Android.  It always looks good. It just does it automatically.  And you don't have to even think about it when you're doing your design.  And by the way, very easy to do design. You just drag and drop the margins.  I mean, it couldn't be simpler.  And if you know CSS and JavaScript, of course, it's easy.  They have a code editor that colorizes the syntax and everything.  But you don't have to to get a great-looking site.  Your content, your existing content, if you have it, in Tumblr, Wordpress, or Blogger,  goes right in and right out. You're never trapped.  And the integration into Twitter and Flickr, all of that stuff is just so simple, so easy.  Even Google Maps, you can just embed them right on your blog.  I just think Squarespace is the tool you've been looking for,  the best hosting plus the best software to make an exceptional website.  And the best part is the pricing.  Let me go back to the Squarespace page here and show you.  The pricing is fantastic.  How much do we spend on that site?  You know, like $100,000.  So let me just show you how much it costs.  This is hosting. What do we spend? $5,000 a month in hosting?  This is hosting plus the software.  $8 a month if you buy annually on the Basic Plan, $10 month to month.  My suggestion is buy the annual plan unlimited.  $16 a month, you get unlimited pages, galleries, and blogs, unlimited bandwidth,  unlimited storage, unlimited contributors.  When you buy an annual plan, either annual plan,  they'll automatically give you a free domain registration at hookitup.com.org.net.biz.info.  It's yours to keep forever, but they set it up for you for free, and they'll hook it up to your website.  You get all these great features.  $16 a month, and if you buy an annual plan, you'll save a lot when you use the offer code TWIT9.  TWIT9, that's the month, September 9th month, saves you 10% off that first purchase.  We love Squarespace. Try it free right now. Squarespace.com.  And if you decide to buy, that's all we ask, use the offer code TWIT9 to save 10%.  It's just the best.  All right, the game's about to start. I'm going to have to send it back to Twitter.  I'm getting excited. John C. Dvorak, line up. It's ready. Kick.

Start time: 5802.98
End time: 5818.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook and the mobile web has been this whole big thing.  So Mark Zuckerberg, there was a TechCrunch Disrupt Conference this week,  and it was the only other big draw in town aside from the Apple Show.  IDF.  And that Magic Fingers.

Start time: 5821.92
End time: 5889.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just the timing. So anyways, Mark Zuckerberg got up on stage at Disrupt, and he was really speaking off the cuff.  Nobody had any idea what he was going to be willing to talk about or what kind of mood he was in.  What Clint Eastwood?  Yeah, that would have been great. No, that would have been what Mike Harrington would have done if Zuck just hadn't felt like going on stage.  That would have been awesome. I want to see that someday.  So anyways, Zuck goes up on stage and he says, OK, I know we've been pushing really hard for the mobile web for the past year.  We've just been nailing it into people's brains like this is the way of the future.  But actually, it's the biggest mistake our company ever made.  And all the neckbeards were like, yeah, so I being a neckbeard without the beard was like, and I went to Facebook a couple of days later.  And Facebook every now and then they'll do these whiteboard lunches where they'll get like 10 journalists tops in a room  and they'll let us talk to some of their really, really smart, high ranking people.  Well, this time there were the 10 journalists, you know, the Facebook press corps.  And then they brought in some Gartner analysts and they brought in Robert Scoble.  And I'm like, what's Scoble doing here? They must really want the word out about something because Scoble talks. He's a talker.

Start time: 5890.28
End time: 5893.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you can telephone, telegraph or tell Scoble. Exactly right.

Start time: 5893.94
End time: 5921.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And bless his heart. That's why they had him there.  So what they had us there to talk about was iOS.  And the big thing everybody in the room wanted to discuss was what did Mark Zuckerberg mean when he said it's him off five was a big mistake?  Because Facebook, they've been leading this whole HTML 5 mobile web push, but they've also been involved in standards like they went into the W3C  and they started the core mob group and then they started this ring mark test suite and boring you to death.

Start time: 5921.48
End time: 5924.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, I'm not being bored. I'm wondering why they've been doing.

Start time: 5924.48
End time: 5949.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've been doing all this advocacy in the free and open source software world to push for the mobile web.  And they found out that they couldn't make it work on the iPhone. In reality, it didn't work.  But at Facebook, they still have all these engineers that are working very hard on core mob and ring mark and all their other mobile web projects.  They just can't do it for iOS right now. And I don't I don't really blame Facebook for that.  OK, I don't know who I blame for that.

Transcript:  Oh, because I don't get invited to these things. Now you do. You want to go? No, you just have to be really.  I get invited. I well I could be invited just as a courtesy.  Yeah, because then maybe I might just go just to, you know, say, hey, how you doing?

Start time: 5966.44
End time: 5969.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, that's why they didn't invite you. I mean, if they were sure you weren't going to go, then they'd invite you.

End time: 5981.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If they were. Oh, I see what you're saying. I can't be vague. No. So I have to just I'm never going to go. So invite me. Yeah.  Yeah, OK. I can try that. So HML five is the future of the web.

Start time: 5981.80
End time: 6007.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How can they? Well, the future of the mobile web. Well, the mobile web is the future of mobile applications.  You guys know about this. We know and believe that they think native applications are kind of going into the dustbin of history.  Mozilla and Yahoo and a bunch of other companies think the same way.  But of course, Apple doesn't and Google can't afford to.  But Facebook can afford to because they don't have any hardware.  They don't have any reason to want the native platforms to succeed.

Start time: 6007.98
End time: 6024.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's really the problem with Apple, because Apple only wants native platforms.  I know. And when they went 180 degrees from this this web based app model, which is what they started with, it didn't work to one that says, you know, our apps, our apps only work on our phone.  Apple in general, all the apps are written specifically for the device. Yeah.

Start time: 6024.84
End time: 6045.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I know. And Facebook had their their iPhone device, the one that everyone said sucked, that had two and a half stars on the app store was mostly an HML five app.  You know, then they rewrote it from the ground up in Objective C.  And now it works beautifully and it causes Zuckerberg and everyone else to say, oh, the mobile web is doomed.  And the hackers at Facebook are saying, no, no, it's not doomed. Just give us some more time.  We'll fix this thing.

Start time: 6046.98

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, somebody on the chat room is mentioning, you know, where's the status of Flash and all this?  Because this is really what the deal is all about.  Get rid of Flash. And it was supposedly when HTML five was announced, Flash was doomed that day and it never was doomed.  And now I don't know, do you guys get this on your some of my browsers?  When I when I when a video shows up, I get this little box in front of the video that says, hey, we're trying to get some of your memory here.  You want to allow it or deny it?  And it's a little box. And then the things blink in the cursor.  But you had this problem and the cursor, your cursor is blinking and winking and you can't figure out where it is.  And so you pound on the control key to get that zero to show up.  And then you try to move the cursor over to click on deny or allow.  And neither one of the buttons work.  So you pound and pound and pound on the deny button and nothing happens.  And then once in a while when it does deny it, it disappears and a new one comes up.  Exactly. John needs a hug.  I do need a hug. Big time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm telling you, this is like all over the place.  And it's the most annoying thing.  And then the worst thing is that one of these things pops up in a background window.  You can be on some other browser and your cursor still doesn't work all over the machine.  So you got to scrounge around through all your tabs to find this idiotic thing, which may be in an ad on the site.  And you have to like close that window.  Does anybody else have this problem besides myself and Andrew?

So we have, for people out there listening to the show, you should know that Google's got this Street View thing where you can see the outside of people's houses and walk up and down the blocks.  And they're going into certain buildings so you can get a look inside the building.  And now eventually, Jolie mentioned earlier that you can get instructions on how to find gate 15 at the San Francisco airport because you're apparently too dumb to know that it's near 13 and 14.  Besides that.  So we have an expert here that has mapped the Twitt Cottage.  So now you can go to Petaluma and you can open the front door and you can walk in and you'll be able to walk in and there you go.  There's the brick wall.  There's the brick wall and there's the, look at that.  Where's the no agenda brick in there?  It's in there somewhere.  And then you can go to the bathroom.  You can take a leak, actually, believe it or not.  No.  Yes.  You can pee on your screen and it will show up in the Brickhouse Studio.  Try it.

And I actually, I've talked about this on the KnowAgendaShow.com.  And I actually saw coming out of the, we go to a raw milk dairy and we actually go there  and buy the milk directly.  And coming out of the driveway was an actual dump truck full of crap cow manure.  And it was steaming.  So, I mean, you've heard about the steaming pile of crap.  I actually witnessed this and it does steam.  And it's like a bunch of steam coming off this hot cow manure.  You know, it's fitting for your idiom.

It's astonishing.  You're so far off the rails.  No, I'm telling you.  It may be off the rails, but it's educational.  We haven't lived.  To whom?  Well, it seemed educational at the time.

Start time: 6548.86
End time: 6559.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So, yeah, these are helium-filled drives.  They're ultra dense.  They spin at very high speeds, and the helium helps it operate in that way,  because they're not surrounded in air.  So one of the problems was...

Start time: 6559.48
End time: 6561.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 6568.08

Start time: 6572.78
End time: 6577.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

End time: 6597.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It'll get the Bernoulli effect or whatever.  It allows the head to float, and so it gives you some of the benefits of the vacuum problem.  Who comes up with these ideas?

Start time: 6597.48
End time: 6619.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've been working on this for 10 years, apparently, because helium had a tendency to leak out of the drives.  So after 10 years...  But this is going to be a big breakthrough, because they're going to increase the density of our drives substantially.  And then things won't die.  Think how much memory YouTube needs to archive and store all those videos.  It's just huge.  All I know is you'd get two terabytes for a hundred bucks.

You know, I've had it with the Samsung Galaxy S3.  I am ready to buy an iPhone 5.  Perhaps you, too, are ready to buy an iPhone 5, and that's why you should check out gazelle.com.  It's the easy way to get a little bit of money to pay for your new stuff, your gadgets.  Gazelle.com.  What is your iPhone worth?  Or maybe you want to trade in heaven for fun, the BlackBerry Rim, an HTC phone, LG, Motorola.  I wonder what that Galaxy S3 on AT&T is worth.  Let's see here how much they'd give me for my Galaxy S3, because I'm really ready to buy an iPhone here.  Where is it?  There it is.  Yeah.  Oh, 16 gigs.  It's a little dinged.  I dropped it off a building, but that's okay.  Free of water damage, you bet.  I'm just curious how much this thing is worth.  Whoa!  That pays for my new iPhone.  Look at that.  If you've got gadgets sitting around, gathering dust, you really ought to be bringing them to Gazelle.  They'll...  How about $210 for an iPhone 4S?  The nice thing about Gazelle is they pay the shipping.  If you have anything over $1, you just send them an email.  They'll send you back a mailing label.  You ship it to them, and then you get paid fast.  They'll send you a check, a PayPal credit, or this is the one I recommend, an Amazon gift card,  because they add an additional 5% to the value.  That's a great deal.  You probably got a ton of stuff just lying around.  Go to gazelle.com.  Get rid of the old, ring in the new.  Get that new iPhone.  Maybe you want the new iPod, a new MacBook.  They'll take your old gadgets and send you cash.  They even buy broken iPhones.  I've got my kid's iPhone.  The screen is broken.  You can sell that too.  You got to try it right now.  Gazelle.com.  Visit them.  If they ask you, tell them you heard about it on Twitter.  But the main thing is don't wait because that iPhone is not getting more valuable.  I'm pretty much pretty much can guarantee it's getting less valuable all the time.  I wonder how much it's worth.  $210. That's great.  If it's flawless, even more.  But that price is going to go down.  Sell it now. Get that 30-day quote.  Gazelle.com.  Alright.  Football time.  I send it back to you.  John C. Dvorak.  I hope you're holding out.  Jolie O'Dell.  Did you bring baked goods?

Transcript:  Monday, September 17th, the Space Shuttle Endeavour's hitching a ride atop the 747 to its new home in Los Angeles.  Tuesday, September 18th, Motorola and Intel have an announcement in London.  It may be the first Medfield-powered smartphone.  That's everybody's best guess.  Also, the Dreamforce Conference kicks off that day.  Wednesday, September 19th, LG and Qualcomm, with the Snapdragon branding, have an announcement to live without boundaries.  That one's in New York City.  Doors open at 8 a.m. Eastern time.  HTC has an announcement that same day in New York City to see what's next.  That one's at 11 a.m. Eastern.  And hopefully, they'll all be talking like pirates, because it is international talk like a pirate day on Wednesday.  Thursday, September 20th, the Tokyo Game Show opens in Tokyo, as you might expect.  Friday, September 21st, that iPhone 5 thing from Apple goes on sale.  And researchers Rizzo and Duong are scheduled to demonstrate the crime vulnerability in TLS and Speedy at the Echo Party Security Conference in Buenos Aires.  That's just a sample of the things we'll be keeping an eye on.  He disappeared.

Transcript:  I was just going to ask him something.  He's gone.  Oh, well.  So, just the last couple of things.  I guess Marissa Meyer just gave every Yahoo employee an iPhone 5.  And I suppose, didn't Microsoft just give everybody a Surface and a bunch of other things?  So, the only way they're going to get sales nowadays is just giving these things away to employees.

Transcript:  Honestly, I think she'll do better than anybody else has done.  She's the closest match to them.  Well, they had a series of folks that were there that had no clue about how to run the company.  Unfortunately, they ran it down so far.  It's almost unrecoverable.  But of anybody they could get, she was clearly the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why can't they promote from within?  People that actually know the company.  Well, because most of the smart guys left the company some time ago.  It seems to me that you know where the skeletons are hidden and all the rest of it.  They just keep bringing outsiders.  Well, yeah.  And as Ms. Venn says, she scares me.  Anyway, I think that will wrap it up for this week's...  Oh, no.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Do you have to go home?  At the Niners game.  I'm going to have to drive like the devil to catch up to Leo in his Maybach, even though I know he's...  I think it's a stretch Kremlin.  He doesn't have any engine in it.  He has slaves pulling it.  It takes forever to get the candlestick using that methodology.  And by the way, I want to thank somebody for dropping off the Book of Knowledge.  See? Look, the real Book of Knowledge.
