Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At the time, you didn't know what Sorghum was.  I feigned not knowing.  You actually did.  It was for the comedic effect of not appearing to know what Sorghum was, but in reality I  knew what it was.  I looked it up on Google before I did my talk.  It's a grain.  Related to sugar?  Because molasses comes from sugarcane.

End time: 425.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Basically, what the parodists did is they didn't modify the video in any way.  They merely changed Echo's answer.  Yeah, I was just playing the wrong video on that.

Start time: 463.12
End time: 467.21

End time: 490.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Start time: 492.22
End time: 515.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Anyway, watch the parody because it's absolutely hysterical.  And it's frankly kind of right on.  I mean, this is a product that is kind of naturally paradise.  What is Amazon up to with the Echo?  This is not so different from what a smartphone does.  But in some ways, you said it, Rob, it's more creepy.  I don't know why.  Seven microphones on the roof of this thing.

Start time: 515.46
End time: 531.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a theory.  All right.  So it's just going to be listening to everything you say all the time,  looking for keywords that it can serve ads around.  Ah.  Yeah, you know, that microphone you're using sucks.  You get a whole bunch of ads for microphones.  That's actually be a good use for it.

Start time: 531.60
End time: 539.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, a lot of people have been complained about the fire phone sort of railroading people.  I say the same thing with the fire phone.  Into the sort of the Amazon funnel, right?

Start time: 539.94
End time: 557.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got that phone that you loaned me.  It's horrible.  And you can have it, by the way.  Thanks.  What's interesting, there's one good feature.  What's that?  This crazy thing where it looks at anything, it scans into that thing.  Firefly, yeah.  And it says, oh, we've got that for sale.  And that's all it seems to be about because that's the best thing on there.

Start time: 558.35
End time: 571.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, that's what the talking tube is for.  It's going to infer what you need from your conversations.  That's what John says, yeah.  And you're going to go to your Amazon shopping cart.  And you'll have an offer.  And it'll just be full of all the, you said you wanted paper towels.  Yeah.  It'll be like, yeah, I did.

Start time: 571.66
End time: 577.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Well, that would be good because Amazon recommendations are notoriously horrific.  I mean, they basically recommend something you've already bought almost every time.  Yeah.

Start time: 578.70
End time: 582.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right?  Or something that you decided not to buy already.  Right.  Yeah.

Start time: 590.91
End time: 598.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you.  So you see one of these things in your novel list, for example, and you see someone in  someone's house mention your book a lot.  Excellent idea.  There you go.

Start time: 598.72

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Start time: 599.84
End time: 626.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Gorilla marketing.  Here is an interesting thing.  First of all, you have to apply.  It's invitation only.  That's obviously a marketing point.  What a crap.  Yeah, crap.  But if you're an Amazon Prime member, $99.  And that kind of confirms what you're thinking, John, that it's really aimed at the, just  as the Fire Phone was, the most avid Amazon users, the Prime.  So it seems that nobody.  Well, I don't know, Devendra.  I don't know about you, but I'm a Prime member.  Aren't you a Prime member?

Start time: 627.37
End time: 686.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'm a Prime member and I really like it.  But I think the failure of the Fire Phone was creating this thing that basically was  just to keep you in the Amazon ecosystem.  Right.  The Firefly feature is really cool, but it's just an easier way for you to buy stuff on  Amazon.  That's also a feature their mobile apps have.  So it's not like unique just to the Fire Phone.  I've kind of lost a lot of faith in Amazon's ability to create great consumer electronics  because the Fire Phone was a Me Too device that was priced way too high for what it actually  is.  Their tablets are fine.  They're okay, but they're still kind of bland and boring and they don't have the full Google  experience.  So they're not as good as other Android tablets.  I think the worst case scenario you guys are bringing up here, that's not how it works  right now, but it could eventually.  And that's terrifying because we are, I've seen a lot of startups that are working on  sort of artificial intelligence technology that could do what you're saying, like listen  to what you're saying and kind of infer recommendations and things like that.

Start time: 687.49
End time: 695.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to disagree with one point.  I really do like the Kindle.  I think it's a fine device.  The new Kindle is awesome.  I like the paper white.  That's the one I use.  I think it's fantastic.

Start time: 695.84
End time: 731.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yeah, you would like this new, it's 200 bucks, the new Voyage, which is basically kind of  like a paper white with no compromises at all.  It's really gorgeous.  It's really nice.  You can really read fast.  Well, it's got a faster processor so the page turns or, I mean, they've really done a nice  job.  Well, I bought Jibo, which is still not available and is exactly the same.  So I don't know why I'm creeped out by this.  Jibo, the whole idea of Jibo and it's more expensive is it sits on your counter and it  looks at you.  No, no, here's Jibo coming up here.  Yeah.

Start time: 732.96
End time: 738.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, isn't this what Mike Jibo looks at you?  It's kind of creepy.  It looks like the Pixar.  And it blinks.

Start time: 750.80
End time: 758.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  See, I didn't think it was creepy because it didn't come from Amazon or Microsoft.  It comes from some, actually, Cynthia Brazil, who is a robotics guru.

Start time: 759.99
End time: 760.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It'll be sold to one of them.

Start time: 805.82
End time: 828.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Okay, I don't know what's happened to me, but I didn't think this was creepy when I first  saw it.  And now I really think this is creepy.  What is the price?  I think it was expensive because it's crowdfunded.  So his skills keep expanding.  They've reached their $100,000 goal in four hours, a million dollars in seven days.  Hey, buddy.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, $600.  A piece?  Yeah.  And how late is it now?

Start time: 828.80

Transcript:  It doesn't actually exist.  No, no.  And Amazon's exists.

Start time: 835.82
End time: 847.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because when you think about what it costs to develop a sophisticated electronic product  like that, I mean, it's great that they raised a million bucks.  Not even close to what they made.  Man, yeah.

Start time: 847.60
End time: 887.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  And presumably Amazon's been working on this for a long time because the idea of the voice  wrecking.  I mean, look, we've got Siri, we've got Cortana, we've got Google Now, but those companies  all worked on those things for years with a large research team and a lot of smart people.  Where did this come from?  I mean, Amazon all of a sudden has voice recognition.  It had no product related at all.  Yeah.  So in that regard, at least it's impressive.  It is plugged in.  It's not battery powered.  It does the same thing as your phone though does, right?  It does say connected to the cloud so it's always getting smarter.  That also.  That's not good.  Yeah.  It really does play into this paranoia.

Start time: 889.60
End time: 908.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's terrifying.  There's another.  There's a startup I've been tracking called Ubii that's been developing something like  this as well.  Just like a thing you plug into wall socket.  It's always listening and always serves as a speaker.  Just kind of.  I could see it being useful eventually, but if we do all have smartphones near us all  the time, it is tough to think of something like this.  Like, what would you really use it for?

You're told that Connect's in the house on all the time, can see what's in the room  and figure, oh, you know, this guy looks like he's got volumes one, two, and three of this  book.  Let's push volume four.

Transcript:  Well, but Connect, I'll vouch for it.  When I sit down, it says, hi, Leo.  When Michael comes in, he says, hi, Michael.  When his mother comes in, it says, hi, Michael.  So, well, she looks a little bit like her son, but it does see you.  And in fact, it's always looking, obviously, because it wouldn't recognize you the minute  you walk into the room.  You can talk to it anytime you say Xbox, you know, watch TV and it'll turn on the TV and  all that.

Transcript:  I think, you know, I've heard all the complaints about the Xbox one's connect camera and I  own an Xbox one.  I really enjoy using that camera and the voice commands and everything.  So it really is about utility.  And the problem with Amazon's Echo is that Amazon, all they do is sell you stuff.  You know, you're just creating you're putting another conduit in your house for Amazon to  better sell you stuff and everything else they've tried to do outside of that hasn't  been as good.

OK.  John is my conscience.  Our show today brought to you by Shutterstock.com.  A great place, the place to go for royalty free stock images, video illustrations, just  sound now, by the way.  Visit Shutterstock.com and you'll see.  Well, I always like to go to the bottom.  Now they have, let's see the count, 44,415,849 royalty free stock images.  They added 300,000 this week.

So let's search for, I don't know, cylinder since we're talking about cylinders.  So now I'll find a lot of cylinders, but let's search, let's narrow it down, for instance,  because maybe your blog needs blue cylinders.  So we're going to, we're going to narrow it down by color and then they're going to match the color.  Or maybe you need cylinders that have people in them.  Or, and you can see, I go on and on.  You can actually choose whether it's editorial or not.  You could say what gender, what age, what ethnicity, any, what number of people you, I mean, this is an amazing search engine.  You want to search for, I like to search for happy.  You can use words like happy hippos and you will find happy hippopotami.  There's happy hippos.  Can you do sad hippos?  Of course.  Of course you can.  I have pink hippos.  There's an angry hippo.  I love, I have to say, I love Shutterstock.  If you need royalty free images, whether for your website, a publication,  if you're doing ads, your videos or any other type of project, even podcasts, because they also have now music.  So you can have musical score stuff.  I see movies nowadays in the, in the, I frequently see this in the credits.  Thanks to Shutterstock.com.  Even movies use Shutterstock's amazing footage.  I want you to try Shutterstock.  If you go there right now, you can create an account without a credit card.  That, that'll give you access not only to all the images, but the free images and videos they give away each week.  Plus the ability to put stuff in a lightbox so you can share it with others or just keep it around for inspiration.  The lightbox galleries are great.  They have multilingual customer service.  They're in a dozen countries, full time support throughout the week and the best images.  You might even want an image subscription.  That's what I, I have 25 images a day because we use it throughout all of Twitter.  Just start an account, no credit card needed.  But if you decide to buy, we're going to get you 20% off an image subscription package when you use our offer code.  This is for the November 2014 timeframe.  Twit 1114 is the offer code.

That just, yeah, that's about to come out.  Yeah, that's coming too.  And, you know, it's, it's a really big change for Microsoft because people have waited so long for these apps and they were released earlier this year.  But you needed the Office 365 subscription to really do anything with them.  And I think this is Microsoft waking up to the fact that they kind of have to be more open.  You kind of have to just let consumers come in there and test your products out.  And what you're really selling is not just, you know, individual licenses anymore or just these specific programs.  You're selling the platform.  You really want people to start subscribing at some point.  So you kind of open the door a little, let them use it a bit.  And it makes sense that eventually as people get used to it, they may start subscribing.

Yeah, of course, I think the vendors, right, they want to get people to subscribe to Office 365.  But more importantly, they want people to live in the Microsoft ecosystem.  And they figure we'll make money in the cloud.  We'll make money some way.  You know, they just started offering unlimited free storage in OneDrive if you have an Office 365 subscription.

It's GT technology.  Yeah, you're right.  The Sapphire company.  We we actually talked about this a couple of tweets ago with Philip Elmer Dewitt, who was in the courtroom.  And he said, you know, I suspect Apple's been trying to seal these documents.  And I suspect the judge really sounded like he was not inclined to.  And in fact, on Friday, all of the documents associated with the GT advanced technology,  Chapter 11 bankruptcy were released, including what many wanted to see, which is the so-called squiller memorandum squiller.  I think was the CFO.  No, C.O.O. of GT technology.  We had already learned a few things, like, for instance, Apple find its partners fifty million dollars for each leak that could be traced back to them.  That was in the contract.  But the squiller memorandum is actually I don't know.  You tell me is this is this an indictment of Apple?  It was an entire Apple confidentiality agreement as well as a quote master development and supply agreement and quote squiller says Apple didn't really enter into negotiations merely saying that.  So, OK, let me explain a little bit about what they were interested in.  GT advanced technologies made sapphire furnaces.  They didn't make sapphire.  They made the furnaces.  But Apple decided that they were going to have GT build these furnaces and build a factory in Mesa, Arizona to make huge quantities of sapphire for an unnamed product.  During the negotiations, which really weren't negotiations, GT managers were told, don't waste your time negotiating.  We don't negotiate.  After the company balked, Apple said, quote, put on your big boy pants and accept the agreement.  End quote.  Some of the terms we mentioned, the fifty million dollar penalty for breach of confidentiality.

They'd never really made sapphire.  They'd only sold the furnaces.  No man.  Here's an interesting one.  No manufacturing processes could be modified by GT without Apple's prior consent.  But GT must immediately implement any suggestions from Apple.

Transcript:  It was a whole, it's a very bizarre situation because you did essentially have Apple dictating to a very important supplier.  Right.  That you're going to start doing something completely different.  Instead of making machine tools, you're going to make cars or something like that.  Instead of making the things that create the sapphire that we need, we insist that you make the sapphire.  They then loaned them almost five hundred million dollars to create these furnaces.  And according to the squiller memo, if you believe it, they then micromanage them in such a degree that they failed.  Right.  And just why in the world would you want to micromanage your suppliers that much?  But when it's a question of...  Well remember, their suppliers are usually Asian.

Start time: 2012.99

Apple decided to forego backup power generators because they were too expensive.  Apparently, that was a problem.  GT was also required to fulfill any order placed by Apple on the date selected by Apple.  You will give us this...

Start time: 2177.36
End time: 2225.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  There's a deeper story going on here, right, about what went down with these companies.  Why Apple chose not to jump into Sapphire as quickly as maybe some of us thought it would.  It's kind of funny too because I don't know.  I know the new iPhones, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, have slightly better screens, probably a new, better Gorilla Glass.  But I'm really wondering what would, I'm not sure what Apple would really gain by making the jump to Sapphire because it's such a, it's a much more expensive material.  And there's still a lot of speculation about how it's strong.  It's stronger against scratch resistance.  But Sapphire is worse when it comes to impacts, like dropping it.  Right.  I think a lot of people end up doing to their phones.  So they need to strike that balance and I'm wondering if they just got cold feet or something.

Start time: 2225.90
End time: 2239.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I think it's a material science issue.  It's very hard to do something that both won't scratch and will survive impact.  It could be a production problem too.  Glass, for instance, hardened glass is great against scratches but not so good against impact.  It may not be.  Plastic is great for impact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yeah.  What do you think?  I mean, Jason's played with this.  They've changed some things right away.  This is, this is by the way, a trend in the industry to digital native.  So remember the, well, I have one right here.  This is an older Android device that on the buttons for the back button has a curved arrow  for the home button has a little house.  The recent apps has a stack of apps.  We've now gone to a triangle.  It's still points of direction.  So that's pretty straightforward.  The circle is now home and a square for recent apps.  Why?  What was wrong with the old icons?  Because it's too almost, it's still skeuomorphic.  It's still like, home is a house.  Why should home be a house?

Start time: 2352.78

End time: 2386.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, it's a good, well.  It feels like a step backwards, right?  It's like control alt delete.  Whenever I used to work in IT, when I told people that, what do those buttons mean?  What do they really mean?  Why are you pressing them together?  Square, circle, why?  Why?  I don't know.

Start time: 2386.89
End time: 2398.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  No, you're right.  Now that's a good point.  This is flat.  I think part of it is a design, as a design choice.  But you know, really the other reason that companies do this is because now it's new  and you might want to buy a new one.  Right.

Transcript:  But a big part of Lollipop is just redesigning the UI entirely.  To make it look more modern.  To make it look more modern and to step up the design language.  So I think if they were to come out with Lollipop and it had the same navigation,  yeah, people probably wouldn't care.  But the fact that it's changed makes it feel even more different.  Is it good or bad?  It's bad.

End time: 2589.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I need to spend more time with it, of course.  But I think the one thing that I'm realizing is, you know,  it's the first 64-bit official version of Android,  and it's the first 64-bit tablet running the first 64-bit version of Android.  And there's still a lot of app incompatibility that I've bumped into.  And also, you kind of expect, okay, so if it's totally juiced up,  everything should be super smooth and fluid, and things more or less are,  but you still get some jitteriness here and there.  And I would just hope that, like, when does that go away for good?  Never.  You wanted to, though.  Look, John, you've been doing this a long time.

When you do a DIR, you scroll down to a certain speed.  It was 90.  That speed was a standard.  Once the processors sped up, they slowed down the software,  so it would still have that same...  It never changes.  Everything is like this kind of this strange standard of kind of borderline sluggishness,  and as it gets improved, somebody finds some way to make it...  Well, that's the thing, is as soon as you get more capabilities,

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And I think that that's kind of been a criticism of...  Well, two things have been a criticism with Android  for as long as I've been following it.  One is that the UI and the user experience isn't up to snuff,  isn't mature, isn't enjoyable to use.  True fans are cool with it, but you pop an Android device in front of someone  and then an iOS device, and people are going to find the iOS device prettier.  Things are a little bit more polished.  That, and then there's also the speed factor.  Scrolling through web pages, using the UI, jumping from here to there.  Android's capable of so much, but yet you still run into those speed bumps.  And that's totally noticeable.  And you just kind of hope at some point to figure that out.  And it seems to keep happening.

Well, feel it, it's a little bit heavier.  Oh, just a slight... Are you kidding me?  Well, it's not hugely heavy, but it's thicker, it's a little thicker.  It's chunky.  It's chunkier, and it has...  But the point of it, when we're all very excited about this,  is it has, what is it, a 2990 milliamp hour battery, something like that.  I'm sorry, 3900 milliamp hour battery.  Huge battery.  So this should go...  Like 48 hours or something like that.  Yes, it should go weeks.  But as soon as they put the bigger battery in, they said,  well, now that there's a bigger battery...

It's like...  Could you just put an... Even if they put a 1080p screen in here, which would, by the way,  I can't tell the difference between 350, 400 dots per inch and 523 dots per inch, which this is, it's crazy.  Not at that size.  It can't... I don't need a 500 dpi screen, but they bet that kills the battery  because you have to have these big GPUs and you have to push all the pixels.  And so it's okay, it's a good battery, but it could have been so good.  And no, they said, well, you know, we got a big battery in it.  Trade-offs, trade-offs, trade-offs.

When Scully was ousted, the company was at $8 billion. He had taken the company 10X and people blame him. Oh, Scully came over and the company went way up. It was the guys after Scully.  It was Harris Spindler and the fine Gil Amelio.  Right, those guys. If Scully had stayed there, who knows, it might have made the company go in a different direction, obviously.  But there was nonsense about blaming him. And Scully spends a lot of time trying to correct the record.  Yeah.  And it's a shame.  Well, it does feel bad though about the Steve thing.

The Note Edge is this awkward thing where there's just too much screen and there's no really easy or nice way to hold it.  Because it's got this whole thing on the edge.  Yeah, it's like they just slapped another bit of screen on top of the Note 4 or something.  It'll be interesting to see how people respond to that.

I was able to get one, but it was like gone immediately.  It's bizarre.  I'm going to read an article, an interview with Richard Waters in the Financial Times.  Larry is an ambitious fellow, 41 years old, of course, co-founder of Google.  He's currently the CEO.  And he says that Google's famous mission, which was to organize the world's information  and make it universally accessible and useful, and they've gone a long way towards that with the search engine,  is not big enough for what he now has in mind.  Those are words that should send a chill down the spine, if any.

He says Google needs a new mission statement.  I tell you, I worry a little bit about somebody like Larry.  I think his motives were good.  I've met him. I think he's a nice guy, very smart guy.  And remember, Google's motto was, you know, don't be evil.  But you've got to worry.  That fell by the wayside.  No, they're still semi-not evil.  But you've got to worry about a guy now who has a lot of ambition, a lot of money, and really nobody's saying no.  Remember, he gave that little weird talk at Google I.O. in which he said,  we wish there were a Google island with no regulation.

Well, for instance, he said, given the chance to, this is him, given the chance to give up work,  nine out of 10 people wouldn't want to be doing what they're doing today.  That's not probably true.  So the interviewer says, well, what about people who might regret losing their jobs?  Once jobs have been rendered obsolete by technology, there's no point wasting time hankering after them, says Page.  Well, he's got a point.  The idea that everyone so slavishly works so they do something inefficiently so they keep their job,  that doesn't make any sense.  That can't be the right answer.  So he says the answer.  What's the question?  Well, the question is, people are losing their jobs.  That's not a question.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  I mean, so he says, here's the solution.  A massive deflation.  Stuff is going to be, thanks to technology, so cheap that even if you're out of work, you'll be able to afford it.

But at the end of the day, the scarcity value of that real estate, which will actually be impacted, I think, by self-driving cars, I think that'll...  Not necessarily.

Working at the DMV, let's say.  Although they seem to be enjoying themselves.  But taking away their job is not going to make them happier.  Oh, you hate your job, no problem.  You're out of work.

So I apparently was channeling that.  They are working on cowless meat.  The burger's creator was pleased with the result.  Look at that.  So you really want to hear the rest of this?  Okay, so the raw ingredients are five millimeter thick strips  of pinkish-yellow lab-grown tissue stem cells, in fact.  They're cultivated in a nutrient broth.  Once they've grown 30 times their original size,  they're then combined with an elastic collagen in a culture dish  where the cells form into chunks of muscle.  It's probably good for your fingernails.  We're not done.  Electrical stimulation is used to make the muscle strips contract  and pump up before the thousands of beef strips are minced up  together with 200 pieces of lab-grown animal fat and molded into patties.

You give the package to a person who then does some magic and it gets to the place where it's going.  That's the cloud, by the way, is what happens inside the post office.  That's the cloud.

You don't need to do the go to the post office part.  The post office part, the affixing the stamp to the letter part, you still got all the benefit of the Postal Service, the delivery across the country, anywhere across the world.  But you print the stamps.  Now, this sounds odd.  This sounds dangerous.  This sounds scary.  With your computer and your printer, you log on to a website, you buy the stamps, you print them, or better yet, forget stamps.  Print them right on the envelope with your company logo, the return address, the recipient's address.  You got a package?  No problem.  You get a USB scale, you plop it on there, and it automatically gets you exactly the right postage.  It even will recommend what kind of mail you should use.  Is this, oh, maybe this is, you could save money, use media mail or first class mail or third class, whatever.  It'll even fill out the forms for you.  The computer is so smart.  It says, oh, this is international.  Let me fill out those customs forms for you.  You want certified mail?  I can do that.  I'll even send an email to the recipient automatically.  Return receipt.  With one push of the button, you can get automatic address verification, postage discounts you can't get at the post office, even discounted package insurance.  Boom, boom, like that.  This is the modern way to mail stuff.  Now, this is not for somebody that once a year sends out Christmas cards.  This is for somebody who mail is a business, whether you sell on Amazon or eBay or Etsy a lot.  Boy, you really ought to be using stamps.com.  If you're a business that sends out bills or mailers or brochures, you got to be using stamps.  We use stamps.com.  Stamps.com.  I want you to try it, and it's easy to do.  If you visit stamps.com, click the microphone in the upper right-hand corner.  You got to go to the home page.  There you go.  And enter our offer code, TWIT, and you're going to get this amazing deal.  You get the scale.  Just pay shipping handling.  It's five bucks.  You get a $5 activity kit that kind of makes up for it.  You get a month stamps.com.  You even get $55 in postage coupons you can use on stamps.com for the first few months.  I think this is a great deal.  Stamps.com.  Click the microphone.  You don't have to take my word for it, but you will love it if you do a lot of mailing.  Stamps.com.  Eliminate those trips to the post office.  Let them do what they do best.

Transcript:  It actually does tell you like bad jokes, like knock knock jokes.  Knock knock jokes.  Knock knock jokes.  I am excited about this.  We've talked before about Twitter and the problem, especially women have with abuse on Twitter.  It just really is out of control.  And Twitter has teamed up with a nonprofit group called Women Action in the Media, WAM,  and they have created a forum on WAM for people to report abuse and harassment.  But Twitter, I think we had lambasted them a little bit for paying a little bit less attention to this all than they ought to.  But apparently they have worked with WAM to create this tool.  And it specifically says, do you fear for your personal safety?  Have you reported this to Twitter already?  Are you being harassed by a single person or multiple people?  Are you being doxxed?  What kind of harassment?  Hate speech, revenge porn, that kind of thing.  And then it works directly with Twitter to resolve the issue.  Now, it remains to be seen what Twitter's commitment to respond to this is.  But WAM did this last year with Facebook and I think it was pretty effective.  And apparently WAM has approached Twitter and they have been receptive.  So I'm hopeful that this...  Now, admittedly, men get harassed on Twitter as well.  I don't think it's the same problem, though.  I think it's really an issue with women being harassed on Twitter.  You know, you don't have to be on Twitter.

Start time: 5633.80
End time: 5652.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, for sure.  I mean, Twitter has enjoyed so much success, right?  Because it is this instant platform to communicate with all sorts of people.  And it's...  I don't know, it's shocking that it's taken until now for them to actually do something about all the harassment.  This isn't the first time...  We've been hearing about this forever.

Saying really, really horrifying things that people might say on Twitter has got a huge social cost if you've got your actual account.

And I do support free speech, but I don't know.  I feel like there seems to be a...  There's got to be a better way.  Some middle ground between absolute free speech and this.  The FTC has slapped the wrist of a patent troll.  J. Mack Rust.  There he is in his cowboy gear.  Good looking fella.  He's the guy who sent out 9,000 patent demand letters to companies that have scanners that scan to email.

Yeah, he just grab his hand.  Because it's just like a DNA sample or even a physical key that you have in your pocket.  You can be legally compelled to give that to police.  You cannot give up a passcode because that's considered knowledge and protected by the Fifth Amendment, the right against self-incrimination.  So we suspected this.  The reason it's germane is if you have an iPhone and you use Touch ID to lock it, you could be compelled to unlock it.  So the advice is to arrest him.  If arrested.  Well, even if stopped.

Enjoy, buddy.  Bored cops.  Yeah.  But this raises the issue, of course, of, you know, look, there's a certain amount of  bad apples in any business and that raises the issue of the protect, you have protections  against police officers.

You should know, or if you have a Galaxy Note or a Galaxy S5 or an HTC One Max, these all  have fingerprint readers.  You should know if you're locking the phone with a fingerprint that in fact they have  the right to, if you've been arrested, to compel you to unlock it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  The Supreme Court has never ruled on this issue specifically, but there was a case in  1966 where a defendant was compelled to give up a blood sample.  And the court ruled that, quote, the Fifth Amendment offers no protection against compulsion  to submit to fingerprinting.  This is kind of the same, right?  So you're not protected, just so you know.  Now, one thing to know is that if you turn off your iPhone, when you turn it back on,  it will say you have to enter the passcode and you're protected, even if Touch ID is  enabled.  That's just a thing Apple built in.  So you have to enter the password.  Similarly, if you haven't used Touch ID in 48 hours.  So I can't remember who this was.  The counsel of somebody was, OK, you get your attorney to slow the process down as much  as he can, and two days from now, they still need the Touch ID won't work.  You used to be an attorney, right?  No, never.  No.  Come on.  Don't deny it.  When did you stop?  Business school.

Transcript:  No.  Breach fatigue has set in with consumers.  But first, I hope you're not fatigued with our advertisers because they're fabulous people  and they deserve every bit of your attention.  Like, for instance, ZipRecruiter, who really did us a very nice service, ziprecruiter.com.  The problem is when you are hiring somebody to fill a job, there are lots of places you  can go on the internet to post a job, but which one is the best?  And do you want to go to all of them?  Well, with ZipRecruiter, you don't have to worry.  You go to ziprecruiter.com.  You post to 50 plus job boards with a single submission, including, by the way, Twitter  and LinkedIn and Craigslist and Facebook.  So you get all the social recruiting.  One post to 50 plus job boards.  And then the great thing is they don't call you.  They don't email you.  Their applications are sent back into the ZipRecruiter system where you can easily scan  them, screen them, very simply find the right people and hire them right away.  It really is the fastest, easiest way we use it.  And it's great.  I want you to try it.  Right now we've got four days free.  And the way this works, that may be enough for you to find that right person.  Absolutely no cost.  ZipRecruiter.com.  You can create customized email responses, a job page you put right on your branded job  page you put right on your website that uses ZipRecruiter to screen them.  It's just fabulous.  ZipRecruiter.com.  If you go there right now, it's ziprecruiter.com slash twit.  You get four days free.  Look at all the businesses that have used ZipRecruiter.  And we should have the twit logo on there.  ZipRecruiter.com slash twit.  We thank them for their support.  Where did John go?  He wanders off, you know.  He's getting more licorice, I think.

Transcript:  They just announced that, oh, and by the way, we also got like 50 million email addresses  leaked out.  Sorry about that.  I mean, it's not as bad as your credit card, but it's still...  It's not good.  So, we're getting...  We're seeing all of these breaches at Target and Home Depot.  So the RSA did a study conducted by the Ponemon Institute.  A thousand consumer respondents.  Half of them have been the victim of a breach.  I think that's a low number.  I would bet everybody here has in some way been...  I mean, haven't you all had a credit card misused or gotten a new one from your bank  saying, well, we don't know, but maybe you should try a new number?  That happened to me.  Everybody.  I would say that's got to be closer to 100%.  Anyway, 14% of these people reported they care enough about privacy that a data breach  at an institution they do business with would affect their future business, banking or shopping  behavior.  In other words, they're saying, eh, no big deal.  Only 14% said they wouldn't go back there.  While the majority say they do care about privacy, 23% says privacy has absolutely no  influence over our behaviors or perceptions of a company.  You know what?  I like Home Depot.  I'm going to keep buying my lumber there.  The 49% reported they're still shopping online, but they are using credit cards instead of  debit cards.  I don't know if that's really much of a big deal.  It's a myth.

It's so good, because the pharmacies we have everywhere, Dwayne Reid, it's the easiest thing to just like wave your phone, hold down your finger, and keep moving.  And the thing about Google Wallet, though, is actually using it is not as fast as Apple Pay.  Even though more people are using it, the actual experience isn't that great.

You just kind of put your finger on it, kind of lazy-like, and it goes, okay.  On every other thing, it's like with the Lenovo...  Remember the old Lenovo's that had fingerprint?

Transcript:  That I don't feel fairly compensates the writers,  producers, artists and creators of music.  She's got that right.  And this is what I actually...  I kind of agree with her on this.  I just don't agree with perpetuating the perception  that music has no value and should be free.  Now, of course, you pay for a Spotify account.  You do.  It's $10 a month.  What was Rhapsody when it first started?  $10 a month.  You set the price.  That was it.  Yeah, we set the price.

Start time: 7255.30
End time: 7298.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you do research before 15 or five?  No, we basically got the deals.  We were the first people to get deals with all five.  There were then five major record labels.  And we set the price that we could set it for,  given the prices that we had from them.  So Indiana 10 is a nice round number.  I think everybody felt fine about that.  But the calculus that we went through way back then,  and we knew it was going to be decades  before overwhelming numbers of people  used a streaming service like ours for music,  but the estimate was about 200 million Americans  buy some music some of the time.  Right.  And our feeling was...  Say that number again.  About 200 million.  200 million.  Of the 300 million.  That's a lot.  So we were able to get a service every once a year.

Start time: 7299.36

Start time: 7301.36

Transcript:  By some music was the statistic we were working with.  And this was in the 80s.  We started the service in 2002.  Oh, I'm sorry.  This is post-Napster, right?  80s, 2002.  That was close.  Yeah, yeah.  No.  And so this was Rapsody.  This is basically the VisiCalc of Spotify.  Right, right.  We kind of pioneered this model.  And so the thinking was,  if you got those people to pay $10 a month  for a much better thing,  you've actually doubled the size of the music industry  because that would be $24 billion a year.  And at the time,  American music sales were about $10, $11 billion.  You can talk now.

Start time: 7334.80
End time: 7336.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  How much of that does a record label get?

Start time: 7336.56
End time: 7387.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, a significant majority of it goes to the labels.  And the artists have, in many cases,  complained very vociferously and articulated.  They're not seeing any of it.  Yeah, but labels have been ripping off artists for years.  And that's the issue.  And I think that there's been a lot of people  blaming the streaming services,  saying Spotify's evil  because people...  I get no money.  I get no money.  And there are outlandish stories.  They say it was played this many millions of times  and I got a dollar.  That's actually on the labels.  Because an enormous amount of money.  I don't know exactly what Spotify's deals are,  but they haven't changed that much, really,  since the earliest days of Rapsody.  And about three years ago,  the deals were virtually unchanged.  And the overwhelming majority of the money  that we took in went to the labels.  And if it's not being shared equitably with the artists,  then yeah, it's going MIA.  Lady Gaga said a couple of years ago,

Start time: 7388.48
End time: 7393.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I got a million plays of my latest song.  I earned $167 on Spotify.  Yeah.

Start time: 7395.44
End time: 7399.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 7399.75
End time: 7406.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  The money...  And that's what Pandora, by the way,  Tim Westergren's always said at Pandora,  we pay a huge amount of money to the record label.

Start time: 7406.48
End time: 7440.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They pay even more than the radio stations, too,  in terms of what they're...  What was the quote?  How many plays did she get?  She says a million plays, $167.  Well, probably something in the neighborhood.  A penny a play is a common number for deals.  And this was a while ago, too, a couple years ago.  It was two years ago, yeah.  So probably...  Poker face.  Probably 10 grand went back to her label.  And somehow they did math that said,  we keep 99%.  You get 1%.  Gaga, you get 1%.  Literally.  So there's leakage in there,  but my feeling is it's on the label side.

Start time: 7441.56
End time: 7459.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  And the labels have been ripping us to artists for years.  So this is not anything new.  I guess the real question is...  And we know that users, you were right, love this.  They didn't love Rhapsody maybe right out of the box.  Some of them did.  I mean, the people, early on, early adopters,

Start time: 7460.56
End time: 7484.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  who got the idea, like, all of a sudden, wow,  instead of having this sliver of 1% of all the music  in the world on my wall,  that I have to buy a la carte, $15 an album,  I can have all of it for $10 a month.  You know, yeah, early adopters got it and loved it.  To this day, I hear from folks that were early users  of Rhapsody, and Rhapsody still has a million subs.  So it's something out there.  It's bigger than Beats.  Hopefully it'll remain that.

Start time: 7484.60
End time: 7506.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  It's bigger than Beats, but RDO, Spotify...  There's a bunch of things out there.  Google's got this business, and I like Google Music.  All Access, they call it, and it's the same...  It's all roughly the same 20 million songs.  Similar idea.  Except not Taylor Swift on Spotify.  But I think you're right, it's more publicity.  Well, for her.  For her.  On the other hand, I don't disagree with her position  that I ought to get paid for my music.  She's not going to make any money anyway.

Start time: 7507.78
End time: 7517.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I don't disagree with that in any way, shape or form.  People should.  And particularly if people are throwing down  $10 a month, month after month, year after year.  We're paying money, so somebody's getting that.

Start time: 7517.64
End time: 7531.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I guess this is the interesting takeaway for me.  The labels, the artists, presumably,  and you felt that $10 a month was going to be  a bigger pot of money for everybody involved  than the people who were buying it.  Yeah, if you straight-lined it out

Start time: 7531.70
End time: 7564.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and you said, look, we've been through as an industry  seven or eight platform transitions.  There were spinning cylinders  and then 78s and 45s and eight track and cassette.  Eventually, if this is the end point format  that we're going to,  and the price is $10 a month  and it delivers unbelievable value,  it was relatively simple math to say  the pie show is going to be $10 a month.  It was relatively simple math to say the pie should grow.  Right.  It grew with CDs, it should grow again.  But it's a long transition.  All of these services collectively  only have a few million subscribers in the United States.  Is there a better solution?

Transcript:  Trent Reznor did an interview with Billboard.  He said, I'm working with Apple.  Who knew this? The creative guy at Vine Beats.  Well, he was the chief creative officer.  Smart because he never took the limelight.  So everybody thinks of Dre and I.  But he apparently is working with Apple.  I can't talk about what it is,  but I got the strong impression  it's about streaming and making it more equitable for artists.  There's room to do that.

Start time: 7588.10
End time: 7613.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  His quote was,  there is a model that can work.  There's a pony in there someplace.  And he felt that,  and the fact is, yes,  if a mass market of people  are paying $10 a month  for music or $8.99 or whatever it is,  and that is shared equitably,  that industry should be larger  than the CD industry was at its pinnacle in 1999  when everybody was swimming in money.  And we know we have to solve that

Start time: 7614.06
End time: 7629.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  because according to the RIA,  music sales are off 14%  for the first half of the year.  First time downloads are down.  iTunes says the same thing, 13%.  That's not good.  People aren't buying music.  They are listening to Spotify.

Start time: 7629.88
End time: 7675.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, if they transition over to the streaming services,  then those dollars will be captured.  So the question is,  how do you make sure that people  don't collapse faster  than people start actually saying,  now, one of the problems  or one of the issues is,  Spotify, to use a very obvious example,  has such abundant access  to crazy capital  and crazy valuations,  they're currently under no obligation  to actually make money.  So they have free services  and the ad-supported services,  which don't make microeconomic sense.  And so we have services  that are out there  that are a hell of a lot cheaper than $10.  And as you start discounting things  way, way down,  you get them into the realm of free,

Start time: 7675.88
End time: 7681.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  then obviously that model,  the bigger pie no longer exists.  It does feel like we're moving towards $5 a month.

Start time: 7682.10
End time: 7707.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that doable?  Well, you know,  at that point it becomes a question  of price elasticity, right?  Because we're no longer anywhere near  To get back to half that number  would be probably a damn good thing  in the minds of a lot of people.  So yeah, it's a question of like,  if you cut it to five and sales more than double,  then you should probably cut it to five.  And they should be experimenting with price

Start time: 7708.20

So a little germane to the topic we're talking about.  And in that book,  there is this diabolical  social media,  social network called Flutter,  P-H-L-U-T-T-R.  And it's kind of like a running joke,  but basically Flutter is this startup  that basically infiltrates your phone,  infers everything about you,  and then blabs it to the world.  And so this new book,  it's going to be called Emergent,  and it will be the story of Flutter.  I like it.  So this imaginary diabolical startup called Flutter.
