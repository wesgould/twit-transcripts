Transcript:  It's time for twit this week in tech.  There's not a lot of tech news, but fortunately, we've got great people joining us.  Father Robert Balisare from the Vatican City, Dwight Silverman from the Houston Chronicle,  and from theregister.com, my friend Ian Thompson.  We're going to talk about CES.  It's coming, but what's it going to be like?  The streaming wars.  Forget that.  It was an amazing 2020 for all the streaming sites and a farewell to Farmville.  It's all coming up next on twit.

This is a show we get together and talk about the week's tech news of which there is virtually  none.  But fortunately, dear friends join the panel today.  And I know that we'll all have lots to say, starting with our digital Jesuit father, Robert  Balisare, who is back in Rome, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am.  I am.  I am back here a couple of days before the new year and I have, I think, three days left  in my quarantine before I can come out of my little room.  Oh, geez.

Start time: 152.68
End time: 155.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 157.04
End time: 162.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ten days.  So we do ten days with a test tomorrow.  Wow.  Yeah.  The third day from the last.

Transcript:  It's right to be prudent because I know the Holy Father does not like to wear a mask.

Start time: 167.30
End time: 183.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, we've been counseling.  Just for the optics, you really should be wearing a mask.  But the vaccines have arrived and they're starting to get the first year.  So hopefully within, say, a month, the entire Vatican will be vaccinated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At least all of those over the age of 80, which is like 99 percent.  That's all of us.  Anyway, I missed you.  It's great to see you again, Father Robert Balisare.  Also joining us, another old friend.  This is really old friend week on Twitter.  Dwight Silverman, who is the tech burger at the Houston Chronicle.  Although do you want to share your news or should we wait for a couple of weeks and talk  about it later?

Start time: 212.32
End time: 233.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know we can talk about it now.  I've been pretty open about it on social media.  I have wound up after saying I was going to retire, there's a buyout at the Chronicle  and I'm very close to turning 65 and I thought, well, this is an opportunity.  So I decided to take the buyout and I was going to go off on my own.

Start time: 233.58
End time: 235.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The last time we talked, you said you were going to do that.

Start time: 236.20
End time: 281.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I was going to go off and do a a substack newsletter as every other journalist in the  world is doing.  And I was going to do a medium blog and kind of work the two between each other.  And then I got contacted by the senior VP of content at Forbes, who asked me to join  them as what amounts to an online tech columnist with a newsletter.  And we're still kind of working out how whether it'll be mostly newsletter or it'll be mostly  stories, you know, what the mix is going to be and kind of what I'll be writing about.  But I will be a staff member and a full Forbes staffer and we'll go back to having a full  time job with a boss.

Start time: 282.02
End time: 289.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you get to keep the money that the Chronicle gave you?  Yeah.  You keep the buyout.  That's the ball world's possible.  That's wonderful.

Start time: 289.76
End time: 301.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's a good, you know, because I'm close to retire.  I am close to retirement.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you just sock that away and it's, you know, it becomes a good cushion.  You know, if I love Forbes, I'll be there as long as I love it.

Start time: 302.16
End time: 323.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nice writing you can do.  If I decide I want to actually retire, I can do it.  Well, it's great to have you back.  And then ladies and gentlemen, he's Terry Thomas with a faux hawk, our very own Ian Thompson.  Isn't that nice?  Well, I had to explain it somehow.  Ian Thompson, the news editor at TheRegister.com.  Hello, Ian.

Start time: 324.01
End time: 325.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hello, Dev, and happy new year to you all.

Start time: 326.16
End time: 370.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Happy New Year.  Happy New Year to all of you.  Yeah, this is it's 2021.  Now there's some question about how you should spell that.  Some say 2020 WON.  Get it?  I prefer to think I'm going to be thinking on the positive side.  This is the year we come out of it.  We get it.  We're going to come back.  Everything's going to come back.  One thing that's not going to come back, though.  CES.  It's too late for CES.  CES is next week and it's all virtual.  Right.  How many of you have quote, signed up for CES?  Father Robert.  Yeah.  Dwight has.  Ian, are you going to CES?

Start time: 370.76
End time: 391.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nope.  No, I mean, part of the deal when I joined The Register was I didn't have to do CES anymore  because it's just a heaving mess of a show.  And yeah, okay.  Doing it virtually will cover the news announcements.  Don't get me wrong.  But we're not going to sit through endless presentations about this is our new Samsung  TV.  It's really cool.  It does this and this and this.

Start time: 391.98
End time: 406.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm totally confused about.  I mean, I guess what it really is, is just a placeholder for next year when they can  do it in person.  Is that right, Robert?  Right.  You don't need to have an event if it's all streamed.

Start time: 407.68
End time: 432.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't, but they need to preserve the calendar.  You're seeing this with a lot of the big events.  They need to do something so that people get they stay in the rhythm of the conference  season.  I mean, everyone knows that we know we have CES in January, then you have NEB somewhere  in April.  You got your security conferences like Black Hat and DEF CON in August.  If you don't keep doing that, when you come back, you're not going to get the crowds  you want.

Start time: 433.08
End time: 444.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, you don't.  The good news is you don't have to leave your quarantine in the Vatican City so you can  watch it all.  Dwight, is this is this a good replacement for an in-person CES?

Start time: 445.96
End time: 508.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if it's a replacement.  It's something different.  One of the one of the only reasons I really signed up for it, I haven't been to CES in  years, but one of the reasons I signed up for it is that the experience that you have  when you're covering the Apple events with their virtual unveiling is so much to me,  I find it more useful than going and sitting in that hall, even if I don't get the opportunity  to lay hands on the devices for 30 minutes.  You know, I think it's a I think it's it's a much more in terms of getting information.  It's much more useful than I guess.  I mean, put up with the logistics of it.  And so I'm curious.  I'm really signing up more just out of curiosity to see what this is like.  I'm looking for any Houston companies who who may be present and I'm, you know, kind  of looking for any interesting trends.  And I think the problem is, is that I've only got two weeks left at the Chronicle, so I  don't have that many columns left to or things to write about.

Start time: 508.70
End time: 521.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's even better.  The best way to attend CES is without assignment so you can just enjoy it.  I always enjoyed CES a lot more when I didn't have to write about it or record anything.  Right. Absolutely.

Start time: 522.08
End time: 573.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. My favorite CESs have always been the one where I'm just wandering the hallways  because then I find something that catches my eye.  That's what I'm going to cover.  But I think they're doing it the wrong way because probably the best conference replacement  that I've experienced during the pandemic was DEF CON.  DEF CON in August, what they did was they didn't try to push it as an educational conference.  It wasn't DEF CON online.  It was we know that this is the place where many of you make your connections with other  people. We're going to emphasize that.  So it was all about community.  I treat CES the same way.  I see some of those people just at CES.  If you play that up, it gives people a reason to come in.  I am registered for all the CES events, but I'm probably going to attend maybe half of  them just because I have no interest in doing another Zoom call or just to see more stuff.

Start time: 573.68
End time: 599.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's to me, it sounds like torture that you just, you know, lead but sit in the seat  and watch this presentation after presentation with buzzword after buzzword.  I guess, you know, it's like just having to watch a really bad season of television or something.  And the other problem is, and this baffles me, for some reason, many of the keynotes  are at 430 in the morning California time.  Like, huh?

Start time: 599.82
End time: 601.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you know why?  It's bizarre.

Start time: 601.36
End time: 608.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why?  For you, because of Italy.  Because of Italy, you love it.  It's going to be great for you.  So, all right.

Start time: 609.32
End time: 636.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.  I mean, you're right.  Defcon did it right.  The whole Discord server thing worked really, really well.  But still companies are getting it wrong.  I mean, RSA announced they were going to do a physical expo and then withdrew that very,  very quickly.  I don't think Defcon's going to go ahead this year either, to be honest.  But, you know, we'll see how CES turns out.  And from a press point of view, if they are doing online press conferences, that saves  us the two hour wait to get into a press conference, only to be told at the door, yeah, we're full.

Start time: 637.88
End time: 651.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, I mean, it makes a lot of sense for presentations.  How could you duplicate the booth experience, though?  Are there going to be, like, do you schedule one-on-one calls with people over Zoom?  Is that how they're going to do that?

Start time: 652.84
End time: 656.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Google's not even trying.  Google has not tried all year.

Start time: 657.06
End time: 669.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got to, by the way, maybe we'll save this for later.  But Google really seems to have just given up on 2020.  It's like, phew.  And now this, what are they doing for CES?  Nothing.  Nothing.

Start time: 670.72
End time: 696.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nothing.  They'll be showing a little bit, but they're not really doing that much.  And look, I can understand them giving up on 2020.  It's been an excrement filled pinata of a year and we've just had to get through it  and deal with it, you know, deal with what needs to be done.  But I honestly don't think conference season this year is going ahead either in its usual  format based on the very slow and odd way that vaccines are being sent out.  So next year, maybe.

Start time: 698.38
End time: 740.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe.  Maybe.  This came up on MacBreak Weekly because Apple seems to, despite the fact that they, just  like Google, were affected by COVID-19, stores were closed, employees were sent home, they  seemed to have come out with a large number of products, very successful products, even  announced an entirely new chip architecture for their Macintosh computers.  It seemed like they were working this year.  Google, even when they announced the Pixel 5 phone, it was such a home home event, they  were wearing slippers and like, it was like, it was the strangest experience.  I feel like, is it just me?  Dwight, have you noticed this, that Google seems to have lost their mojo in 2020?

Start time: 741.72
End time: 763.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they, you know, I don't think Google was ever really great at selling its  devices anyway.  Yeah.  You know, their marketing has been fairly, here's a phone, you'll like it.  And it's kind of been at that level of intensity already.  So I'm not kind of surprised at what they've been doing this year.

Start time: 763.88
End time: 775.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They just, Google I.O., they just said, yeah, never mind.  Right.  Right.  Google had several developer events.  Apple had more events than ever.  Google said, yeah.

Start time: 777.28
End time: 814.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That shows off the difference between the back to front and the front to back approach.  So Apple is a back to front approach.  They design it and then they release it.  That's always been their mojo.  We know what people want.  Even if they don't know what they want yet, we're going to show them.  Google is absolutely front to back.  They want to release a little bit, see if it generates excitement and then they build  on it.  Well, in something like a pandemic, the front to back dies because you're not getting that  immediate feedback.  You can't bring your equipment out in front of masses of people to say, OK, they like  this.  They don't like that.  That's not to say it's a bad approach.  It's just it's far more affected by something like a pandemic.

Start time: 815.59
End time: 835.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Except that 2020 was a boom year for technology companies, all of whom stocks went through  the roof.  Companies like Zoom were discovered.  I mean, there was opportunity in 2020.  It wasn't like, oh, we could just skip this year.  No big deal.  There's nothing to say about it.  It just baffles me.

Start time: 837.00
End time: 842.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where did that come from?  What did people buy?  People were buying laptops.  I mean, that was the number one seller.  Yeah.

Start time: 843.00
End time: 852.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, but Google services, Google Meet could have been Zoom.  I mean, there were a lot of opportunities for Google services and things.  I just don't feel like they paid that much attention.

Start time: 853.75
End time: 858.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I forget.  Are we still on Duo or have we moved on?  Have they killed Duo yet?  That's the other problem.

Start time: 859.16
End time: 864.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, you're on Meet now, which they introduced.  This is what I mean when they're terrible at marketing.

Start time: 864.72
End time: 866.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Meet is a terrible name.

Start time: 868.54
End time: 870.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's meet in Meet space.

Start time: 871.28
End time: 895.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there has been something I've really noticed this year in that all the major companies  who are dealing with online meetings drop the ball apart from Zoom and even Zoom had  its problems.  But you'd thought Microsoft and Skype, Google and its video conferencing, FaceTime could  have been expanded.  All these opportunities.  And it takes an outsider to come in and go, yeah, look, this is really easy.  You just click on this button and click on this button.  And it's something everyone's parents can understand.

Start time: 895.12
End time: 913.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This was the year of Zoom.  I mean, 2020 was.  It's amazing how this company almost feels fortuitous.  It didn't feel like this was a strategy that Zoom had up its sleeve.  I can't wait till there's a pandemic.  We're going to be ready there.  It just weirdly was in the right place at the right time.

Start time: 914.44
End time: 921.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can you think of any other company in history that has had this amount of market penetration  in such a short time?  It's incredible.

Start time: 922.48
End time: 924.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I don't think there's an example.  I don't.

Start time: 925.38
End time: 937.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it came with its problems because they tripped up on security originally, but then  they recognized what was wrong.  They hired the A team of security to basically go in there and fix it and touch wood.  It's looking pretty good at the moment.

Start time: 937.96
End time: 956.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nobody talks about Zoom security anymore.  Well, except for that one Zoom guy that they had to fire because he was working for China  and shut down some Zoom conferences because the government of China didn't like it.  Except for that, nobody's talking about Zoom security at all.  It's very strange.

Start time: 956.56
End time: 981.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And what was interesting about Zoom is that there are a bunch, not a bunch, but there  are several other companies that have essentially the same product where you send a link, you  click on it, it launches, you see multiple people.  And it's just as simple.  But when it happened, Zoom, maybe because of the name, was one of the, you know, was  the company that was able to most take advantage of that.

Start time: 981.36
End time: 989.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why wasn't it Microsoft Teams, for instance, just as well positioned?  Because Teams was terrible.  Teams was awful.  Okay, well, that's a good start.

Start time: 990.44
End time: 993.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's Slack.  It's not Zoom.  Right.

Start time: 993.48
End time: 1015.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a Slack clone.  It's a Slack clone.  Just trying to make Teams be the Zoom for 2021.  There's no question.  All right.  So back to CES.  Are we excited about LG demoing a bendable OLED gaming monitor?  You press a button, it's curved, you press another button, it's flat.  Are we excited about that?  No.  No.

Start time: 1016.42
End time: 1041.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've got to say, I'm really, really skeptical about any kind of flexible screen at the moment  after the complete nightmares we've had over the last 18 months.  I mean, yeah, okay, they're bending it slightly rather than flattening it rather than trying  to fold it over.  Sorry.  But, you know, it seems to be like a problem looking for a solution.  You know, it's just, I'm sorry, a solution looking for a problem.  It's just, it doesn't add that much.

Start time: 1041.64
End time: 1043.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are we excited about the see-through TV?

Start time: 1047.18
End time: 1051.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because what I want to do is see something else.  That's my thing.

Start time: 1052.16
End time: 1083.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a strange product.  I don't know what the market is.  We will see, as we saw in person, but this is the problem.  Here's a really good example of why a virtual conference makes no sense.  There will be micro LED TVs all over the place, but you'll be looking at them on Zoom.  So who cares?  Right?  That was the one thing I was impressed with this year or last year in CES.  Some beautiful TVs.  I'm selling its first micro LED this year, a giant, what is it, 180 inches for $159,000.

Start time: 1088.61
End time: 1089.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I'm sorry.

Start time: 1089.84
End time: 1092.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like TV as much for the next person, but for goodness sake.

Start time: 1092.92
End time: 1104.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, see, you'd like it more because if you see Ted Lasso on a 150-inch screen, then you're  like there.  You're right immersed in the...  No, it's not.  No.

Start time: 1106.46
End time: 1112.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do want the emergence of affordable large OLED screens.  That I actually am interested in.

Start time: 1114.13
End time: 1166.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the LG Rollable that we've seen for the last four years in a row is finally coming  out.  Only $100,000.  Is that in your budget?  No?  Oh yeah, me too.  LG's transparent OLED.  Let's see.  You're right.  I think OLED...  The real question though is will OLED be supplanted?  So we're going to see a lot of new LCD technologies like mini LED, which are just better backlights.  And those will be less expensive than OLED.  And then we're going to see micro LED is still too expensive, but it's maybe two or three  years before the prices start to drop.  I wonder if OLED may be the plasma of 2021.  This might be the last gasp.  Wow.  What do you think?  That's bold.

Start time: 1166.60
End time: 1179.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love OLED.  Although it's still in your phone.  The LED is kind of the standard in your phone right now.  But even then there's talk of Apple and Samsung moving to newer technologies in those screens.

Start time: 1180.00
End time: 1183.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're going to use the mini LED in their screens, Apple is apparently.

Start time: 1183.70
End time: 1210.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think companies like Samsung, who also have a retail presence, they have their own stores  in a lot of big markets.  I think they stand to benefit from CES because if they can get those products into the stores,  even just for demo purposes, people who hear about them via CES can go out and see them  immediately.  And I think that companies like that will have some benefit.

Start time: 1211.28
End time: 1232.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  LG, of course, in years past has had that giant video wall of OLEDs when you first enter  the central hall.  And that's a great thing.  I don't know.  It's not going to really be quite as good on a Zoom call.  Are they using Zoom, by the way?  What are they going to use for CES?  Have they said what their technology will be?

Start time: 1233.30
End time: 1247.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm still waiting for the links.  So it depends.  It's not just CES.  There's a couple of events that are happening the same week.  And actually, there's a couple of events happening this coming week.  But I won't know until I actually get the link to see the interface.

Start time: 1248.30
End time: 1280.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  LG will be showing, get ready for it, QNED TVs.  These are mini LED TVs.  So to be clear, LED TVs are actually LCDs with LED backlights.  And the mini LED, they're so small you can have lots of them, which gives you a better  local dimming, better dynamic range, and not a better name.  QNED.  QNED.

Start time: 1283.67
End time: 1291.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You wonder who came up with this.  Is it a marketing department?  Is it a technology department saying, no, we must have a stupid admin?

Start time: 1292.62
End time: 1298.91

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The strange thing is it's that gear, it's that equipment that I think would be best  for a virtual attended conference because you're right, the screens, they mean nothing.  You can show me the largest resolution screen you have and I can't tell.  Show me something that's just been invented by a guy in a basement.  I'm very interested in that.

Transcript:  There was a virtual showroom like that for the rollout of the most, I believe it was  the Note 10.  No, no, it was the Fold, the Galaxy Fold 2.  It reminded me of being, of using one of those interactive CD-ROMs back in the day where  you walk, it was like being in Myst.  You walk in, you click on something, it tells you the specs, you walk to another area, you  get a demo, you get somebody talking about it.  It was kind of cool but it did really seem like a CD-ROM experience but it gave you more  context, more of kind of a showroom and a show floor context than I've seen in other  places.

Transcript:  Exactly.  I'm sorry, I've yet to meet a single person who likes using Teams.  It's like people are raving about Zoom.  I mean, not that peeved off with Google, but it's just when Teams comes around, everyone's  just like, well, can I do this?  Can I not do that?  Is it watching me now?  Is it not watching me now?  And it's a very strange CES up.  I don't understand how Microsoft has dropped the ball quite so badly on this one.

In fact, I think somebody on our team went to the most recent Pepcom event as a kind  of warm up.  Probably and?  Yeah, I don't know.  It'll be interesting.  It's just a weird year all around.  Anything you've seen, any of you that you're looking forward to finding out more about  at CES this year?

Transcript:  Honestly, I'd like to hear more about the autonomous cars, because that's been a big  feature for the last couple of years.  And I don't see how that's quite going to work virtually unless they can give, you know,  do a proper Q&A.  But the car thing's really coming on fast and CES has traditionally been strong on it.  So I'll be keeping an eye on that one.

Start time: 1557.72

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  There's some things they could do with self-driving cars would be kind of interesting.  They could put you in the back seat and you could go for a ride around Vegas, which would  be kind of cool, kind of fun.

I took them out of the house in the car.  We never got out.  We never rolled down the windows just because I wanted to get them out.  It was packed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I suppose it makes sense on one level because Vegas has traditionally made its money from  people who are really lousy at working out odds.  But to actually see it in there is just bizarre.

End time: 1629.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So is there anything CES related going on in Las Vegas?  Are they doing anything ancillary on a small scale like maybe demos of self-driving cars  at all?  Or is it just, is there going to be no physical presence there?  Zero, nothing?

Start time: 1630.70
End time: 1642.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My understanding is there's no physical presence because it's too expensive to try to set something  up and then find out maybe on the last day that there's been another lockdown and it's  all off.  No one wants to risk it.

And a special performance, I don't know, by Billie Eilish, 7 p.m.  So there'll be a concert.  One of the fun things about CES used to be, I think it got less interesting as time went  by, but would be the after hours events, the parties, the concerts.  There were some pretty cool stuff in years gone by.

Our standards have really changed for what we consider entertainment during all of this.  It's like, I'll just watch somebody in his living room.  I'm in my living room.  You're in your living room.

Transcript:  Although I got to say some of the best music has come out during the pandemic of people  just recording in their homes, covering a song and then releasing the video, you know,  just them playing it on the internet.  There's a bunch of really excellent music out there as a result of this.  And you got to wonder how that's going to change the music business, you know, when  as you said, once we get to come out of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's one of my favorite topics is what's going to persist and what's not going to  persist.  For instance, weirdly last year, hardcover book sales were up 18%.  So I don't think that's going to continue.  I think that's like a that's because of the pandemic.  That's a blip.  Audio books also up, I think, 16% and ebooks, which have been dying.  They've been down every year for the last few years were up as well in the double digit  percentage.  But none of those trends, I think, will continue.  On the other hand, streaming services gained about 50% overall in customers.  And that I think is is going to hasten the end of cable television and is going to really  move us to the over the top world that we've been slowly moving to.  It's going to hasten it.  So it's interesting.  In some cases, the pandemic makes changes that won't last.  But I think things like Zoom will continue for a long time.  I think streaming tell Disney Plus had a huge year because of it.

Transcript:  Well, I got to say, I mean, usually, usually on New Year's Eve, my wife and I will go out  clubbing or raving, as I believe it's known in the year.  And so three years ago, for example, we were watching one of our favorite bands in Glasgow.  And yeah, it was a great night out.  And this year they did a paid stream.  We listened to it at home.  I didn't have anyone let you on the wife.  I could have a cup of tea when I wanted to.  It was actually a pretty good night.  You miss the energy of a club.  But I think those kind of streaming services are really going to take off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's what I wonder.  I mean, there are certain in-person things we do like conferences and concerts.  I mean, I have to feel I have to imagine that live performers are suffering mightily  because of this. And will they come back?  They say that the 1920s, the roaring 20s was part of the reason it was the roaring  20s is because people were so burned out from the pandemic of 1918 and being quarantined  and masked for so long that when they finally came out, it was the roaring 20s.  Do you think we'll have our own roaring 20s?  You think so? Yes.

Transcript:  Yes, without a doubt.  If there's that there's a book I've been recommending, Pale Rider, which is about the  the Spanish flu pandemic.  And in it, they talk about kind of the changes in society as a result of that.  And, yeah, I think we're just going to have an explosion of people traveling, going to  parties, concerts.  I think every band in the world that's a name will get out and tour.  I mean, I think it's going to be almost like a frantic golden age when this is all done.  Oh, I hope you're right.  Because if you look on social media, like all of my friends on Facebook  and Instagram, all they talk about is when this is over, here's where I'm going.  You know, and they post pictures of countries they've been to that they love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  And remember, the roaring 20s wasn't just about people going out and partying.  It was people changing what they've come to expect from society.  After such a prolonged time of not being able to do what you want to do, suddenly  you're changing how you consume.  You're changing what you consider to be success.  You're changing what you consider to be stable employment or stable housing.  We could do the same thing.  And if you do that, the companies that that latch onto that and start feeding that appetite,  they're going to make a mint.  It's going to be it's going to be a free for all once the dam breaks.

Let's just repeat the whole thing.  Now, we remember how it ended with the Great Depression.  So maybe we could skip that part.  But well, that's good.

Transcript:  I mean, the prohibition of alcohol did have a huge social influence on on the United  States because men and women started drinking together for the first time, for example,  different races started mixing together.  Oh, that's a good point.  Yeah. So, I mean, it was an enormous social driver, albeit an incredibly stupid policy.  But, you know, I mean, it was an enormous driver for social change.  And you saw women's henlooms going up and they started smoking.  OK, so it wasn't all good.  But I mean, you know, men and women mixed.  I might start smoking.

I think, you know, this has already happened to a couple of friends of mine.  And when people are released from their houses and being in the same close confines  with their partners and maybe having decided over the last year that,  yeah, this is maybe too much of a good thing.

Who knows? You know, might be a good thing all around.  I don't know. I just I always find this fascinating.  I think that that's interesting that that's what happened in the 1920s.  So I hope so. I hope so.  Yeah. Let's take a little break.  We have we have a very nice panel, which is good because we have very little news.  Ian Thompson is here from the register.

We'll start again on January the 4th because a good long Christmas  is the British tradition and we think people should have it.  That said, we did have a couple of news pieces, one of which we may be discussing  later, where Juneau's voluntarily came out of out of the Christmas period  and wrote stuff up simply because it was really important.  It's like like solar winds, of course.  Well, there was that we got rid of fairly early,  but it was the British government's really bizarre Brexit advice,  which I think is coming to.  But as it turns out, one of our guys did some digging  and there was a really good reason for doing what they did.  But more on that later. Oh, I can't wait.

Transcript:  Our token Texan. That's true.  I want to say you may have noticed  there's a slight difference in the video feed you're watching today  because we decided to take this opportunity to upgrade  what has been the backbone of Twit and all of our video production  since the very beginning, our new tech TriCaster.  And John has been so excited  for John, the end of the pandemic happened  and we got the new TriCaster to Elite,  which is the new top of the line TriCaster.  Do you have some things stored up you can you can show us with the TriCaster?  He's still learning. We got all sorts of new stuff.  It's the most complete live production system on the planet.  In fact, NewTek has updated its entire line of TriCasters,  no matter which you select, you get it's the most amazing suite  of media production capabilities at your fingertips.  This is something I'm going to miss at CES this year  is Kiki Stockhammer demonstrating what you can do with a TriCaster.  I just would stand in awe and watch as she pushed the T-bar  and push the buttons and all sorts of amazing things happen.  It's more than a live video production.  The TriCaster to Elite we use here at Twit  is an all encompassing digital media solution.  If you create content for the Internet, for mobile, for television,  for your church, for your synagogue, for anything that you're making TV productions,  you need a TriCaster.  The TriCaster to Elite is software driven, IP native technology.  That's one of the things we're most excited about.  It provides the capability,  connectivity and control you need to take on any sort of digital media production.  And when you think about the variety of features,  I'm actually really impressed because our team,  they just dig into this.  They go, oh, what else can I do?  There is no other live production solution that can enable the digital  media workflows like the TriCaster to Elite, things like live call connect,  which is built in now.  It's this new tech's latest innovation and enhances your production  by letting you connect to anyone, anywhere on any device  with high quality video and audio, regardless of the caller's device.  So that means you can use Skype, you can use Teams, you can use Zoom meetings,  you can use Slack, you can use anything.  The most popular video conferencing applications are all there.  There's the integrated live set technology, which we don't use,  but it's amazing.  You've seen it.  Well, the problem is you probably have seen it, but don't know it  because it lets you transform any location into the most elaborate  virtual environment.  And with the new tech TriCaster to Elite,  you get access to a premium library of new tech live set virtual sets  so you can have it be any way you want.  Choose from an extended variety of simulated environments,  whatever you need to fit your brand, your style,  or just get wacky and have some fun with it.  And then there's the live graphics creator plugin.  We've just started to dip our toe into this.  You can design animated titles, motion graphics, looping effects,  and you could do it with the creative cloud tools that you already know and love  then import them directly into your TriCaster live production system.  We were we were able all the lower thirds on you see now in our production  are just basically Photoshop files.  It made it so much easier to do what we're doing.  You might maybe you noticed how nice and clean our graphics look now.  Live graphics creator lets you produce and present spectacular live graphics  faster and easier than ever before.  When you're ready to take your production live,  there are presets built in for Facebook Live, Microsoft,  Azure, Twitch, YouTube Live and more with a flexible implementation,  a more complete set of capabilities and a unique capacity for distributed production.  TriCaster to elite frees you from the traditional boundaries of live video production.  The TriCaster to elite, we are so proud, so happy to be a TriCaster house  and to be able to use our new TriCaster.  It's transformative.  It's setting new standards.  It's really it's better than broadcast.  Go to newtech.com slash TriCaster.  You'll find an easy to use interactive guide that kind of lets you walk through  the features and choose which TriCaster is right for you.  New tech is N-E-W-T-E-K newtech.com slash TriCaster.  We've been working with the new tech team now for how long is it, John?  It's probably 15 years.  And it's been really fun to watch the TriCaster just get better and better  and better, more and more professional.  I don't think Twit would exist without the new tech TriCaster.  And we're so excited to get the new TriCaster to elite.  John's just hopping up and down, up and down.  We've had trainings.  We've been having so much fun playing with it.  We got a new control surface.  That's just sweet. It's cool.  Thank you, new tech.  Appreciate it. Really do.  You guys rock. Rock.  Right.

By the way, that book that you were recommending, I just wanted to  pass it along, because I know people will ask, is called Pale Rider.  The Spanish Flu of 1918 and How It Changed the World by Laura  Spini. Great book.  It's great. And anyway, I actually read another book.  I think it was Gina Collada's book about the Spanish flu some time ago.  And it is really a fascinating story.  And I suspect, you know, I don't think people talk like I don't remember  my grandparents talking about it at all.  And I suspect that in my kids probably won't tell their grandkids about this  here either. It's like they don't want to.

And I did an interview with the author for a story I did,  strangely enough, at the very start of the lockdown about  what will stick. It was kind of, you know, the thing you're interested in, Leo.  And we talked and as part of that story, I interviewed the author.  And one of the things she pointed out is that one of the reasons we have  the health insurance system that we do now in the United States  was because it came out of the Spanish flu.  Oh, interesting. And that pandemic, which there was not a health insurance  business then. And it came out of that.

Transcript:  It can't get worse. So, you know, I mean, it's just  I think a lot of Americans are now realizing that, you know,  universal health care does kind of make sense, you know, not it.  Just other countries seem to be coming out of this a lot better than America is.  And there's a reason for that. And it's not just picketed politicians.  It's the fact that if you don't have a job, you don't have health care  and other than the emergency room.  And that doesn't work out very well.  So maybe it's even more than that.

Transcript:  One of the biggest reasons why people say they're not for universal health care  is they said, well, it's the cost. It's the cost. It's the cost.  I don't want to pay for other people's health care.  I think what the pandemic has shown is, well, if you run that model,  and you have a pandemic, it destroys any cost saving you could have ever imagined.

Or a British one or a French one or a German one?  You know, if you can get seamless transit between France and Germany and yourself,  why on earth would you go to Britain in the first place?  And this is going to hit our tech industry.  I mean, it's already hitting the software jobs market  because I've now got five friends in the UK who have moved to you  who moved to Europe the minute the Brexit vote came in and are now  applying and getting for getting citizenship.  So there is a massive brain drain going on in the United Kingdom at the moment.  Yeah. Well, I mean, the only people who are going to be staying  are people who are either retired, too dumb to move,  don't have skills, which could translate overseas  or who are just so caught up on the little Englander thing.

This is this is over unless we can get the United States to get involved.  We are we are toast.  And the fear of, you know, Hitler invading was, you know, completely  terrifying to everybody.  But for some reason, there's this kind of nostalgia that, oh, yeah.  You know, this Emerald Isle, this Britain, we we fought them off in 1940.  And, you know, we don't need Europe at all.

Hey, here's a here's a story that made me so very happy.  You know, Wondery, which is a podcast network founded about five years ago.  They have shows like Dirty John, Dr.  Death, The Shrink Next Door.  Amazon just bought them for three hundred million dollars.  Wow.  I've heard people say it's going to be part of Amazon Music.  I've heard people say, oh, yeah, this is Amazon trying to build a,  you know, podcast business to compete with Spotify  and maybe perhaps Apple will get into this and others.  But honestly, it Wondery is not going to give you a podcast business.  I'm not sure exactly what it gives you.  What do you please explain to me?  What's the land the land boom in podcasting?  What's that?

Start time: 3372.02
End time: 3406.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, in this in this particular case with Wondery,  it gives them intellectual property for Amazon that Amazon  studios could use in a variety of ways.  So, you know, Dirty John has already been turned into a miniseries.  Dr. Death is going to be a television.  Right. Right.  And so what so what Wondery specializes in is it's more almost more like  old style radio theater.  Their podcasts are, you know, true crime and they tell stories.  And and this is something that's just gold for Amazon Studios.

This was Hollywood saying, you know,  we should get this digital transformation is happening.  How do we get involved?  And instead of making sideways video of seven minutes  that you could put on a phone, but not on your TV.  He came up with this, which was, I think, probably a better a better move.  And unlike Quibi, Wondery is still in business.  So good news.  Fox, I'm sorry, Amazon does not  has not said when the Wondery deal is expected to close.  It has to, you know, it's one of those deals that has to be.

Transcript:  I mean, at this point, 300 million dollars is a rounding error for Amazon.  And they know that they can make money off of content.  And they also know that right now,  I'm not disparaging the catalog that Amazon has.  They have some great shows.  They've got things like The Expanse, some of their independence.  But Netflix is kind of kicking their butt on the content side.  And rather than than trying to match them beat for beat,  this could be a smart play.  They're going off into a territory that's not really taken up  by any of the big players and Wondery gives them access.

And an Apple, which, you know, for years was kind of the place  you went to get podcasts,  has kind of fallen out of that running.  And, you know, if you have an iPhone or a Mac,  you know, yeah, you use it to it's the easiest way to get podcasts.  But they don't have any exclusive content.  They don't.  They're not kind of marketing anything is this is an Apple podcast.  And and I wonder if that's if they're just watching this  and thinking it's not worth their time or, you know,  why they haven't made that move themselves. Yeah.

Start time: 3557.38

They're cranking the content out.  Amazon Prime is a distant second.  HBO Max is coming on strong, though.  That's the the red line that just started in a couple of months ago.

Why can't let's cut out the middleman and do this ourselves?

Transcript:  I don't know. I mean, I think honestly, on one level,  I kind of miss the old days where you had to wait a week to.  And I've been doing this with Bake Off, for example.  You know, it's frustrating that you can't binge that straight off.  But there is a certain kind of frisson in waiting a bit and actually,  you know, waiting until until it comes out.  The only downside, of course, is the Internet.  So you've got to stay off certain forums and the rest of it for two or three days  because Britain before the US.  I don't want my British mates telling me who's won.  But there is a certain a certain old fashioned style.  But honestly, I think for anyone who didn't grow up with VCRs,  they're just going to want to binge everything.

Transcript:  Well, the other problem with the Internet is when Wonder Woman 84 came out  that day, Christmas night, there were a lot of server errors and issues  because everybody watched it all the same.  The minute it came out, everybody tried to watch it.

Start time: 3927.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then they trashed it.  And that kept people.  You know, I didn't I decided I wasn't going to watch it  because of all the bad buzz about it.  And they probably lost me as a viewer.  One of the interesting things about binging versus watching episodically  is that I think particularly with Netflix, the show creators,  when they know it's going to be all dumped at once,  change the structure of the shows.  Yes. So that you don't have necessarily a big  cliffhanger at the end of the show.  It just ends.  And then there's credits for the new episode.  And then it just picks up in the same scene sometimes.  The whole structure and the way they film it and then edit it  changes when it's designed to be binged.

Transcript:  I've got an example for that.  I love two shows, Star Trek, The Next Generation and The Expanse.  Right now, those are probably my top two.  I just did a rewatch of the entire next generation when I was back in the States  because it's on Amazon Prime.  And I realized I missed like a dozen episodes.  And I had not realized that I'd miss that because back when they were first on TV,  I had skipped a week or two and I just it didn't affect the story.  If I skipped an episode of The Expanse, there would be a huge plot hole.  Right. So that's the difference between episodic and binge worthy shows.

Start time: 4009.08

Transcript:  Well, also, I have a short term memory problem.  And so if I don't watch the show one after the other, I end up going,  Who's that? What happened? Why is he there?  What? Wait a minute. I thought he was dead.  So that's another problem.  I wonder if bad movies do better in a streaming environment or worse.  Wonder Woman came out of the gate doing very well.  But in the second weekend, the box office went down 67 percent.  And I have to think that it's a lot of people like you, Dwight,  who saw the reviews and said, well, I guess I'm not watching that.  Even though in the US, it's free.

And Chadwick Boseman is just incredible.  I mean, there's a scene where he takes over and for and I'd say for 10 minutes,  he's he's like riveting.

Transcript:  Leo, here's a little story.  One of the things that they do that makes Expanse so good  is they've actually spent a lot of time  figuring figuring out how you would move when the ships or the stations are in zero G or not.  And they actually they have notes in the in the readings that say, OK,  this is zero G, this is not this.  This is the orientation of the camera.  So they've actually figured it out.  So that they're not cheating.  There is no anti-gravity.  There is no transport or there's no easy way to get from from ship to ship  without going through an airlock.  And it's little details like that, that if you know about space  and if you know about space technology, it's like an inside joke to you.  It's amazing. A lot of CGI.

Let's see, this was a very sad, sad New Year's Eve for me  because we had to say goodbye to two of my bestest friends,  Farmville and Flash.  They kind of went together, didn't they?  I feel like they're buried in the same grave.  Adobe killed Flash finally.  And Farmville, which was based on Flash, I guess kind of had to go along with it.  Did any of you play Farmville? I was badly addicted.

But, you know, honestly, saying goodbye to Farmville and Flash, they  it's just just kill it.  Just kill it.  I got so sick on Patch Tuesdays of writing stories about  this is the latest critical vulnerability in Flash.  No, no, this one's even bigger.  Oh, God, Flash was a nightmare, just a nightmare.

Start time: 4671.24
End time: 4706.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Farmville was a nightmare in its own way, too.  I spent a lot of time farming, farming corn.  I remember one morning, my wife got up.  She said, what are you doing?  I said, she said, you're farming, aren't you?  I said, yeah.  So why don't you why don't you knit a sweater?  At least you'd have something at the end of the day.  And it's really true. I really recognize.  But I have a weakness because after Farmville, I played We Rule.  After We Rule, Simpson's tapped out.  And now I'm doing Animal Crossing and I find I'm doing the same damn farming  on Animal Crossing. It's the same thing.  It's the same thing. Of course you are.

Transcript:  Yeah, I just described them all. Yeah.  I think this was probably for most of us, our first experience of dark patterns  and evil addictions.  And I know that I always know with one of these games that I played it too much  when I'm no longer enjoying it.  The first few weeks, you enjoy it. It's fun.  But when you kind of grit your teeth and go, oh, I got to I got to  that corn's going to go bad if I don't harvest it.  And you fire the thing up and you're just like, why am I doing this to myself?

Transcript:  Coming back, coming back to what you were saying about dark patterns, Leo,  I thought that was it was interesting that Farmville and Facebook  both really took off at around the same time as they played onto each other's  strengths. Yes.  And yeah, you're constantly checking Facebook and oh, may as well check on how  my farm is doing in the meantime.  But yeah, I mean, as Dwight says, it goes way back to the Sims.  You could possibly even take it back further.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's digital crack.  But I mean, this has been going on for for quite some time.  I mean, if you go back to the 80s, I mean, Elite was one of the first games  that really crippled people in terms of addiction.  They the BBC decided to do a news story on Elite because  the news editor came in and found nine out of 20 of his journalists were playing it  and the others were asking them how to get on as well.  So, you know, it's these things that computer software,  you know, computer games and narcotics have an awful lot in common.  And they're increasingly designed to hit those same pleasure centers.

But my town crashed and I lost everything in the great crash  of probably 2015.  And you think I learned the lesson, at least with Animal Crossing,  there's no more to buy.  So they just to dig you for no good reason not to make money  just because they can more than anything else, which is kind of sad.  Very good article in the New Republic by Siva Vajanathan, who is a  sociologist and wrote a book about Facebook.  The. The.  The article I recommend to everybody is making sense of the Facebook  menace, can the largest media platform in the world ever be made safe  for democracy, spends a fairly long  article describing the issues with Facebook and then trying to come up  with some solutions, you know, for what do you do with Facebook?  You don't want the government to shut them down.  You certainly don't want them to be split up and it just creates more  Facebook's. It's like a hydra.  The greatest threat, this is the paragraph I thought was important  and really is timely.  Perhaps the greatest threat that Facebook poses in concert with other  by the way, he points out, other digital media platforms, devices  and the whole global media ecosystem is corrosion over time.  What Facebook does or does not amplify or delete in the moment  matters very little.  He's talking about what Facebook blocks and whether this should be a  lot of that. He says that doesn't matter in a diverse and tumultuous  world, but the fact that Facebook, the leading player in the global  media ecosystem, undermines our collective ability to distinguish  what is true or false, who or what should be trusted  and our abilities to deliberate soberly across differences and distances  is profoundly corrosive.  This is the gaping flaw in the platform's design that will demand much  more radical interventions than better internal policies or even  aggressive antitrust enforcement.  I feel like that's true.  I don't know what the answer is.  He talks about something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, he's in fact saying that he's saying it's the global media.  He says really, Facebook is a part of a larger global media ecosystem  that has had over the last and I think a lot of it's because of the Internet,  maybe cable news, but just as we were inundated  constantly with information and the upshot of it is  it's no longer you were no longer able to distinguish good from bad,  useful from not useful, trustworthy versus not trustworthy.  It's just a massive information that we don't have any biological way to process.  We talk about this a lot.

And of course, because of the very fast, powerful feedback loops  that the technology is created, everybody who creates content knows that  and knows pretty well about what it is that creates that.  And so there's no incentive to create long form boring  pieces that nobody's going to read.

Start time: 5154.98
End time: 5206.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is this is something that came out of the Brexit investigations  into social media was that, you know,  social media wasn't necessarily being used to change people's  minds directly with targeted advertising.  What they were doing was testing out various keywords and key phrases  to see what really got people fired up and then spamming those out  across the entire populace.  So, you know, make Britain free again and, you know,  regain control and the rest of it.  These were all put out to various various different social groups  and sociological types before being spammed out on a general thing.  So you're right, people are absolutely using this for to push their message.  But they're just doing it in a very, very efficient way.  And I think there therein lies the problem. Yeah.

You know, you mentioned the whole idea of  no one's going to pay any attention to being told for an hour about Brexit,  but they will if it's entertaining and you could have depth  and it be entertaining, that is hard to do, but you could do it.  And and so I think that what what's happened is that people have  insisted on having essentially icing on everything, icing on your stake.

Transcript:  So I interviewed  the CEO of HPE.  And one of the things he said, you know, yes, the cost of  cost of doing business is better is lower in Texas.  The one downside to it is probably the biggest downside  is that while in Austin, you certainly have a  a critical mass of talent in other parts of the state, you may not.  Houston, you are growing that more and more.  It's probably the most diverse crop of talent in the state in Houston.  But it is a, you know, you have to get that critical mass here  that you have now in Silicon Valley before I think you really have  a lot of people moving.

You you tracked all these companies.  Eventually, you have to start raising the quality of life across the city,  which means you have to increase the taxes or start charging taxes  in order to pay for everything.  At that point, these companies will up and go someplace else.

They all warn about the Californianization of Texas.  And in fact, in the upcoming legislature,  there is a lot of talk about reducing the local control  that states and counties have because they're doing things.  They want to do things that look suspiciously like California.  And so and so but what's going to happen is you have more and more of these  companies here who expect that level of service  and that level of amenity from their government.  And they're not paying for it.  And they're not paying for it.  They're not paying for it.  Well, it's going to change taxes.

We're going to have to pay to clean this stuff up.  Come to Houston.

And so, you know, you kind of the one thing about Houston that  that kind of has more issues now is that we increasingly  we've been having these storms that cause horrendous flooding.  You've covered up all of us all the time.  And I think that as much as city leaders and the Greater Houston Partnership,  which is what we call the the Chamber of Commerce here,  is as much as they want to spin it, that, you know, Houston  has a great quality of life and has a great quality of life  until there's 30 inches of water in your front yard.

Transcript:  We will talk about drone because we got a drone, the new drone regulations,  because we got the drone father here, the quad father.  But first, a word from our sponsor, Express VPN.  Somebody asked me the other day on the radio show, I don't go anywhere.  What do I need a VPN for?  I said, yeah, no, it's true.  When when we first started using VPNs is when we realized that every time  we use an open Wi-Fi access point at the coffee shop or the airport,  we were on a network with other people we didn't know that they could be.  They see what we're doing, but also the people who provided the access point,  they could see everything we were doing.  It seemed only prudent to have a VPN.  And that's really when VPN started to take off.  But it's also the case that even when you're home,  a VPN is a great way to protect your privacy, to keep you secure,  but also keep the information about what you're doing  away from your Internet service provider.  The guy said, yeah, but I use incognito mode.  That only hides that doesn't that doesn't hide you from anything.  That only that only just doesn't keep a history.  That's not that's not privacy.  You need an encrypted VPN.  Plus, there's the thing that we've all gone through where, you know,  we've watched every Netflix show available to us.  Wouldn't it be nice if you could watch Netflix in the UK  and see all those Doctor Who episodes or Netflix in Tokyo  and see all the anime episodes?  Well, you can with Express VPN.  Now, remember, a VPN is only as good as the company providing it.  Your privacy and your security are protected with Express VPN  because they care about you and they make sure that they do not log you.  In fact, they even invented a server technology they call Trusted Server  that runs in RAM only sandbox, so it can't write to the hard drive.  And the minute you close the VPN connection, it disappears.  And there's no trace of your presence.  And we know that's the case because they get regular audits  from PricewaterhouseGOOPER.  So we know we know that they are not tracking you, that you are private.  Now, of course, there are free and very cheap VPNs out there,  but it costs money to run a good VPN.  If you want a VPN that's fast, that lets you emerge anywhere in the world,  that lets you watch HD video, it's going to cost you a little bit.  I think Express VPN is a great deal, around seven dollars a month.  And it does it without slowing down your connection.  It does it without logging your presence.  It gives you true privacy, true security.  And oh, by the way, Doctor Who episodes from the UK Netflix.  It's the number one rated VPN, not just by me, but by CNET, by Wired.  They do everything right.  Stop handing your personal data over to ISPs and other tech giants  who mine your activity, sell off your information.  I put Express VPN on the router.  That way, everybody in the house is protected.  Protect yourself with a VPN.  I trust to keep me private and secure online.  ExpressVPN.com slash tweet.  E-X-P-R-E-S-S VPN.com slash tweet.  We're going to get you the best deal.  When you sign up for the 12 month plan, you'll get an extra three months free.  That's like a 25% discount.  That really is the best way to do this.

But before we do, I do want to take a look back  because this was an interesting week and we've made a little video for you.  I hope you enjoy it. Watch.  This is what the robots are going to look like when they dance on our.  Oh, good. I'm glad I didn't play this on the show.  That is an appropriate comment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. So if you've got anything that's less than 250 grams,  which would be a lot of the hobbyist craft, the toys,  the little racers that have FPV, there's there's no change.  You can still run those any way you want.  They've basically built the new regulations  based on how much damage it could cause if it fell out of the sky.  Above 250 grams, your craft now has to be running a locator.  Now, the original draft was that they wanted you to connect to your phone,  which would broadcast to a national registry to say that you were flying  and where you were flying. That got nixed.  Now all you need is some sort of transmitter on your device  that either uses Wi-Fi or Bluetooth so that anything in the area  knows that there's craft in the area.  I think that's the easiest way to sum up all the rules.  Now, as you get bigger and bigger, you start getting into commercial use  and that's controlled by the FAA. Right.  But they they really didn't want to regulate everything  because the FAA just doesn't have the manpower to do that.

Drone operators are currently required to obtain a waiver  if you want to fly one at night or over people who aren't involved  in the operation of the drone.  Drone manufacturers will have 18 months to build these remote  ID systems into their drones, and then you'll have an additional year  to buy one. So you've got really in a way you've got two and a half years  before you have to worry about this. Is that right? Correct. Yeah.

And you can see through that camera, through the front of your craft.  It's a great way to pilot. It is a lot of fun.  You get so much more control because rather than you trying to figure out  which way your craft is turned and which control input you have to do  in order to make it go the way you want.  It's it's literally like sitting in a car.

I do have to wonder what happened to all those Mount Gox bitcoins  because they're worth seriously amount huge amounts of money at the moment.  But honestly, Bitcoin is a speculative instrument.

Transcript:  I mean, remember about Bitcoin, though, is there's always a story  about how this business is now going to accept Bitcoin or you can buy.  It is a terrible device for transactions.  It is a horrible device for transactions because of the volatility.  It's incredibly clunky.  What what it is, it's an investment tool.  It's a financial tool.  It's a way for you to try to grow money.  But trying to buy something with a Bitcoin,  going from the actual accepting of the transaction to getting the money,  because that has to go through a financial institution.  You could see, depending on the size of the transaction,  several thousands dollars difference, either positive or negative.  That's that's a horrible way to make a transaction. Yeah.

Transcript:  Also, I just do want to make this point, so I think it's important.  The amount of power and processing time being used to mine these coins  at the moment, it's the size of a small country.  So for all these people, oh, I'm so green, I'm so environmentally friendly.  And now I'm mining Bitcoin.  You know, it's there is a big carbon footprint to these.  So ethically, it's kind of a dodgy area.

Transcript:  And leave it to the Japanese to come up with a solution for space junk.  They're planning to build wooden satellites.  You make them out of wood.  This is a Japanese company, Sumitomo Forestry,  in conjunction with Kyoto University.  They hope they will be launching the world's first satellites made out of wood in 2023.  Because, of course, the wood burns up when the satellite reenters.  But I think you still have to put some electronics in there.  I'm just thinking you can make them out of wood,  but you still have to have some circuit boards in there, don't you?

Start time: 7005.08
End time: 7021.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting they released this news over the traditional Christmas  and New Year's slow period, because, yeah,  if you want the satellites to do anything, you can't do it with wood.  You've got to have electronics in there.  Oh, stop your...  I do it with wood myself.

Transcript:  Yeah, when it comes to...  I'm not even going there.  No, I mean, honestly, when you've got to put stuff into orbit, weight matters.  And wood is heavier than, say, very thin aluminium.  And they both burn up in the atmosphere anyway.  So, you know, it's one of those...  It's a cute idea, but, you know...

Start time: 7048.44
End time: 7079.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look, the space junk problem isn't burning up in the atmosphere.  Anything you shove into the atmosphere is going to mostly burn up.  The problem is when it's orbiting and wood or aluminium  is going to be travelling at three kilometres per second  to stay in a geostationary orbit.  And it doesn't matter if it's wood or aluminium.  If it hits you at that speed, you die.  If it hits a satellite at that speed, it will destroy that satellite.  So it's not really a solution. It really isn't.  It's kind of cute, though.

This I hadn't realised.  Geostationary satellites aren't pushed back to Earth.  They're pushed out to a parking orbit further out.  So we're potentially building another band of stuff around this orbit,  which is going to come back and haunt us when we actually try and get rid of these things.  So, I mean, ideally, we need to build space elevators,  as Arthur C. Clarke would add, and build our communications around those.  But that's a century away.

It's, here's from Astronomy magazine,  the best candidate for an extraterrestrial message in 42 years  is probably manmade, but what if it's not?  Researchers heard the signal  at the 64-metre Parks Radio Telescope in Australia back in April and May of 2019.  The radio emissions seemed well organised  not spontaneous, not random.  They're analysing it like crazy right now.  And as is often the case with these kinds of transmissions,  when they're picked up as, you know, it could be, you know, an Earth bounce or some sort of thing.
