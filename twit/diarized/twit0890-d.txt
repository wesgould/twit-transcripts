Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yep.  And haven't really used much of it.  Not at all.  No.  But it was a good experience.  It was certainly good to be in that environment.  And I took a ton of computer science classes and human computing interface.  And in a way, coming from a liberal arts background, it gave me sort of the deep breath.  Yeah, I can hang in this space and I can participate.  And I learned a lot about cognition, which is huge when you're trying to communicate in any medium.  So in the minute and a half that I get for an ABC GMA story, knowing how to get my message across, that I learned a lot in grad school.

Start time: 251.48
End time: 287.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, I was testing the aura Fitbit and the Samsung Galaxy Watch, how they monitor your sleep and report your REM stages, your deep, how long you slept, how long it took you to fall asleep.  And we tested those against a standard sleep study, something you might go do if you have restless leg syndrome or sleep apnea to see how those mirrored up.  And it was super interesting.  That's what I love about my job is that I get access to these incredible tools, facilities, institutions and can use them to get information about consumer tech that you wouldn't normally get.

Start time: 460.64
End time: 503.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So the kind of idea is that like, whereas most publishers, you know, they publish quite  mainstream stuff because you need to be able to guarantee the return that you'll get and  guarantee that you're going to get it into Barnes and Noble.  We are able to do much more interesting and some slightly geeky things because we crowdfund  the first printing of all the books that we do.  So we've got some fantastic books around the making of the Resident Evil series, the making  of Alien Isolation, which I think most people consider to be the scariest video game ever  made.  The Gothic cookbook.  The Gothic cookbook, if you're feeling a little bit miserable, but also kind of kitchenette.  But this is the one that our audience is going to be most interested in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  So we worked with the Douglas Adams estate.  So we have a book called 42 and it's all the kind of stuff that was left lying around  Douglas Adams office when he died.  Oh, Lord.  There are post-it notes.  Oh, this is my worst nightmare.  Unpublished.  Yeah.  Unpublished kind of memos, some wedding speeches, papers that he had kind of kicking around.  So we collated each page is a facsimile of something interesting from his office.  Scripts, jokes, speeches, to-do lists, poems.  Oh, Douglas Adams fans would flip over this.  Yeah, Douglas Adams fans, it's the last kind of trove of material from him.  So we have that coming out.  You can preorder it now and get supporter editions the beginning of next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just want to say if you do this after my death and you find the Bitcoin password, I  would really appreciate it if you would not publish that until my estate got ahold of  it.  Okay, just saying.  Just saying.  This looks cool.  You are offering our audience an offer code.  I just wanted to mention this up front.

Start time: 576.54
End time: 593.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Rod is the editor in chief at Ad Astra, which is the national publication of the National Space Society,  nss.org, written a great many books.  I'll bring the pile in.  I'll have the pile brought in for later in the show.  Okay, that's fair.  But the pile pile, we call it.  But you just came back from a month on Mars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I called it, yeah.  And it was extraordinary.  You're up in the Arctic Circle, right?  Yeah, so we were up at about 15 degrees or 75 degrees.  Sorry, 15 degrees south of the pole, which sounds like it's a fair distance away.  But the sun never set.  It kind of skirted the horizon, which, as I was mentioning to you earlier for a photographer,  you got sunset for three, four hours a night.

Start time: 682.50
End time: 701.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so it's so close.  I mean, there's no perchlorates.  The soil isn't oxidizing like Mars, but it's gritty.  It will kill you instantly, is what you're saying.  Not like Mars, yeah.  But it's cold all the time.  The soil is very sharp and gritty, gets into everything.  So it's a great place to test hardware.  Look at this.  Some tested spacesuits.

Start time: 703.30
End time: 713.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is Mars-like, I guess, because there's no animals or anything.  And you guys are writing, instead of rovers, you're writing little Kawasaki ATVs.

Start time: 713.72
End time: 749.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because they had two rovers up there.  But they kept getting bogged down in the soft soil and so forth.  So Pascal Lee, who runs this in conjunction with NASA, he's got a doctorate in planetary geology,  works down at Ames and the SETI Institute, is a big advocate of using some kind of alternative ATV on Mars.  The idea being the astronaut would have some of their life support on the ATV.  So when you sat on the ATV, you'd have your spacesuit plugged in,  and when you got off, it kind of followed you everywhere you go.  So that's why they experiment with ATVs.

Start time: 749.48
End time: 756.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They were testing that.  And here's the gang up where the sun never sets.  The guy on the right, John Schutt, looks like he actually lives up there.

Start time: 756.52
End time: 775.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's an amazing guy.  He's crested four of the highest mountains on the planet.  He's done 34 seasons in the Antarctic as an expedition leader, finding meteorites.  And if you didn't ask him about it, you'd figure he's just some guy living on a bus stop.  You start talking to him and he's astonishing.  What fun.

Transcript:  Anyway, Rod is here because there's a lot of space to talk about, including tomorrow's big, well, hoped big launch.  Crossing fingers.  Crossing our fingers.  Anyway, what a great panel.  Rod Pyle, me, Will Harris, Becky Worley.  Welcome to all three of you.  I guess we'll kick off.  There's so many stories we could start with.  I think we should kick off with the Twitter whistleblower, Mudge, who worked briefly for, I think, for a year and a half for Twitter.  Yeah, banging on two years.  Almost two years.  Peter Zatko.  He was very well known.  He was one of the members of the Cult of the Dead Cow Hacker Group, testified to Congress as one of the members there about hacking.  He was at LOFT, L-O-P-H-T, very well known hacking group.  Later on, worked for the Department of Defense and other very respectable organizations in cybersecurity.  Was hired by Twitter right after they were hacked.  Remember when Elon Musk and Barack Obama and Tim Cook's accounts were hacked saying, hey, we want to give back.  So if you give us some crypto, we will double it and give it back to you.  Like any idiot would fall for that.  But it was a massive hack of some of the best known accounts on Twitter.  Twitter freaked out.  Hired Zatko.  He was there almost two years.  Fired at the beginning of the year.  According to Agrawal, after he did the whistle blowing, he said, well, he was fired because he wasn't any good.  He says that Twitter's security is terrible.  He said he tried for a long time to tell them.  They didn't listen.  So six months after his firing, he became a whistleblower, sending information to the FTC, the SEC and others.  Lots of stories have come out of that.  I have to say, as soon as I read it, I said, I want to know more before I believe everything he says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead, Becky.

Start time: 912.74
End time: 957.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because I was reading this and something that's, you know, I was curious, what exactly are the allegations that are being made around the security breaches and problems?  And so he said there were no logs and he specifically called out around January 6th that there were no logs and that nobody knew where the data lived, whether it was critical.  All engineers had some form of critical access to the production environment.  And if an internal engineer wanted to take over the platform, they could and they wouldn't know where the where the attack was coming from.  And there was no way to close that down.  Is that something that you think most companies do?

Start time: 958.33
End time: 963.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, well, maybe.  I mean, here's the irony of this.  That was what he was hired to fix.

Start time: 965.41
End time: 1004.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is exactly it, Leo.  So you've got it nail on the head.  So he comes in in 2020 in order to fix, you know, exactly that we can probably all appreciate is a lot of Twitter security problems, right?  As you pointed out, the hacking of Tim Cook or the cyber security stuff, he then makes a big stink about the fact that following January the sixth, you know, he was worried that somebody who was sympathetic to the January sixth, you know, quote unquote insurrection cause could take over the platform and do something.  And you're like, well, dude, you've been there for a year and a half.  Isn't that what you were supposed to be doing?  Literally brought in a year and a half ago.  That was that was your job.

Start time: 1005.50
End time: 1012.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, I mean, really, his complaint might be, well, I tried and they wouldn't let me.  I don't know if he said that specifically.

Start time: 1012.98
End time: 1029.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He also said, I think what I think what he says is that a lot of the complaints that he had and a lot of the queries that he had basically got tied up in the kind of Twitter executive board, which was not a good thing.  And he said, well, I think that's because of the own functioning because of the Dorothy.  We knew this though.

Start time: 1029.48
End time: 1106.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter's had the most dysfunctional board in history.  That is Twitter in a nutshell.  That's our our little dysfunctional friend.  Twitter was in violation of its FTC consent decree in 2011.  The FTC, after a number of security problems, said you must establish and maintain a comprehensive information security program that will be assessed by an outside auditor.  And you must not.  This is the best part.  You must not lie to your users about your security.  And he says, well, they didn't do either.  Again, he was there.  It's hard to know.  I mean, much is respectable and respected.  So, you know, there is some concern that maybe the timing of this so close to the to Elon Musk's trial and Chancery Court in December.  I mean, in October in Delaware, that maybe it was to support Elon's contention that there were too many bots on Twitter.  Actually, there's a very good piece, which I recommend from our good friend Mike Masnick on Tech Dirt, in which he explains why the whistleblower report actually does not support Musk, even though it might seem to.  It supports Twitter.

Start time: 1109.14
End time: 1168.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I think, I mean, there is I don't want to get too meta about this, but Becky will know as somebody who works in a media outlet.  I don't know, Mike, and I don't know Tech Dirt very well, but it's very interesting to see like what outlets run with what version of that story.  And you can kind of guess like who got the internal briefing from the Twitter PR, who got the internal briefing from the PR that Mudge clearly hired, because the different angles on this story are like really distinct.  Mike, Mike is that, you know, this guy was fighting his hardest to try and fix a broken culture within Twitter, or it's this guy was absolutely, you know, an idiot who couldn't, you know, tie his shoelaces together and certainly couldn't fix anything, you know, inside a major corporation.  And you go, well, those two things, you know, two perspectives on possibly the same set of facts.  But it's interesting to see who runs with what with what I will defend my goodness.

Start time: 1169.48
End time: 1174.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I didn't understand the story. Will you explain why I still don't understand why it supports Twitter?

Start time: 1174.92
End time: 1176.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's because you're in the media.

Start time: 1176.72
End time: 1182.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  OK, the mainstream media is not telling the truth.

Start time: 1182.66
End time: 1302.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As the media is unfortunately falling for the spin.  So what Mazik explains, and this is this is God's truth.  He's not making something up.  It it really revolves around a misunderstanding, either a misunderstanding, intentional or accidental that Elon has about bots.  And then Elon has intentionally confused the world about.  It sounds like Elon is saying that the platform is more than five percent fake and that Twitter has been lying about that.  That is, in fact, not what Twitter has ever said.  Twitter's counting something called monthly daily active users.  And this is not monthly. Sorry.  That would make no sense. Monthly daily active users.  What is M.Dowell's monetizeable?  Even better. Thank you for correcting that.  So M.Dowell's monetizeable daily active users is a number that Twitter gives its advertisers  so that when they buy ads, it's in effect saying, well, every day this many people who could click on your ad are watching.  They also say very clearly they said this to the SEC.  They said it to the FTC. They say it to advertisers.  This is an estimate because it's hard to tell who's real and who's not real.  We estimate about five percent of that M.Dowell number.  Very important. Not of the total, but of the M.Dowell number could still be bots.  We try to filter them out, but we may be is maybe be off by five percent.  That is they never say how many of all of Twitter is bots.  The whole point of calculating M.Dowell is to tell advertisers.  This is how many people could click on your ad and we might be off by five percent.  So Elon is intentionally or unintentionally conflating bots on the total platform with this very important number that Twitter is using.  It's the number they use to monetize.  And Twitter's always said it exactly right.  And in fact, the whistleblower much confirms it.

Start time: 1303.49
End time: 1311.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, that's exactly right.  I mean, I think to say whether Elon is doing it intentionally and unintentionally, he won't look.  Is there that much question?

Start time: 1311.78
End time: 1317.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We don't know his intent, but it looks like he's trying to get out of the deal.  He looks like he's trying to complain.  And so he's looking at whatever he can find to get out of the deal.

Start time: 1317.86
End time: 1351.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But I think the more important point rather than, you know, the spam and the bot thing is kind of a tangent.  The question is, you know, did everybody who is basically an engineer at Twitter have access to basically mess with the platform with no logs that described who messed with the platform?  I mean, that's bad.  If you've got to commit code, if you've got to mess with the platform, that's something that you should put your name to.  And he is basically alleging that anybody, you know, half the engineering team could commit anything without having to put their name to it.

Start time: 1351.74
End time: 1395.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's why this whole MDow thing is relevant to that, because much is misstating this in Elon's favor, showing a misunderstanding of what's going on, which then cast, in my opinion, into doubt the entire whistleblowing account.  If he doesn't understand this, we don't know how much of this is accurate, how much of this is he thought supporting Musk.  It puts the whole thing in doubt.  So I'm not saying it's not true.  I'm not saying it's true.  I'm saying what we have to do is wait for an investigation.  The SEC and the FTC will investigate and see what they come up with.  That'll be pretty quick, right?  That'll come around pretty quickly.  And in 10 years we'll know what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I looked at this from a different perspective, which was follow the money.  And so much in the federal whistleblower policy, there's a reward.  Yes.  Ten million dollars is the reward.  But if you look at the SEC filings on top executives at Twitter, they're getting huge amounts of their compensation in stock.  So I don't know the exact amounts that he was compensated in stock or how much he currently holds.  But you're thinking that he would sabotage his own net worth by undermining the platform.  So both of those things could be true.

Start time: 1432.20
End time: 1475.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so is he going to make more money from the reward than he would lose from the failing stock?  We don't know that.  Right.  What we don't know is if Elon Musk made a call and said, hey, you know, it would really be helpful.  I mean, that's really a scurrilous.  That's very conspiratorial.  That's a scurrilous accusation.  But I think my point is there's a lot we don't know.  And I don't think you can just say, well, Mudge isn't lying.  This is true.  If it is, it's horrific.  It's bad.  But there is some areas in this, including the MDOW, where he doesn't understand what's going on.  There's also this question of, well, it's that bad.  Why didn't you fix it?  I mean, that's something he could have fixed.  He was in charge of security because from now on, we've got to log access simply.

Start time: 1475.48
End time: 1512.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I think the thing that it really comes down to and the thing that it just highlights, and I mean, in a sense, the sad thing about this is that it isn't really news, which is Twitter leadership is just an absolute shoot show.  Like, it's terrible.  Nobody can really take responsibility for anything.  You know, we are in a situation where the board is trying to force a sale of a company at a stock price that was 30% lower than it was nine months ago in order to get out of what seems like a grim situation.  Like, this is not a company that's got its head screwed on straight.  But we've always, like you said, this is not news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the real question then for you all as the panel.  And I'd love to know what you think, Becky, and I love Will, and I love Roger Wayan on this.  How important is Twitter?  So what if it's a shoot show?  Right? Who cares?

Start time: 1546.56
End time: 1578.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I think the answer is it's really important to a certain extent.  It's important to a certain segment of the population.  Journalists.  Yeah, we way overestimate how much of the population that is.  It's like 100% of journalists are on Twitter.  And so journalists think that 100% of the world is Twitter.  Right? And I say that as a former journalist.  I can, you know, I understand the bubble.  How important is it to real life?  I mean, what percentage of the US population is on Twitter?  Like, 7%, 9%, less than?

Start time: 1579.48
End time: 1646.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but think about it this way.  You know, a lot of people assert that Twitter is the public square, right?  Of the digital.  Yeah, that's my question. Is it?  I like the metaphor that it's more the Coliseum.  And this is not my original idea.  This is brilliant.  But the idea is that there's so much viewership of the blood sport that's taking place on Twitter.  And that is important.  And it's a proxy for the public square.  That's just one thought.  Another thing, this question really was front of mind for me also, Leo.  So I did a little research and listen to this.  The Senate Judiciary Committee's top Republican Chuck Grassley said that all of these complaints,  the whistleblower complaint, raise serious national security concerns and privacy issues that need to be investigated.  And he said, take a tech platform that collects massive amounts of user data,  combine it with what appears to be an incredibly weak security infrastructure and infuse it with foreign state actors with an agenda.  And you've got a recipe for disaster.  I actually thought that was pretty intelligent.

Start time: 1646.60
End time: 1661.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Except the foreign state actors aren't getting the data that Twitter collects.  What data does Twitter collect, really?  It doesn't collect the same quality of data that Google and Facebook collect, incidentally.  I mean, what information do you give it?

Start time: 1661.50
End time: 1664.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You've got to look at the trending topics to know that, right?

Start time: 1664.99
End time: 1705.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, what information do you give Twitter?  Not much.  In fact, they did misuse the information.  We know this.  When you give them email and phone numbers for two factor, we found out, and they've pleaded guilty to this, that they would use it for advertising.  OK.  But that's not a national security issue.  Remember, the Republicans don't like Twitter because they banned Donald Trump.  And so I think there's a certain amount of piling on from the Republicans because they just don't like Twitter.  So let me ask you this, Becky.  Do you think Twitter could be used by foreign adversaries as a potent propaganda tool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, I guess I would only just extrapolate in the thought experiment based on the complaint and the whistleblower complaint,  which is what would be a scenario where it could have caused more destructive actions, say, during the January 6th insurrection?  What if certain accounts were suppressed and others were promoted?  Would that have really changed history?  I'm not sure.

Start time: 1731.87
End time: 1744.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I mean, maybe it was used to organize, but if it didn't work, they could go on WhatsApp.  They could have gone to Signal.  They could have gone to any number of messaging platforms.  Truth. Network.  Truth social apparently is about to go bankrupt, by the way.

Transcript:  You've hit the nail on the head with the Coliseum thing, right?  It's about a group of people wanting a certain amount of spectacle and enjoying the spectacle.  But I think the fact that we're even discussing this, you know, this evening is a case.  We're going to discuss it because the quote comes to mind of, you know, Leo, are you not entertained?  Yes.

Start time: 1770.76
End time: 1800.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I have heard from many of our most avid fans that they are not entertained by discussions of Twitter.  So I am taking a great risk doing this, but I think it's important.  I have two little more nuggets.  My point with Grassley is he's bringing in two separate things, the privacy violations and foreign actors.  They're two completely separate.  They're not. There's no intersection, even though he's acting as if there's an intersection.  I think the private actors thing is reasonable.  Nuggets, more nuggets from Warley.

Start time: 1800.64
End time: 1818.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Two nuggets that I think are interesting.  The attorney for Mudge is Deborah Katz.  And I thought, gosh, I know that name.  I looked her up.  She represented Christine Blasey Ford in the Kavanaugh hearings and the chief whistleblower in the Harvey Weinstein debacle.

Start time: 1818.48

Start time: 1841.86
End time: 1922.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I mean, literally the only comms we had were 144 character texts on our GPS units.  But that brought me to thinking about Twitter while I was up there because it was a similar character count.  And so stupid macro question.  But has anybody figured out what his game musks game plan might have been just just stepping back the beginning of this crazy story to almost buy Twitter as opposed to actually be serious about it?  I mean, I know there was talk about, well, he was going to do this and then do that and drive the price down to get it for less and all that.  But this is a guy who love him or like him, crazy or not, you know, has been on this kind of crusade somewhat quixotic in some cases to build electric cars to save the environment, to build massive ever larger rockets.  He tells us to set up a backup population on Mars, although I think most of us who don't get to go probably wouldn't be that supportive of that.  But we like the idea.  And in theory, you know, for 44 billion dollars, he could have condominiums on the rings of Saturn right now.  So what is the point if he's really doing it?  Is there some other agenda here?  Does he really think that it is such a big chunk of the public conversation that he's going to use that to drive his other agenda?  I'm confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And go ahead.  Is that Elon obviously has an enormous stake in in Tesla, which is to a greater or lesser degree heavily dependent on government grants and part of the you know, if you look at the inflation reduction, that gives a lot of credits to automakers that make a lot of money.  Automakers that make electric cars.  It restores Tesla's credits, which he had lost.  Yeah, he has enormous contracts with the space agency and NASA, which are government bodies.  And all of this is a very long play on the expectation that Donald Trump will win in 2024.  And in order to restore access to Donald Trump's Twitter account in 2024, there might be a little quid pro quo to do.

Start time: 1996.50
End time: 2045.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there's a simpler Occam's razor here.  I think there's a simpler explanation for all of this that the Elon Musk who founded didn't find bought Tesla and built it.  Did he found SpaceX or did he buy it?  Yeah, he bought it with a couple other engineers.  And built it. Is not the Elon Musk of late that we've seen primarily on Twitter.  His latest thing, by the way, is the biggest crisis coming to the world is underpopulation, which is why I have 10 children.  He's off his rocker now. He's not the same guy.  He's off his rocker. And he's also shoot.  He's a ready fire aim kind of guy who ready fired aim 44 billion dollars to buy Twitter and then realized, oh, that was a bad idea.  And has been trying to get out of it ever since.

And this, you know, there are there's times when it doesn't work and you want to back out.  And he really got into it and is now in a big legal brouhaha, which is going to take up a lot of his time and energy and cost him money.

Start time: 2072.56
End time: 2086.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I don't I don't think there's any way the Delaware court doesn't say, well, you got to make Twitter at least a little bit whole.  I don't think they're going to make him buy it.  But I think that they're going to say more than a billion more than the billion dollar break up fee.  It's going to cost him several billions.

Start time: 2087.04
End time: 2102.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And by the way, I think the market changing in the middle of all this offer didn't help.  I mean, didn't help and might have given him cold feet if he was sort of on the edge.  And so maybe if you look at the amount of Tesla stock, he's had to sell the amount of Tesla stock that he sold to try and make that happen.

Start time: 2102.48
End time: 2107.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 2107.92
End time: 2140.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there is another conspiracy theory on that one.  Tesla's, you know, just did a three for one stock swap and the thinking was that he was going to sell the stock.  There was a tax manipulation, essentially, and then buy it back at a lower cost after the split.  So it and in fact, there's there's some people who even think that was the play all along.  I'm trying to remember who it was.  Not Jim Cramer, another stock guru who says, you know what, this really was all about a Tesla stock and nothing about Twitter, nothing to do with Twitter.

I would say, correct me if I'm wrong.  Bottom line on this interesting whistleblower. Fascinating.  Going to have to withhold judgment till I see more evidence.  The EU is also going to get to an investigation.  There's a lot. There's investigations galore being launched by this.  I will. I personally going to wait and see.

Transcript:  And did it again with SpaceX at least two or three times.  And if it wasn't for external investment, they'd be done.  But again, these are just people who know him well.  I don't at all.  But their feeling is that this concern about money has become kind of a late arrival.  This Emperor Elon thing that we're beginning to see on Twitter is also a bit of a late arrival.  And they're confused. So when I ask what they feel, their feeling is he's still not that concerned about it.  He's really just concerned about this achievement within chaos kind of lifestyle that he loves.  He's done amazing things.

But he took on all these contractors and said, I can do it better than you and I can bring the rockets back and wash them off and empty the ashtrays and launch them again.  And he did.  Because it's just not that hard.  So I talked a few years ago to Tory Bruno, who's the CEO of United Launch Alliance, and he said, yeah, he cleaned our clock.  And we had to go out and figure out how to do this cheaper.  And SpaceX now controls over half the world's launch industry, and that includes all the stuff China does.  So amazing stuff.

Transcript:  There's a fine line between Mouth and Mouse.  I'm just saying like there is between the Olympics and jail.  Our show today brought to you by Policy Genius.  Now this is true genius here. We pay hundreds of dollars a year for insurance to protect our homes, our cars, our phones.  What are you doing to protect your family?  My phone's insured. My family? Wait a minute. What?  Mortgage payments?  Schools? Colleges?  Those kind of debts don't disappear if something happens to you.  A life insurance policy is the best way, the only way to protect your loved ones with a financial cushion they can use to cover those costs.  And I know no one wants to think about the worst case scenario, but let me tell you, it's important for peace of mind.  It's the first thing I did when the kids were born. I said, You know what? Responsible. I have to get life insurance.  And I still have it, which probably I could stop now, but I think it was a very important thing to do.  We also have insurance on me for the company. We have what they call key man insurance.  Having life insurance through your job, which I always had, probably not enough. Maybe enough to buy a nice urn.  But that's about it. Most people need about 10 times more coverage than their job provides to properly provide for your families.  Now, I got to tell you, life insurance gets more expensive as you age. I'm glad I got it in my 30s.  You always want to get the policy sooner than later. Here's the way to do it.  I wish this had been around when I was getting my policy. Policy genius. It's not an insurer. It's an insurance marketplace.  Okay, so that's what you want. You want to make it easy to compare quotes from top companies, the big ones, AIG, Prudential.  But you want to do it in one place to find the lowest price on life insurance.  By comparing quotes with policy genius, you can save 50% or more on life insurance.  The market is very inefficient. And so the cost of life insurance for you could vary 50% even more.  You can go to policy genius, get a policy for say, let's say half a million dollars in coverage.  That's probably what you'd want to start with. As little as $17 a month. Isn't it your family worth that?  Click the link on the show page or go to policygenius.com slash twit. You can get personalized quotes in minutes.  No obligation, no cost. Find the right policy for your needs.  In order to advise you on this and help you with this, the people at policy genius have to be licensed agents.  That doesn't mean they're selling you their life insurance, but they have to be licensed agents to advise you.  They're working for you. They are not employees of insurance companies.  They're on hand for the whole process. So that you have somebody trusted, you can ask, well, what's this mean? What should I do?  They want you to understand your options so you can make decisions with confidence.  And they're not paid by the insurance companies. Policy genius does not add on extra fees.  They don't sell your info to third parties. I know we're all very sensitive about that these days.  Just check Google or Trustpilot and look at the reviews. Thousands of five star reviews. People use it. They love it.  You can get coverage in as little as a week. If you want, you can avoid unnecessary medical exams.  It depends, but you can go there and say that's one of the things I'm looking for.  Since 2014, Policy Genius has helped get this. Over 30 million people shop for insurance.  They've placed $150 billion in coverage with the biggest insurance companies, the best insurance companies.  They do, of course, have home, auto, disability, renters. They have all the insurance.  So anytime you need insurance, policygenius.com slash twit.  But I wanted to really emphasize the life insurance because that's something I think a lot of people forget about.  Go to policygenius.com slash twit. Get your free life insurance quotes. See how much you could save.  Thank you, Policy Genius, for supporting the show. We appreciate it.  And you support the show. And I always say this, but please take it seriously when you go to that special address,  because they're looking for that to see if you saw it here. Policygenius.com slash twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the invite has this the Alka Seltzer Apple.  I call it Plop Plop Fizz Fizz. Oh, what an iPhone it is.  The tag is far out, which means me think this is supposed to be space.  These are galaxies. Right. This is the Apple looks like stars and a galaxy.  Yeah. So that makes me think about the rumors from a couple of years ago  that the iPhone would have satellite connectivity,  which then leads me to the story you were referring to, because weirdly,  just this week, T-Mobile and SpaceX announced there would be satellite  connectivity for T-Mobile subscribers coming next year.

Start time: 3167.20

Start time: 3170.80
End time: 3181.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's an interesting question. Starlink. Starlink.  Now, I don't understand. They say you don't need anything special in your phone.

Start time: 3182.96
End time: 3196.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They said a piece of T-Mobile mid band, two and a half gigahertz spectrum  and a view, clear view of the sky is all you need  and that it will use the existing hardware that's already in your phone.  Well, a radium spectrum.

Start time: 3196.58
End time: 3205.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because that two and a half gigahertz spectrum has been like just kicking around for ages.  That's what they said.  That was the slightly lame spectrum that people had to give up for 5G.  I'm confused.

Start time: 3208.50
End time: 3220.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They said you'll be able to text, send images, and if there aren't that many people in your area,  you'll possibly be able to do video and specifically said works with existing cell phones.

Start time: 3220.60
End time: 3239.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I'm gathering and certainly the Apple solution is intended for areas where there's no coverage  but you need it to use an emergency. It's like a spot phone. Right?  But that didn't sound like what T-Mobile.

Start time: 3239.96
End time: 3253.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, the Apple one was exclusively an SOS communication was the rumor.  But the T-Mobile one is they said it'll be free for premium or mid range accounts.  Low cost accounts probably won't have it.

Start time: 3254.42
End time: 3258.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

End time: 3294.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is one of those things where it's like, it feels like,  I don't want to say like it's almost too localized to be an Apple event,  but it's like Europe doesn't have that problem.  Right? There aren't places in Europe really where you can go where you can't get good cell coverage.  Oh, come on. There are places in Transylvania where you cannot get cell coverage.  It feels like a very American thing. I have an alternative theory.

Start time: 3295.04
End time: 3299.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a breeze to me. I did not realize that only in America you lose cell phone coverage.

Start time: 3299.66
End time: 3322.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, anywhere in England, you're going to get decent 4G.  Interesting.  You know, that's what happens when you get Brexit.  You know, you just Brexit happens and you get the amazing coverage.  All right. Okay.  What about if it's a camera that has like a space mode?  Because everyone wants to take proper photos.  Oh, you're talking about the Apple.

Start time: 3323.48
End time: 3330.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You never get good ones.  Yeah, that was the other speculation is that these are astrophotography stars.

Start time: 3330.78
End time: 3342.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would be cool, right?  That would be something you might get off the web and that you could then make the illusion to.  Well, they're selling all these great, if you look at Celestron now, they're really amping on the iPhone.

Start time: 3342.52
End time: 3349.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is my Pixel 6, which has excellent astrophotography.  Yeah, there's a lot of them.  It came out a year ago. They've sold seven of those.

Start time: 3349.50
End time: 3352.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but I'm one of them.  But they're really that's very Apple though, isn't it?

Start time: 3355.68
End time: 3359.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And now for the first time's astrophotography on a phone.

Start time: 3359.94
End time: 3378.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, because those seven people that bought that phone don't count.  It's going to bring space photography to the mainstream.  Okay, we're going to make space photography accessible to people for the first time.  You can come up with all sorts of Apple blurb.  It'll be called, you know, face space, face space, and there'll be an open API for it for everyone else.  Thank God.

Start time: 3380.68
End time: 3400.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So is that the panel's, you know, consensus that this is, or just because it's the web decade now?  On MacBreak Weekly, we often say the designers at Apple are just laughing their ass off when they see all the speculation from media.  Well, this must mean satellite phones.  No, no, it's just a good picture.

Start time: 3402.15
End time: 3405.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe it's just a tie into Artemis. Maybe the timing's close to the launch. Who knows?

Start time: 3406.09
End time: 3414.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, or JWST.  That just looks like moon dust. That's kind of weird looking, isn't it?  It looks scruffy if it's supposed to be Artemis, but I do buy the web thing, maybe.

Start time: 3414.80
End time: 3425.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm looking at it, and it does look a little bit like James Webb Galaxy. See, there's some on the side there.  There's a diamond, you know, cat eye.  But then what's inside?

Start time: 3426.04
End time: 3428.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nothing. That's gravitational lensing, and that's the power.

Start time: 3429.79
End time: 3448.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, are they going to use gravitational lensing for the web?  For the web? They did for that first picture.  So they use it for the web, I know, but I mean on the iPhone.  Can you do that with your crummy little home telescope? That I doubt.  Okay, so you don't think this is the Alka-Seltzer Apple?  Because it could look like that. I mean, I could be that, too.

Start time: 3448.80
End time: 3455.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, after paying $800 for a new lid for this computer a month after it went out of warranty, an Alka-Seltzer Apple would have been appropriate.

Start time: 3455.48
End time: 3461.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So when you were up in the Arctic Circle, you had no phone service. You had to use satellite.

Start time: 3461.48
End time: 3471.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we had to actually use our GPS units.  And they had text capability.  But it's alphanumeric.  So it was like a trip back to 1991. So I was going...

Start time: 3472.50

Start time: 3482.10
End time: 3523.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It wasn't quite that bad, but they basically had a display on mine anyway.  Now, supposedly, get this, you can hook it up to your phone, right?  You can Bluetooth it to your phone.  Bluetooth it to your phone.  No, the GPS.  GPS, yeah.  The Garmin.  So you can then go in on your phone and use that keyboard.  So I brought up a Bluetooth keyboard so I could Bluetooth to my phone, which would then Bluetooth to the Garmin.  But unfortunately, I got up to the North Pole effectively and got ready to sign everything up or to get going because I had already signed it up when I was down here.  And it said, hey, I can't find the domain server.  The domain server?  Wait, why would you have to do that for something that's designed to operate out in the wild?  Domain server?

Start time: 3523.48
End time: 3526.11

Start time: 3526.58

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you called us, we heard from you every week, via Iridium, which is a satellite phone service.  Yeah.

Start time: 3532.48
End time: 3536.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How many of those are left?  I don't know.  Because our service was abysmal.

Start time: 3536.94
End time: 3542.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So when Iridium launched, it failed pretty, it was Motorola, I feel like.  I think so.

Start time: 3543.48
End time: 3548.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It failed pretty quickly.  And it was like a batch of 16 and then another 16.  There are 66 satellites.  66, OK.

Start time: 3549.58
End time: 3554.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they're geostationary, I think.  They're floating right above you at all times.

Start time: 3554.68
End time: 3569.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  But they still kind of bump along the horizon over the day.  Oh, so they're not geostationary.  So, well, so we had time of day issues.  Now, it could have been weather, but certainly, you know, standing outside under a clear blue sky, they would connect and disconnect and connect and disconnect.  Here's a bit of history.

Start time: 3569.60
End time: 3668.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Iridium communication service launched in 1998.  Becky, we know that year very well.  The first Iridium call was made by Vice President Al Gore to the great grandson of Alexander Graham Bell, Gilbert Groesner, who was the chairman of the National Geographic Society.  Motorola, yeah, provided the technology.  But I remember, yeah, nine months after the launch, they went into bankruptcy.  The handsets could not operate as promoted until the entire constellation of satellites was in place.  And that was going to cost so much money that they just folded, which, of course, means nobody bought.  It was one of those catch 22s.  It means nobody bought the phones, which means they couldn't do anything more.  Apparently, it was also fairly mismanaged.  But eventually, in fact, in 2000, Motorola said we're going to have to deorbit these.  We're going to have to bring them back.  Yeah, no, they remain in orbit and operational.  The government, the U.S.  government, as opposed to the Queen, stepped in to save Iridium by providing $72 million in exchange for a two-year contract.  I'm reading from Wikipedia and approving the fire sale of the company that erased $4 billion in debt.  It was restarted in 2001 by the new Iridium satellite LLC owned by a group of private investors.  So that's why you could use that.  They replaced the original constellation.  They sent 75 new satellites up on SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets.  Again, Elon Musk.  All roads lead to Elon.  I love this concept.

Start time: 3668.74
End time: 3706.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I really hope it succeeds and I hope Apple brings it into their technology.  This could save so many lives.  I think about all the people who are...  James Kim. Our dear, dear James Kim.  My first thought was James Kim, who got lost in the Oregon mountains, trapped in the snow.  Nobody could find him for 10 days and he died.  I just think about all the backcountry skiers, all the...  Anybody who's in nature, there's so many times where you're off the grid and off that coverage.  It's a little nerve-racking.  I'll say as a mom, I would want my kids to have that on their phones.

Start time: 3708.80
End time: 3719.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You spent a lot of time...  You're from Hawaii.  You spent a lot of time, I think, stand-up paddle boarding, I don't know, doing stuff in wilderness.  You probably would use this, yeah?

Start time: 3719.89
End time: 3742.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  And I fish a lot.  And so to be out, especially now with the fires...  Oh, yeah.  You could get...  I mean, the place I went fishing on the Tuolumne River this summer with my son,  and we went down this really tiny road, one way in, one way out.  A week later, the fire started in Yosemite, and we could have been trapped in there like that.

Start time: 3742.72
End time: 3744.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Easy. Yeah.

Start time: 3744.50
End time: 3760.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And so having that kind of access, it's funny because you think about it when I used to...  Before cell phones, you used to never think about this stuff, but now you just...  That access to help and first responders is a nice thing to have.  Really get used to it.

Start time: 3760.82
End time: 3781.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you bring up the point of two-way communication because you could get the warning that the fire's closing in on you,  whereas I was just thinking about it with the Garmin, well, I got an SOS button, that's all I need to do.  And somebody mentioned on the chat, by the way, Inmarsat, we had an Inmarsat box as well,  and it worked for about an hour a day.  Oh, wow.

So as Leo will know from one of my former jobs, as Leo likes to point out, when I worked at Conway Nast, working on GQ and Vogue and that kind of thing.  Men like big watches because it's the very few.  One of the very few things that we get to wear is jewelry.  We don't have any choices.  Women can wear earrings, necklaces, nose piercing rings, all that kind of thing.  Men basically have watches as the only thing that's socially acceptable to wear as decoration.

He's a startup guy and he's wearing, he's not wearing an Apple watch.  He's wearing a Movado, big old Movado.  I said, why aren't you wearing an Apple watch?  Is it because we don't have many chances for accessorizing and this is it?  Or if you're a physician, red noses, colorful ties and strange socks.  There aren't a lot of choices.  We all, we all wear a uniform.  Yeah.

You can live in Los Angeles, in West Los Angeles, no less, and drive a Prius and wear crummy jeans and a $500 t-shirt.  People, people will figure out how much money you make.  Yeah.

And I bought one just because it was on sale, it was on Prime Day, it was a Seiko Cordura or something.  Those are beautiful.  I think they're cool.  Yeah.  And I thought, well, I'll take that to the events where I have to, you know, try and build up my stubby stature.  And I cannot learn how to use the thing.  It took me an hour to figure out how to set the time zone.  Yeah.  It's got all this other stuff on it.  And then, oh, I'm in a different, I have to set the time, and I had to get out the instruction book to figure out how to use it.  And then the second hand doesn't, it just drives me bats.

Interesting thing about the invitation, it did say the Steve Jobs Theater.  So we were going to be in person, right?  Not only is it in person, it's going to be inside.  So the last thing Apple did, WWDC, they did it at the campus, but they did it outside.  There's lots of room outside there.  The invitation specifically says the Steve Jobs Theater.

I have kissed the ring.  You've kissed the ring.  No, I don't.  I don't care because somebody has to.  These things, in fact, more and more I'm thinking these are just big adverts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, there was a great article about how tech products are no longer announced.  They're dropped.  Yeah.  And the product drop is now an event just like an album launching.

She was saying, you know, I was sort of explaining what I was doing, what I was working on.  And she said, you know, nothing can ever just appear in a shop these days.  It has to be launched.  Everything has to have a launch.  I love her.  And my 98 year old grandmother grasped this idea of everything needs a launch.  And I think, you know, whatever Apple is going to do on September the 7th, it will well and truly be launched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It wasn't.  This one might be.  For my money, if I'm going to do something like that, I want to launch a whole bone.  That's creepy.  It's not cremated.  There's a reason.  So first of all, you get that 2001 moment of the bone drifting in space, as Stanley Kubrick did.  But then you aim it for reentry so my kid can come out and laugh and clap while my bone burns up and you can watch it.  I mean, that'd be much cooler than just the idea that, you know, dad's pinky ashes are in orbit.

So we're all, there's a little bit of Gene Roddenberry in all of us now.  And then through Celestis, Gene and Majel had some of their remains set up two more times.  So this is their fifth time.  In 2013, their ashes were joined by Scotty and a strand of hair from Arthur C. Clarke.  This time, this company launches DNA as well as ashes.  Yeah.

We sent it to the aliens.  They cloned it and sent it back.  Like, I don't know.  There seems like a story there.  I'll leave that open to you.  There is, by the way, a chance to join them.  You have to be dead first.  I was going to freeze my head.  Doesn't that get in the way of doing that whole thing?  No, because you could send a pinky.  Just freeze the head and send the rest.

Transcript:  For all the dozens of people that have done it since 2000 when we started.  This reminds me of this very cool service that was coming out of Japan about three years ago,  four years ago maybe.  Where they were launching...  I think it was before I came on your show.  They were launching little cans of tungsten ball bearings.  Coated in different chemicals.  So you could have a bespoke meteor shower.  So if you're having a wedding reception, it's outside, it's sunset, this thing's going overhead  at that exact moment, and it would have a little explosive charge that would blast all  these tungsten balls out, and they'd reenter in this big plume of different colors.  That's like special fireworks.  A little expensive.  Yeah.  A little questionable environmentally to some, but I thought it was a really cool idea.

Transcript:  If you want to go up, reservations close August 31st for the Enterprise flight,  which will be later this year, or as soon as ULA can get a space launch vehicle up and running.  And they will stream the memorial service and the launch live via webcast.  Payment plan is available.  Let's sign right up.  Let's take a little break.  Our show today brought to you by userway.org.  Userway.org.  I'm talking about making your website ADA compliant, accessible.  Not only is it the right thing to do, because you're opening up your website to a much larger group,  60 million plus people, you have a responsibility to make your site accessible.  It's a public entity, so you've got to make it accessible.  And with userway, it's easy.  That was my biggest concern was, oh, I can't afford it, or it's going to be too hard.  No, userway is really affordable, and it's really easy.  It's incredible. It's AI powered.  It tirelessly enforces all the accessibility guidelines, the WCAG, WCAG guidelines.  And I love this. So do our engineers.  It's one line of JavaScript. That's it.  Because userway is so good, it's used by more than a million websites, including the big guys,  Coca-Cola, Disney, eBay.  These are companies that really have to be accessible, and userway can do that.  As you get bigger, they scale with you.  If they can handle Disney, absolutely they can handle you.  They make best in class, enterprise level accessibility tools available to you,  your small or medium sized business.  And then as you scale, you need userway, and you're ready.  It just makes business sense.  Some of the biggest problems, nav menus. Very difficult.  So the way this works, if you're blind or you're using accessibility tools,  there is what they call an accessibility layer.  That's what the screen reader sees.  So really what userway does is make sure that all the information available to the front page,  to the sighted user, is available to the browser in the accessibility layer.  It changes colors.  Now you've got your Pantone color for your business.  Of course we do too.  It doesn't change that.  But it adjusts hue and luminance, so it's easier for people with vision issues to read.  So userway will generate alt tags.  That's one of the reasons it needs AI.  It can actually see the picture and generate an alt tag that matches the picture automatically.  You can go in if you want. You can modify it, of course.  It fixes violations like vague links, fixes broken links.  Make sure that your website uses accessible colors.  And you'll get a detailed report of all the violations that were fixed on your website,  so you know exactly what it did.  Plus you can work with it.  Userway integrates seamlessly with your site builder software.  Let userway help your business meet its compliance goals.  Improve the experience for your users.  Userway can make any website fully accessible, ADA compliant,  and everyone who visits can browse seamlessly, customize it to fit their needs.  It's a great way to show your brand's commitment to the millions of people with disabilities.  It's the right thing to do.  Userway can make any website fully accessible and ADA compliant.  In fact, if you want to see how it works, we've got it running on twit.tv.  Just look at the lower right corner.  With userway, everyone who visits your site can browse seamlessly,  customize it to fit their needs.  Great way to show your brand's commitment to millions of people with disabilities.

Transcript:  Hard to believe that it is already.  So one of the things Webb is looking at, by the way, we saw Jupiter, which was cool.  So they can look back at our solar system,  but they found the first exoplanet, non-solar system planet with carbon dioxide,  which is a big deal.

Start time: 4930.01
End time: 4939.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  Anyway, the James Webb gift that keeps on giving.  Oh, and will.  It's really great.  LastPass, which was for many years a sponsor of our shows,  it is one of the most used, if not the most used,  password manager out there, has admitted they were hacked.  Lawrence Abrams at the Bleebing Computer had this story two weeks ago.  He asked them, they didn't, they clammed up.  But finally, this week admitted that they were in fact hacked.  But to reassure you, if you use LastPass,  there's no evidence that customer data or password vaults were compromised.  The threat actors stole portions of the LastPass source code  and something LastPass calls proprietary LastPass technical information.  Hmm.

Transcript:  Well, it did force me to go check my security settings  and turn on two-factor authentication, which I hadn't done.  Oh, yes.  Change my password, which I hadn't done for a while.  And so if nothing else, it at least lit a fire under my butt,  because this one scared me.  Yeah, and I guess the worst-case scenario,

Start time: 5103.67
End time: 5142.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they don't have the passwords in clear.  The worst-case scenario would be, though, that they got the vaults,  which most people who use LastPass store on LastPass's servers,  and then could at their leisure attempt to brute force them.  So if you didn't have a good master password,  you might be vulnerable at that point.  Since we all put the keys to the kingdom in our password vaults,  I don't use LastPass anymore, but no matter what you use,  that's got everything in it.  It would behoove you to use, one, a good long password,  which is hard because you have to remember that one for your master password.  I'm sure, Becky, you did not use monkey123.

I'm not going to use a 28-character random password.  Nobody's got time to memorize that.  I take...  I don't want to be too explicit about what I'm doing  because I don't want you to reverse-engineer it.  But let's say you took...  Maybe you memorized...  Will, I know because you had a good public school education,  you have memorized many great poems.  Let's say you had a Lord Tennyson poem committed to memory.  Half a league, half a league, half a league onward,  the light brigade, right?  Yeah, so a great...  Is this maybe what you use for your Bitcoin locker?

Start time: 5200.20
End time: 5245.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, let me explain what I do before you do that.  So I wouldn't make my password half a league, half a league, half a league onward  all rolled into the valley of death.  I would make it H-A-L, H-A-L, H-A-L-O,  and maybe I would do uppercases on certain kinds of words.  Maybe I'd add punctuation.  And then, just to make it really good...  So that I can remember because I remember the poem  and I can reconstruct the beginning part.  I will add something else that I know.  For instance, what I like to use is my childhood telephone number,  which I memorized as a little kid,  but is not in a phone book anywhere anymore, I hope.  So by adding those seven or ten extra digits,  I think that's a pretty good password, not likely to be...

Start time: 5245.48
End time: 5296.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, so most security experts say that the best password is not a password,  but either a phrase or a mnemonic.  So a mnemonic is a great thing.  Yeah, that's what I'm using is a mnemonic.  Yeah, so let's take, for example, because I'm here,  William Shakespeare in Julius Caesar says,  The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves.  So you would have capital T-F-D-B-I-N-I-O-S,  or exclamation point, let's have a special character, B-I-O.  And that is absolutely uncrackable because nobody's going...  It's not a real word, but it's something that's easy to remember.  It's a selection of random things that's completely easy to remember.  And that's a great way of doing it.

California law requires a business or agency to notify any California resident whose unencrypted personal information was acquired.

End time: 5589.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have myself lost much money on cryptocurrency.

Start time: 5590.19
End time: 5771.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've heard of that, have you?  So the promise, you know, it all goes back to the first cryptocurrency, which was Bitcoin,  and the invention of something called a blockchain.  The easiest way to understand blockchain is it's a database.  But unlike a database that you're probably mostly familiar with,  where there's a central place for it, the blockchain is a distributed database.  Everybody can have a copy of it, which gives you some advantages.  It's harder to fake a transaction on the blockchain or any entry.  By the way, it doesn't have to be a transaction.  Any entry in that database.  In fact, one of the problems with blockchain is there's a lot of crap in there.  There's all sorts of stuff in there.  If, for instance, and I think it's thought to be the case,  there were some child pornography in the blockchain, you couldn't actually get rid of it.  It's preserved forever and it's distributed forever.  The current Bitcoin blockchain is huge, hundreds and hundreds of gigabytes.  So that's the central technology.  Cryptocurrency in general, in order to make that transaction,  you have to have something called a proof of work.  That's what the miners are doing.  I want to give Rod a Bitcoin. Congratulations, Rod.  The way I transact that is I use my Bitcoin wallet.  This doesn't require a third party. You don't need Binance or somebody to do this.  I can do this. I go to my wallet.  I have Rod's address. I send Rod this coin.  What will then happen is it will then be sent out to all the miners  and they all at once try to solve a difficult math problem,  a prime number factorization problem.  The first to solve it gets a reward, gets a percentage of that transaction,  and the transaction goes through.  When they solve it, they add it to the blockchain. It's now part of the blockchain.  The problem with that proof of work setup is it's very, very energy costly  because you have all these Bitcoin miners all racing to solve this problem.  When you solve it, it's a lot of energy.  It's designed to be an increasing amount of energy as the currency ages.  This has historically been a problem.  Currently, cryptocurrency transactions are using more power than some nations.  It's a massive amount of power. That's how proof of work works, and it's not ideal.  Early on, there was a cryptocurrency called Ethereum invented by a teenager of all things.  He proposed that Ethereum ultimately could use something called proof of stake.  This is back in 2014.  Instead of proof of work, proof of stake just assigns one miner the job.  It doesn't use nearly as much energy.

Start time: 5773.59
End time: 5793.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I like this description.  In proof of stake systems, computers don't burn energy racing to verify transactions.  Instead, crypto investors deposit a certain number of digital coins in a shared pool,  and that enters them in a lottery.  The winner of the lottery is the one who gets to verify the transaction and wins the reward.

Start time: 5796.66
End time: 5806.40

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's right, but that's what you would get anyway.

Start time: 5808.48
End time: 5905.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The difference is only one person is trying to do that instead of everybody trying to do that.  They say that will cut the use of energy by 99%.  This has been something that Ethereum has been promising for years.  It's finally, we think, going to happen on September 15.  That's called the merge, where Ethereum changes the fundamental transaction backbone for all Ethereum coins.  Now, as you might imagine, A, this is technologically incredibly complicated and error prone.  B, there are a large number of people who do not want this to happen because they make money as crypto miners.  So they're not happy about this.  In fact, the merge will probably also be simultaneous with a fork,  where some number of Ethereum users change to a proof-of-work form of Ethereum.  That's probably going to happen as well.  The article that you just read from Becky, a very, very good piece,  unusually good piece from the New York Times about the merge written by David Yaffe Bellany,  very, very detailed, talks about the whole thing.  I've been wanting to talk about this for some time because it's just a few weeks off.  It could be crazy. It's probably a good thing.  Plenty of other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, will continue to use proof-of-work,  so it's not going to single-handedly solve the energy problem.

End time: 5952.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, because the way these things work, as more coins are generated,  as more transactions happen, the difficulty of doing it goes up, which means they use more power.  So nobody at this point who's trying to make money Bitcoin mining is doing it off the normal grid  because you won't make money. Electricity costs too much.  So for a long time, all the Bitcoin miners were on hydroelectric dams in China  and other places where the cost of electricity was effectively zero.  China shut that down, by the way. That was a big blip.  One of the reasons Bitcoin dropped so dramatically a couple of years ago.  So have I described this accurately? Anybody want to?

End time: 6072.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there are so many problems with cryptocurrency, including the cost of the transaction and the amount of time.  Ethereum gas fees, the cost of those transactions, are wildly unpredictable, often are more than the transaction.  So if I gave you a hundredth of an ETH and it cost me $200 to give it to you, that would be a net loss overall.  And we've seen this with NFTs where it's actually could be a money loser or trying to get your money back.  There's all sorts of problems with this. Remember with the DAO, one of the big DAOs didn't go through.  They were going to buy the Constitution and they failed.  But then the cost of getting your money out of that Constitution DAO was higher than the amount of money you would get back because of gas fees.  So this is a big problem. There are lots of problems with cryptocurrency.  El Salvador, which left the American dollar as its currency and went to Bitcoin a year ago, is in deep financial doodoo because they can't pay any bills anymore.

Start time: 6074.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Furthermore, you don't know how long it's going to take.  And unless, and this is the weird thing, Bitcoin, if you pay enough, you can choose how much you're going to pay for the transaction.  The more you pay, the more miners will work on it, the more likely it will go through.  But if you say, no, I want the minimum, it may be days before the trend, weeks before the transaction goes through.  All of this unpredictability is not, in my opinion, good for a monetary system.  It's terrible.

And so if you're thinking that you're going to have automatic transactions, automated transactions that are done through the blockchain, but you don't know how much that transaction fee is going to be,  that seems like a fundamental problem with the concept.

Transcript:  Although Becky, I think the larger problem with smart contracts and the kind of thing you're talking about there is that when we talk about, you know, people stealing things off the blockchain,  people stealing other people's NFTs, the kind of fraud that goes on with DAOs, you know, it's really reasonable to argue that if the smart contract is law, right, the smart contract is what governs what can and cannot be done.  And so if the smart contract allows it and you fraudulently exploited it, then that's technically sort of legal by the smart contract.  Right. So the bigger problem with smart contracts is that if you exploit them, then any exploitation is legal because the code is law.  Right.

And as you're scrolling through it, by the way, look in the lower right hand corner, because that shows you how much the losses are right now.  You know, as I go, it gets higher and higher and higher.  It is, it is, I'm stunned that people still think this is a good idea, that they think Web3 is a good idea, that they think NFT is a good idea, that they think blockchain is a good idea.  It is a technology that has some use, it is a distributed database.  Yeah, it's not changing the world.  And all it's really doing is relieving people of their money.  So is that number in the lower right?

Start time: 6250.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So Benedict Evans writes really well on this on Twitter, which is he says, you know, the really interesting prospect, which is that, you know, the whole point of Web3, if you think about it from the sort of point of view of the evangelizers is it's distributed, it's away from the banking system.  You know, the community writes the rules, the consumer is the, you know, is the owner.  All those things are really important.  On the other hand, if something goes wrong, then by design, there is no one to complain to.  Right.  And if you have your things stolen, or if you have your account hacked, then there is no one to go to because specifically you own it, it was your fault.  And the idea that, you know, to make Web3 and those kind of things useful to the general public, like if you want to make Web3 cryptocurrency, Ethereum, Merge, whatever, useful to the general public, you have to have some degree of centralization.  You have to have someone to complain to when something goes wrong.  But that defeats the entire purpose of the Web3 experiment, which is to decentralize everything.  Right.  So it's really going back to an era of like, you know, you break it, you bought it, you screw it up, you lose your money, and there's nobody to complain to.

End time: 6361.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And of course, the people who have invested heavily in all of this require that somebody come along and give them real dollars for their investment.  So there's a lot of fraud going on.  There's a lot of cheerleading going on because people can't let this pyramid scheme collapse.  And that's, in my opinion, what it is.  So it was a bad idea to begin with.  Good news, Ethereum won't burn the planet up anymore, maybe.  But it's, you know, it's not, I think in the long run, this is not a good idea.

And we're not falling for it because the only people making money, I suspect, are the brokers.  But do you think this whole NFT is based on kind of spurious creative works thing is?  Well, I think it started because there were a lot of Bitcoin bros who needed to launder their money.

Transcript:  I'm sure they know how to do that.  So people are approaching you about this are the ones who would stand to make money.  Yeah.  And also, I wouldn't want to, you know, we've often thought about doing that ourselves.  I wouldn't want to capitalize on our audience taking their money.  If they buy it, a lot of people buy NFTs just want to support the artist.  That's great. You could just donate instead.  That's a patriot's for it, right?  Yeah. But if I think a lot of people buy NFTs buy it as a speculative vehicle,  as a security that they're going to sell back at some point and make money on.  And that's something that bothers me.  We are really close to the SEC saying that these are securities.  And that's that is always what they've been right.

Start time: 6470.92
End time: 6503.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if they are, then the SEC regulates it.  There are many who are true believers in crypto who say, yes, we need that.  We need some regulation. We need we need to understand what the rules are, at least so we can go forward.  But there are many who fear that as well.  And regulation usually means taxation. Some people don't like that idea.  The whole idea of some of this is an anonymity. Right.  But as we've learned again and again, you're not really anonymous.  In fact, I yeah, ever. Yeah, maybe. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this was based on the notion that the the explorers polar explorers of the heroic era all took along their battle flags.  Right. So Shackleton had his family crest and Robert Scott, who was not a very good leader,  because he trudged his men into death and oblivion, had his family crest and then they'd have a larger.  So that what you're seeing, there's a picture of Pascal who runs the place and owns it.  Putting up a flag, which I had made for him of the first long Shackleton expedition.  It was 1907 to try and reach the South Pole.  And that shackles his family crest on kind of a standard. That's cool.  Bearing background or something. And I thought, well, we should have something like that.  So I there was one on the whole Internet.  There was one image of that Shackleton flag for the original thing.  So I had a graphic artist redo it for me. And then I thought, well, I want to have something for me.  So I decided to have the Martian war machines taking out the planet Earth with Mars rising in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Zip, none, zero.  Is that your idea or ABC's idea?  A little bit of both.  I'm much more in the everyday practical news.  You can use consumer.  So, you know, I'm really interested in Venmo.  I'm, you know, the cash app story this week is crazy to me that, you know, you're seeing people having their accounts drained.  And those are the kind of stories that really catch my attention, the ones that are much more in the hands of the everyday user.  And it makes me super nervous to talk about crypto at the broad, broad broadcasting levels in terms of try this.

Start time: 6686.02
End time: 6722.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is actually we've been kind of getting into this on the radio show.  Because there's a well known radio guy, finance guy who says don't use Venmo cash app and really don't use Zelle.  They're dangerous.  And and I'm saying, well, I use them all the time.  They're they're no more dangerous than your bank or cash.  But their point is, and I guess this is true, probably even you're reporting your audience.  People don't understand that they're tied directly to your bank account.

Start time: 6722.50
End time: 6727.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But as you know, if I gave if I took 100 bucks out of the bank and gave it to you, it's not the bank's responsibility to make it good.  You know, if I get scammed that way, it's not.  So people somehow think that if you use Zelle or cash app or Venmo and get scammed, it's the responsibility of the bank.

Start time: 6745.36

No, because she'd heard this.  I said, no, it's fine.  But it's like cash.  If don't give it to somebody you don't know, I might have to.  Well, the hacks are different.  The hacks are different.  We'll actually want to talk about the hacks in a second.  But separate from the hacks, which are an issue, just be careful because it's like cash and you're not going to get made whole if you give it to somebody.

So you really have to treat it.  And so...  And she's a smart person.  So that really opened my eyes as to how easy it is to say, oh, I need to send this person money.  I've got...  They said Zelle, no problem.  I've been using this to send money to our kids.  I'll just send them that money.  And that's it.  It's gone.

Start time: 6934.48
End time: 6973.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Same issue?  Venmo is PayPal.  So it's the same thing.  And I think the only reason credit cards back up your stupidity is because no one would have used them in the early days.  And so they kind of got in the habit of it.  I wish we'd made Zelle and cash to app and all that do the same, but we didn't.  Apple Pay is the same.  Anything you're sending money from your bank account, you're at risk.  Now, the hacks are a big problem.  Because if I do hack your account, I got it all.  I got everything that's in your bank account.  And again, with no recourse.  So you need to use good passwords, all the same things you always do.

Start time: 6973.96
End time: 7049.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So after this cash app story came up, basically the story was that multiple people are reporting on social,  that their accounts have been drained when they haven't made any payments to anyone.  And there are reports of passwords, of user account names and information associated with the accounts being listed on the dark web,  with some people saying that may or may not be good data, other people saying, yeah, I got a lot of money out of this.  Reviewers on the dark web, right.  But what's interesting is I signed up for the cash app this morning and you don't put a password in.  It uses your email or your phone number.  But the security by default is pretty lean.  There's no pin number turned on.  You have to go into the settings and turn the pin number on.  And there's no authenticator turned on by default.  So I can think of a bunch of scams like the Google Voice scams.  I don't know if you've heard about those where people can basically get access to your phone number and therefore take over your two-factor authentication,  where this could be a real problem.  And this is the kind of stuff that makes me very nervous.  And then I end up reporting on a lot.

Start time: 7049.50
End time: 7076.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As you should.  And I have to say, I have amended my recommendations.  It's not that they're inherently unsafe, although the cash app does sound like it's inherently unsafe.  But the risk is so much higher because it's tied to your bank account.  And because there's no recourse, that it's probably best not to use these, I guess, right?  It doesn't sound like you should use cash.  I use cash app all the time.  That's Jack Dorsey's company.  That's blog.  It is.

Start time: 7077.48
End time: 7091.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just wouldn't assume that it's secure by default.  And that's a lot to ask for the average consumer.  That would be my request, is that there was a lot more default security, two-factor authentication, and beyond, and a PIN number to actually access this thing.

Start time: 7091.86
End time: 7097.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It should have all of those secure things.  But then it's harder to use, right?  And they want you to use it.

Start time: 7097.58
End time: 7101.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what's the big picture solution to this other than DNA sampling or something?

Start time: 7102.18
End time: 7149.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is actually, this is such a fundamental thing in technology is the idea of authentication.  How do you, even prior to technology, how do you prove you are who you are?  That's why we have passwords.  That's why we have PINs.  We have all these things.  And I think that there are going to be better ways to do this.  This FIDO2 passkey solution that we've been talking about that Microsoft, Google, and Apple now are actively supporting.  I think that's going to be an improvement over passwords.  The problem is there's always a tradeoff, or it seems like almost always a tradeoff between security and convenience.  And most companies who are trying to do business with you are going to err on the side of convenience because they want you to do business.  So I think that's part of the problem.  I'm sure Cash App knows how to make itself 100% secure, but they fear it will be too hard to use.

Start time: 7150.56
End time: 7184.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I also think some of the big players will absorb cash transfers into their ecosystems because their authentication is more robust in their devices.  So take Apple, for example.  If I'm going to text money to my kids, I have to use facial recognition to text it from my phone to theirs.  But they've got a password on the phone.  So do I.  And you have to double up with some sort of PIN or facial recognition to send the money.  So that's built into the ecosystem.  And I can see that being a strong case for security by device security built in on.  That's like a three factor.

Start time: 7184.88
End time: 7198.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what PassKey is all about is that your device, because it's using biometrics fingerprint or face, is really can somewhat be trusted to be a proof that you are who you say you are, as long as you're using those biometrics.

Start time: 7199.42
End time: 7202.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Anyway, how is the definition of security versus convenience?  Yes, exactly.

Start time: 7204.48
End time: 7213.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it is more convenient.  It is more convenient if you're using touch ID or face ID on a device.  That's pretty convenient.  That's not a password.  So that's why.

Start time: 7214.48
End time: 7233.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And think about something like Mint, which is tied to all my accounts.  And that has not only is it on my device and I have to use facial recognition to open it up.  But then when I open the app itself, it acts for a secondary facial check.  Right.  So that makes a lot of sense to me.  It doesn't help on the web, but in terms of on my browser or my computer.  But I think there's a lot to be said for that.

Start time: 7234.26
End time: 7245.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what Paschis does, though, because now when you're on your computer on a site, it'll say, OK, open your phone, log in.  And so it is tying that device with biometrics to websites.

Transcript:  Do you guys have two factor authentication for just general credit card transactions on the web?  Because that's one thing that's become increasingly normalized over here, which is you can be on Amazon.  You can be on any old website in the world.  You put your credit card details in and it will insist on texting you a six digit code.  No, we don't do that here.

Somebody once joked that the surefire way to create a billion dollar American startup is to take European or British bank technology from 10 years ago.  Bring it to America.  It is so poor.  So one of the things that we do over here is if you use your card anywhere that you haven't used it in the last two or three days online, it will 100% ask you to put in your phone number.  And if it's the phone number that they have matched on your account at your credit card thing, they will send you a text message with a six digit code.  And you've got to put your six digit code into the web app or the iPhone app or whatever it is you're using in order to authenticate the transaction.  So to FAA has just become like almost absolutely standard for credit card transactions over here.  Yeah.

Transcript:  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  They shouldn't allow me on live anything, right?  It's just a mistake.  HBO said 10 million viewers watched the episode.  That is a very big number.  In fact, the biggest start for a series in HBO history.  When we talked about it last week, there was some concern that people,  because of the kind of the bitter taste from the end of Game of Thrones,  people wouldn't watch this.  Like, I'm done with that series.  Apparently not.  In fact, it did so well, they immediately greenlit it for a second season.  And I didn't know this, but HBO has five other spin-offs in development.  Wow.

Start time: 7857.56
End time: 7923.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No.  It's quite good.  I would say the best one is a chap that you surely know,  a chap called Dave Chen who has a website called Decoding TV  where he does breakdowns of all of this stuff.  And one of the things they talk about is the main sort of princess in it  gives a little minor lore dump in the middle of the episode  about a queen called Nymeria who sails to Dorne  and then burns all her ships off the coast of Dorne  in order to say that she's...  You know, their people are running no longer,  that we're going to burn the ships because we're staying here come hell or high water.  And the story of Nymeria the queen is one of the other spin-offs that is in development at HBO.  And of course Nymeria, as a strong woman, was the name of Arya Stark's wolf, Direwolf.  Nymeria!  In the first series of Game of Thrones.  You're right.  I knew I knew that name.  It's almost like there's a little plan.

Transcript:  Also, sorry, what are the rules of that joust?  At what point do you club the guy's head in versus just go, oh, I use...  Sometimes you go, no.  That's my bad.  Yeah, right.  Oh, my bad, I'm not up for it.  I didn't really feel like the guy who got his head clubbed in really had the chance to yield.

Start time: 7946.48
End time: 7978.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He didn't get a fair chance to yield.  No, he immediately...  But at the end of it, when it's over, the knight who won takes his helmet off.  And there's this moment where the two princesses look at each other meaningfully and say, oh, he's Dornish.  And I thought, oh crap, what does that mean?  I've got to watch all eight seasons of...  I can't remember, Dornish, what does that mean?  So I'm sure there's some stuff...  Listen to the recap.  I have to listen to the recap.  The reason I bring this up...  I just have a little bit of...  Go ahead.

Start time: 7979.51
End time: 8000.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was just doing the math on how much this thing costs.  Yes, that's the reason I bring it up.  So 20 million an episode for...  What is this thing called?  House of the Dragon?  House of the Dragon, yeah.  What is it called?  Now, that sounds like a lot, right?  But get this, 30 million an episode for Stranger Things.  And 40 million an episode for The Lord of the Rings prequel.

Start time: 8001.02
End time: 8024.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Get ready, because that's coming next week.  And this is the real battle.  It's Amazon and streaming versus Warner Brothers  and traditional filmmaking, television, HBO.  I mean, admittedly, HBO is now as much a streamer  as they are a cable channel.  But really, that's the battle.  Because Amazon essentially has unlimited funds.  They don't have to make the money back in the streaming.

Start time: 8024.94
End time: 8027.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is this a loss leader for them?  I think it can be, yes.

Start time: 8027.48
End time: 8054.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, so the way that someone explained it to me,  which I thought was like a really good analogy  and maybe will resonate with your American audience,  is the Lakers, the Los Angeles Lakers in NBA,  like the premium NBA franchise.  Like everybody wants to work for the Lakers.  But the bus family that owns the Lakers,  that's their business.  Right.  So they have to make good business decisions for the Lakers.

Start time: 8054.48
End time: 8059.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you going to compare this to the mighty ducks?  No, no, no, no.

Start time: 8059.48
End time: 8100.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What we're going to go with is that's HBO.  So HBO has to make sensible decisions and good money.  Because they're like the Lakers.  They're like the bus family.  Because that's their business.  It's their own money.  Yes.  Whereas Amazon, Amazon ironically is the Steve Ballmer.  Steve Ballmer owns the Los Angeles Clippers  and could just spend however much money he wants  because the Clippers aren't his money.  That's like the side hustle.  The Clippers are the side hobby.  For Amazon, Prime Video and the Lord of the Rings is just like,  a few hundred million there, a few hundred million here.  That's not going to impact on the core business.  And it's the difference between operating a streamer  as your core business or a streamer as your little side hustle.

Start time: 8101.04
End time: 8126.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would actually compare it to the Anaheim Ducks.  Which is the LA Lakers and the Anaheim Ducks.  The Ducks are owned by Disney,  which made a movie called The Mighty Ducks.  They make money off of the merchandising, the branding.  They don't have to make money off the hockey team.  So it's like that though. You're right.  They don't have to make money off the Prime.

Transcript:  No one in England has ever heard of the Anaheim Ducks.  So I don't blame you.

Start time: 8134.45
End time: 8151.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Also the other thing is that the Amazon Play,  the difference is they can end Disney with the Mighty Ducks,  is the cross promotion that can exist between their properties.  So not only is it, it can be a loss leader for other things,  but they can use it to cross promote other things that are more profitable.

Transcript:  Whereas HBO can't really have Matt Smith in House of the Dragon  sort of catching up on an episode of Sex and the City.  Wow, now we've really gone too far afield for me.

Transcript:  At some point do these serializations or spin-offs from Game of Thrones  start becoming like the whole Law and Order thing?  Game of Thrones special victims unit?  Yeah, right. As awful as that gets.  If you're looking at a third or fourth tier spin-off,  and I'm just thinking of this because of my time with Star Trek  and watching that whole thing fracture into the weirdness that it has,  what do the budget limits become then?  Because I mean you hear these numbers for Stranger Things.  I heard that number I think when I was working on Trek.  A big show for us was like a million one.  Oh yeah.  That was expensive.

Start time: 8201.79
End time: 8202.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  40 million an episode.

Start time: 8202.80
End time: 8232.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. But it looks like a movie, so part of my brain is saying,  well that kind of makes sense because when you're producing  you have a money meter running in the back of your mind all the time.  Part of that makes sense for the kind of visuals they're getting,  but you've got to commit to making what would be a whole franchise of movies  in one season, what's the average? 8 to 10?  Yes.  That's what most of these are.  And then you start doing these spins,  well can the fifth or sixth tier spin-off from Game of Thrones  Game of Thrones, NCIS have the same budget as the first one?

Start time: 8233.38
End time: 8261.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In order to acquire all of these, AT&T took on $50 billion in debt.  So HBO, Warner is deep in debt.  Maybe they should buy Yahoo.  That would be a good idea.  Yeah, right. Huge debt.  So they don't have a lot of runway.  They've canceled a bunch of shows.  They canceled Batgirl, a $90 million investment  because they could write it off on their taxes.  Sorry, what?  Batgirl? Oh, you have been away.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Wait, what?  They did another one of those things?  You're gone a month, they shot a movie for $90 million and then canceled it.  Batgirl, you probably don't know about Scoob, the Christmas show either.  But I think that that's what you're seeing now is big, big money.  And Netflix even, which is still the king of streamers,  8% of all streams are Netflix streams, is running against headwinds.  Their stuff is very expensive.

Start time: 8291.66
End time: 8344.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And what you're seeing is the, if you look at the news today,  which is the increasing streamerization of cinema,  which is the big hot Marvel property that everyone's wondering what's going to happen to is Fantastic Four.  And we heard the news, I think this morning or yesterday,  that Matt Shackman, who helmed one division for Disney,  is going to be the person in charge of Fantastic Four.  And a lot of the film Twitter commentary was,  well, I guess we're not hiring film directors to make films anymore.  We're TV-izing film, right?  Which is effectively what Disney has done.  If you look at the Star Wars series, the Marvel series,  which are all shot in the volume,  it's the TV-ization, the streaming-ization of cinema.

Transcript:  Well, this is the hypothesis that we're at peak TV, right?  That because of COVID, because of streaming,  because of multi-tiered pricing options,  that peak TV is now.  And whether this can last or not is the question.  And we're seeing that with the financial troubles being experienced by the likes of Netflix and others.  So, you know, is this the peak of peak TV?  Maybe.

Transcript:  This is the article from the Financial Times,  which is hidden behind a very expensive paywall.  In fact, the guy who coined the term peak TV,  John Landgraf, has been predicting it since 2016.  But he said this year.  Well, if you predict it every year, you're going to be right one year, right?  He said this year, it really is the peak of the peak TV era.  He is chair of Disney's FX Network,  Amazon Prime, Lord of the Rings, $465 million budget.  They could make Top Gun Maverick three times over.  House of Dragons, The Dragon, $200 million for 10 episodes.  Disney Plus has Star Wars Andor.  She-Hulk, attorney at law, which is probably the best name of any of them.

Transcript:  It's kind of like what happened with cable TV where, I mean, we all remember because we're older,  the cable was originally you sent it out to the hinterlands for people who couldn't get real television.  And then it became this thing with all this cool programming and you paid for it so you wouldn't have ads.  And then suddenly it was filled with ads just like everything else.  And I feel like we're being hit with that again.

Transcript:  If you remember network television from the day and again, thinking back on track episodes,  you had four or five ad breaks depending on what era it was.  They were programmed in, they were written into the script.  So at the end of each act, you did the close up of the I know you don't best thing in the world.  Staring off camera.  But now they just drop the ads in with a battle ad.

Start time: 8516.16
End time: 8526.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But Leo, that's how we experience so much TV over here growing up.  You now realize how unnatural that was.  Watching Star Trek The Next Generation on BBC.  And you would get the moment where Picard is suddenly sort of looking into the distance very meaningfully.  And you think, oh good, what's about to happen?  And you'd get a fade to black and then a fade back in again.  And now we know.  It was only, you know, as a nine year old watching Star Trek, you have no idea why that was the case.

Start time: 8558.37

Transcript:  Brits have a very different relationship to advertising.  When we do our ads, I always hear from people who listen in the UK saying, wait a minute, you're the host of the show and you're doing the ad?  Like that's like apparently verboten in, well that's probably not the right word to use.  They have this thing in the UK called media ethics.  You're sort of in the right geographical area.

End time: 8594.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  You know, you were a few thousand miles.  Bad rugby.  Yeah, it's very strange because we have a very weird relationship to the BBC, which obviously is not ad supported.  But which therefore kind of skews our thoughts on advertising.

Transcript:  We were talking about that in the Twit forums at Twit.com community because Big D lives in Germany where there's a very robust public television.  People still watch broadcast TV there because of it.  Here in the US, public television has been eviscerated and runs everything but commercials.  And yeah, constant pledge breaks.  But the good news is there's such a diversity in a rich ecosystem of streaming stuff when you throw YouTube in, which is streaming, that there's I don't think we need public TV.

You know, one of the films that I was really keen to watch in the last few weeks has been Prey.  Yeah, what a good movie.  It's a prequel directed by his friend of the show, friend of the show Dan Trachtenberg, right?  Yeah.  Which is a Hulu streaming original.  And then you go, oh, Hulu doesn't exist outside of the United States.  In the United States, it's a Disney Plus original.  In the United Kingdom, it's a Disney Plus original.  And you realize how much of the sort of conversation is based on one market being the US.  And we talk about the sort of the cable infrastructure and the advertising infrastructure.  Actually, you know, that is just one market.  And actually, the rest of the world doesn't operate in quite the same way.  We don't even know.

Transcript:  No. So it's an incredible story.  It was a Fox picture, which was due to go to cinemas, theaters, as you would say.  Oh, you mean movie palaces? Yeah.  Movie palaces.  And then when Disney bought Fox, Fox had a deal whereby anything that went to theaters would then first streaming rights go to Netflix.  Right. And so rather than put it in theaters and have the streaming rights go to Netflix, they chose to stream it on Hulu as first run.

Transcript:  Hey, you know, Rod, I want to circle back to your question about all these derivative works and how all these prequels and sequels and everything like that.  And how can we they continue to monetize these?  And one interesting thing that I actually learned in grad school was when Blue's Clues, the kids show first came out.  Great show.  Yeah, they they only had enough money on PBS to make one episode a week.  But the time slot was for five episodes a week.  And they decided, OK, we're just going to air it and know that on Monday we're going to get the big ratings and then the kids will turn in tune in on Tuesday and realize, oh, I've already seen this one.  And the ratings will gradually go down as the week progresses.  The exact opposite happened.  The kids watched on Monday.  They tuned in on Tuesday and said, oh, I know this.  Watched it.  And then they wanted to come back again on Wednesday because they wanted something predictable, something they knew the template of.  Right.  The world was so chaotic and they could predict how the storyline was going to end.  So actually Friday had the highest ratings.  And I kind of have this hypothesis that in the world we live in now, it's really nice to watch a show that's kind of new.  But you basically know what's going to happen.  There's a bunch of that.

Start time: 8912.62

Transcript:  That's really taking notes of what she just said.  So what I want to know, and this is stepping back a bit, but anybody here a Top Gear fan, the original BBC show?  How did that become the most watched, highest grossing film in the show in the English language for a decade?  It's three fat middle aged guys blowing up cars.  I mean, I want to know that secret.  I'm past middle aged, but I mean, it sounds really like a great idea.  Different ingredients.  I love it, but I still don't understand.  It's the same show over and over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  So there are, I mean, there are not to take this show on too much of a rat hole.  But there are, yeah, there are two answers, which is one, every middle aged man wishes they could hang out with all those.  They all want to be German.  We all want to be German.  Exactly.  You don't want to be that person, but you want to be able to hang out with those people.  And two is the familiarity of it's a show every week that's not about cars.  It's about friendship.  And to Becky's point, one of the hot shows right now that I am absolutely obsessed with, which a lot of my dad friends have glued me into is Bluey.  Which if you haven't watched Bluey, holy smokes, it is one of the greatest shows on television.  It's Australian.  It's a cartoon.  It's about a little family of two parents and two kids.  And every show is seven to nine minutes.  And you will learn something.  You will laugh.  You will cry.  It will.  Whether or not you have kids, it doesn't matter.  It's got that wonderful sort of aesthetic of kids watching it will get the very textual text and the parents watching it will get the super text and subtext.

Transcript:  It's the Top Gear of Tech.  One of the ways we bring this show to you ever since day one when we started shooting  video was with our new tech TriCaster 2 Elite, the most complete live production system on  the planet.  And what an empowering technology for us as podcasters.  When we first started video, I said, well, how am I going to switch it?  What am I going to do?  When we were at Tech TV, Becky, we had two million dollar control rooms with grass valley  trees and we had very, very expensive cameras and all that.  The TriCaster 2 Elite, any TriCaster product has allowed me to do with twit for a fraction  of the cost.  Better than Tech TV ever did.  It's actually more than just a live video production system.  It's an all encompassing digital media solution that lets us create content and you create  content for the internet, for mobile.  Yeah, even TV now uses new tech.  Late in 2001, NewTek unleashed an updated version of the TriCaster 2 Elite with lots  of new features.  The live call connect feature, which means you can call in.  We're going to actually, I think maybe that's what we need to do.  We're going to launch a new fall show in January with call ins and I think that might be the  solution.  It now supports Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and FaceTime as inputs to any production.  Selectable audio and video returns enabled the TriCaster 2 Elite operators to view an  audio return like any other output, which means it's so much more flexible.  Benito is the king of the TriCaster, right?  Benito, you understand all this stuff.  It's a mystery to me, but our technical directors love it.  The all new Neural Voice Isolation Tool, which cleans audio, uses AI to cancel or reduce  background noise, automatically detects voices and says the rest of it, throw it out.  Audio is so important to video.  And you know, I love it that the folks at NewTek understand that.  You get increased power, flexibility and simplicity.  We use the macros like crazy.  Now they support variables, which is really kind of cool.  It's like becoming a programming system.  The system offers dynamic and powerful tools to allow operators to nest macros to deliver  complex productions more easily.  You could encode up to three channels all at the same time.  They've got the live panel builder now in the TriCaster, meaning users can create bespoke  user interfaces, customize the presets within the user interface, making your distributed  workflows simpler, more cohesive without compromising on quality.  The NDI GenLock 2, by the way, really is important.  And that's a new feature in the TriCaster 2 Elite, which allows you to match outputs  to a common sync pulse.  Perfect for remote workflows, operators can now send alpha channel through one of the  mix outs.  I mean, I can go on and on.  It is really an impressive tool.  Operators could see the resolution and frame rate of every video source coming into the  TriCaster so you know exactly, before you put it on the air, what you're going to get.  Since its arrival in 2020, TriCaster 2 Elite has offered incredibly powerful live production  systems to people in every area of video.  I know so many churches and schools, broadcasters who use TriCaster.  It's transformative.  The TriCaster 1 Pro, also an excellent choice for producers, content creators, and publishers.  It has live call connect support for 4K UHD streaming, live streaming.  It's kind of amazing what we can do these days.  There's a whole TriCaster family.  The best thing to do, visit the website, go.newtech.com slash twit dash TV.  Where you'll find an easy to use interactive guide that offers advice on which TriCaster  is right for you.  That's what got us started many years ago and it's what keeps us on the air every single  day.  G-O dot new tech, N-E-W-T-E-K dot com slash twit dash TV.  A real tip of the hat to NewTek for that technology.  It's been so important for us.  Thank you, NewTek.  We appreciate it.  We were shooting Becky and Estee, right?  I mean that wasn't high def even though we were doing tech TV.  Four by three.

Show of hands?  No.  You missed it.  You were in the Arctic.  Was it great?  I don't know.  I didn't listen to it either.  I have to go with the summaries published by some of the tech reporters who were willing to sit through three hours of it.  Among other things, Mark said owning being in charge of Metta means that he is the CEO of the company.  It means that he wakes up every morning.  It's like being punched in the stomach.

Start time: 9608.36

Transcript:  The whole interview is basically that classic Zuckerberg thing of saying lots without saying anything at all.  If you read the – I'm going to be unashamedly British here and pick the BBC summary of the interview.  Good idea.  Zuckerberg said that getting the decision wrong, quote, sucks.  When we take something down that we're not supposed to, that's the worst.  This was something that –  Oh, wow.  What an incredible insight.  Thank you, Mark.  He says, depending on what side of the political spectrum you're on, you either think we didn't censor it enough or we censored it way too much.  I mean, wow.  Both are right.  Both are accurate.  The insight.  These are the highlights, too.

They said, we didn't block it, but we lowered the temperature on it.  And there was some – he mentioned that the FBI had contacted him.  The FBI later clarified.  They said, we are not allowed to and we did not say to him, take down this story.  In fact, we didn't even mention the Hunter Biden laptop story.  We mentioned that there is misinformation from foreign actors showing up.  And you might want to do something about that.  We can't tell you what to do.  You might want to do something about that.

Transcript:  Also, he talks about – and I just love this because the irony of when you go back to the origins of Facebook is incredible.  He talks about how it's difficult to deal with sort of thorny issues around personal lives.  And he says, I didn't get into this to basically judge these things.  And you're like, didn't you get into this entirely to just judge women based on their appearance in Harvard?  Wasn't that the entire point?  You literally got into this to judge things.

Transcript:  So yes, I think it's a really good thing.  And I go back to the California Air Resources Board, changing the world with their emission standards back in the early 2000s,  when they set the emission standards for California.  And as California goes, so goes the country.  And hopefully, if the country doesn't have the will to do it, California is big enough to have an impact.  And so I see this as hugely positive.  I know the good news is it's only as the obvious thing is it's new electric cars.  That's what must be sold in California.  And it corresponds with 2035 is when GM says all their cars will be electric.  And that gives time for the infrastructure, the charging infrastructure to come in.  And I think people will get much more comfortable with range anxiety and realizing I actually don't drive 300 miles very often.  And by then, hopefully, you'll have fast charge stations.

They have backpack sized leaf blowers that go, but they're still gas powered.  I think electric.  So my question is, just to play the other side of the political fence for a minute, which I don't ever live on comfortably.  There's still this discussion about the calculus of, okay, here's what it takes to build an electric car.  Here's what it takes to manufacture batteries.  Here's what it takes to cycle all that stuff out of the ecosystem later.  How long do you have to convert to all electric before that plays out into a net win?  Or do you?  I mean, I've read a bunch of different accounts of this and I haven't yet seen one that really convinced me one way or the other because it's really resource intensive and...  Well, it's tough on the grid.

Transcript:  So EV in the UK is interesting, again, depending on where you live, because in California or in America generally, people have houses that have driveways.  Yes.  And that means you can charge a car on your driveway.  Yeah.  You live in London.  90% of places that you live in London don't have driveways.  You park on the street.  So you're relying on the government to provide charging infrastructure on the street where you live, which is very difficult.  On the other hand, you're probably driving much shorter distances, which is either better or worse, depending on your point of view.  I will say that I think I was in Brighton, which is twinned with Santa Monica in the States.  So that gives you an idea of what kind of place it is.  And this weekend, they had a...  Do you guys know Vespers, the little Italian scooters that were kind of like the world culture of the 60s?  I always wanted one of those.  Yeah.  So they had a little mod festival and there were hundreds of these bikes all along the coastline of Brighton Beach.  Mods. Mods.  And I was there.  Yeah.  The mods and rockers.  And I was there and I was thinking, what is...  The mods were the 70s.  We're in the 20s.  In the 20s, 70s, what is going to be the equivalent of the mods on their Vespers now?  Is it going to be anybody driving a gas-powered car?  Is it going to be...  Arnold and his mama?  What are we going to have nostalgia for in 50 years where we think, actually, that's probably not very good for the environment, but it's quite cute at the moment?

But because I'm turning 40 next week and I have a midlife crisis, I've bought an electric motorbike.  Perfect.  And it's like, if you're in London...  That's a perfect choice.  And all you want to do is...  Range anxiety, the range on this thing is 40 miles.  But in London, that's about four weeks of riding.  So I've bought a...  There's a great brand called Maving, M-A-E-V-I-N-G.com.  And they make very classically British-inspired Triumph.  It's all Triumph engineers.  It doesn't work, you mean?  Electric bikes.

How do we straighten it?  It seems an inordinate amount of rightward leaning Twitter users are being banned or  kicked off.  Well, this guy obviously has an agenda.  It can't be good for MDowd.  The biggest issue and my biggest regret is that it became a company.  I think what he meant, and it's interesting to read the replies, is I wish it had been  a protocol.  And Kevin Marks says, well, I might point out we were treating it as a protocol because  you had an API right up until Chirp when Twitter rug pulled that killed all third party clients  in most apps.  Oh, I remember that.  The winter, the Twitter winter.

There's like, dude, a you made an absolute shoot ton of money.  So it's very easy to look back and say, I wish I'd done it a different way from a perspective  of immense privilege and immense money.  And B, at every point you had the opportunity to make Twitter open, you repeatedly chose  to not do that.  So he has regrets.  You bought tweet deck.  You bought every single thing that was successful.  You killed it all off.  So I mean, sure have regrets, but it's very hard to have regrets over things that you  consciously repeatedly chose to do.  It's like, maybe I have regret over this one thing that I did once occasionally.  But if you keep doing something, can you really regret it?  It's more like, more on that point, you kind of made a life choice.  You could say I was a jerk.  Like the five times that I shut down every client and every API and I rate limited everything  that access Twitter and I refuse to build a decent desktop client and I refuse to build  a mobile app that had, I mean, how much regret do you really have?  Maybe he's learned his lesson.  Well, a few billion dollars will give everyone perspective, right?

Transcript:  Here is a final story that I think has a happy ending.  A Unix legend, Brian Kernahan, who was instrumental in writing Unix.  I have his book, The C Programming Language, brilliant guy, Princeton professor.  He's now 80 years old.  He realized that the AUK program that he wrote that is widely used on Unix like platforms  didn't support Unicode.  So he wrote it.  He added, and because he says, I don't really understand Git, I'm just going to email you  the code.  Unicode support for AUK at the age of 80.  I've tested this a fair amount.  It clearly needs more tests.  He wrote an email to the one true AUK repo posted by longtime maintainer, Arnold Robbins.  Once I figure out how I will try to submit a pull request, I wish I understood Git better,  but in spite of your help, I still don't have a proper understanding.  So this may take a while.  It made me pull out my old C Programming Language book, which I got in 1982 and realized that  that was, Kernahan was 40 back then and I was a mere sprout of 25.  But it's a beautiful story.  What a legend.  Kernahan?  Yes.  Absolute legend.  Yeah.  And a wonderful story.

Transcript:  So this is a really long...  Because it's on crew, they're going out for about 40 days.  So they're going in this really weird, big halo orbit.  So it's a different orbit than any of the Apollo missions used, and it's to accommodate...  Part of what's wrong with Artemis, if I may, is that the upper stage is so underpowered  that even though the main part of the rocket is more powerful than the Saturn V, it doesn't  have the lifting capability of the moon the Saturn V have, which is why we have all this...  We got to meet Elon's rocket out in lunar orbit to get people down the surface.  So it's a very...  Right now, the physics of this are really weird.  Basically, they're going to...  So this is the first on crewed one.  Next one will be a loop around the moon mission like Apollo 8.  And then the third one, Artemis 3, which will happen in 2025, maybe 7, somewhere in there,  will carry the first three people, which is when we get the first woman and first person  of color to the moon.  But by law, you have to launch them on the SLS, which is the big government rocket.  God bless them, I hope it works, in an Orion capsule, which is a third bigger than the  Apollo capsule, three people.  You got to go to lunar parking orbit, where you meet up with Elon Musk's lunar starship,  and then two of those three get in the nose of the starship, taking up about 3% of its  total volume with this enormous chasm of an RV behind them and land at tail first on the  moon.  So it's a little weird.  But this is the first step.

But I mean, God bless them, they've been working on this rocket since 2002 in one form or another.  And it's supposed to be easy because it's recycled shuttle parts.  So we know they're going to fly it at least four times because they have that many shuttle  engines.  They've got 16 of them sitting around a warehouse.  Do they have to use them up?  Well, yeah.  That's how we're saving money at Fort Billion to launch with a B.  And then we'll see what happens after that.  But it's good to have a moon rocket.  Elon could wake up one morning and say, this space stuff is for the birds.  I don't want to do it anymore.  So it's good to have a government program.  So more power to them.

This is NASA's little heralded test to slam a spacecraft into an asteroid to see if we  actually can knock them off course.  Should they be on their way to Earth to take out a major city?  Kind of important.  So it's a very small rock, but it's a valid test.  And if the physics of it work out as they plan, then we start building bigger ones and  we'll protect ourselves.  We hope in the event that should ever occur.
