Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's why I shouldn't say oh isn't to me. It's like oh yeah Bitcoin went down  What a surprise you know you should have known better  But I feel bad for people who you know saw Matt Damon saying courage favors the brave and they said well  I'm gonna be courageous and buy a Bitcoin  Of course if you hold stocks right now your 401k is probably not doing too well either

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 430.62
End time: 435.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 435.92
End time: 445.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a lot of people thought that it would be like gold  But you know unfortunately you know at least gold you know you have something physical that you know has some

Start time: 445.46
End time: 470.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, but let's be fair the industrial value of gold comes nowhere near the price of gold  I mean yeah, you could if if you had some gold bricks in your basement  You could probably find somebody to buy it to make you know expensive stereo dongles  But it's not like it's gonna be what's the price of gold perhaps?  It's a lot more than the industrial value of it, so gold is probably similar to Bitcoin in that respect right

Start time: 473.18
End time: 481.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I mean at least it has some industrial value Bitcoin you know it's nothing yeah, you know it's it's a scam yeah

End time: 534.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess I have to be the the web 3 defender, and you know I oh good. We found one finally  Finally well, I think there is you know there is some utility value in in cryptocurrencies broadly  You know in the idea of like greatly improving cross-border payments taking a lot of cost out of the equation  Not necessarily with Bitcoin because Bitcoin is one of the least efficient  Cryptos out there the problem is that the speculation value the you know the quote-unquote investment value  But really it's speculation the speculation value of these cryptocurrencies is at complete tension with any utility the more  volatile and hence  You know short-term money making these currencies are the less useful they are for payments right as El Salvador has learned

Start time: 535.98
End time: 546.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  To their chagrin they made Bitcoin last year their state currency  Replacing the dollar and now they can't pay their debts  I

Start time: 546.74
End time: 564.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Shouldn't I shouldn't make it good. I think they made it legal tender, but I don't think they completely replace the dollar  I think they made it parallel as an alternative to the dollar use the dollar or use use Bitcoin  But it didn't completely replace the dollar they bought a significant amount of Bitcoin

Start time: 564.70
End time: 630.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which was also a little bit of a mistake I shouldn't laugh, but there's so many Bitcoin bros  Especially those Bitcoin billionaires going around saying you see you see it's the future  There's so much hype around it. I  Guess I feel terrible for anybody who's lost money  You know because I don't know I doubt it will come back to its former glory days, maybe it will  But I think maybe some of the bloom is off the road  So I feel terrible for anybody's lost money, but at the same time  I'm glad that it's kind of taken some of the air out of the market  Ironically Jack Dorsey former Twitter CEO founder one of the founders of Twitter  announced  Web 5.0, which is web 2.0 plus web 3.0 based on  bitcoins blockchain  Just a couple of weeks ago. That's not looking like a good choice right about now  Coinbase time for web 6.0. Yeah, maybe if we got a skip ahead what's there? There's no are you said you're gonna defend web 3?  What is good about web 3 I

Start time: 632.48
End time: 676.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mean there's a limited set of circumstances where a blockchain which is you know, basically a write-only database  That's that's distributed on the internet  Is useful and it's generally where you don't want to have one party  Maintaining a database and where you you know, like where you don't want to have to trust someone right?  like a bank  Yeah, exactly, I mean the the irony is that we've built up all these systems that do rely on trust and  people are kind of used to it and  there's even a kind of a thinking in the  You know in the crypto world that well like if you get caught by a scam you didn't do your research, right? It's your fault

Start time: 677.18
End time: 683.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because you shouldn't have to try it and who do you blame right? There's no bank to complain to yeah, exactly

Start time: 684.38
End time: 714.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, I don't know, you know to your point Leo  I am very sympathetic to people who saw a misleading ad and kind of you know and kind of  Went for it based on you know based on this false premises  I'm you know, I'm also sympathetic to people who say hey the existing system is  you know, I believe you know people who believe the existing systems rigged against them and  You know don't want to you know, don't want to invest in stocks  They're certainly not getting any kind of interest on their bank deposits

Start time: 715.74
End time: 783.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you know, that's a way to yeah, and that's exactly the situation this person close to me was in it  didn't believe you know thought the system was corrupt and broken and basically rigged against normal people and  You know was reading reddit forums and even even when I tried to explain, you know  The the technical stuff and the limitations, you know, I mean there's as you said  I agree that there's some some theoretical, you know, really interesting use cases for blockchain and crypto  But when you actually start looking at it as you know as a store of value  You know, it becomes way more problematic, you know  And try and actually trying to use it and certainly nobody  I don't think anybody has come up with a really viable way of making it usable as a store of value  And when when you when you look at the world around you today and and see all the corruption, you know  it it is very enticing to jump into something like this and  You know hope that you know  Maybe this is going to be a solution to the problems that we have part of the eye-opener though

Start time: 783.20
End time: 840.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it's not corruption free the world is full of corruption is full of scammers  It's full of bad guys and NFTs it turns out  Not only is it centralized pretty much all on open sea  but  If open sea decides as they did with the board ape  Oh, we're not gonna sell anymore. You can't that's it. You're done  So it is centralized and there are plenty of scammers out there have found ways to steal NFTs  to fish NFTs, I mean  I feel like it's it's the best it's the worst of all worlds combined  But it does have this utopian promise of something better. I just don't I just don't see it happening  There's also the environmental impact which we can't ignore. I know that banking has an environmental impact as well, but  You know these proof-of-work  Cryptocurrencies right now are not exactly the thing we should be doing. I think as the as the world gets hotter and hotter

Start time: 841.61
End time: 855.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean my one issue is that people are describing them as  Currencies, but really what they're being used as right now is just  For speculation their tulip bulbs  Yeah, they're tulip bulbs that were all better except they don't look pretty in the spring

Start time: 858.38
End time: 998.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  To your point Sam at least you could play it a tulip  Even if you paid five thousand dollars for it, at least you'll get a tulip  Maybe not if your tulip is held in a vault under the Swiss Alps. Yeah, maybe not  Anyway, I don't I don't want to pile on if you if you're holding Bitcoin. I have almost eight Bitcoin  But I can't access it because I forgot my password and it's just sitting in my home  Yeah, it's an old story. Everybody knows this story. No actually not all know  Well, maybe oh no if but see this is always a problem with even with stocks if you knew when the peak was  It would be oh no, you should have sold Leo in a sixty thousand because it's never gonna be there again  But is it if I sold it today at twenty thousand and it goes to sixty in a year  Did I do the right thing so it's better it's locked away I didn't buy them there were donations for a while  You know, we we have a tip jar or something on the website for a while  I had a QR code for a Bitcoin wallet and so yeah, no, I didn't buy them there  They were sent to eight Bitcoin. Well, this is in the  The last one was twenty-few dollars back this was when they weren't worth anything and they weren't even sending whole bitcoins. They were sending fractionals  But enough did people did it it was seven point eight five Bitcoin and I can see it it's in the I have the wallet  I just have to remember the best phrase to unlock  It'll come to me. I  Don't feel as bad and I mentioned this before too, and I apologize if you're hearing me repeat  I don't feel as bad as Steve Gibson our security guy when Bitcoin first started  He thought I'd be fun to set up a Bitcoin miner next morning literally next morning 50 Bitcoin came out of it  Early on it was easy to do that on a just a PC  So he put it on he put the wallet on a hard drive forgot about it later  Erased the hard drive. So he had even by today's standards. He had a million bucks  You know, you had three million dollars at the peak that just never piece be erased  And that's the other by the way, no central bank nobody to complain to  You lose you forget your password you forget your you erase your hard drive you lose your wallet you use a custodial wallet  Which a lot of people did at Mount Gox and other places you lose it. They ain't nobody to complain to

Start time: 999.84
End time: 1031.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course if you set fire to a pile of you know paper bills the bank that's true place. That's a good point  That's a good point, but yeah, I mean the the non reversibility of cryptocurrency transactions  By and large there are some there are some that are reversible  But that you know, that's a big problem and people haven't really gotten their heads around the customer service implications of that  Just the you know, like there's transaction fraud  I haven't even heard people talk about that issue right as much which I think is a big issue in terms of making it mainstream

Start time: 1032.00

Start time: 1064.06
End time: 1080.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, but I think that I think that a lot of what we're seeing like why is everything kind of  Collapsing at once it's because you've had a ton of leverage  Into this market and all of those leverage bets are unwinding at once right and it's just enormous selling pressure

Start time: 1081.48
End time: 1115.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And by the way, this picture is why there are people  Maybe me who have some schadenfreude about all that.

Start time: 1150.82
End time: 1212.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I think some of the principles behind that like more decentralization getting away from  Everything being consolidated with a few major players like Facebook or and Google and Apple and and and so on  I think I like that in principle  But you know the reality is the reason why it got so much better  But you know the reality is the reason why it got centralized in the first place is  People don't most people don't want to and don't know how to run their own servers and and do all this stuff on their own  Right. This is something that you know that the technology is such that  Invariably you will end up  Consolidating it, you know with a few players and and open sea and you know everything else  There's no reason why you know technically today why it couldn't be  Decentralized I mean that's what it was to begin with but the the reality is most people don't want to manage all of this stuff  You know, they want to be able to just use use the stuff without thinking about it, right?

Start time: 1213.50
End time: 1227.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Yeah  770 million more than it has right now  Um, and so he says look free speech is important. We should allow people to say what they want, but  Unless you work for spacex, right? Oh, well, we'll get to that unless you work for space  Yeah, but it's important to make twitter as attractive as possible  and of course free speech  Real free speech which turns you into 4chan or worse  Does not make twitter a billion user platform by any means right? So he's got a little bit of a problem there  And by the way spam is a protected form of protected speech  So I don't know what he's gonna do there  He says  Really that means showing not showing people content.

They're these poor twitter employees are shell shocked because everybody's been going on, you know, jack torsey good  See ya  I mean, it's been it's been a rocky 10 years  Uh, and it looks like he does in fact want it.

End time: 2108.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He I don't know if that's the takeaway. I think the takeaway is that at that one during that 10 minute  Conversation if he wanted to buy it, it's going to probably change through different times over the next month

End time: 2169.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah  Analysts believe he will  Cut 20 of the workforce. In other words of the 8 000  Uh people listening, you know a couple of thousand gonna lose their job  Uh, he when asked about layoffs he dodged the question, but he did say twitter is losing money and that's not a great situation  If elon thinks he's gonna make 44 billion dollars back  in his lifetime on twitter  He's just wrong, but obviously he got a lot of people to invest right  Where's why are people giving him money to buy twitter?  That's crazy  Larry ellison gave him a billion dollars  You're not gonna get that money back larry. Yes, he could afford it  Uh, I want to here's what musk said. I want uh twitter to contribute to a better  long-lasting  civilization  Where we better understand the nature of reality?  It's kind of a heavy burden for a social network

Have to do with you know with spacex which he has always said it's like, you know getting to mars making you know making  human civilization  Multi-planetary  Multi-planetary is his most important thing.

Well runs the company  She's the c and chief operating officer and president  But she is the one that really runs the runs the operation day to day  And you know if any if there is any one individual and certainly in something like this  There is never any one individual that deserves all the credit  But you know if there is somebody that deserved credit, it would be her not elon. Yeah. Yeah

Start time: 2380.38
End time: 2408.32

That's it. That's all of them  It's me. Elon. Yep. Yep. This week and elon has now come to an end  Thank you very much for your attention. We'll be back with something else  In just a bit you might have noticed  I don't it didn't say anything but you might have noticed i'm looking a little trim a little fit  Uh, i've been steadily safely  Losing weight through neum. I am a fan of neum weight  Because it's not a diet  It is about learning  About your relationship with food  So that you are conscious  When you eat and then kind of magically you eat better and eat well and there are no forbidden foods  It's you know, there's a lot of information out there  It's very easy to be overwhelmed by all the information from the wellness industry  But neum believes the only place you really need to start is right up here in your mind  With neum weight you take a path toward better health one lesson at a time. It's a psychology based approach  That really helped me change the way I think about it food and health  Rather than changing my whole lifestyle  You know, I early on in neum you have a coach you have a group and i'm  Shame facetly said I had a hot dog last night. My coach said what are you talking about? Nothing wrong with that  There's no bad foods what I can eat a hot dog. They said yes you log it. Yes  Have you been taking reading the lessons? Yes  It's cognitive behavioral therapy and other scientific principles that help you better understand your relationship with food  For instance, I really learned that when I overeat I do something they call fog eating. I'm kind of in a fog  I'm i'm eating for emotional reasons or stress reasons and i'm not even tasting the food neum taught me  To turn off the tv put down the phone  sit  enjoy  Taste every bite and you know what? I just magically by doing that eat less  It's kind of remarkable  Neum understands building long-term positive habits can be hard  And filled with ups and downs. It's about progress though, not perfection. Everybody's journey looks different  Neum is fully grounded in science. This is not  Voodoo it it's it's scientific. They've published more than 30  peer reviewed scientific articles  For users practitioners scientists and the public about how their methods work and how effective they are  The idea is get no more stress be empowered  Be empowered because you're taking care of your health  One day off isn't going to ruin the program neum helps you get back on track  You decide how it fits into your life. Not the other way around five 10 15 minutes a day  I take about 10 minutes a day to read the lessons  With neum I log my food so I know what i'm eating. It's about being about bringing awareness  To what you're eating, but how much time you spend is is up to you  And the thing is i've been on neum now for a year  And I am about 20 pounds under my starting weight  And I don't weigh myself every day  It fluctuates and it's that's normal, but I feel better. I'm healthier  All my metrics are better. My doctor's very proud of me  Start building better habits today sign up for your trial at neum  n-double-om  dot com slash  Twit give it a try. They they have a trial you can see if it if it works for you  I think it will I that's what I did and I was so happy in fact  I'll tell you who's really happy my wife  I started doing it and Lisa said well, I'll you know, i'll keep you company because it'll be i'll be a supportive spouse  She's she's at the lowest weight she's ever been her whole life since i've known her she looks great  She's completely in control of her weight  And she just loves it and you know, we went out last night seven course dinner very fancy fun  She's writing everything down taking pictures.

I don't think anybody's not using type c at this point laptops do  all the android phones do  It's just apple apple makes somewhere between three and four dollars  a cable  For licensing light, uh the lightning cable. So if I were going to make a lightning cable  I'd have to pay apple because it's proprietary  I'm sure they're reluctant to let that go, but I also see this happening. In fact, I think apple's been planning this  before 2024  Any thoughts is this a good thing my question is I guess

Transcript:  P  Uh, let's talk about this because we've got sam here auto guy sammable samad principal research at a guide house insights  podcast host  uh at wheelbarrings.media  the uh  Folks at the national highway transportation safety administration. We call them nitsa  Have put out their  Standing general order on crash  reporting they're investigating  crashes on advanced driver assist  systems  tesla's are they particularly looking at tesla or just all adas systems this this came

Start time: 4867.84
End time: 4921.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um the the order originally came out a year ago  After they started doing an investigation into a couple of dozen teslas that had crashed into stationary  Fire trucks and police vehicles emergency vehicles while on autopilot. Yeah  And so this particular order applies to all automakers suppliers and  companies developing automated driving systems  So this includes companies like waymo and cruise and argo ai and others  And what they have to do is within 24 hours of finding out they have to report  Any crashes that involve either driver assistance or automated driving system?  Um being active within 30 seconds of the crash  So if the system was active and then shuts off and and then within 30 seconds, you have a crash they have to report that  Why then?

Start time: 4922.40
End time: 4926.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Was it that anybody was you know?  Switching them off right before a crash

Start time: 4927.56
End time: 4988.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, uh, it's not so much that people were switching them off, but there's been a lot of speculation  You know, there's been a lot of reports over the years from tesla owners in particular  that  Got into crashes and they said, um, you know my my car it was an autopilot  And it crashed and you know tesla looked at the data and said nope autopilot was not active at the time of the crash  But despite lots of questions over the years and I know I asked tesla multiple times over the years, you know  In any of these crashes  Was the system active, you know a few seconds before the crash because the the user interface in these cars  Is often not entirely clear what mode you're in. It's not it's not obvious much of the time if the system has deactivated  And if you weren't paying enough attention  That you know, you might think that it was still active and then you know  You get a crash and you think it's active, but it wasn't which is why they asked why nitsa asked for it to be  The data to be any any time the system was active within 30 seconds of a crash. I had heard

Start time: 4989.72
End time: 5010.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And maybe this is a scurrilous allegation  That tesla was intentionally doing that so that elon could say  Completely accurately as he has done many times  Self-driving was not turned on at the time of the crash  Is that is that just scurrilous or is or you think there's some merit in that?

Start time: 5011.86
End time: 5073.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I I don't think that they would intentionally turn it off or I mean, it's entirely possible. They might fudge the data  Uh, you know, i'm not accusing them of that  But I think what is very reasonable is that you know in a lot of these situations the system did deactivate  You know when the car was going down the road the driver thought it was still active  And you know did not take control when they should have  And then the car crashed and this is why I think it's important to have this data. Unfortunately  Um, the other thing that nitsa did is they allowed these companies to declare certain bits of information  Uh confidential business information  um, and so while the the data is reported to nitsa  Um when they release when nitsa finally released the first batch of this data this week  Uh, you know, there were about 393  crashes  Uh that were reported 273 of which involved tesla vehicles. Here's the graph. Is this because tesla reports more?

Start time: 5074.58
End time: 5076.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  accurately more often or is  Is

Start time: 5078.52
End time: 5083.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't think so. Yeah, I think I think it's you know that they're they're just crashing more frequently. Uh, is that because

Start time: 5085.36
End time: 5086.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I mean they have more cars with 8s

Start time: 5088.40
End time: 5177.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Out there don't they? Uh, no, no, not really not necessarily  Um, you know because this includes, you know a wide variety of different systems and  You know, they're like for example the hondas, you know, the the next second highest number was honda with 90  But you know  arguably that you know the honda vehicles shouldn't have even been included in here because you know what they call level two systems are systems that  control both steering and speed and if the  um if the  You know the honda the honda system the two systems the steering control the lane keeping assist and the speed controller are separate systems  They're not consolidated  And but you know the thing is I looked through the data  Yeah, I read through the the the excel file that they that they released  And in the descriptions of the crashes, I looked at all the honda crashes. None of them were none of the crashes were actually  Cases where the the adas was the problem. It was always you know, the car would you know had  adaptive cruise control and lane keeping assist on  Went through an intersection and a car ran a stop sign and struck the car in the side, you know  Things like that. So it was all unrelated stuff  but because  nitsa allowed  information to be redacted  I looked through all 273 tesla related crashes. They redacted the descriptions so we haven't  You know nitsa has the data, but we cannot we do not know what happened in those crashes

Start time: 5177.24
End time: 5187.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  These gray wedges of this pie on on these crashes  Unknown means not that nitsa doesn't know but they're not telling well in some cases

Start time: 5188.72
End time: 5198.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They actually don't know. Okay, you know because it depends, you know, it depends on how the data was reported  So there's cases where they they actually don't know what the root cause was

Start time: 5199.40
End time: 5253.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is a really interesting. I mean very complete. I like driver assist systems. I've used them on teslas  I've used them on audi. I have it now in my ford maquis  You know, that's adaptive cruise control. That's that's an adas system, isn't it?  Yeah, no, it absolutely is where it slows down and when the car is in front of you slowed down and speeds up when they speed up  Lane changing is available in blue cruise and gms  Whatever cruise they call that one super cruise super cruise  Right, you the automatic lane changing that would be a das  Does anybody attempt to do as much as tesla does though that they're their autopilot is uh  Works for instance, not just on highways like super cruise and blue cruise but on city streets  Supposedly it it sees stop signs and stop lights and reacts properly to them

Start time: 5253.86
End time: 5259.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is anybody else them? It doesn't necessarily react properly. I know sometimes it does two two different things there. Yeah

Start time: 5259.52
End time: 5264.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Um, yeah, it sees it sees uh, it sees speed limit signs and reacts to those. Yeah

Start time: 5265.40
End time: 5272.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean no no one has gone as far as what tesla has done at least from a marketing perspective

Start time: 5273.74
End time: 5278.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And maybe that's part of the problem is that tesla tells you it's an autopilot

Start time: 5279.00
End time: 5302.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So tesla drivers that is a that's a fundamental problem here. Yeah, you know is the way that they brand it  Um, you know both blue cruise and super cruise allow actual hands-free driving  So you can take your hands off the wheel. You still have to watch the road  Technically with autopilot you're supposed to keep your hands on the wheel at all times  It's not supposed to be hands-free and they don't just don't use driver monitoring

Start time: 5318.58
End time: 5327.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's a marketing problem  Yeah, it shouldn't be called autopilot blue cruise super cruise those don't imply that the plane will fly itself

Transcript:  um sam is there a secrecy problem in the self-driving industry because I saw that waymo has also been trying to  Redact crash data in this case. It's um  Data that it reported to the california dmv someone sought that data and now  Waymo is trying to redact it. It's you know, are these  Do you feel like these companies have a legitimate trade secrets argument here or is it just  A smoke screen because they're embarrassed

Start time: 5357.50
End time: 5445.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I I think it's I think it's a smoke screen. I don't you know when it comes to crashes, I think that you know,  Everything should be public  um, they're you know, especially with these types of systems because we don't  We no one has  uh  Proven, you know that these systems are actually even as safe as human drivers yet  You know and we cannot prove that until we have this data  You know at least you know, they are giving the data to government to to regulators  So at least the regulators have access to the data, but I think that you know, it should be public  I think we have a right to know because  These companies are doing experiments on public roads around  Other road users that have not consented to be part of an experiment  I mean, did you sign off saying yeah, i'm okay with tesla testing full self-driving  Around me or waymo or cruise or anybody else?  I certainly didn't and so, you know, I think if they're going to test on public roads  around other users  All of this information about how and when and why they crashed  Should be public. I think we have a right to know that information  I mean, we don't necessarily have a right to know  You know all the the source code and the specific all the details of necessarily why it crashed or what went wrong?  But I think we should have a right to know what happened and and where well and that's what it says standing general order says

Start time: 5445.82
End time: 5451.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 5452.94
End time: 5470.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To the best we can tell yeah, I mean, you know tesla submitted, you know two reports on  273 crashes in the past 11 months  So that's you know, that's a good start. I mean there are tens of thousands of crashes  Every month, but it's about six. This is about six and a half million crashes a year in the united states

Start time: 5470.60
End time: 5483.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  so  And worldwide a million people die every year from auto  crash so  It's I mean, I doesn't mean these are not  Safe they may be much safer than a human driver

Start time: 5483.96
End time: 5502.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's not a good thing to have a human driver  Well, you know, it depends, you know, it depends on  You you have to do there's a lot of different driving scenarios a lot of different conditions and not all are  Equally challenging some but what this does is how many lives were saved by a das?

Start time: 5514.14
End time: 5517.96

Start time: 5518.14
End time: 5548.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We don't know it may be we yeah, we don't we don't have any evidence to that  To that effect and that either that's the problem. Yeah, you know, we need we need more data to understand  You know in the in the scenarios where these systems are being used  Are they actually safer because you know driving driving in, you know urban environments, you know at relatively slow speeds  You tend to have a lot of crashes but they tend not to be fatal right most you know  More than half of crashes are happening on rural roads. There's a lot of idiots

End time: 5580.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I get I mean, but we can't we don't know because we can't know  If this is a if if 8s is a positive or a negative  Right. We don't know that that this information doesn't so it's important to remember that will nitsa use this information to regulate or

Start time: 5581.72
End time: 5618.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the intent of this? That's that's the that's the long-term plan, you know  Up to now they've never really collected data on the efficacy of these driver assist systems  So this is the first time that they're really getting, you know some hard data from the industry  About how effective these systems actually are  And you know, so they're going to be taking a close look at this data to try to understand  You know, where do they work? Where do these systems not work?  And you know what if anything needs to be regulated how or or you know, how do how do we create standards?  For the performance of these systems. We're somewhat immune

Start time: 5620.14
End time: 5700.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because because it happens all the time to the number of auto deaths crashes and incidents that happen all the time  constantly, uh and and and  So it's it's an easy thing to be fooled. For instance  when you talk about uh electric vehicle fires  it scares people until they  Remember that there are gas vehicle fires all the time  It's not 100 000 a year 200 000 a year. So  Uh, it's really important to remember. Yeah, 273 tesla accidents but put it in context  And this is the problem is that we don't we just really don't know if 8s is a net positive or a negative  We and we can't know that we don't know how many accidents were avoided by 8s  My experience as a driver is but either way I pay attention because I don't trust the damn thing  But but but my eyes which is the right I think the right way to use it. No one should be trusting this  Yeah, no, that's the right way to use it. But it is a help  And there have been many times and I bet you everybody watching has had an experience. Uh, if you have one of these cars that stops  Before you hit a car in front of you or a pedestrian  My daughter how often are you accidentally almost hitting pedestrians? Well, uh, not a lot but it happens, right?  Have you ever well do you drive paris? First of all, do you drive? I think you bicycle

Transcript:  Uh, and I I think that these new technologies where cars stop before they you know, i'll tell you what  My car has stopped me two or three times from backing into traffic  It has a big beeper that says there's cross traffic and I go. Whoa, I didn't see that one  so  I think you can probably make a strong case that these things used properly are a net plus

Start time: 5739.46
End time: 5757.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And and I think you know things like blind spot monitoring and cross traffic alert are huge, you know  They are truly valuable and they are truly beneficial and they're relatively low cost  But you know some of the other stuff, especially if you treat it as if it's self-driving. Yeah, that's the key  That's why autopilot's a bad choice

Start time: 5758.32
End time: 5772.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We had there's a curve we I drive down on the way to san francisco  That my tesla would invariably try to pull me into the wall because it just got confused  But I know that and I had my hands on the wheel and when it started to veer out of the lane  I would pull it back into the lane and be fine

Transcript:  Um, but but look at the case of walter wong the the apple engineer. That's tragic died in in 2018  Yeah, yeah, he drove his tesla every day. He had multiple instances  Of same car on autopilot trying to pull him into that same spot on that median that interchange  Yeah, where he ultimately died. Yeah, you know and he reported it to tesla and you know  And yet he continued to use the system. That's the problem in a way, you know, and that's yeah the the you know  Again, it comes back to the human behavior because of the the expectation the fault the the erroneous expectation  We have about the capabilities of these systems. I have not i'm just happy to say

Transcript:  But the cause of any accidents in my life i've been in a few but it's always rear-ended or something, you know  Somebody ran it ran into me  Uh, but I do use those especially on highway  Stop and go traffic. Uh, i've used the tesla lane change mechanism. I don't I never had a full self-driving  tesla, but I felt like those made me better drivers because uh, it just  You know and and and and by the way one of the best features  Of automatic cruise control is it it actually keeps more more car lengths between you and the car in front of you  It keeps the proper amount humans never do right humans are always tailgating  Because we don't we're not we can't adjust to the idea that you're not going to be able to stop in 60 feet  You know, you're going too fast  But the car knows it and so I let the car determine the the distance from the car ahead of me

They often end up falling asleep  They're paid very low wages having a robust not quite autopilot  Because I think that's still even going to be a ways off in five ten years  But having a robust driving assistant like program  Would make such noticeable difference in trucking fatalities wall street journal article this week

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they all all of these systems whether it's on a light duty vehicle or a big rig have um  Tele some sort of tele operation or remote operation capability  So that you know if the truck gets into a situation that it doesn't know how to handle  It can basically call call back to base and say hey, I need you to to take control  And so a remote operator will in most cases it'll you know, it'll be you know  Looking at the sensor data and giving it some hints, you know  And this is designed for things like construction zones or you know other things like that where it's not quite sure what it should be doing

Start time: 6164.88
End time: 6202.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, well, I mean, you know if there's no driver in the vehicle, there's nobody to take over  So these systems most right now mostly are being designed to go hub to hub  You know where the the the depot is located close relatively close to the off-ramp  So within a half mile to a mile of the off-ramp  So it'll take the off-ramp pull into a depot and then you know  Maybe there a driver will will jump depending on what it is  They may transfer freight to another vehicle or to smaller vehicles for last mile delivery  Or you know a human driver may take over to to do the the final leg of the trip

Transcript:  And I presume that these  ai's will be  Less aggressive than human drivers that they'll yeah, they'll be willing to don't no mad max modes  Yeah, and they're gonna follow the speed limit and they're gonna stay on the right  You know, the worst thing is when you see a big rig passing  Other big rigs or other cars even because he wants to go the speed limit  Terrifies me

Start time: 6228.26
End time: 6269.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean and it's kind of a  Uh part of the issue is I guess based on the fact that you have human drivers that of course have to sleep  Um, and oftentimes are being paid, you know by the mile or being paid based on whether or not they can get there  At a certain amount of time  So you have all these things baked into the system that often lead to folks being forced to drive on little sleep  And speed and pass cars on the left hand side when they shouldn't be if you have just a autonomous vehicle  Taking these sort of trips. It should be all baked in there shouldn't be any unnecessary speeding because it is  Leaving from point a to point b with no stops and I want it to be passive

Yeah, you know human driver human truck drivers are they're limited to 10 hours a day  Of driving right and you know, then they have to have a certain there's a mandated break period before they can drive again  And they use electronic data loggers now for that  so  you know automating  That long haul part, you know, and you know, it's really there's a shortage of truck drivers  Which is part of the supply chain problem we have and there has been a shortage

I want to talk a little bit about user way.org  very proud  to have a user way on our website at twit tv because after all not only do you have a legal obligation  To users with disabilities you have a moral obligation and a business reason to make your site accessible watch  userway.org  I'm talking about making your website ada compliant  Accessible not only is it the right thing to do because you're opening up your website to a much larger group 60 million plus people  You have a responsibility to make your site accessible. It's a public entity  So you got to make it accessible and with user way it's easy  That was my biggest concern was oh, I can't afford it or it's gonna be too hard  No user way is really affordable and it's really easy and incredible. It's ai powered  It tirelessly enforces all the accessibility guidelines the wcag wukag guidelines  And I love this so to our engineers. It's one line of javascript. That's it because user way is so good  It's used by more than a million websites including the big guys coca cola disney  ebay these are companies that really have to be accessible and user way can do that as you get bigger  They scale with you if they can handle disney  Absolutely, they can handle you they make best in class enterprise level accessibility tools available to you  Your small or medium-sized business and then as you scale you need user way and you're ready  It just makes business sense some of the biggest problems nav menus very difficult  So the way this works if you're blind or you're using accessibility tools  There is what they call an accessibility layer. That's what the screen reader sees  So really what user way does is make sure that all the information available to the front page to the sighted user  Is available to the browser in the accessibility layer. It changes colors  Now you've got your pantone color for your business. Of course, we do too. It doesn't change that  But it adjusts hue and luminance. So it's easier for people with vision issues to read  So user way will generate alt tags. That's one of the reasons it needs ai  It can actually see the picture and generate an alt tag that matches the picture automatically  You can go in if you want you can modify it. Of course  It fixes violations like vague links fixes broken links. Make sure that your website uses accessible colors  And you'll get a detailed report of all the violations that were fixed on your website. So, you know exactly what it did  Plus you can work with it  User way integrates seamlessly with your site builder software  Let user way help your business meet its compliance goals improve the experience for your users user way can make any website fully accessible  ADA compliant and everyone who visits can browse seamlessly  Customize it to fit their needs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's still rubber tires, but the wheel itself instead of being made out of aluminum or steel is made out of carbon fiber  What's the benefit of that? It's lighter. Uh, it's a lot lighter. It's stronger  It's actually more resistant to damage  And you know for for evs because efficiency is so important the the rotational inertia  Is even more important than just you know moving who would have thought of that  That's interesting so I think when I was talking to the ceo, um a couple of weeks ago he told me  You know, they're they're working on they're they're gonna have they're gonna have their wheels on a new suv coming out later this year  Saves about 60 kilograms, which is about 130 140 pounds  Yeah, especially at the wheels, uh, you know as  You know as we get these bigger and bigger wheels on cars  You know that those 22 and 24 inch wheels you ever pick one of those things up they get pretty heavy and so  You know carbon fiber is an important material for that kind of that sort of thing. You know, what else is lighter?

Yeah, you know  a lot of the like like the temperature in my house is controlled by a  Limited but but ai, uh  Things are starting to happen that an ai controls. Do you think that's going to have sam?

Transcript:  but ai has  very significant limitations  And you know the the truth is, you know, going back to you know, the the lambda thing  it's  Very it's good at mimicking intelligence. It's not intelligence and it still doesn't work  the same way  That the human brain does in perceiving the world around us  and  I you know like in in self-driving cars  You have to have you have to give it guardrails because  You know it can go very wrong in very unexpected ways  um, you know  For a lot of stuff, you know like things like customer service chat bots. Yeah, it's fine  You know if it makes a mistake, it's not a big deal. Nobody dies  You know in a safety critical system like an airplane or a car  It's a very different scenario. And so you have to build in those  Determine those rules based guidelines that say, you know if the ai makes the wrong decision  You know it you're not going to allow it to go past these these limits  To try to minimize the the consequences of those mistakes

Start time: 7812.42
End time: 7828.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

They launched the xavier chip  You know which had 30 tera ops and they thought okay this is a very good thing  Level four autonomy  Now then a couple years after that they launched the oren which has 250 tera ops  So yeah, this is going to be good enough to do level four autonomy  Now last year they launched the atlan which has a thousand tera ops  And that this is going to be the one, you know, so it they  We don't know what we don't know and this you know  This all this stuff is proving to be a lot harder to do than any other  This all this stuff is proving to be a lot harder to do than anybody really imagined  Yeah, and we need more and more computing power eventually.

I'm in the screen after skill the you know, the genius bar workers who are fixing your aerospace. Sure. Yeah  I'm just you know, bravo. This has been a trend starbucks has  Fought unionizations they've hired as apple did uh law firms to you know discourage  Unionization, uh, and yet starbucks stores are one by one becoming unionized and this is the first apple store to become unionized  And I think that's fine.

Transcript:  The national labor relations board which protects your right to vote for a union  And does very much circumscribe what a company can do to fight a union, although  Companies like amazon have these compulsory  meetings where they you know harangue you basically and give you all the reasons we're family  Well, why would you want to do this to your family?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I throw out a crazy idea here? Yes  Could unionization be the best thing that ever happened to amazon?  Because they have a labor crisis that is so bad. They did a study an internal study  About where they're going to run out of workers they can even hire  and  You know, they're already there in some markets and they're you know, they're thinking about where they open up a warehouse  They're even studying like what's the labor market there? You've got crazy turnover, you know of  more than 100 which means  You know they turn, you know, like the average employee doesn't even last a year in an amazon warehouse  so maybe  if these unions come along and  Insist on better working conditions  Amazon might save more money in you know, not having to  hunt down  You know new recruits and train them then they'll ever pay and sell, you know  Increased salary and benefits that they negotiate with unions just a crazy scenario. Why doesn't amazon do that?

Start time: 8527.86
End time: 8603.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a really good idea. Well the reason why doesn't from amazon's perspective the reason why they're anti-union despite, you know, I mean  Is because amazon's whole ecosystem. It's kind of like our current supply chain crisis  It was all kind of hanging on by a single thread amazon  at every quarter would increase the number of workers or decrease it dramatically depending on their  Kind of needs during the fourth quarter of the year the holiday season amazon needs a considerable amount like they have to add  Hundreds of thousands of people to their workforce every fourth quarter and then normally the first quarter  They fire a lot of those people or pay them to quit is kind of the program or they'll pay you to never work in an amazon place  again  But they can't do that if there's a union  they can't continue to kind of have their cake and eat it too when it comes to the labor market of  Just have enough employees for every single moment and not have too many during the other quarters if they have  An intermediate force that is looking out for the benefits of the workers and looking to make sure that these workers  stay on for more than a year because  That would mean you'd have this huge surplus of workers which isn't good from an efficiency standpoint because you cover amazon paris
