Transcript:  It's time for TWIT This Week in Tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The stories are true, but the names have been changed to protect the ignorant.  Ladies and gentlemen, Patrick Béja is here from France.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Patrick Béja is not my real name, as you just said.  Well, to protect you.  It's okay.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can use a pseudonym here.  Patrick does the incredible Phileas podcast, which is an English language podcast out of  Paris that is kind of like twit euro style, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yep.  It's like the twit of political and international news, kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And actually, you do other shows too.  There's a movie show.  What's the site for all of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can go to frenchspin.com to see all of that.  But maybe I'll tell you a little bit more about a new project that we're developing  at the end of the show.  Sure.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'd love to hear about it.  To regale us with great stories from the good old days.  John C. Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the good old days.  Last week.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  John C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Neither John nor Patrick went to CES, and that's why you both are here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Well, we don't need to go, Leo.  You were there.  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think I killed my staff.  I think they actually were this close to rebelling and leaving me there.  As long as they didn't poison you.  They may have.  I mean, I was sick as a dog.  Really?  Yeah, they may have.  I always get sick.  From what?  Well, I had a meatball sandwich at the Vegas McCarran Field.  That might have been a mistake.  Those meatballs had been there since Wayne Newton was a headliner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They could have been Wayne Newton for all you know.  You know, it's what's left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was either Siegfried or Roy.  I'm not sure.  But it was somebody's.  And they were not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, John C. Dvorak, tell Leo about the mouse clarification.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, does this have to do with the fact that 25 years ago you said the mouse would never  go anywhere?  What is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it just has to do with Philip Elmer DeWitt wrote that piece that got passed around.  And I finally found the original column.  And then I told him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is something we talked about a couple of weeks ago.  What was the piece?  What did he say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because he went back and changed his column in CNN and blanked out all the stuff that  nobody knows where this phony quote came from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, fill this in because not everybody listens to every show.  What was the initial?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me get the link and then so I can look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I remember talking about this, but I'll be honest, I don't really I would fill you in  myself, but I don't really remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just happened like last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Philip Elmer DeWitt is a writer.  He was time.  He worked at Time magazine, covers the Macintosh.  I don't know if he's still at Time magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it maybe still works for.  He must still work for Fortune CNN because he went back and changed the column last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So is this Microsoft upstages Apple's tablet is Fortune's Philip Elmer DeWitt nuts that  story today's proof that there's always someone who doesn't get it comes in the form of Fortune's  usually much more reliable.  Under a laugh inducing headline video, Microsoft upstages Apple's tablet.  Elmer DeWitt writes Steve Ballmer's keynote at the CES show in Vegas ran for more than  an hour and a quarter.  But what got the most attention from the press gathered to watch it with the three minutes  Microsoft CEO spent talking about his answer to the tablet computer Apple is expected to  release in less than three weeks.  That's just it was if that was Microsoft's answer, we don't want to know the question.  Virtually everyone on the planet who saw Ballmer's presentation saw it the same way except for  Phil Elmer DeWitt writes in a subtle dig at his competitors in Cupertino.  He demo demoed the HP slate with an Amazon Kindle version of Stephanie Miller's Twilight.  The book's cover shows a pair of hands cradling an apple.  Is that what you're talking about John or is this another thing you got wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No this here Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Steve Ballmer's keynote at the Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas Wednesday ran for more than  an hour and a quarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the press went here is Google DeWitt Dvorak D E W I T T Dvorak and it's about this eighth  anniversary down January 1984 how critics reviewed the Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh this is when he's talking about you.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now if you see he's changed the column and I thank him for doing this by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is this is another column you know it is the 25th anniversary of the Apple ad  in the Super Bowl which was 1984 January 22nd 1984.  So he wrote a column in Fortune and he's in which he says in anticipating the anniversary  I have some choice quotes from the first wave of critical reviews of the Macintosh and I've  scrolled down you know Byte says the Mac brings us one step closer to the ideal of computer  as appliance creative computing.  John Anderson said you know won't multitask can't use a Mac away from a desk it's slow  not enough ram Bill Gates says anyone who could write a good application on a 128K Mac  deserves a medal.  But he quoted he quoted you see that's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No it's a Francisco Examiner John C. Dvorak keep going it's in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There it is.  Now he's got some stuff struck out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah this is all bogus somebody made up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is not a quote from you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No that's why it's all Xed out.  The only thing I ever said was the Macintosh uses an experimental pointing device called  a mouse there's no evidence that people want to use these things.  Quite famous.  That's all I said.  I didn't say I don't want one of these newfangled devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is what they said you said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll say it in the voice they want you to be saying it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The nature of the personal computer is simply not fully understood by companies like Apple  or anyone else for that matter.  Apple makes the arrogant assumption of thinking that it knows what you want and need  unfortunately leaves the Y out of the equation as in why would I want this.  I don't want one of these.  This is the tech grouch.  I don't want one of these newfangled devices.  I think the tech grouch might say that.  I also think it's completely accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apple does make the assumption that it knows what you want and need.  That's completely true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now John did you get a Mac early on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had one right from the beginning yeah in fact I still have one of the 128's that have  all the signatures inside the box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh that's worth something now.  They had everybody who was on the Mac team sign the mold and then they made the mold.  I bought a 128k Mac March of 1984.  A little after this review came out.  A month after this review came out.  I remember going to Macy's is where I got it because I had a Macy's charge card and it was $2,500.  And I plunked down the plastic and I probably paid for that thing for 10 years.  And you know what in hindsight it was the beginning of the Kool-Aid right.  Because you know you couldn't copy a floppy without 50 swaps.  You couldn't save because you had the Mac write disk in there.  You'd have to create a document and eject the program disk.  Save it then put the program disk back in.  There was no button to eject.  You had to eject in software.  Something Apple still does.  Well actually I guess there's an eject button now in them.  So what do you think now?  Here we are 25 years later.  Will the Mac make it John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It has a good shot at it.  How about the mouse?  Any future there?  The mouse by the way I just wrote a column I think it was in PC Magazine.  And I think you know I think the mouse may eventually with his touchscreen machines coming out.  At some point the mouse may be dead in this whole point moot.  Wow.  Now by the way.  You could retroactively declare yourself correct.  I probably got four miles from that column in terms of bogus PR than anything I've ever done.  Including my dinner with IBM which had a lot of legs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a very good point.  Or you're singing Barney.  Which apparently has one point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Barney thing is well that's in a different league.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  1.2 million views on YouTube from John's three years ago recording a Barney doll singing I Love You in his bathtub.  And that's it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No editing.  No lighting.  Why bother?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why bother?  I don't even know why we do this show.  I'm just going to record my stuffed animals singing and I'm done.  So let's talk about the big story of the week.  And I'm not talking about the Conan O'Brien fracasse.  I'm talking about Google and China.  Now one of the reasons I wanted to get you on Patrick Béja is to get a world point of view on this.  Because in some ways people are saying Google is acting almost as an extra national.  That Google has a foreign policy.  And I'm just wondering how that plays to the rest of the world.  We're going to talk about it in just a second.  Before we do though I want to thank one of our sponsors the folks at Citrix who do GoToMeeting.  A great product for saving time, saving travel.

John is still not there.  I wonder what's going on.  So there he is.  He's removed the modesty panel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the cone of silence.  So I did a column in MarketWatch.  I ran on Friday.  If you go to MarketWatch.com right now for people in the chat room you can see there's a big ugly picture of me there on the front page under commentary.  And that I wrote about this Google situation with a kind of a different take.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's fascinating.  So just to recap, I'm sure everybody's heard this.  Down a little more.  Down a little more.  Down, down.  There it is.  That's a good picture of you.  It's just like this.  Google's at risk by not leaving China.  So here's the deal.  On Tuesday, this has been going on for some time.  Google, in fact, now we know had meetings Christmas Eve.  Eric Schmidt, who the story goes, has been the strongest advocate of Google cooperating with the Chinese authorities with being in China.  They've been there for four years filtering search results at the behest of the Chinese government following the Chinese government's law, we should say.  But never gave any information about dissidence to China.  In fact, was smart.  They kept their servers out of China.  They had those search servers there, but the Gmail servers, the Doc servers were all overseas, so they weren't required to give any information to the Chinese government.  They made it unlike Yahoo.  They managed not to.  But starting at some point, and it depends who you read, could be anywhere from 2001 to July.  In July, hackers started breaking into Google servers in the US trying to steal information about dissidence, trying to steal source code.  Google, around about December, discovered these intrusions, tracked them down.  They clearly believe, according to a blog post that came out on Tuesday, it was the Chinese government doing it.  They say furthermore that as many as 30 US countries have been similarly hacked, that human rights advocates outside of China's Gmail accounts have been compromised through uses of spear phishing, malware, other scams like that.  Not breaking into Google servers, but actually hacking these people with targeted attacks.  And essentially, Google said enough is enough.  If China does this, since China has done this, we have been given no choice.  We are going to give them two choices.  We're going to say change your laws and let us operate unfettered in China or we will exit.  Is that accurate, John, as to what happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what is reported.  I'm not absolutely sure that any of this actually happened.  Why not?  In terms of the China hack.  What do you think happened?  Well, I don't I don't say I don't I don't know what happened because Google's not very forthcoming.  They don't even have a press release out on this.  But I do know this much.  They had to get out of China because if they were going to be forced to give China special treatment for its search engine just so it could be there, which they've been doing for four years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And somebody finally figured out that if they keep doing it this way because they're starting to gain market share on Baidu over the past six months to the point where they were almost getting up to 50 percent, they're up to 40, I think they realized that they would be put themselves in a in a tremendous bind in the future.  If they if the majority of their income started to come from China, because at some point the Chinese could say, hey, wait a minute.  You know, now that you're getting most of your money from us, we want to make mention something to you.  Maybe you should stop.  Take those anti-Chinese websites that you show to people every place else in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe you should stop doing that around the world, not just in China, but around the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and they could lord it over more pull the plug late in the game, which would sink the Google stock and almost ruin it could ruin the company.  Google has to go about to some other way.  So it has to get out of China under these rules.  Very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That makes sense. Patrick, does that make sense to you?  I'm not certain it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, well, maybe they could exit more gracefully in the future, but it seems like a pretty drastic response to be saying goodbye to all that income.  Just now with 40 percent of the market now in China and maybe more in the future, they're saying goodbye now to all that money just because in the future it might become a problem with censorship, especially since everyone else is still doing it.  It doesn't seem to bother everyone else.  There must be some other component to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I think that there were internal divisions at Google.  I mean, Ken Aletta and others are saying that Eric Schmidt always wanted to be in China, continued to want to be in China, even at that Christmas Eve meeting that Sergey Brin, one of the founders of Google, has never been comfortable with being in China and that this gave Sergey the ammunition he needed to finally say, look, guys, we cannot do business with a partner that spies on us, that attacks us, that's attempting to break into our servers.  I think you're right, John.  I mean, I think they probably did look down the road and said, and it's only going to get worse.  But I think that they this gave Sergey the ammunition he needed to finally win this battle with Eric Schmidt and maybe even the board.  Who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I gave him the excuse they needed is what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and the thing, one of the things we raised in the this week in Google show yesterday, one of the things I raised is it's very convenient for Google for a number of reasons.  First of all, they've managed to deflect kind of an important point, which is that they were hacked.  You know, all the attention is on Google taking a stand, people applauding Google for standing up to China, which completely distracts from the bigger issue, which is data was compromised.  The cloud, it was compromised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There was a number of attacks, but were they actually were the attacks successful?  Yes, Google admits they were successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Google says no information about dissidents was released.  The hackers never got into Gmail accounts, but they did manage to get some account information and they apparently got some intellectual property, including source code.  So no, there was a successful attack.  The secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, released a statement that evening, Tuesday evening, saying effectively you've got to explain some explaining to do.  She asked the Chinese government to explain itself, saying that Google's allegations, quote, raise very serious concerns and questions.  The ability to cooperate with confidence in cyberspace is critical in a modern society and economy.  And quote Thursday, she's going to have an address specifically on this.  Google also says this is according to the blog posting by Google chief legal officer David Drummond.  I think it's telling that it was the legal beagle that announced this first quote.  First, this attack was not just on Google.  As part of our investigation, we've discovered that at least 20 other large companies, by the way, that number is now I think 30 from a wide range of businesses and includes Adobe, by the way, including the Internet, finance, technology, and so on.  The Chinese technology, media and chemical sectors have been similarly targeted.  Second, we have evidence to suggest that a primary goal of the attackers was accessing the Gmail accounts of Chinese human right activists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It does.  You know, you were asking what it the way we approached it here in France.  And the first thing that came up, I think maybe it was early in the game when we weren't sure of the scope of the attack and the origin of the attack.  Everyone thought it was China, but we weren't sure as much as we are now.  The first question that came up was, is Google doing this for moral reasons?  Are they upholding their don't be evil?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, that's a good question because they put up with Chinese regulation for four years and now all of a sudden they get a spine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it does.  Certainly there is an ulterior motive, and it might very well be what John is talking about.  But I do think that there is also something else, which is somewhere in the company, possibly, you know, Sergey, there is a moral compass in a way that there isn't in any other company, because I don't think given China's market that it would even be a question at Microsoft.  I mean, maybe I'm wrong, but can you even imagine Microsoft thinking, well, you know what, the Chinese government isn't super playing super nice with us, so we're going to leave and leave all that pile of money on the ground?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat room is asking a good question. Isn't this almost a tantamount to an act of war?  You know, it's funny is that.  Well, here's the funny thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How's it an act of war? I go to China, visit. I don't like the place I leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, the act of war from China attacking our infrastructure.  And I'll tell you, here's the funny thing is that we discovered.  I remember this in September that the federal government announced that American infrastructure, the electrical grid, independent electrical companies had been attacked that they found Trojan horses on many of those computers.  It was at the time, I think it was widely suspected it was China. Of course, China has that, you know, had that operation hacking the Dai Lai llama.  And and there was not nearly the fewer that there is now.  It's as if, you know, hey, you can attack our electrical grid, which really is an act of war.  Go ahead, but attack Google. Hey, don't mess with Google.  I think it's a little easy for Google at this point because they did.  They deflect from the fact that they were hacked.  It also if Google's got there's a lot of attention lately with people.  I don't know how it is in France, but I suspect this is there the same there with people saying, I'm not sure if we trust Google.  And and I think Google needed something like this to to kind of reassert their moral authority.  Oh, you can trust us. So it's very convenient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. The whole which makes me think the whole thing is a charade.  But that said, by the way, we also do this.  The Americans do this kind of stuff to always nosing around other people's systems.  That may be why we didn't say anything. Huh?  But, you know, the fact that the Chinese is the Chinese what you're telling what their end point messages is the cloud is not safe and the Chinese can't seem to do this without getting caught.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, or they were doing it a long time and Google finally sussed to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's actually what I also suggest in the column that has been going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A lot of experts say has been going on since 2001 to that in that to that extent in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know. I don't know.  You know, lots of unknown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, in France, and I think this is true of the EU in general, this mistrust of Google is not new.  In fact, the EU has been going after Google.  In fact, the French government said it's going to on Thursday that it was thinking of taxing Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, that's a hilarious story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But yes, this is this is this is OK.  Now I'm not one of those guys that says France socialist bad.  But this is a little bit of a stereotype.  The French government is considering a Google tax that would help level the playing field between Internet portals that offer free content and the music publishing industries that lost revenue because of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not exactly a the government proposing this.  Sarcosi said it, didn't he?  Well, not exactly.  There's basically a study that was conducted by a guy who works for the music industry about the ways that we can improve the cultural offerings on the Internet.  And one thing that he suggested, amongst many others, was this idea that, you know, someone is making lots of money on the Internet.  Let's tax them to do something else, to, you know, to promote music and other things.  And it is I mean, it might get somewhat proposed in a law somewhere in the government, but it's so completely asinine that the EU is never going to let that fly.  It's ridiculous. It has no grounds whatsoever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He also said the possibly dominant position Google has acquired in the online ad market should be officially investigated for any unfair practices.  There's definitely an anti Google and I would suppose it's anti US sentiment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I think it is. It's this guy who is a music industry guy who is anti- That was Sarcosi.  That was your president talking.  OK, he is not the super biggest fan of the Internet either.  It's just, you know, he's the guy who pushed for the three strikes law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But specifically- Which went into effect this week as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, it did. Yeah. It's a catastrophe. It's a disaster.  But it's never going to be actually enforceable.  Did you see that story about the three strikes law thing?  They actually for their logo through a series of missteps ended up using illegally a font that didn't belong to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the poster for the law broke copyright law?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The logo for the government body called Adobe was designed by a firm to use a font that belongs to Orange, you know, the telecom company.  And they designed the logo with that font.  And when the logo came out, it was like, well, strike one.  So this is a disaster.  The Google tax thing is never it's most probably not even constitutional in the concept.  Why would you tax Google on the Internet and not people, you know, the ad companies in the street who display ads on posters and banners and stuff like that?  It's never going to go well. I think it's never going to go through.  But it's it pretty much shows you how ridiculous we are when we go about thinking of these things.  And more than France and socialism, I think it shows how people in this country and probably others don't understand the way it works.  They don't know what this Internet thing is and they still know how they can make money out of it.  So they're thinking, let's take the money from the guy who actually makes money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why not? I like to see a per click tax.  It's not much. Just a quarter, quarter cent per click.  Like one cent per click.  Yeah, do the rest of the show with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, Patrick will stun me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I'm used to it. Yeah.  But going back to the Google thing, I have a question.  Do you guys does this Google getting out of China for whatever reason?  If it's an excuse, if it's a good point at this at this point to get out for various reasons,  does it make you like Google more or does it not change your opinion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, no, it makes me like Google more.  I think in fact, I would say if I you pulled the blogosphere on Tuesday, it was a resounding applause for Google.  Right on Google. You're doing the right thing. Go for it, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't get behind that kind of thinking personally.  I like Google just the way I like Google. I don't like a more.  Well, don't you think, though, this is Google? I have to say.  And and and if a better search engine came along, I bail out in a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But now, now, first of all, let me underscore this is more than search.  When Google pulls out of China, it's Google Docs, it's Google Mail, it's Google Voice.  It's all of this. It's all of the Google tools.  Now, you may say, yeah, Google's only a less than half of the search market.  But let me tell you, the intelligentsia, the university students, they in the cities of China, they use these Google tools heavily.  That's why China's breaking into Gmail. They're trying to get the dissidents email accounts.  So that's a big deal. These people, you know, that's a bit.  What if Google pulled out of the US? What if you couldn't use Google Maps anymore?  Would you would it be a problem, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it wouldn't be a problem.  It would be a problem. You'd use MapQuest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, in that case, John, let me ask you this.  What does Google at this point with this getting out of China,  which China was basically the only thorn in their side that people could point at and saying they're not doing that right.  They're not following their don't be evil motto.  Everything else they're doing is either, you know, open source data liberation front.  Everything they're doing is trying to be open and and and, you know, the way they should be doing things.  Is there anything that you could tell Google except, you know, the big spooky thing?  We don't trust Google because they have all our info, which I agree with.  But what else could they be doing to earn your trust and love?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're doing fine. They've got my trust and love.  I don't like that. I don't do the doc stuff and I don't do I use the Google search engine.  It works great. But I mean, is there anything more they could do to impress me?  You might want to ask that question. I don't know.  I think the Nexus phone is kind of neat, except it's so slippery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not that slippery. I heard you talking about it being slippery.  It's no more slippery than the iPhone. The iPhone was dropped a couple of times already.  I have to. But I dropped the iPhone the first day I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You just have to hold on tight. You can see that's the problem with the Nexus.  When you hold on tight, you touch the screen and because it doesn't have dual touch or whatever, it shorts it out and you can't do anything.  It does, by the way, you have to hold it weird like this. No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The operating system does have multi touch. The phone hardware has multi touch.  Hey, I heard an interesting rumor and this was from a correspondent who does not wish to be named.  He works at Google who said, I'll tell you what really happened.  Apple, with whom Google still has a very good relationship, said, can you guys not put multi touch in the phone for a little while?  Our patents for multi touch are very weak. We don't want them challenged at this point.  We'd like and I don't know why Google. It's a good story.  It's a good story. I don't know why Google would exceed, except that maybe they still like Apple.  But I can prove that as multi touch because you can use multi touch on the keyboard.  There are applications that support multi touch.  There's even a browser that supports multi touch that you could put on the Nexus one and the Droid, by the way, which also has multi touch.  I love this phone, John. I've gave it. I have officially replaced my iPhone with the Nexus one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You moved over. You dropped the iPhone for this thing. Yeah, and I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So why did they only sell twenty thousand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you know, it's because they don't have it.  They don't have Apple's marketing cloud data.  I mean, the iPhone, I think probably for most users, the iPhone probably still.  We kind of debated this yesterday. Jeff Jarvis, who's kind of he's not a hacker type.  He's uncomfortable with the with the Google phone. But Gina and I loved it.  I think it's for people who don't want to mess with their phone.  The iPhone's very straightforward, very simple.  But if you want to have a, you know, if you want to folders on your desktop, you want to have any kind of configuration capabilities.  If you want to have an open store, if you want to have multitasking, this phone, it's so fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a gigahertz. I'm not saying I don't like the phone.  I just don't like the fact that it's slippery. A get a case.  And when I get a case, I'll be a happy camper. I ordered a case right away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I ordered a silicone case, but the iPhone is just as slippery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It really is. So the thing about it is the is that what I do like is that when you're doing SMS,  you can just push the little microphone and then say somebody.  Isn't that the coolest? And then you don't have to deal with it.  It works great. Here, I'll do it. And the other thing is pretty and it's amazingly accurate.  The other thing I do like about I like the turn by turn. It's very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, got built in turn by turn GPS free that when you arrive, it gives you a screen view where you arrive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It uses the Google map that little Volkswagen that takes the photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The integration into Google is significant. I mean, it's huge.  All right. I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to compose a text to you, John. Here we go.  So instead of using the typing, I'm just going to speak into it.  Hey, John, how are you today? Question mark. I am fine. Period.  See if it's that. All right. What are you laughing at?  I'm sorry. You can probably do it in French, actually.  Hey, John, how oh, look, it did. Are you too?  It did it like like I'm a kid, like texting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I don't know why. At least it figured out your personality, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. No, I've been using it for all week.  Well, not all week. I got back from CES on Sunday.  So, yeah, I guess all week for and I and I started doing the texting in the last couple of days using the dictation.  I love it. Now, it's not good for driving because you have to fiddle with it sometimes.  But, you know, do a little editing.  But I just I think this phone is spectacular in so many ways.  I'm just really happy with it. Great camera. Great video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So will you be still be happy with it when the fourth iPhone comes out?  Talk to me then. What do you figure?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leo's fickle. Talk to me then. Well, look, my job is not to be loyal.  That's not my job to be loyal to a platform or a device. He's fickle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He just jumps on whatever bandwagon is right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I try it all. And if something's I kept trying iPhone replacements that I did the Palm Prix, the Storm, the Instinct, even the Droid.  And I never replaced the iPhone until this came along. I'm not fickle.  I go with the best. I don't have loyalty to a device because my job is to tell you what the best is.  And I don't even think it's the best. I don't want to hear anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So laying it on. That's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that your job? So I went back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I still I like the Nexus phone, but here's another problem I have with it.  So I did. I did kind of a stress test with it and I cranked it way up.  Somebody in the chat room just said, be careful, Devorek.  He'll pull a Mike Arrington on you. Screw you, Devorek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So by the way, that video still has one one thousandth the number of views of Barney singing in your bathtub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I have. So here's the deal.  Maybe I should make you for weeks this morning thing.  But anyway, the I loaded up, I put the Wi-Fi on, I put the GPS on, I loaded it up to the gills with with everything.  It lasted three and a half hours under full load, which I thought was kind of nice.  But just under just the average use and still drops dead after a day.  The old Nokia N70, E71, N71, which one it is that I normal my normal regular phone.  That thing goes on for a week without having to recharge.  I'm always forgetting to charge. Give it up, John.  No, no smartphone is going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, it's got an OLED screen, which is a little bit more economical, but it's not no smartphone is going to go a week anymore.  No phone is going to go a week anymore. That's just old school, man.  You charge it every night. What's wrong with that?  I forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You forget. So here's John.  What I do is, OK, I have a dresser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When I take off my clothes, I put my wallet and my keys on the dresser and I plug in my phone.  And then the next morning, it's all ready to go for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What we need is wireless recharging.  Like the pre-hack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is such a thing. There is such a thing.  You can buy third party things.  I'm grumpy and I forget.  I don't really have a problem with that.  I kind of expect that any smartphone is going to have to be recharged.  It's got to get through a day. That's kind of the minimum.  I've been hearing that it doesn't get through the day.  It's about the same as the pre and the iPhone.  They're all kind of like that, depending on how you use it.  When you get a new phone, you turn on all the buttons.  You do what Dvorak did.  But under normal use, I find it's exactly a day.  But again, I plug it in when I get to work.  It's not an issue for me.  And it has an interchangeable battery.  You don't like that? Get a second battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, at least you can do that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I really think this is finally the Android operating system coming of age.  I guess that's my point.  With 2.1, it has come of age.  I liked the Droid a lot. I thought it was this close.  And Nexus One gets it right there.  I was very impressed.  And I think that I would like to see this do well.  I mean, I do have some advocacy, a little bit of juice for it.  Because if this phone does well, there will be more applications for it.  Oh, wait. I know what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What?  This week in Nexus.  No, no, no. We already do it this weekend.  Another podcast. You're not doing enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If I were going to do a podcast, I would do a cell phone podcast.  You're right. I think that that's something that we could probably do.  And you're absolutely right.  I'm going to see what happens in March.  Hey, you know what? January 26th, the week from Tuesday,  if Apple announces something spectacular that's better than this,  then I'll replace this.  I go with whatever's the best today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it 26th or 27th?  Well, no one knows exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's all a rumor. Apple hasn't said anything.  But we will be there whatever day it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I hope Google brings the Nexus phone in France so that we can tax it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Another opportunity for revenue.  I don't think fickle is the right word.  I try them all. I buy them all.  I don't get free versions. I try them all.  And if something's better, I tell you it's better. That's all.  And if it's not, I set it aside.  And I've been using the iPhone for three years, which is a measure of its success.  But finally, I found something that is, I would say, as good as,  depends on who you are.  As I said, do you use an iPhone yet, John?  No, you're still a Nokia guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I use a Nokia and then I also use the Nexus.  I would use an iPhone, but I hate AT&T to such an extreme that I refuse to.  And I have principles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, this is what worries me about the rise of the Google phone.  You can install an application from anywhere, which everyone has been saying,  yes, this is the way we should do it.  It's like a computer. You can do that.  We don't need to go through the app store.  We have how many tens of millions of zombie computers  working for whatever ghost network?  Whoever thought that was a good idea?  Who wants to replicate this on phones?  This is going to happen. You know it's going to happen.  Guess what? It already happened.  Well, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Android marketplace, to be a developer for Android,  you merely need to sign up and that's it.  And there's no approval process.  Unlike Apple, there's no approval process at all.  It's open and I think that that's a strength.  However, it's also a security risk.  A person with the handle Droid09 uploaded into the Android market  and was there for a day or two, a program called First Tech Credit Union.  If you were a customer of the First Tech Credit Union,  you might have downloaded it, saying,  oh great, my bank has put up an Android application.  According to a warning on the credit union site,  the app was malware.  We recently learned that a fraudster developed a rogue Android smartphone app.  It creates a shell of mobile banking apps that tries to gain access  to a customer's financial information, said the bank.  Please note, this attack didn't target First Tech accounts.  Accessing your account from your phone's browser still is completely secure.  The app is down, but this is exactly what you were saying, Patrick.  This is the risk of having an open marketplace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And this is bad enough, but you can also operate outside of the Android market, right?  If you put a link on a website, you can go there through the phone and sell the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. Now, to do that, you have to go in the settings on the phone and say,  I am willing, and it gives you a risk, a security warning and everything,  I am willing to get applications from third parties.  But that's ironic because it doesn't take much to put one on the marketplace.  Obviously.  So, you're given openness.  I think probably I would expect, and I think it needs to be,  that Google or somebody makes kind of a vetted marketplace where these are secure.  But I like the choice, and I think that's the key.  You don't have a choice, really, unless you jailbreak the iPhone,  which is not only an onerous process,  but it reduces its reliability and causes all sorts of other issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's true.  But I think you do need a sort of label, approved, proven safe, whatever,  reviewed for the app so that people know that you can, you know,  maybe even only let people download approved apps if they don't change that setting in the menu.  Because if you don't, pretty much you're going to start needing an antivirus  and a firewall on your phone and stuff like that.  That would be horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There have been a lot of complaints about customer service.  There are people who got the Google phone, the Nexus One, and discovered that T-Mobile sucked.  Shock, you know, which it does, apparently, in some areas.  It works quite well here. I'm actually getting 3G reliably.  I haven't dropped a single call, which I can't say is the case for the iPhone here.  If you buy, I have to say, if you buy a T-Mobile version of the Nexus One,  not only will you face potential early termination fees from T-Mobile,  but Google has its own equipment recovery fee, $350 if you cancel within the first 120 days.  That's not so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you back this up a minute? If you do what with T-Mobile?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  According to Engadget.  Okay, I'm going to read the story. Ross Miller posted it on Engadget, January 12th.  Here's another reason to consider going the unlocked route with the Nexus One,  which is what I did, by the way, because I want to be able to take it to Europe and so forth.  In addition to having the AT&T, non-3G, and international GSM option,  as a number of people have noticed, Google has its own early termination fee equivalent,  here called the equipment recovery fee.  In the terms of sale, they say they will charge you, and I don't know if they actually are doing it.  $350 if you cancel within the first 120 days.  This is in addition to any fees imposed by the carrier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why would anybody not just buy an unlocked phone then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, because T-Mobile's got its $200 ETF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So where is this coming from? Do other carriers do that as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, in the States, all carriers have an ETF, which is usually $175 or more.  That is because they're subsidizing the phone. So this is for people who buy this subsidized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, once you terminate, you should be able to get an unlocked code for any phone you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the law, but very rarely in practice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, nobody ever asked to do it because they don't get the fact that the phone's locked in the first place.  But I have a number of phones that I've usually given to the kids eventually,  that are past their due date, and you just call them up and they give you the unlocked code.  You unlock the phone, you can do anything with it after that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This one's unlocked, it was $529, but it's unlocked.  And then you can get a month-to-month T-Mobile account, so you don't even have an ETF from T-Mobile.  So that I thought was a good attractive. That's kind of my like how it is in Europe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. That's exactly the way it is in Europe.  And you do have an ETF for the carrier, but you don't have an ETF from the manufacturer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's unheard of. I've never heard of that before. That's just bizarre.  And I don't know if Google's enforcing it.  Lots of complaints, though, on the boards about Google's lack of customer support,  people were having trouble with T-Mobile, have no one to talk to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apparently, you can't call anyone at Google. You have to send an email, right?  Right. They don't have phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't use phones. You use Google Voice.  Yeah. That's one thing I love about this.  Which, by the way, is one of those things I do like from Google quite a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wish they would open this up because this is one of the strongest selling points for the Nexus One.  Maybe this is why they haven't sold that many.  Because you can get an invite maybe if somebody you know has Google Voice,  but there's no other way that I know of to get a Google Voice account.  I happened to have one because I was a Grand Central customer.  And this works with Google Voice to the point that you replace the voicemail with Google Voice.  You can even replace all the calling with Google Voice if you want.  I have it set so that international calls go through Google Voice, which is a lot cheaper than T-Mobile.  And then I don't use T-Mobile's voicemail. I use Google Voice.  So all the messages come to my phone just like visual voicemail plus text, which is something Apple doesn't do.  So I think that's another selling point. Unfortunately, you have to have somebody email me and say,  well, that's nice, but who has Google Voice? And not everybody does, alas.  I have Google Voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ask around. Most people you can get it. There's invites all over the place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I bought a few on eBay actually.  For like $3.50.  That's a good deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got an invite and got a US number. And now there's talk of Google Voice maybe coming to Europe.  And I'm afraid I'm going to be stuck with my US number stuck to my account. And I just opened it to test it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no. They have a $10 fee. You can change it to anything you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, thank you, John. You just saved my Google Voice life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When you use your Google Voice, is it as if you were calling from the US?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm actually never using it. I did it twice to test it.  That's cool.  I'm really hoping they bring it to Europe, but apparently it's not in the books for right now.  They've been talking about it recently a little bit.  That's definitely one of the things that would put a phone over the iPhone if a service like this was available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, spectacular. Apparently they're telling me in the chat room that somebody said,  I just went to voice.google.com, requested an invitation and got one within a week.  So I guess they are a little bit more liberal with these now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they just needed to get their capacity up. It's an amazing product.  We don't even have any long distance service anymore. We just use Google Voice. The whole family does.  Because Google Voice is a long distance service of sorts that's free.  And there goes my AT&T. I don't have to deal with them anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The only negative I've noticed, have you noticed this? There's some lag in the phone calls. There's a lot of latency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No. I've never noticed that.  It's like a half second to a second. Quality is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, this is what I'm talking about. What other company has improved our lives as much as...  It seems like I'm in love with Google, which admittedly I'm a little bit.  But they have really changed our lives a lot more than most companies in the past five, maybe even to ten years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I'd say so. In fact, you could make a case in the States that both AT&T and Verizon recently this week announced  a drop in the cost of their all-in-one programs, you know, all-you-can-eat programs.  And I think that you can trace it directly to the fact that T-Mobile introduced this plan, you know, this all-you-can-eat plan,  very inexpensive plans that are month to month.  And I think that you can say that they did that because they knew they were getting the Google phone,  and this is basically a plan for the Google phone.  So in a way, you can indirectly say that Google is absolutely making a strong impact on the wireless industry in the US.  Prices are going down because of them.  Good.  Article in MobileBeat about the chip in the Nexus One.  It's the Audience A1026 Voice Processor chip.  This is an additional chip that apparently makes a huge difference in the quality.  It's a DSP in the quality of the phone calls.  The real-time processing brings up the human voice, brings down the background noise, brings down digital echoes.  So they actually built in a voice processing chip in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's got a microphone in the back of the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's got two microphones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's basically like a noise reduction system that works like it does for these high-end headphones, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, there's a microphone hole there, and I don't know if that's a microphone.  That's a speaker.  This is the speaker here, and then there's a microphone on the bottom.  So I guess this is picking up background noise.  That's kind of, that's a clever design.  I haven't noticed the sound quality one way or the other because I very rarely make phone calls.  For me, I do much more texting and emailing and all that than I do phone calls.  Let's see, other stories we're going to get to in just a bit.  There is quite a bit of news.  In fact, I'd love to get a kind of CES from the outside point of view from Patrick and John.  But before we do that, I want to mention our friends at carbonite.com.  It's a backup solution, a great backup solution that I've been using since the bad, dim, dark day about three years ago  when I lost ten Gizwiz shows by accidental deletion and had to call Dick DiBartolo and say,  you know those great shows we just recorded?  Can we do those again?  And then right about the same time, it was the same mistake I made.  I turned on Windows Media Player and it said, do you want to look for songs on the hard drive?  I said, yes.  It cataloged them all.  And then I thought it was like iTunes where if I deleted the names of the songs, it wouldn't delete the songs, except that it did.  So not only did I lose ten Gizwizs, but I also lost, it happened twice, an interview for Floss Weekly.  I lost it once.  I called the guy back.  We did it again.  I lost it again.  I had to send him a fruit basket.  I felt so bad and we did it a third time.  I'm not going to say names, but it was after that that I said, look, I got to have a solution so that I don't lose podcasts anymore.  And I discovered carbonite.com.  I've been using it ever since.  So what happens, you can go there right now and install it.  You go to carbonite, C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E.com.  You don't need a credit card.  You just use the coupon code TWIT and you can install it.  You'll be able to try it free for 15 days.  Immediately, it starts backing up your data.  It uses AES 256-bit encryption.  You choose the key so no one can get into it, scrambles it up, then uses 128-bit SSL for extra security to upload it to their servers.  Now, it's using your bandwidth.  So depending on how much data you have, how fast your connection is, how much you're using the computer, it could take a little while to get that data up there.  Because up there, it's automatically backing up all those precious documents, your personal files, your email, your photos.  You don't have to worry, by the way, about size.  I back up gigabytes.  As long as it's on the internal hard drive in your computer, you have unlimited backup and it's less than five bucks a month.  It's a great deal.  I want you to try carbonite free right now.  Go to C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E.com.  This is great for a laptop.  C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E.com.  Use the offer code Leo.  You'll get two weeks to try it for free.  Mac and Windows, by the way.  And after you try, and I really want you to try it first.  Make sure it's something that fits your needs.  If you decide to buy, we're going to give you two months free with the offer code TWIT.  So use that offer code TWIT and give carbonite a try.  It's a great backup solution.  It's not enough to back up locally.  You got to back up offsite.  And if you're backing up offsite, do it right with carbonite.  We thank them for their support of our network, our entire network.  So by the way, just one more Nexus One story.  Did you see that Wozniak was doing an interview on NBC?  And he said, when they asked him, what's your favorite gadget?  He said, oh, I like the Google phone.  Steve Wozniak.  He did?  Yeah.  He said, it's the latest one and it's a non-Apple product.  It just came out yesterday.  I love Woz because he's just like, you know what?  He's guileless.  He's fickle.  He's not fickle.  He just says it like he sees it.  And by the way, later he said, but I still have two iPhones because he got a little bit of, I'm sure heat.  I'm sure Steve said, Woz, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says, we need up at the cottage, by the way, when I'm showing you.  What's that?  In case of this.  Is that a Bordeaux Chateau Lynch bagel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Lunch bags.  Lunch bags.  Is that a good Bordeaux?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, don't drink it.  Whatever you do, keep a cork in it, Dvorak, because I want to try it.  You keep telling me how great Bordeauxs are.  And I don't know if I've ever had a great Bordeaux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Patrick, you've had a couple of them.  All those Layoville wines are great Bordeaux.  The Layoville are good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.  They were very good.  And they're your wine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, they've got your name on them.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I should drink more Layoville.  That's the name of my blog.  Patrick, do you drink Bordeaux?  Do you drink wine at all?  I'm the worst French person you will ever find.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't drink wine.  Well, I drink, you know, like everyone else.  But you hate baguettes, too?  I hate the baguettes.  Come on.  Baguettes.  I mean, that's unavoidable.  I hate the baguette.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is disgusting bread.  No, you love it.  But yeah, who could not love a baguette?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  When it's just warm, it comes out of the oven in the morning when you go get it at the bakery.  That little chef Rochot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you're set.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, meatloaf and Bordeaux go together great.  Do they?  Somebody asked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We did a meatloaf.  Our Munchcast show was about meatloaf right before Twitter.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Now I'm hungry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what other news items do we have here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there was this thing in Haiti.  Did you see?  Now Twitter went crazy with the Haiti thing.  In fact, it's funny because two days before Twitter,  Ev Williams announced that Twitter had had its busiest day ever.  Just for no apparent reason.  There was no big news story or anything, just growth.  And then he said, and tomorrow will be even bigger.  And then the earthquake happens.  And of course, Twitter goes crazy.  There's emergency messages on Twitter.  I don't think there's a lot of Twitter and coming out of Haiti, maybe some of the NGOs.  But what?  There's a couple.  Some of it.  And then what I thought was great was the immediate retweeting of,  you know, text the word Haiti to 90999 and donate 10 bucks to the American Red Cross.  There was some misinformation that also got Twittered,  like the phone companies are going to take a lot.  None of the cellular companies were taking any cut out of that.  It all went straight to the Red Cross.  They were at the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Were they?  Charging for, well, they were just taking the charge for the message.  Oh, all right.  Some people said was cynical.  And then I think there was a comment on BOL this week.  Someone said, well, when you send a check to a charitable organization,  no, but I mean, the post office is not going to write off the price of the stamp.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In any case, I think that they wised up and they're not taking any fee for that.  And here's the great thing.  So this is not the first time the Red Cross did this in what was it?  When was Katrina?  2004, 2005, they did it and raised $200,000.  After the Asian tsunami, they did it again, raised $400,000.  To date, in four or five days since the terrible earthquake in Haiti, $11 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Went to $11 million now?  I thought it was six, like two days ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  $11 million as of this morning.  That's interesting.  Well, I think it says something, first of all, that people are texting more, right?  More people are comfortable with that.  I think Twitter has a lot to do with it.  I have to think that the word spread on Twitter.  And I did it.  I immediately did it.  It's just so easy to do.  So I think that that's kind of encouraging.  That's a good gimmick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The other amazing thing is that Twitter didn't go down at all.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, something's going on there.  That's more amazing than anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We haven't had a Twitter is down story in a while.  I think Twitter might be, maybe they've solved this.  Maybe they're reliable.  Looks like it anyway.  Could it possibly be?  Microsoft says, this can't be right, that it's legal to rent windows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a big story that broke last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they're going to start a new rental SKU that comes out of nowhere.  It's weird.  Why would they even?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, first of all, I don't even understand renting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you remember the olden days when they used to have vinyl albums?  And nowadays with the DVD store, you go in and you rent the DVD.  Oh, but what do you rent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, I'm going to go to the software store and rent Microsoft Word for the night?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  What do you mean?  Yeah.  Make sure you bring it back after a couple of days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't forget to rewind.  Who's going to rent Microsoft Word for a night?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I get to rewind the disk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I borrowed Windows 7 for the weekend.  We had a great time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, you know what it's going to be?  It's going to be for companies that have projects that are going to take like a couple of months  that they need to set up an office or a department for,  and they need to rent the thing for a couple of months.  And then they, I don't know, give it up or the serial number deactivates,  or you can't use it in two locations at the same time.  Actually, this doesn't make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It makes no sense at all.  It's a nice try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have to think that what this really is is Microsoft's always kind of wanted to charge a monthly fee.  That's what it's really all about.  Right.  They don't want to sell you software.  They want you to really think of your software as a subscription.  And is this kind of, John, you think this is a way of getting that through?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, you know, they may.  I think that's part of it.  I think they want to get people into a different frame of mind and then turn it into the whatever the software is ephemeral.  Software as a service.  Right.  I think it's a huge blunder, by the way.  You know, if Microsoft had its act together, every time something like this China attack on Google came around,  Microsoft could make hay by saying, hey, if you were using shrink wrap, you wouldn't have a problem like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think Microsoft wants to point attention out to its security issues, especially since I think one of the major exploits was Internet Explorer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is how they cracked into all of these computers was through Aurora, the well-known Microsoft flaw in Internet Explorer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then another one is present in seven and eight.  It's not just a six thing.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, you know, IE seven and eight.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's in all of them.  Hey, John, what happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your picture went away.  Are you?  And I think it's because of a setting I did.  And I'm trying to go back and unset it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like the lights went out in your room.  I thought I thought it was just that the sun went down and it was going to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't see.  That's it.  It's not turned out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not getting anywhere with this with this trick of mine to fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, let me let me call you back because once you once you do what you did, I don't think you can restart the video.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you give me one second to get to the tools, put some clothes on, then turn on the lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK.  Oh, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here he comes.  He's coming back.  Yeah, but I didn't get to go under the fix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you're still in it.  Well, just you know, you could turn on a light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it just look, watch a maternal light, a really bright light on right now.  Ready?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just so people understand, it looks like the warm glow of a fireplace across the room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can leave this bright light on, I guess.  But, you know, I know what the setting is.  I know what I did wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right.  Well, go ahead.  I'll tell you what we could take a break.  Everybody, you can go get a baguette and a glass of wine, Patrick.  John can fiddle with his settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I go base my meat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are you making dinner tonight, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm just going to eat.  I'm going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, we did.  We just did a podcast about meatloaf, as I mentioned, and I am famished.  I just got my mouth.  Do they meatloaf in France?  Probably not.  They probably turn their nose up.  It's called a terrine.  Oh, terrine.  It's like pate.  Kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, kind of a little bit.  We have Subway meatballs, though.  That's delicious.  Do not eat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is so sad.  I am so bummed out.  Do you have Quiznos?  Is there a Quiznos?  Is there Quiznos in France?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I don't know that one.  At least there's hope yet.  Wendy's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Taco Bell?  No, not in France.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a big mac.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And your secret sauce is different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That can't be.  It can be.  It's varied.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's very different.  I mean, it's a very different taste.  It's a very different taste.  It's a very different taste.  It's a very different taste.  It's a very different taste.  It's a very different taste.  I had one in Beijing.  It's exactly like an American Big Mac.  Exactly.  In fact, you know what the big fast food in China is?  Kentucky Fried Chicken.  They love their KFC.  The big thing in France in McDonald's is the Royal Deluxe, which is especially done for

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  French tastes.  We don't even have that.  It's like more hamburger.  It's a hamburger fit for Louis XIV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Royal Deluxe.  There, that looks good, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a big improvement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got the bright light on me because I, yeah, it's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're almost there.  But it's better than the old bright light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's dancing.  It's a disco, disco, Dvorak.  I want to be a disco, Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  New version of the Crank of the Tech Grouch is online, by the way.  Somebody should check it out.  Techgrouch.mevio.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is that clown up to now?  He is just so grouchy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, I had a question about the rental SKU.  Yes.  I'm sorry.  Maybe we're onto something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, you're bringing us right back to where we ought to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought that was John's job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's happening?  Yeah, no, John's, he's turned into the Distractor-in-Chief.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I just wanted to know if any of you guys, either of you guys knew how much it was going  to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  I'm sorry.  Hold on.  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mevio seems to have snuck into our feed.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How do I stop that?  There's no stop button.  You can turn it off.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's the Techgrouch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Brought to you by Crest.  Now, that's weird.  Wait a minute.  Does the toothpaste company know they're sponsoring a guy with no teeth?  Of course not.  That guy has no teeth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's been reported that some teacher back in Arizona has hooked his computers from the  school district up to look for aliens.  Now they're claiming it cost the school district a million bucks for him to do this.  They fired him.  But who billed for the million?  The aliens?  Hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  What is that hanging in his beard?  That is not...  That's the mic.  That is not appetizing.  How do you mic a guy like that?  That looks like there's a chunk of food in your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at it.  Hey, the still's gonna blow up if you keep the heat that high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John, John, don't put the mic in the beard.  You put the mic on the shirt, not in the beard.  Just a little technical tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Get off the set.  Truth be told, I was listening to that trance music on the iPhone.  Wow, I had a trip.  Got any suggestions for the show?  Send a self-addressed stamp beaver to techgrouchatmevio.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See that sound?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the microphone in your beard.  Brought to you by Crest.  That's pretty amazing.  Mevio gets proctored and gambled to do ads.  That's a good thing.  Oh, it's really good.  I'm thrilled for you.  They don't have Ford.  Hello.  Happy for you.  We don't have Ford anymore either.  I don't know if it has anything to do with this, but we had a Ford guy in the show last  week at CES.  I wanted to be on Twitter, but I probably should have been more clear that if you're  on Twitter, you can't talk about Ford.  You have to be like a geek.  It just ended up being a big ad.  The chat room was going crazy saying, this is like a program like that.  I said, all right.  I let him go and we cut it out.  Ever since, we don't have any Ford ads.  Oh, I'm sorry.  No, I think it was the schedule ran out.  I do have an Audible ad.  They love us.  They love us.  Audible.com slash twit two.  Your chance to get two.  Not one, but two.  Free books from audible.com.  I listen to Audible books all the time.  Just started.  I'm really enjoying it.  Mary and Bradley Zimmer's The Mists of Avalon.

If you go to audible.com slash twit two right now, browse around, take a look at all the  fantastic books on audible.com.  70,000 titles.  All the best sellers.

You know who loves audible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who loves audible?  Mothers.  Really?  Mothers love audible.  I got my mom an iPod a few years ago and then I got her an audible account.  It's the kind of thing that mothers say, I don't need it.  You know, I don't really get it.  I don't know what it's for.  I don't need it.  I'm fine.  And then a couple of months after that, they come back to you and go like, I can't live without it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, my mom loves audiobooks.  She really does.  That's actually a very good idea.  I get mom a couple of things.  A Netflix account, she loves that.  Audio books.  And she and I got her an Internet radio and she's loving that.  So, you know, Rob Glazier, probably pretty well.  John C. Dvorak, former CEO, founder of Real Networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also the guy who bought the Professional Bowling Association.  Did he really?  Yep.  You're kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He made his money at Microsoft, right?  He was a Microsoft guy for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he was.  But I think he really made most of his money with Real Networks.  And then because I think they, I don't know, they got a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In 2000, well, he was spent at Real for 16 years, created the Real Player,  which was kind of the bane of the Internet.  Everybody hates, some say the most hated program on the Internet.  I would be in that camp.  I would agree too.  It would have to be close to that, right?  Because it's just downloaded so much crap on your computer.  And it wasn't a great audio format.  I'm so glad we've gotten away from it and gone to MP3.  And every once in a while, I'll browse to an old website, like Old Time Radio or  Audio Air Checks, and the guys did everything in real audio.  And it's like, you just go, oh, please, no, no, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, luckily, if you have that Video Land program, it'll play the real audio stuff.  And then it'll also convert it.  It just sounds so bad, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So bad.  I remember Bonzi, Bonzi Buddy.  Yeah, it was just terrible.  But it was, you know, to be fair, from an earlier era where people didn't have the bandwidth,  they needed something that could stream audio in very low quality bandwidth and video too.  In 2005...  That's true, but it wasn't the problem, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the problem was what?  That it was a lot of crapola that you got when you got the real player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, the program, when you downloaded it and installed it, you pretty much said goodbye  to half your hard drive and computer, you know, CPU cycle.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it really started to go downhill for real when MP3s became popular.  And then in 2006, when YouTube emerged, that's it.  That put the nail in the coffin.  Fortunately, Reel had sued Microsoft.  And for a billion dollars, they settled when Microsoft agreed to pay Reel $761 million  in cash and services and promote Rhapsody on the MSN network.  Reel owns Rhapsody.  So that kind of set Reel up for life.  I mean, that's it, you know.  Reel got in kind of trouble last year when they released something called Reel DVD,  which I thought was a really great second act for Reel.  It was DVD copyright, copying software, but it had some stuff to protect the studios.  Like you couldn't copy a movie.  You had to keep the copy.  You could only make one copy.  It was kind of a thing that you would have thought the studios would have said, yeah.  And I'm sure that's what Rob thought.  They sued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was the example of fair use, respecting fair use in the software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And of course, the movie industry has no leeway for this.  So Rob has resigned. He's leaving.  We don't know why he's leaving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think he has his bowling average up.  Does he still own the PBA?  Yeah, as far as I know, he does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Him and a few partners, they got together, they bought it for next to nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, sure. How much could the PBA be worth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, one point in the sometime ago, during the era when Grant's Tomb was the number one tourist attraction,  the PBA bowling was the most popular sport on television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't see you as a bowler. I see you as a candle pin kind of guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I've done candle pins.  Man, that is one hard game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the challenging. That's the bowling for people who really are serious.  Those little candle pins, they are hard knocked down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you get to strike ever, it's a miracle.  Yeah.  The best one, by the way, if you want to play these crazy rolling a ball game.  Yeah.  Rubber band ducks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I never heard of it. Where do they play that? Is that Wisconsin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They played it back East in some couple. I think in Massachusetts you can find some rubber band ducks.  Rubber band ducks.  Yeah, they're called rubber band ducks. They're duck pins, but they got a rubber band around the middle, big thick thing.  So they bounce all over like crazy.  And it's actually quite a kind of a fun game.  And then there's a game up in Canada called five pin bowling, which is actually quite difficult.  And of course, then there's a regular duck pins. I think there's a couple other ones.  And most people who are ever bowlers, they've always trying to go out of their way to play these other crazy games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Duck pins are shorter and squatter than the regular pins used in 10 pin bowling, according to Wikipedia.  Oh, they are. They're little.  And then you use a little ball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if they mention them in there, but rubber band ducks is very obscure.  There's only a few places left that have them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Here it is. Rubber band duck pins introduced in the Baltimore, I'm sorry, Balmer, Washington area.  The pins are circled with hard rubber bands to increase action and scoring.  Rubber band duck pin is the only version of duck pin played in the province of Quebec.  Ah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go.  That's where I played it.  Quebec.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Obscurity is for everybody.  It's not France, but it sounds like it.  I think we've covered all the stories. Can't be. You know, Google is so dominated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What about the Apple's, Kodak's suing Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, this is, you know, Apple's suing Nokia. Nokia's suing Apple.  In fact, the latest is that Apple is suing Nokia to keep them from shipping any products in the U.S. at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the good luck with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At all. It's like, no, sorry, you're no longer allowed.  And now Kodak sues Apple and RIM saying the technologies that you use to display images on your digital cameras and computers violates our patent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's ridiculous. Well, wait a minute, though. Wait a minute.  I don't know enough, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Listen, who's paying royalties?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I was going to say. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  LG, Motorola, Nokia, Samsung and Sony Erics and all pay Kodak royalties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And for what? For technology for previewing different images of different resolutions and another as ridiculous?  I mean, OK, the patent thing is completely out of control, although I don't know. Maybe there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is. This is a U.S. issue, though, isn't it? I mean, you don't have these problems in France.  It doesn't feel like it. No, we see the drop of the hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  An imaging company really essentially invented the digital camera and a lot of other stuff. Tons of patents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just love how in America, if you if you know you're having trouble competing, well, just sue them.  It's the second choice, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The origin of it is the patents that are being awarded. So you write with no basis, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, this is this goes back to that Google phone story about Apple asking Google, please don't put multi touch in.  We don't want to have to defend this patent because the multi touch patent that Apple has is absurd.  I mean, there's there's, you know, people have been looking at multi touch for years, long before Apple even considered it.  Airlines are rolling out Wi-Fi.  I used Wi-Fi on Virgin America when we flew to Vegas and back.  Very slow, not all that usable, certainly not.  You could use Skype, but you could check your email.  Normally be about twelve ninety five.  But in this case, Google paid for it.  And I have to say, the first thing you see is an ad for the Nexus one phone before you get to use your Wi-Fi.  It's pretty smart.  The company that does this is GoGo, which is a product of Aircel.  Aircel is the leading Internet airline provider.  American Airlines started it.  GoGo will be offered soon on American Delta Air, Trans Virgin America already United Air Canada, US Airways Continental.  Southwest Airlines is working with another provider, Rho 44 to put Wi-Fi.  So basically, you're not going to be able to get on an airplane and say, I'm out of touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they're going to use the laptop with all these new TSA regulations.  They back down a little bit on that, I hope.  Yeah, so far.  Yeah, it's not going to take much to get it back on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Continental is experimenting with they have a live in-flight television system, which is something, you know, it's been around for a while on JetBlue.  And then also on the same planes are going to put GoGo, the Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How does it work? Is it does it have like a satellite relay or a good question? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They go through a satellite relay. Yes, they shoot up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, yeah, you'd have to because otherwise the handoffs from ground on the ground to ground at 600 miles an hour be crazy.  So they're going up, not down.  But I'll tell you, satellite Internet is terribly slow. Awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a big latency. It's it's miserable.  Yeah, not a good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I used it on a flight from Los Angeles to San Francisco.  It worked OK.  You know, I didn't expect it to be a DSL quality, but allows you to do email.  I even sent a video, an iPhone video.  Really? That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I got a Skype call from I'm sorry, I got a Skype call from someone from the Lufthansa flight that was all online in the plane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, Lufthansa had faster Internet and I used it on an SAS flight some years ago.  It was very fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So maybe yours was slow because Google was offering it free to everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everyone was using it. I think.  And of course it was. Wait a minute from CES.  Yeah, this is a plane trip to CES from San Francisco.  Every single seat, they're opening up a laptop, getting online.  What am I thinking? Of course it was slow.  I'm surprised it worked at all.  So Gawker, I love Gawker's balls.  These guys, they got that was beautiful.  These guys. So they Valley Wag, which is their Silicon Valley gossip site, offered $100,000 to be granted to.  It was a scavenger hunt to anybody who provides an Apple tablet to the Gawkers and lets them play with it for an hour.  $50,000 for a picture of Steve Jobs holding an Apple tablet.  But ironically, the best proof they got was from Apple's legal team, which sent him a cease and desist email saying, quote,  You should not solicit for photos, videos or a sample of an unannounced and highly confidential Apple product, in effect, confirming the existence of the tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I think Apple really made a huge mistake here.  And I'll tell you why. I don't understand why Apple didn't give them a picture and then have a picture of Steve and then collect $150,000 and put it in the coffers.  What's wrong with that?  You know, so they got a lot of free publicity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They kind of gave the lawyers at Apple a second prize of sending him a DVD of Legally Blonde to a $25 Zune marketplace gift card and a fabulous set of steak knives.  I love it. Nick knows how to work it. You got to say that for him.  Yeah, you got a lot of PR for that.  Oh, it's great. Now, can they get in trouble for soliciting that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think so. I think that's a gray area. I think it's sketchy. I think it's just a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's bad journalistic practice, but I don't think it's illegal to say, I'll give you $100,000 to break your NDA. Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't see how they could get in serious trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think NDA should be illegal. How does anybody sign away their constitutional rights with a contract?  Right.  I mean, if an NDA is legal, why can't I just go to Africa and find some, let's say, black people and have them sign away their constitutional rights in a contract?  Come work for me.  And they're slaves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, come work for me. I won't pay you. You signed the deal. It's in the shrink wrap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, when is this going to end? It's bogus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  McDonald's is now offering free Wi-Fi in its restaurants. They did this before, but I guess it's back.  You've kept this in France forever.  Now with your... what is it? Your Grande Royale?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Royale, Deluxe Royale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Royale, Deluxe Royale. It sounds much better when you say it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so it's such a nice place to do your computing because of the beautiful aromas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, even a hard plastic computer, even an aluminum body, unibody computer can absorb hamburger odor in half an hour.  We have, we'll have people and nobody, nobody in this room, but I have people come in here after they go down the road and have breakfast.  We have a little place that has hash browns and they just reek of hash browns.  And I just go, you were in Halle's, weren't you? And they go, yeah. I said, yeah, I could smell it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And McDonald's is so much worse.  You're making me hungry now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You want a Deluxe Royale. It sounds so good. Doesn't that sound good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's why we like it, because in our language it sounds really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everything sounds better in French.  It just all sounds, even a French fry sounds better in French.  Frites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Frites, pan frites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Patrick, tell us, Diu, what is your super secret new project?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's not really super secret, but a few friends, podcasters and myself, we've been sort of getting together for a while.  I tried to rally the podcasting energies in France for a little while, and a few of them actually are making it better and faster than I am.  And we're sort of getting together and putting a portal for video podcasts and another one for audio podcasts.  Is it called VotreTube?  It's called NoWatch.  NoWatch.tv for videos and NoWatch.fm for audio. So it's just a splash page for the audio now.  But the first version, very preliminary version of the website is up for the video thing.  And NoWatch.tv is the place to go if you want any French podcasts from now on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you've got some American, you know, French in here, Fringlish.  It says NoWatch.tv, incredible web shows. Attention, super production.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You read it exactly right.  Super production.  And I see it says Geeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is that?  I'm not sure what you mean.  Well, here under Scuds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Geeks.  Geeks.  Geeks.  It's basically a homing pigeon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Homing head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Geeks.  Searching head.  Geeks search for head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Something like that, yes.  That's exactly what it is.  Scuds TV.  I'll give you a few shows over there that are pretty good quality shows.  And we're going to go forward from there and together.  It's all in French though, right?  Yes, absolutely. It's a hub for French web shows.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So does Geek Inc. podcast mean the same thing in French as it means in English?  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It does.  Geek Inc. is a podcast about geek culture in French.  And it's super fun and super cool.  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think that's good.  Is there a large podcasting community or is this kind of nascent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it really was just me until a year ago.  I guess that would be the definition of nascent.  I'm exaggerating a little bit.  But until a year ago, it was basically just me.  And they started doing stuff a year ago.  And these guys, the Scuds guys, have been taking it to the next level  and have been organizing all this pretty well.  So now we're all together.  Kevin Rose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It looks just like Dignation.  Only Alex got really old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're a bunch of kind of famous people in France  and they're just doing a spoof intro for the other one.  It is a spoof of Dignation though.  Well, the seminal formula of a podcast is two guys in a couch now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess it is.  Kevin would be honored by that.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a little bit of this on some shows.  Some have a different formula.  But yeah, it's basically the beginning of a wonderful adventure of podcasting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  NoWatch.tv.  That's great.  Congratulations.  That's wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thanks.  I'm excited to get NoWatch.tv and NoWatch.fm to be the two central hubs for podcasting.  Hopefully it will go well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Congratulations.  Well done, Patrick.  And of course still Frenchspin.com for Patrick's podcast in English,  the Phileas Club, and in French, in both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There are a couple in English, a couple in French.  How would you say the tech grouch in French?  I'm afraid I would anger him, so I wouldn't translate it.  Le jongleur du technologie.  Something like that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  The technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Le fou.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Grouch is difficult to translate.  Yeah, because nobody's grouchy in France.  We're all grouchy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, there's no such thing as that.  Grancheux, okay, very rude.  You can use the word rude.  There's a few rude people in France.  I love French.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love France.  The tech rude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The tech.  No, be Grancheux.  Le technophile Grancheux or something like that.  I like that.  Wow, that sounds great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what you should be, John.  I think you should change the name.  I didn't say you.  I mean, whoever the grouch might be.  No, the grouch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's a cousin, distant cousin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Distant cousin with a, looks like a squirrel in his beard.  John C. Dvorak is at channeldvorak.com.  He's also the host of numerous shows, including Cranky Geeks at crankygeeks.tv,  No Agenda, and Tech Five.  Somebody said I should ask you what Adam Curry thought about this whole China Google thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We didn't talk about the China Google thing.  We talked mostly about Haiti today, and they'll be posting later today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, he does have a theory on the Haiti thing.  Oh, yeah.  Does he think Pat Robertson caused it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, the Pat Robertson thing was quite funny.  We did go over that quite a bit.  Somebody mentioned to me that the problem with the Pat Robertson thing is that somebody said,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, he got confused.  He thought Haiti was Haiti.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a joke.  So, no.  Is there a conspiracy theory?  Adam believes that there's an earthquake machine and they aimed it at Haiti specifically.  And then I doubled up on the theory saying that we are actually going to take over the country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it's about time.  That's what my argument was.  Haiti's been a thorn in our side for generations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just been a nuisance.  Now we can go in there and take the place over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Papa Doc, baby Doc.  Baby Doc, mama Doc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know that there's been a few issues with the Americans taking the responsibility of the earthquake.  We took over the runway.  Yeah.  And a lot of people are saying that the US is going to stay.  I have to think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it was at the quote, invitation of the Haitian government, such as it is.  But I have to think that when Secretary Hillary Clinton flies into a country in such turmoil  that she causes far more problems than she solves.  Imagine, I mean, that runway must have been closed for hours to secure it, to make sure she had a quick getaway.  That's not a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She has to check in on the property she has in northern Haiti.  They're going to build a bunch of hotels up there and she's going to be, she's in part of the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the next Cuba.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  You should listen to the show, Leo.  You and I would agree on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All except the earthquake machine.  I don't think we've perfected that technology.  But other than that, it was, you know, I wouldn't, you know, I wouldn't be surprised.  We might look back on this and say, yeah, that was the beginning.  Yeah.  John, thank you.  Patrick, thank you.  Thank you all for watching.  You can watch this show.
