Jason iPad Calacanis from Mahalo dot com.  Hello.  Hello how are you guys doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm here with my solid gold iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes I've had it plated in platinum.  You can't hit any of the buttons anymore but it looks good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who needs to hit the buttons?  Robert Scoble who is playing his spiral piano.  That's another one of those apps from the Ocarina fellas right?  Schmuel.  Schmuel.  Schmuel.  And for a first time and I'm really glad to have her Jeannie Jardin of boingboing.net.  It's good to see you Jenny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh I'm sorry what was that?  Oh stop it.  I couldn't hear you.  I was optimizing our iPad edition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're only allowed to have people who have iPads on the show today.  Actually we were going to get Cory Doctorow on and maybe we will get Cory on next week  because he has a pretty strong case against the iPad which we'll talk about in a second  but we have a bit of business we've got to take care of before we do that.  A couple of weeks ago Kevin Rose was on the show and we were talking about Conan O'Brien  and how he had picked a random Twitter follower, a random Twitter person to follow.  He hadn't followed anybody I guess.  So we thought oh we'll do the same thing.  It'll be kind of fun.  So we followed a woman named Lisa Tickled Pink.  She had just started her Twitter account.  In fact the way Kevin found her he did a search for I Hate Technology and she showed up.  He'd just been in New Zealand so he thought oh this is great.  She's in Auckland New Zealand.  She hates technology.  She just joined Twitter.  She has no followers.  So three weeks later she now has 30,462 followers and I have a guilty conscience because the  poor woman didn't have any idea.  We didn't warn her.  We didn't ask her permission.  We just swarmed her.  Now the good news is she's very happy about it.  In fact Lisa's going to be joining us a little later on in the show to talk about her experience  going from zero to 30,000 in three weeks.  We are going to give her an iPad as kind of a little bit of a payment for her trouble  and because you can't get one in New Zealand.  So we've got one.  The box is right here.  All packaged up to ship to her.  We had something happen at the factory and we accidentally got an extra one.  So I think what we're going to do is we're going to give one of these to a random follower  of Lisa.  So Jason now you have perfected this giving stuff to random followers thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely I have.  We can just go to that site I talked about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I could do that.  We'll do it on camera but just before we do we're going to just see what is the current  number of followers now.  It's 30,701 followers.  So from that we're going to pick a random.  So what do you just put her you just put Lisa tickled pink in here right.  Correct.  This is twit Rand dot com and I'm going to pick from her followers and we will get a  random follower and that person is going to win a 16 gigabyte iPad.  Are you ready?  Error loading Twitter data please check your username.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sounds to me like when you put out the URL I believe a thousand twit fans just I broke  it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well let's try that one more time.  Yeah we broke it.  OK we'll do this later in the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I could also pick one of the random followers on our list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have another program that you use to do this.  The thing is we got to vet it because we got to make sure it's really it's truly a random  number generator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is a Twitter there is a random number generator.  I think it's random dot org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah I could just use that huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah so what I could do is we could pull up her and just pick a follower list and see  how many pages of it there are.  We'll save that number and then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or I could just shoot myself now.  We'll do this.  We'll do this through this later.  Do you have something on your iPad Robert Scoble that will do this automatically.  What is that.  Oh you're playing that game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm crashing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah because you're doing it backwards.  All right so today was the day the or yesterday Saturday was the day the iPad came out.  Did anybody wait in line or did you all do the.  Well first of all Jenny I know you didn't wait in line because you got one ahead of  time.  Oh you're muted.  You're muted Jenny.  Where's your button.  There you go.  No.  Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How's that.  Yes there you go.  Yeah got one a little bit ahead of time.  I actually wanted to go wait in line with the rest of with the rest of our people but was  a little too tired from all the TV stuff that was happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You were on every station in the world showing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was ridiculous.  It was like I was Justin Bieber for a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well you had a you had you know Willy Wonka's golden ticket.  You had one of you know a few hundred iPads out there.  And you had an iPad months ago but it was a different I think a different model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a 2.0 model with the solar power the two cameras and the virtual reality augmented  Skype.  But yeah it's a different version.  You'll see that in about a year from now.  He usually puts it out a year later.  Jenny give us the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's had it for the longest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How on earth did you wind up getting one.  Did you get contacted by Steve himself or by PR.  Did you request it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The best rule of iPad is that you don't talk about iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah you probably have to sign some papers don't you.  Oh of course not anymore though.  Right.  You're out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Non-disclosure.  How does it do you give Mossberg and Pogue this kind of third degree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah.  Like we can't get Mossberg on the show but we've talked to Kara about it and we've certainly

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  in broad strokes and certainly talk to David.  The people managing iPad launch reached out to a number of reviewers.  I don't know why I was on the list of reviewers but I was there.  Had you been on that list before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Had you gotten advance copies before.  Sure.  Okay.  So that's why.  Boing boing is why.  You're a powerful journalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We have more than a dozen unique viewers per month.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That'll do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So how long before the launch did they contact you and say hey you're a candidate for this  and how long did you have it like two days or two weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had about a week ahead of time.  Long enough to not let the device part from my hands day or night and get a real good  sense of how I might use that and how other people in my life would be likely to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know Andy Anotko who does MacBreak Weekly with us and writes for the Chicago Sun Times  also got one ahead of time.  He says he went to New York City to pick it up and of course you sign up extensive NDAs  and one of the things you cannot let anybody see it and so he's got it in his backpack.  He's on the train back to Boston.  He's talking about this on the show.  He said this is the hardest thing I ever did.  I've got a two hour train ride and I've got an iPad and I can't use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was pretty excruciating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I bet it was.  I bet it was.  So did they populate it with apps I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  With some of the few iPad ready apps that were available a week out and as if memory  serves here I'm just looking down now.  So the Reuters News app, Epicurious, the Marvel Comics app, the Elements.  Some of those actually ended up being my favorite but you know it was kind of magical like on  Friday evening to see the iPad section of the App Store populate with tons and tons  and tons of new apps.  You know I mentioned that StarWalk app on Rachel Maddow's show Friday night.  That for me, I mean maybe it's because I love science, I love astronomy but between that  and the Elements, I can think of no stronger case for why this device and why others like  it are really kind of a compelling hint into the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know one of the things I noticed was how much nicer the native iPad apps look.  I mean it's as if people said oh we've got to make this look great because it's on the  screen and there's just, even the ones that were just universal apps upgraded really look  so much nicer.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know it was fun going back to some of the iPhone apps and even just going back to  your iPhone after that.  It's like everything shrunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The iPhone does seem almost too small to use now.  I have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well I mean really it's like going from a 9 inch TV to a 50 inch TV.  Just that alone is a big qualitative and quantitative difference.  You know I don't know enough about the details yet but it also feels like they really jacked  up the sensitivity on the touch screen as well.  There's less, fewer sort of miss swipes, miss taps.  And the difference is really more than the sum of the individual parts it seems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It really is a gorgeous screen.  It's very responsive.  I think that's one of the first things that you see when you, you know, a lot of people  who didn't like the idea of the iPad then hold it and the responsiveness and the speed  of it kind of wins you over very quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now your colleague Cory Doctorow and Boing Boing wrote a blog post right before the iPad  came out saying why I won't get an iPad and why you shouldn't either.  And one of the things he mentioned, in fact I'm looking at the Marvel comic book app right  now, is that he loves comic books and this is exactly the antithesis of what he thinks  makes the comic book culture so great.  You can't, you can get a great comic book.  It looks great on here but you can't share it.  You can't sell it.  You know you got the only copy of this particular comic book.  You lose all, it's copy protected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well I'm not here to, you know, uphold or debate the points in Cory's editorial.  He speaks well for himself.  He's very capable of doing that but, you know, in that one instance I would say consider  the fact that Apple did not make that app.  Marvel made that app and what you're looking at there has to do with Marvel and with Disney  and with the other people involved in rights issues with the content that they distribute.  Apple did not require them to wrap their content in DRM or make it impossible for you to share  that.  It's the question of the device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Well in fact, you know, I was thrilled to see that they put the Kindle app on here.  Yeah, right away too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Friday night like right around 6.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Amazon updated it to be iPad specific and frankly it is, I would say, as good a  reading experience as the native iBook app.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And some of the limitations that people have pointed out with the iBooks app which is a  delight in terms of usability.  The fact that I think you can't just some of the issues that Corey raised those some  things are different in the Kindle app.  So you have some freedoms with Kindle that you don't with iBooks.  The device itself doesn't impose those restrictions.  It has to do with the apps and the content arrangements that lie on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I think one of the things I'd love to hear Jason and Robert your thoughts on  this.  A lot of people were critical of the iPad before it came out.  Comparing it to a computer saying, well, you can get a half price netbook that has cameras  and multitasking and flash support and does everything that iPad does and more.  And it strikes me now having used the iPad for a couple of days that that's not the comparison.  That really a more apt comparison would be to compare an iPad to say a television set,  a content consumption device.  And if you compare it at that level, then the price and the capabilities are, you know,  it's like a 21st century TV set to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or compared to Xbox or PlayStation, which are not, they're somewhat interactive, but  you can't create your own video game on an Xbox really easily unless you're, you know,  a hardcore game company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So my thought was it's OK.  They coexist, right?  It's not a zero sum game.  You can have both an iPad and a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  What do you think about that, Patrick?  Because you talk to me about that.  That the iPad feels different than your MacBook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it does.  As soon as you put it in your hands, you really get sort of engrossed in it.  You know, you really you just you want to use it, which is kind of interesting.  It's a different feel than a laptop.  But I think it's comparable.  I think you could compare it to a laptop depending on what you use it for.  If you're not a hardcore computer user, I think this could serve you just as well as  a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Most people use email and surf the web.  And if that's if that's your usage pattern, this thing does really well.  Now, if you are like me and Dave Weiner and you create content and do videos and you want  to get into Photoshop and you want to, you know, maybe get into Second Life and then  play around and create things, this falls apart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you can still do that.  Nobody's saying you can't do that.  You just can't do it with this device anymore than you could do with an Xbox 360 or television  set.  Dave Weiner almost immediately tweeted, well, OK, I kind of like it.  It's not so bad.  He actually seems to have enjoyed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the I think that didn't last very long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, he went the other way again.  Oh, I got to keep up with his tweets.  You know, he's now he's grumpy again.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just saying this is the infuriating part about the device and Steve Jobs's, you know,  philosophy of product design.  It's the ultimate compelling consumption device.  Anybody falls in love with it the moment they start playing with it.  There are some really unique features to it.  And it's got just an incredible feel in your hand that I've not felt with any other  device. So, you know, I'm much more into an open type platform that you can do some  creation on. But I love it as well.  And so you have to wonder why is it that Steve Jobs insists on crippling the devices  not letting you put a USB port in, not letting you change your battery, not letting you  run, you know, Opera or another browser.  I'm not going to speak for Steve Jobs, but I can I'm glad he didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a simple. The idea is simplicity.  We interviewed Wozniak.  He was out there with you, Robert, at the Palo Alto Apple Store the night before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was at Valley Fair or Valley Fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, we interviewed him that night, Friday night.  And he said, I thought completely the salient point, which is this is in a way a  reboot for personal technology.  It is it's gotten too complex.  This even here's the guy who, you know, built the Apple one and Apple two.  And he says, this is this is simple and that's good.  You don't do you need a USB port on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I look at it differently.  It's almost like we're moving from the carburetor era of cars to the fuel injection  era of cars. And I remember the same arguments happening, especially around kids  who love to tinker with their cars, you know, getting inside a carburetor and  replacing the carburetor and messing around with your air fuel mixture was really  easy back in that era of cars.  And now, you know, now we have fuel injection that's run by computers and you need  to be a computer hacker to really control your air fuel, air mixture in your car.  And that's a different thing.  But look at what it's brought us in terms of reliability and mileage and other  things. And normal people don't want to learn about the air fuel mixture of their  car. You know, they just want to turn on the key and drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this is a terrible analogy.  Why?  Because adding a webcam, which has been on the iPhone for over two years, right, is  not the equivalent of, you know, the equivalent for a carburetor would be opening the  thing up and changing the memory chips.  Nobody's saying, you know, change the memory chips.  What we are saying is, you know, can I have a camera?  Is cameras too complex for people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really?  Dave Weiner and Corey Doctorow definitely made the point that they want to tinker with  a device. They want to build software for it.  They want to have an open platform that they don't have to convince a committee to  distribute their software to.  And those are legitimate claims on this world.  Now, that's on the high end of the feature standpoint.  Yeah. You know, Steve Jobs takes away stuff every time he comes out with something

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  new. You know, I guess the question is, are we cows and, you know, victims of  Steve and just following along?  Or is this is this a useful device?  But we still got our computers.  We still got our camcorders.  We still got all the other devices.  It seems to me that you're not giving up anything by buying an iPad any more than  you would be by buying a television set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. I mean, do you think that there's going to be a consumer that you don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  want a camera on your TV set?  That's not that's not needed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, that is that's coming, by the way.  Yeah, but I don't want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know. But nobody really wants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not true. Wait until you see the next Xbox.  It has a camera on it that watches your interaction and you play video games and  the tall gestures to the camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Project Napalm.  Jenny, I mean, what do you what do you think on this?  I mean, is that a reasonable response to people like Corey?  Look, this doesn't exclude all of those great things that the digital revolution  has brought us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a first generation device.  I think it's been interesting to watch a range of people arguing about this on  Twitter, looking at the iPad as a successor to or something that is supposed to  combine different functions, different roles that are familiar to us.  Those of us who remember what computing was like 10, 15, 20 years ago might feel a  sense of frustration or there might be some kind of friction for us in adopting  this, because no, it's not a netbook.  No, it's not a phone.  No, it's not your TV set.  No, it's not your book.  But it can it has the capability to take elements of all those things and the Xbox  and the we and whatever and merge them in new and interesting ways.  Some of the folks in the chat room that I'm following here in the Twitter IRC,  someone just mentioned that the tear down photos that we blogged on Boing Boing  yesterday from I think I fix it indicates that there may be space for a camera.  I would be really surprised.  I mean, I mentioned this like on that on the 27th of January when they did the big  unveil in San Francisco.  I mentioned this to one of the iPad handlers in the shrouded room where us  journalists got, you know, 10 minutes of fondle time with minders.  I said, I think it's interesting that this device doesn't have a camera.  And I didn't get a definitive response there, but I didn't get a no, this device  will never have a camera either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  One thing that I know about Apple's internals, because my brother in law  works on the iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are you kidding?  Are you shaking?  There's a big earthquake right now.  You can feel it?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't feel it.  Can you feel it?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe it's just a truck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's big.  This is actually, this is big.  Everything in my house is shaking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  I don't feel it in Brentwood.  Huh?  Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you feel that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, um, not here in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is actually really big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  So here's what I do when there's an earthquake.  I pull up search.twitter.com and I start searching on the word earthquake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It should happen pretty quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All the tweets that come in and then, uh, can, uh, Leo, can you pull up USGS website?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Let me pull that up before everybody else does one in Baja, Mexico, eight minutes ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was like a good 20 seconds.  You guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  USGS website will have the, uh, we'll have the epicenter in about four minutes or  less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Holy crap.  It's still swaying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you in a wooden building, Jenny?  Where, where are you and where, where exactly are you in LA?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Okay.  There's definitely an earthquake happening because I see it on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It must be real.  It's funny.  It's funny.  Nobody believed her.  Nobody believed her until we saw it on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah.  Twitter has lots of earthquake, LA earthquake, uh, just felt nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wasn't just getting the vapors cause I was so excited about the iPad.  Are you okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is everything all right, Jenny?  Before we, everything's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just saw all the plants hanging from my ceiling going, whoa.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And are you in downtown?  Where are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It says 6.9 in Baja.  So that's, that's a fairly sizable earthquake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Baja is not that close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I know, but it seems like it's not in Baja.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm on the west side of LA right now and I'm in a big kind of warehouse building at the  moment.  So, uh, no, it's not wooden and it's, uh, God willing it's earthquake proof.  We can go back to talking about technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because you'll, you'll be able to, uh, to, uh, we'll be able to watch it live on the  Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The, uh, I'm actually following your IRC channel and everyone is, uh, posting data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's fun when you, when you, uh, Google earthquakes, Google now shows a recent  earthquakes result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's part of the USGS is showing 6.9 16 miles south, southwest of Guadalupe,  uh, Victoria, Mexico, four minutes ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's probably about right.  You're probably feeling it.  Uh, it takes a while to go through the, uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  interesting that you experienced it as a very rolling, very long motion.  That would, that would tell you you're not close to the epicenter because you're  very close to the epicenter.  It's very sharp and sudden.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, that's interesting because there's, there's been times in the past when, uh,  in the past few months, even when we've had quakes that were very, very close to  where I am either in downtown LA or, or just, uh, I think there was one off of  Catalina and there was this big abrupt kind of jolt, but it was very short.  This is the longest quake I've felt here or anywhere in, in quite a while, but it  wasn't, um, it wasn't so violent and shallow.  Golly.  Okay.  And I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a real time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Moved for me.  I think Steve jobs is getting a little bit upset at us questioning the device and  he just shook the earth.  This is a message to people, to people in Los Angeles.  Calm down.  I'll put a camera in when I'm ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Somebody ate too many marshmallow peeps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It might've been me.  I, uh, I've been devouring these peeps.  It's a sushi made out of peeps with, uh, uh, rice, crispy treats instead of rice  peeps instead of fish and the, uh, and the seaweed is actually fruit rollup.  It's quite, quite flavorful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would like you all to just note that I did not run to safety.  When you were good.  There's a journalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She has it.  She's a, that's a journalist for you.  She stayed there reported.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course we didn't believe you cause nothing was shaken.  The camera was rock steady.  I thought she's losing it folks.  She's gone.  CNN has actually started covering it.  So it must be true.  Okay.  Must be true.  Seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Trust me, but you trust Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, that's what's interesting.  Twitter is 7,000 more results since I started searching a minute ago.  I mean, it's just, uh, it's, it's really interesting how this happens.  So that's a good question.  You know, a few years ago you would go to USGS or you do what I do, which Google  earthquakes now you go to Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the problem is Twitter doesn't really tell you where it is or the, or  the magnitude of it, because if you're really close to the epicenter, uh, even  a small earthquake can sometimes seem like major to you.  Right.  And that's why I instantly started going to USGS and refreshing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  page to see how big it might say something about you or the reader.  But what are you more interested in the number or what people are saying about it?  You know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and that might, because you know, you know what we all did.  We went to different places on the internet to learn about this event.  We were watching Zini experience it live.  And now we can see on Twitter, what our friends are saying on Facebook, on, on,  you know, Google, I mean, there's a lot of places that we're going to get  really fast information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just for the record, uh, there are people reporting earthquake in Arizona,  San Diego, and Los Angeles.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It must be that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it 2012 already?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  6.6.9 is fairly strong.  That's a strong earthquake.  Yeah.  That's a strong, I wouldn't be surprised.  You'd feel it in some pretty distant places.  So we're going to take a break.  I want to come back.  We do have a lot more iPad talk, including the surprising stat that as  many as perhaps 700,000 iPods were sold in day one.  Is that credible?  Is that credible?  We'll find out in just a little bit, but I want to take a little break to talk  about my friends at squarespace.com.  Squarespace is a great place.  To make your website.  Somebody, a friend asked me yesterday.  She said, um, I've got the domain name and I want to sell some stuff, but I  don't know where to go to make my website.

Then lets you easily with drag and drop, customize it to fit your needs.  They've got great stats.  Uh, so you can find out who's visiting your site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just made a site while you're doing the commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's that easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just go to iPad earthquake.squarespace.com.  iPad earthquake.squarespace.com literally halfway into the commercial.  Let me try out Squarespace and I got a site up and running and changed the template.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You did it faster than I can, than I can actually go to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm ready to go.  This is great.  Any additional iPad earthquakes.  I'm going to be number one in Google.  I got this.  If everybody could tweet this for me, that would be helpful.  It's all about the SEO.  Isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love it.  Absolutely.  But I mean, look at, that's how easy it is.  Cause you didn't have to add a credit card or anything.  It's just very straightforward.  I do think, you know, I, I know a couple of people said, Oh, I got the WordPress app on here.  Now, even though it's not for iPad yet, they think they start thinking of blogging.  Cause the iPad just seems like it feels like you might take this to a coffee shop and you  might just feel like writing.  How, how is the keyboard for you?  Um, Jenny, what do you think of the keyboard?  Is it easy to write with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, it's funny when I first started using the iPhone, I felt a little frustration  with typing interaction.  But it will be okay a lot.  But after like there's these cutoff points after a week, after a couple of weeks, after  four weeks, uh, you, you learn this new motor skill, right?  It's like learning to ride a bike and I can bang out quite a few words per minute.  Now I'm feeling some of that same friction with the touchscreen keyboard on iPad.  I like it a lot more in landscape than I do in portrait.  Uh, but I also, they, they loan me one of the docs, the keyboard docs.  I like that a lot.  I could imagine easily, and I, I, I in fact intend to, uh, purchasing one of the units  with 3G so that I don't have to worry about whether or not there's a wifi connection,  you know, taking it to tech conferences, having the keyboard doc, you know, in my  purse or my bag or whatever I'm carrying and being able to compose longer posts or  file reports using the doc or just touchscreen for tweet length or Facebook  length or very short posts.  We've been doing these, uh, short length posts on Boing Boing for a few months now.  It's something that my colleague, uh, Rob Baskita set up.  He's been doing a lot of interesting design tweaks with us and they're right  about the length of a Twitter post.  So with something with our own blog, with the medium and the voice of our blog  evolving, I could imagine more short form things and it's funny how there's this  back and forth between the device and our voices and the format of the blog.  Um, I look forward to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't it interesting how the device influences your style and your writing?  I think that's fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or the site has as well, like because of being forced to do 140 characters or  less, I noticed myself being more, um, being more brief on the blog as well.  It teaches you to conserve and editing and brevity are two of the greatest  skills of any writer.  I think.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My 140 characters is definitely brevity.  I got, I bought the Bluetooth keyboard, the little Apple Bluetooth, which is  really nice and light and small.  Uh, and, uh, it works beautifully with this.  In fact, as soon as you pair it and it pairs instantly, um, then you don't get  the pop-up keyboard, um, you just start typing on here, although I, somebody  told me, and this is a really great tip.  I think I saw it on a Gizmodo.  If you press the eject key on the Bluetooth keyboard, it will slide up the  onscreen keyboard so you don't lose it, which was a nice little tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Our, our buddy Joel Johnson pointed out earlier today, uh, something that I  hadn't really thought of, but it seems really silly that the apostrophe key is  buried one layer deep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  Cause you hit it a lot.  I hit it a lot.  Yeah.  I need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's nice that there's that smart correction, but it's and it's my, you  know, yours and that's a really common mistake.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It never knows which one to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, I just downloaded one of the, uh, earthquake apps that's available in the  store.  Unfortunately, none of them are available for the iPad and here's something  that you can see that's wrong with the iPad.  You, you can buy iPhone apps.  This is an iPhone app, but it's really small.  And then if you blow it up, um, there's a quality of it goes way down.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's really bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Some apps do better than others.  I've noticed, in fact, even games like spider, which I love actually blows up  two X pretty well and looks pretty good.  I guess it depends on how the, the, the bit maps are stored and so forth.  I imagine though, every single, okay.  I'm going to tell you one thing that's really pissing me off.  The number of companies, you know, you have a choice.  You can do a universal version of your app.  People like Evernote re released new versions, Kindle new version, uh, that  have both iPad and iPhone, iPod touch versions in a single app, no upgrade  cost, very nice.  So when I launched my Evernote now, I love it.  It actually, uh, it actually pulls up Evernote full screen on the iPad.  And it really is beautiful.  But how many companies, almost all of them are coming out with iPad specific  versions for an additional $10 or more.  It's driving me crazy.  There's this land grab is greed that just making me nuts here.  Yeah.  Um, and aren't iPad apps seem, they seem like they're much more expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Five times as much.  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why?  Well, because you have to pay for the pixels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Cost per pixel is lower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it drives me crazy.  Like New York times already has an app.  Why are they doing a separate app?  Now they're not charging for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's four times more pixels, four times the cost, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It just drives me crazy.  A big oven, which I really love.  Why are they selling a separate version?  Uh, they could just make a universal version.  I already have it installed.  That was the first thing that drove me crazy is I, I, I, I synced my iPad and  had hundreds of apps that I don't want to use because they look so bad.  And you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They should have an upgrade fee too, you know, that you get a  discount if you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple doesn't make that possible.  Unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That, that's part of the wall street journal did an awesome job because

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  hold on, Robert, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I just say the wall street journal was a delight.  I, I, I turned it on and I logged into my wall street journal account.  I get it in print at the house, have the online, and then it just works on the iPad.  So it's like one login.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  We're not paying the 17 99.  I don't know when that's going to kick in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think it's going to be free for, for subscribers.  You get the print version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you see, you get, you get back additions, which is nice going back to  Saturday last, so it's, I guess, a week worth of additions and the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I tried logging in with a wall street journal print subscription and I was  blocked, uh, maybe I was doing something wrong, but I was blocked from  downloading today's paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had an online subscription.  Is yours online or is it print only a Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mine's print.  It's both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ah, see, that's both.  See, I paid, I paid for the extra for the online and I think that that's  probably why you and I can get on.  So Shannon, you, you only have a print version.  That's correct.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the only problem with the wall street journal is it's like every other  page is an ad.  I was like, are you kidding me?  Like how about one ad per session or two ads per session is more ads in it.  There you go.  More ads in it than in the paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, and they're, and they're offensive because they take over the  whole screen in many cases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Um, if that was the free version, I wouldn't mind an ad every other  right, but I'm paying money for this.  But if I'm paying already, like, can we just, I mean, I don't mind some ads  and then it keeps a little ad in the bottom left.  It's a little red thing for Oracle.  Thank you.  I think it's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that doesn't bother me as much.  And I noticed a lot of the New York times also, which is free, has a little  ads on it, but when they do the full screen ad, I mean, I guess I look, we do

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  ads too, but how can you charge the user a subscription for the digital version  and then inundate them with invasive ads?  Yeah.  I, I, I, because this is the same as newspaper, you know, you used to pay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  50 or a hundred bucks to get the print version.  You got all the ads with the print.  I guess they're coming at the world as, as if it was still newspaper world, you  know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and this is what Jeff Jarvis has been saying on this week in Google and  others have been saying is that for content creators, this is an opportunity  for them to go retrograde, to go back to an era where they controlled the  distribution medium.  They, they, you know, it wasn't the worldwide web and he, he's, he's of the  opinion, I think a lot of, there's a big ad, a lot of people are of the opinion  that this is the last gasp for content companies trying to control everything  so tightly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I mean, go to a movie theater now.  You pay your 10 to, I think the movie prices in New York are up to $18 for a 3D  movie and you guys sit through about a hundred different ads before you even  see the movie and there you're paying, you're paying to get in the theater  and paying more for popcorn and everything else.  And then you guys sit through all the ads too.  So I think, I think these guys are going to treat us the same way, you know, Oh,  we got a captive audience.  They want the New York times.  Let's shove ads in their face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think that Jeff's point is that as long as you got a web browser, that  that's the future of news and that's how people are going to get their news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  On the cost of iPad apps, by the way, some, some apps are going down in price,  like Tap Tap, that's free radiation.  Yeah.  Tapu list is game used to cost, I think, four, three or four bucks.  Now it's free.  And now their business model has changed to have a little bit of advertising.  And then you buy music and things in the game that'll help them monetize.  And so they've gone the other way, which, which is give away the app for free,  you get people addicted to it and then sell things inside the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As a, as somebody who loves casual gaming, I have to say this is the best  casual gaming platform I've ever seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding.  What is the casual, what's the best casual game native to the iPad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if you haven't yet been hooked on plants versus zombies, don't download it.  Do not download it.  Whatever you do don't too bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you're saying plants and zombies are available for iPad.  Yeah, this is the iPad version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One of the Apple folks who, who demoed the iPad for me first said that this  was his absolute favorite game.  That was the one he was most psyched about plants versus zombies for iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and you know, this is a PopCap games.  They, these are, what's interesting.  These are flash games.  Uh, so obviously they're not written in flash now.  And I, I think if PopCap has figured out how to put games like this, of course,  it does bejeweled on this platform.  Watch out.  This is going to be an incredible game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, there's a version of bejeweled for this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, not yet, but I have a feeling it's the same company that there will be.  Um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the CEO of Zynga who makes a Farmville and stuff like that said he's converting  all of his games to non-flash so that he can get them onto the iPad, iPhone and  other platforms without worrying about it.  Is this the end for flash?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The, the, the, the IP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's certainly the beginning of the, it's not the end, but it certainly takes away  a lot of the need for flash.  I mean, Ted talks, for instance, uh, just last week, uh, turned up, turned on an  HTML five website so you could watch all of their videos on the iPad without  having any flash involved.  And you can see, you can build a casual games now without having flash.  That was pretty hard to do, you know, two, two or three years ago now.  So, uh, Adobe, if I have a video on my YouTube channel with the, with Adobe  giving us the reason that flash is still relevant, they, they now look at it as,  Hey, we have 3 million flash developers who know how to do flash, but they don't  necessarily know how to do objective C or other languages.  So they're converting from a platform that runs flash to a tool that will help  iPhone developers build games using flash front ends.  So they already have a, a tool that converts flash apps, not, not flash in  web pages, but flash apps into iPhone, uh, uh, apps that can be, or iPad apps that  can be distributed this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's your favorite game right now?  Uh, uh, on the, uh, on the iPad, anybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, Patrick, um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Patrick, by the way, we should explain his, his Robert's a teenage son.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And he's the gamer in the family.  I don't play games.  Is it playing right?  What are you playing?  I'm playing turn on the audio so people can hear the audio.  Oh, that's the driving game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's an amazing game.  You steer with the iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Which, which is actually a fairly good experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is, you don't find it.  The screen moving around is bugging you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I actually don't cause it doesn't take a lot to move it.  And it actually works with how you play.  Right.  Um, I also played the, uh, call of duty Nazi zombies game.  That's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did they upscale that?  Did they make that for iPad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they do actually.  Okay.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, I just think for instance, if crossword puzzles or Scrabble, just, this  is kind of such a natural for people who love crossword puzzles.  Um, this is how you're going to want to do crossword puzzles.  I would think.  And it's, you know, the Scrabble's $10 version is selling like hotcakes, but  actually I prefer words with friends for $5.  It's a, it's a faux Scrabble that you play online instead of via the Bluetooth.  Um, and I think it's, it's just really great.  Um, I can't stop playing this Farmville clone.  God help me.  God help me.  It's called we rule.  Oh dear.  I thought I'd escaped Farmville, but no, no, no, no.  We're going to see a lot more.  I think Jenny, Jenny, do you play any games on this thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right now, Patrick is a, the call of duty game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not, I'm not a big gamer, but I actually think that I may end up, uh,  picking some new bad habits.  Yeah.  Thanks to the iPad.  The whole thing with Scrabble with being able to use that helper app on your iPhone  and sort of flick your letters onto the board remotely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's cool.  Magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tell me about that.  That's the official Scrabble version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So the Scrabble app for iPad is, is lovely.  Uh, I forget what the name of the app is for iPhone, but there's a, there's a  helper app that if you have, say three people playing Scrabble around the table  and each of the players happens to have an iPhone and happens to have this app  installed, you can set up your little deck or whatever you call it and just  flick your letters onto the board.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  We're going to see a lot of things like that.  I'm sure because you've got this blue, you've got Bluetooth.  It's very quick and easy to pair.  And they talk to each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To me, even just that design decision, that kind of playfulness and it's like  a pun in technology, sort of being self-aware of what the technology is  capable of that in and of itself is a thing of beauty and beyond whatever the  gameplay experience is, whoever thought of that, like thumbs up, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's a very, that's a very good way to, to put it.  It's, it's very playful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now you're still killing zombies, Patrick.  I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, I am.  So the graphics are pretty good on this.  Actually.  It's a fairly good experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This was a hard game to play on the iPhone because you don't, you know, the  screen is so small, you don't have really room for controls.  So you're kind of obscuring what you're doing with your big fat thumbs, but you  could see there's so much room on the iPad that you really can use joysticks  and thumb controls and they work quite well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I've actually, as far as the gaming goes, it's a lot better than it is on the  iPhone and I'm actually finding it very playable because I've actually tried to  play this game on the iPhone too.  And it's a hard, say the least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jason, what are you playing?  You got any games on there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I just, you just cost me 10 bucks.  I bought plans versus zombies.  And so that's the end of my life.  It is the end of your life.  I have an embarrassing addiction to Bejeweled 2 Blitz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love Bejeweled 2 Blitz.  You told me how to play actually.  You really helped my game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so the, it's a totally embarrassing thing is like my two sister-in-laws and  like, they're addicted to it.  So I basically am in every week in competition with them to see who can  score more on Bejeweled 2 and they both beat me.  You know, like it's just embarrassing.  And then everybody knows when you play it because you have to post your high score.  So now people are like, you're, what are you doing?  You have all this free time with your kid and all this stuff.  You're playing Bejeweled every day.  And I'm like, well, that's what I'm in line for something.  You know, whatever.  But, you know, I just thought of something though.  You were talking before about, you know, why is it not have all the features?  Why can't you multitask and stuff like that?  And I think the most awesome feature of, of this surprise feature for me is  that the battery lasts forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's so great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How is that possible?  I mean, my iPhone lasts under an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Jason, I was thinking, I was arguing about this with somebody yesterday.  The fact that the device is not yet trying to connect to a cellular network, I  would wager has something to do with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  But I mean, 12 hours of battery life, 10 hours of battery life, playing movies,  playing games.  It's absurd.  And I think this is why Steve is keeping all the other features out of the item.  I think he realized his battery life is paramount.  And I think he's made such a big deal about Windows crashing in his marketing  campaigns and he's got that sort of, you know, three decades of fighting Bill  Gates and Microsoft.  And that's like his one thing he can always take out like, oh, blue screen of  death, blue screen of death.  He is paranoid about having a blue screen of death on his, on his device.  So the only thing he allows to run the background is the phone or the iPod  software, which is something he has direct control over.  He's desperate to not have it crash or have the battery go down.  If you multitask, the battery is going to last half as long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody I think it was the ultimate or the unofficial Apple weblog pointed out  that one of the reasons they may not have flash in here and they may not, they may  have done their own chip is because when you do an ASIC, a custom ASIC like the  A4, you can take capabilities out and you don't need unlike a general purpose chip  where you'd have support for things like flash or a camera where you'd have, you'd  have capabilities built in to support these technologies.  You can save energy.  You can save complexity.  You can make a cheaper chip.  If you know, well, we're not going to support a camera.  We're not going to support flash.  You don't have to support those things in the hardware either.  What are you showing there, Robert?  I'm showing you the new Netflix app.  I love that by the way.  I watched a movie last night.  Yeah.  That's what made me realize this is a TV or this is the competitor for this is  maybe not your laptop, but your TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, look at what we're doing here.  You know, we, we can have personalized media experiences.  Uh, we can be watching a 60 inch movie.  We can then be on Twitter and talking with our friends and Patrick can be on  Facebook or reading his forums and we don't have to have the same experience  or we can play a game against each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Family life.  It's all over folks.  It was bad enough with Blackberries and iPhones.  Now we don't have to talk to each other or even look at each other at all.  Ever again.  Are you going to have a rule, Robert?  No iPads at the table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is going to stay in the family room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's probably a smart idea.  I could just see this under the table at my house.  So all the teenagers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, can you stop the iPhone from being used there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to take it away from them.  That's sad.  How about a Kindle?  Is this a threat to Kindle as a book application?  Let's talk about that in a second before we do.  I do want to mention GoToMeeting and you know, by the way, this is one of the hot  apps on here is a GoToMeeting app.  They, folks at Citrix released a free GoToMeeting player.  So, I mean, I love the idea that you're, you're, you're, you're, you're supposed  to be at work and you're supposed to be meeting with somebody and you just go out,  you know, you take it easy, you go out to the park and you launch the GoToMeeting  player and now you can join a meeting and watch the meeting and participating in the  meeting directly from your iPad.  GoToMeeting is a great program for people who have to meet in business.  If you've been making conference calls and you've been suffering through them,  you've been suffering through the, the pain of being on the phone and knowing the  other person's playing with their iPad or their iPhone, playing, you know, the  jewel blitz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know they're doing it because it gets quiet on the other end, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know they're doing it because I'm doing the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, Leo, I just want to say I was just looking at CNN's coverage of the Quake  just now.  The last line of the report is posters to Twitter reported fueling the Quake as  far as Phoenix, Arizona.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of amazing how CNN has embraced Twitter.  I mean, it's as if they discovered it and then, you know, they just embraced it.  It's everywhere they are now.  And it almost makes it feel passe that mainstream media has such a big, such a  hold on it.  I have to say Twitter is really nice on the iPad.  Yeah, sure is.  There are three good applications.  Twitterific immediately came out with a free one.  TweetDeck has a very nice one that basically duplicates the functionality of  TweetDeck on the desktop.  But I have to say, I like Andrew Stone's version.  Andrew does really, this is Twitilator Pro, does really beautiful stuff and I  think really uses the interface nicely.  So this is the timeline.  This square on the right can be direct messages.  See the border that lets you know.  It can be mentions.  See the little envelope that lets you know.  You can watch trends there, trending topics.  So we could easily see that the earthquake trending topic here.  There's also regional trends, which is something that Twitter does, but doesn't  necessarily exposed in a lot of the Twitter applications.  And I really like this inline pictures.  So if you use TweetPhoto or TweetPick or one of the well-known picture sites, it  just puts it inline right in there.  And I just, I just love that.  This is a very, anyway, there are a lot of different ones.  This one's not free.  Twitterrific is, and I think a lot of people will use Twitterrific, although  they have ads in Twitterrific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have Twitterrific up on my iPad right now so people can see it.  It's pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To me, it feels like it's not using the space very efficiently.  Look how big that is.  But you do get big pictures of people, which is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's nice for the pictures.  You know, I do like to be able to see people.  I have a TweetDeck as well, which is really pretty good.  It has more, more information on the screen, more tweets on the screen.  But I actually liked the look of this and like, because my stream moves so fast, I  just like to sit there in bed and just, you know, page through my stream.  Right.  Pretty nice.  Have you tried Twitterlider?  No, that looked really cool.  I'm going to try that next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So pretty.  I'm a sucker for pretty.  I love it that design is going to become so much more important.  Thanks to this.  Apple already did that on the Macintosh and this just takes it to the next level.  Why are you showing us that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because this is my answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Kindle is dead.  Yeah.  Let's talk about book reading.  Battery is empty.  I was, I have to say, I, and I mentioned this earlier, I'm thrilled that, that  Amazon's Kindle application is not only on here, updated and Apple hasn't stopped  it.  So all of my Kindle books, everything I have in my library is available here.  And using Whispersync is always up to date.  And this is a really great experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love that the titles, the page covers are in color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, in fact, if I'm looking at a programming book, the Steve Kochans  Objective C book, and apparently he did the screenshots in color because they're  in color on the Kindle application, which is great.  Yeah.  The Winnie the Pooh that comes with the iBook application, of course, has color  illustrations too, and is actually a very good choice.  But what about reading?  Is it as easy to read on here?  Do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think so.  I, you know, I, I, I read a little bit last night on here and it was just as  nice as the Kindle.  The one exception is that there's glare on the screen.  Right.  And also it doesn't work in bright sunlight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's best in the dark, let's face it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And, and if you, so, right.  So I bought the Kindle cause I live near the beach and so I like to go out there.  I just found I never used it for that.  So, so that argument just doesn't wash with me because when I'm on the beach, I, you  know, I just, I never liked reading that much on, on the Kindle.  And here the page turns are so much faster so I can read faster.  I can skim faster.  The Kindle is really hard to skim through a book, which is a lot of how I read.  This is why I like paper because you can, you know, in fact, who has a big book  here, Oh, downstairs is Tom Peters new book.  And it's a, it's the kind of book that you don't read from front to back.  You sort of skim through it and look for an interesting idea.  Right.  And then you focus on that idea for a little while and then you skim  and find another one, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to say, if it's got color illustrations like this, Winnie the Pooh,  it just, this just beats the Kindle all like crazy.  Yeah.  Just, it's just gorgeous.  Um, you know, it's funny is the Kindle app on the, uh, on the iPad doesn't have  the dictionary that the Kindle has, but the iBook app does have the dictionary.  And I've always thought that was a nice feature of the Kindle is that you can  look up a word, uh, if you're reading along and you don't know the word, of  course it's got the same capabilities with notating and bookmarking and all  of that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, not only that, but look at this book, uh, Peter Rabbit.  This isn't even in the Kindle app.  This is just an iPhone app that you download, you know, but you, um, you  click on it, it has color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, it reads to you and I'm going to leave that off.  But as it reads to you, it fills in the, uh, it fills in the picture, you know,  and, um, you know, it's colored.  Look at that compared to the, uh, the Kindle.  My son never liked the Kindle.  Right.  You know, my, my two year old, he's not going to be kept attentive to a black  and white screen that doesn't move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, my 75 year old mom says she's going to continue to use the Kindle  because it's lighter and it's easier on her eyes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, talk about that.  Um, yesterday was the first day my mother in law has really used a computer  and she doesn't, she's, she grew up in Iran.  She doesn't speak English.  And I was able to pull up Farsi, the Farsi version of the BBC and hand it to her.  And because, because of the form factor, it's, uh, it's more like looking at a book.  Right.  So people like that who are adverse to computers feel a lot more comfortable.  If you hand them a laptop with a lot of keys that they don't understand and can't  read, they, they really freak out.  But she took right to it.  She was paging through things and clicking.  She learned how to click on things and how to zoom on things really easily.  And so it's bringing a new, a new kind of person to the computer world.  Remember only about a seventh of the world's population is on computers.  Out of 7 billion people, you know, probably around a billion and a half are on  computers and probably around 2 billion are on cell phones.  So if this metaphor, if this style thing brings computing to more people,  that'll help us all out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you, uh, would you read books?  Do you use a Kindle, uh, Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, um, no, I, uh, I listened to audio books on audible, um, Kindle, you know,  I just spent my whole day reading emails and other documents.  So at the end of the day, I'm really tired.  My eyes, I just like to close them and listen to an audio book.  Um, I think most people sadly don't read that much.  So the, you know, for the majority of users, they would rather have a  game playing device that can surf the web.  And then books is something they do 5% of the time or 10%.  And the serious readers, yeah, they might go for the Kindle over, um, you know,  the iPad, but I think the iPad got it right, which is, you know, the make,  make the screen really good for surfing the web and looking at photos and videos  and all that kind of stuff, and then maybe lose a little bit of traction when  people are reading a book than the other way around.  I mean, surfing the web on a Kindle is a joke, right?  Um, but if you turn, I find if you turn the brightness down on the iPad,  it looks much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can do that.  It's built into the book application.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And the book application, if you put it down to about, I don't know, a third,  it's much more readable.  If you have it on the top, your eyes just start vibrating.  Uh, but yeah, it sucks in the sun.  I mean, it's unreadable.  I mean, even the iPad in general, I mean, if you're in a room with too much light,  it's not readable.  Is that this, these glare screens are very glaring.  Yeah.  I don't, what is the point of it?  Is it just, is the, is the glare-ness what makes it so crisp?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Blacks are richer because in order to reduce glare, you have to essentially  almost fog up the screen.  And, uh, and, uh, so you don't get the contrast ratios that you would get with  the, with the clear screen.  It's just a clear screen.  It's a glass screen.  How about you, Jenny?  Are you a Kindle user?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, I'm not, you know, I've tried it out, but it never, uh, it was never a device  that I got all churchy about.  I like the iPad because it fits with my continuous partial attention deficit  disorder lifestyle.  So I can change my mind very quickly between wanting to read a book and wanting  to maybe work on a lightweight blog post for Boing Boing, uh, play a game, you  know, look around in the periodic table of elements.  You guys haven't shown that on screen.  That's my favorite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't have it.  Would you show it?  Cause it's expensive.  You got it from Apple.  I didn't get it.  So I have to buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's 14 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a lot for the periodic table of the elements for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, but it's not just any periodic table.  It's got pictures of copper.  Look at that.  I'm a shill for science.  You guys look at this.  Oh, actually that is pretty.  Okay.  All right.  And then look here, I'm going to open up the Wolfram Alpha.  Um, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  I'm buying it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can see that there's like, you can look at the thermodynamic properties of  copper, but here let's go to the second page and then you see all of the  different representations and you see how I'm like moving around that, that  dragon with my finger so you can manipulate the objects and then look at that.  So now we're looking at, uh, what would be a 3d representation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, so if you had the glasses, the anamorphic glass, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't have them on my desk right here right now, but there's these, um,  uh, it's like for $4, you can buy these little boxy, uh, paper lenses that you  look at, not paper lenses, paper glasses with little plastic lenses and you look  at this application and it's, it's really amazing.  You can twirl those little 3d images too.  So it's, it's like, you really do have sort of a holographic experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, Leo, I just, I, uh, loaded the Wolfram Alpha app up on my iPad  and I just typed in the word copper and it does all sorts of fun stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Could you explain why they charge for that app when I can use the Safari and do,  can I not do exactly the same thing in Safari?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, yeah, it's two bucks now.  So it's, it's not as expensive.  So it's a donation to Steven.  Yeah.  You know, help help developers stay alive and notice there's no ads on here.  So he's not making a whole lot of money, um, off of a $2 ad or a $2 app so far.  I think it's, it just has a little bit nicer layout, but God knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, I bought the Wikipedia application.  Don't ask me why I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jimmy Wales needs to eat too, you know, I don't think he, I don't even

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  have anything to do with it.  I don't think he wrote the Wikipedia application.  Um, all right.  So, uh, gaming thumbs up book reading.  Well, kind of Metsa Metsa.  Uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  here's something for the 3g version.  Cause we haven't seen the 3g version of the iPad yet.  Are we going to see a new kind of traffic app come out for this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I was surprised at how good the geolocation is even without GPS on this.  I guess they're using sky hook, but the maps, the maps application works quite  well, you're able to pinpoint yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you guys trace skywalk or sorry, star walk the star?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I got to buy that too.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it just so happens that I have it.  Let's see.  Here you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it knows where you are and it shows you the sky as you're pointing at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly.  So there's the crab and a Kenis major and there's trippy ambient music.  Can you hear it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, turn it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it's cause I got to turn it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can just picture like 50 people at burning man carrying that around  the Playa next year.  Oh yeah.  This is dude check out doors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's called, what is that called?  Star Walker, Skywalker star star walk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's 10 bucks.  I mean, it's pricey, but that and the elements are certainly my two favorite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's Google going to do?  Because Google's coming.  I know there's Google tablets coming with a Google Chrome OS and the Google  version of that app is already free on Android.  So I bet, you know, the Google's going to come in with a really nice map on their,  on their app and a whole bunch of new, new kinds of apps on theirs.  It'll be really interesting to see how Google and Apple compete over this new  space that Apple is really proving exists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, somebody just corrected me on the price too.  I think it's actually at least it's 499.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I just bought it.  That's how I know.  I'm a sucker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The answer to your question, Robert, is that the Android tablets are going to  sell probably two or three to one to iPads.  Really?  You think so?  Absolutely.  Because there'll be probably 30% less and there'll be, I would, I would say  there'll be 50 different versions of it out in the year, just like there are.  And if you look at like the HTC phones and how quickly they're iterating and the  features they're putting in them and the stability of the Android operating system,  Android, it's very clear Android's going to outpace the number of iPhones.  And with the iPad, I think it will be an even bigger difference because when you  think about it, this is going to be a six, $700 device.  If you want to have the version with, you know, the internet on it.  And when it comes out on Android, gosh, I would be surprised if it's over 500.  You'll probably have three, four, three or $400 purchases.  And when these things get down to 300, you know, everybody's going to have one,  just like a lot of kids have the iPod touch in a family.  You will have three of these in your house, but when there's six, $700, you're  not going to have three of them in your house and prices really matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And  I'm less interested in the three G I'm really pissed that they didn't put GPS in  the cheaper device because I'm for my car.  My kids are going to be sitting in the back seat with two, with two of these or  three of these and Patrick's along.  And I'm going to put by a sprint 4g modem that's coming out in San Francisco for  the car, it costs about a hundred or $200.  Tantech had one that South by Southwest and it's really fast.  It's like DSL speed speeds.  And then you spray wifi into the car.  And so if you have three devices in the car, they all use the same connection.  And I only paid for the connection one time instead of having to buy 3g for each  different iPad or Google Chrome OS pad that comes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the future.  Yeah.  I have one.  And in Austin, the sprint overdrive actually was connecting over 4g and it  was legitimate DSL speeds.  And Los Angeles was getting 4g next from what I understand.  And sprint is on a jihad to get cause sprints as a company is really screwed up  right now.  So they're basically saying, let's bet the whole farm on 4g.  So it's going to be great for consumers.  And I think the future is people are going to have this and phones without  cellular service on them.  So you'll get one of these.  What is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tell us what that thing is.  I can see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So for the wifi router and it's, it's really cool about it is it has called the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  overdrive overdrive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And what's cool about it is it has a, it creates a little wifi network.  It connects over 3g or 4g and you can connect a bunch of devices to it.  And it's got this very cool led display here that shows you how many people are  connected to it, how much you've sent or signal strength.  And I'm finding myself carrying this with me.  And for example, I was playing poker the other night till six or seven in the  morning and I was at the casino and I just popped this out and had my two, my  blackberry, my iPhone running off this because it was a better connection and  faster.  So using the iPhone on AT&T is really sucks.  Obviously we all know that.  So basically what you do is you get one of these and now your iPhone is on sprint  and this lasts two hours.  And it's, this is a, this is a first generation device.  They're a little bit screwy.  They freeze up sometimes and I had a rebooting problems.  I sent it in, I got another one.  This one's a little bit better.  So it is first gen is a sort of disclaimer, but I've gotten two hours of life out  of this using heavy internet.  So I think that, and you can, it's crazy, but they have a new innovation that I'm,  I guess Steve Jobs hasn't figured it out yet, but if you go on the back here, you  can open it up and take the battery out.  It's a very advanced technology, removable batteries.  I know, I think Steve's working his R and D department's hard at work on the  removable battery concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They can't figure out how to get the removable battery and the solid aluminum  back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They could figure it out if they wanted to.  It's so, this is the thing that's so frustrating.  I mean, you really, I'm, I'm an adult and I can't change the battery on my iPhone.  This is when the, the arguments of like, oh, it's beautiful.  It has to be designed well, changing batteries.  People have been doing for 50 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you said one thing that you like about this is the long battery life.  One of the reasons you can get more battery life is because you can put more  battery in because you don't have to put an enclosure around the battery.  So you get more, you get more capacity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not only that, but the first thing I did when I picked this up was just feel the  edges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no, I don't think it's aesthetic.  I think it's, I think, well, it's partly aesthetic, but I think Steve jobs, you  know, partly aesthetic, but it's also, it really is a way to get maximum battery  life out of the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He doesn't want to put a fricking door on this thing or a little clip or anything.  He wants it to be smooth all the way around.  And that sure is nice when you're holding this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you're being ridiculous, Robert.  I mean, this is Steve Jobs' OCD speaking.  I mean, he guy is obsessed with droid sex, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, you look at battery doors on these things and they add, add complexity  to the devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They add buttons.  Are you changing the battery's complexity?  Are you out of your mind?  Do you want a flashlight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  I know that Shenny has to leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cause they're LED and they last for 50 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Boys, Ms. Jardin has to move on.  And I really thank you for being here, Shenny.  It's really nice to meet you finally.  After all these years, I've been a fan and of course, Boing Boing is absolutely  the must read blog and you do such a great job with it.  Also, Shenny.net, X-E-N-I.net.  Another place to go.  Thank you so much for being here.  Uh-oh.  I think you've muted yourself again.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Muted yourself.  We muted you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure she was saying nice things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I, uh, can you hear me now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can hear you now.  Thank you, Shenny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you have me back, I'll make sure to bring another earthquake with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Would you please?  That was exciting.  I will.  That was the most real world thing we've had happen on this show ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, and I'll just leave you with one thing.  So I was just looking on Twitter and, uh, an astronomer that I follow said that the  type of waves, uh, the long rolling waves from the distant earthquake are known as  love waves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you just named the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I bet you it's a geologist named love, but okay, we'll take it.  Bye everyone.  Thank you, Shenny.  Great to talk to you.  Boingboing.net and xennie.net.  And, uh, boy, she's a, she's really a very talented and well-known, but you, I  didn't realize you'd worked with her before, Jason.  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I, uh, I met Shenny back when I was doing Silicon Island reporter in the 90s and  she was working for one of the clients of the magazine and she helped me at the,  one of the events we were doing here in Los Angeles.  And she was like, Oh, I'll moderate a panel.  She did an amazing job.  And I went to the people she was working for.  And I said, listen, uh, it's been great having you as a client, but I have some  bad news.  And they said, what?  I said, I'm going to hire Shenny.  Uh, and they were like, Oh my God, how could you do that?  Oh my God.  It was a whole controversy.  I said, I'll give you a free sponsorship for the next event.  And they were like, okay.  You know, um, but so I basically gave a $20,000 sponsorship to get her to work  for us and she did an amazing job.  She's awesome.  Yeah.  She's one of my 10 favorite bloggers.  It's interesting.  Like there's a whole group of people who worked at Silicon alley reporter,  Rafa Dali from pay content, uh, Shenny Jardin.  And actually I was the first person to publish clay Shirky.  Really?  Silicon alley reporter.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I love him too.  Boy, is he amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I used to edit his pieces and I'd be like, you have 800 words.  He'd write 800 words.  I would get through two paragraphs and say, I'm already lost.  And I'd say, dude, you have to explain these references because I don't think  people know this 14th century poet.  Nor do they know this philosopher.  And so when you reference the two of them and you say like, you know, real  gay is to this as you know, windows 95 is to, you know, Netscape 1.0.  I don't think people understand.  He's like, really?  No, no, they don't.  Cause I I'm the average person and I don't, I slept through that  course in college and I didn't go to graduate school.  It was pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, what are you playing, Robert?  What is that?  That looks really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Patrick's playing geometry wars.  Yeah.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That looks really, that looks really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It costs me like a 50 or 80.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I have spent so much money on apps and you know, I don't feel  like we're seeing anywhere.  It's interesting.  I think in some ways this is, this is television in the Milton  Burleur, you know, we're, we're, this is, this is a first generation device.  And just imagine, I mean, look at, we're seeing already and just imagine what  we're going to see in a year as people start to understand how to develop for it.  Apple did a brilliant thing by making it the same operating system as the iPhone.  So you've got this great base of applications and a lot of developers who,  more importantly, I think, who know how to write for it.  And we're already seeing amazing stuff.  And I think this is just the beginning.  This, this, this is, if, if I were a young guy learning to program.  I'd be, I'd be learning objective C cocoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know what the problem is though, Leo is if Steve jobs was less  obsessive about control and he let those apps run on Android and Blackberry.  Do you realize how big Apple would get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I agree.  I think it's a mistake.  And I think what you said about an Android tablet selling three times  more than the iPad is very interesting.  And you're probably right.  Not just for price.  I think, you know, you know, me, I switched from an iPhone to a Nexus one.  I like Android.  Um, I understand this, that, you know, multitasking as much as people like it  does make it harder to write software, harder to maintain an operating system.  Reliably it adds to complexity.  Um, and you know, in a way, if you have something that's as snappy as the iPad  is, you can kind of live without multitasking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, it would be great as a feature in the settings panel that said, I want to  turn on the advanced feature set, or I want to turn on the developer feature set.  And Steve Jobs could do that in 15 minutes.  As a matter of fact, they must have that internally, like turn on developer app  thing.  So we just won't give it to people.  It's, and it's just absurd.  I mean, if you look at the phones, this is the embarrassing thing.  I think for Steve is that in the first, uh, you know, six months of the Android  phones being out, they had better hardware profiles than anything he's built to  date and people think he's invincible and untouchable.  It's not true.  Uh, you know, a lot of his innovations, you look at Microsoft Windows did to,  you know, the first version of the max off.  Remember when Microsoft originally had DOS, it didn't have a graphical user  interface and windows came along and beat them 96 to four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, I remember, I remember talking to Steve when he was still at Pixar.  So it's probably in 93, 90, maybe 94.  Um, and he said, and I thought it was very telling.  We had a 10 year lead on Microsoft when we came out with the Macintosh in 1984,  we had a 10 year lead.  We let it slip and 10 years later with windows 3.1 and later windows 95,  Microsoft caught up and we, and apple lost.  And that was at the time it was very astute.  Um, and I think he knows better than anybody that there is no such thing as a  permanent lead in this industry.  It moves way too fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's, it's an interesting gambit.  He's trading, um, features, advanced technology,  uh, and the, and the high tech crowd for ease of use and a lack of crashing.  And I think that it doesn't have to be binary.  He could very easily make the concept of jailbreaking, um, legal and just call it  experimental, but he is so obsessive.  I think that he cannot handle the idea that somebody would put that on experimental  mode and they would be at a dinner and say, Oh, my iPhone crashed.  He takes it as a personal insult that his, you know, that if his, if his thing  crashes and that's the whole reason for the app store as well, you know, and,  and complete control.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it extends into three specific things.  I think one is he wants these devices, uh, to not crash.  Um, two, he doesn't want anybody to be confused and feel intimidated by them.  And then three, he doesn't want children to have a bad experience and have parents  go, this is inappropriate for kids.  And if you look at Google, like Google is inappropriate for kids.  If you type in any woman's name and turn off safe search and look at images, it's  you're going to be really, uh, you know, um, offended and or delighted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I gotta say there's already one porn website that has created an  iPad specific version.  I'm not going to say the name, but I had to test it out.  So I did just went and visited.  Can you say the name in the chat room?  It's got about five hundred and seventy and it's iPad specific.  What they've done is they've taken all the flash videos and they've made them  H dot two sixty four seven twenty P so that they'll play back on an iPad.  What is that you're showing us there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did a search for porn and found these two apps, porn star names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  This is not an app.  This is just, and this is the point is that you do have a browser in here.  And if you, and you can't, you know, these are actually apps, you know, but  the porn star names is just names.  You do a search for porn.  No, yeah, but go search for porn on an Android.  There's plenty of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Most of it awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it'll, it'll be also interesting to see what the adult, adult entertainment  industry does about flash and silver light.  And I bet, I bet they go HTML five very quickly because of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what this website did.  And you know, it took them no time at all.  They just made seven twenty P H dot two sixty four videos and said, this is  an iPad version of our site and done.  I wasn't able to get any of the videos to play though, which relieved me because  it was, it was actually scary.  Lisa Tickle Pink has disappeared off the internet.  Lisa dear, if you're watching, I wore a pink shirt just for you.  We would like to get you on and talk about the fact that you are now a  30,000 in the 30,000 follower club on Twitter, which is more than Dave Weiner  who invented RSS.  So you're doing okay kid.  And we also would like to, if, if somebody could provide us with an alternative  service to Twitter and we'd like to give away an iPad before the show's over.  So we'll do that when we come back.  I hope before we do though, get ready, get your sighs and whispers ready.  Jason Callicannis, cause it's time to talk about how the ball, how the ball.com.  Oh, this, this website is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're a type in audible.com slash tweet.  Type in audible.com slash tweet.  Um, what is the, um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  audible.com slash Twitter because you get one, not one, but two books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Three books is better than one.  Or, uh, and you don't have to hurt your eyes.  Close your eyes.  You have a shades, you put shades on and, uh, you relax and listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought that was funny when you said that Jason, cause it's in fact true  that when I read books, I fall asleep almost instantly, uh, cause I'm reading  in bed and I go, and, uh, but audible, I listen to books while I'm driving,  while I'm gardening, while I'm in the gym.  These are times I'm not going to fall asleep.  I get hours of reading done every single day.  Thanks to audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know, there's now there's like facts and news and then there's wisdom.  And I think what a lot of young people don't do today is they're so hyped up  on getting quick news, tweets, Facebook updates, you know, news stories, blog  posts, that's all great, but you don't get deep wisdom from that cause you don't  get so deep into a subject that you actually understand it on a very deep  level and it can apply that.  And when you listen to business audio books or science audio books or  psychology or self-improvement, and you spend five, 10 hours with the subject.  You really have learned something deeply.  And that's what's missing from most people's, um, media, um, diet.  They don't have substance and wisdom.  And that's what I get out of audible because that's what I'm craving.  And that's what I apply to business.  I have quoted, you know, this book that I've been listening to and I'm two  thirds of the way through it.  Uh, talent is overrated to my people.  Uh, and you know, and to CEOs of other companies, I'm an angel investor in,  and this book is awesome, but you know, I wouldn't have read it because I'm just  too tired to read a three, four or 500 page book at the end of the day, but I  can plow through this when I'm driving, when I'm on a Southwest flight to the  valley, I mean, audible makes my life very easy.  I'm on the two book plan and that means I'm always like four books ahead.  And that's, that's the perfect ratio for me because I've got, I'm probably about  three or four books behind, which means I, if I want to switch, I've always got  them there, it's no pressure and it's only like, what is it, 12 bucks a month  or something silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's not very expensive.  It's definitely the way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the, and the points that you get each of these books, it's cumulative.  So like, let's say you, you, you take two months off from it and you're like,  Oh my God, I wasted it.  Like, you know, you have your Netflix account, you don't use it for three  months and you're like, Oh my God, I wasted it.  That happens to me all the time.  Not with audible.  You, those credits build up.  So then, you know, like, let's say you go in there, you have five or six credits.  Like I did the other day, I had five or six credits.  I went right to the, um, they have like an Oscars of book awards.  I looked at the top two or three business books, top two or three science books.  They say, you know what?  I'm taking them all.  I'll put them on my phone.  If I listen to it, I listen to it.  But for 150 bucks a year, 200 bucks a year, that, that, what is that the cost of?  You know, I mean, it's a cost of a couple of iPad applications.  14 iPad applications.  You're going to get really smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was doing a search for clay Shirky, but I entered clay shark instead.  Let me let me, I don't think any of his books are on here too bad.  Cause that would be really something to listen to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And maybe with him actually, um, reading them, reading them would be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's so much great stuff.  Look, you get two choices.  So pick your two free books by going to audible.com slash Twitter.  You're going to sign up for the platinum account.

And you had no, you, you had no idea what happened.  Was it, what was that like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was crazy.  Um, I literally had over 2000, 3000 emails and my server just said,  we can't deliver anymore.  So I didn't know what was going on.  Someone emailed me eventually and said, look, and put the link onto your show.  And, you know, so now I'm watching your show.

It's lots of fun and uni tech is great.  And it's all their fault that I was on Twitter.  So, uh, it's been, yeah, it's been great to see the social  experiment, um, you know, from my school.

And I want to see some cartoons Floyd.  So there's our winner.  We're going to tweet him at Floyd Norman.  He's got 98 followers.  He's like you, Lisa.  He's I think new to Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, congratulations to him.  He'll be thrilled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're all saying that's not random.  Why is that not random?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you can't please 30,000 people.  That's one thing I have learned on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I certainly hope that's random.  If it's not random, it's random enough.  I don't know him.  Do you know him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know the guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think, I think that that's a random follower.  So that's, that's a, we're going to, we're going to say congratulations to Floyd  Norman and all the people in there who say it's not random.  Well, I guess it's cause it wasn't you, but we'll, we'll probably do this again.  Lisa, congratulations.  We're going to send you out your very own iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

I know it's bedtime for you.  I'm not going to keep you up any later.  Cause it's not, it's, it's, it's the morning into 12.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Oh, look at it.  It's beautiful there.  It's clear 66 degrees.  It's going to be 71 degrees today.  Beautiful, beautiful weather in Auckland.  That doesn't look like Auckland.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It looks like Honolulu, but it looks like a beautiful day there.  So I hope you're enjoying your day.  Thank you, Lisa Etheridge.  Congratulations.  Thanks for playing along with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thanks, Lisa.  Lisa Etheridge, our winner.  And congratulations.  I'm going to close this out.  To Floyd.  Now that I don't know why everybody would get that result now because that's  her official follower of the day.  It gets the same result every time because that's her follower of the day.  It does it once a day.  I'm going to go with it.  Unless anybody could tell me there's no reason to go with that.  The other one was broken, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I, uh, I love that Melissa Etheridge.  Is she adorable?  Come to my window.  I mean, what's the chances you pick somebody who's an internationally  known Grammy winning, not Melissa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lisa Etheridge.  I should have asked her, are you relation?  Any relation?  She's funny.  I like her.  All right.  She is adorable.  And thanks to Kevin Rose for picking such a winner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, Kevin Rose has a propensity to pick beautiful women.  He has a knack for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He has a knack.  But he says it's the first I asked him.  I said, come on.  You, you, he says, I searched for.  I hate technology.  And that was the first one that came up.  He said, I didn't, you know, dig deep through the stack, trying  to find somebody, uh, cute.  Yeah.  But he did now everybody's saying, well, how is she going to lose her followers?  Now?  I don't think so.  I think she's actually pretty fun to follow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's up to her now to keep those 31,000 people happy.  I'm sure she can do that.  Congratulations to Elisa and congratulations also to our cartoonist.  Uh, Floyd Norman.  Who is our, I hope that, I mean, I don't see how it could not be random.  That's, I mean, that's, that's who we got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got Floyd Norman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, how could that not be random?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's amazing.  He's the American animator who worked on the Walt Disney.  No, you lie.  Is that true?  People are saying in the chat room,  that he's famous.  Yeah.  Floyd E.  Norman.  He's an American animator who worked for Walt Disney, Sleeping Beauty, Sword  in the Stone and the Jungle Book.  Is this guy look like he's, uh, 75 years old?  Yeah.  Approximately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  He, no, he says back at Disney today after lecturing at USC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You picked this guy.  I mean, literally look up Floyd Norman in on the Wikipedia.  This is, this guy's a famous guy.  He also worked on Hey, Hey, Hey, it's fat Albert.  Uh,  Twitter's an amazing thing.  Wait a second.  He was involved in Pixar, Toy Story 2, and Munster's Inc.  There's some sort of fix going on.  I think Steve Jobs is controlling the Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He probably doesn't, you know what Floyd, if you don't want the iPad, we'll find  a charity you can give it to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're like school on Saturday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love the iPad.  This iPad is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  Is it possible that there was a fix in there that, that, no, I think that was  random. I think that was the guy we just, we've just happened to pick a,  a famous guy.  It's yeah, it could happen.  It just happened that way.  He's following Lisa.  So he must've wanted it.  He must be a listener, right?  We have many of our listeners are absolutely wonderful, talented,  accomplished people in many different fields.  And that's just what happened.  Do you think it's credible that 700, stop that Robert, stop it.  Look at that face.  So disturbing.  What a punum.  I'm fun.  I'm only a mother could love what, do you think there's any credibility to the idea  that they might have sold 700,000 in the first day?  Is that possible?  That's absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it is.  Yeah.  I think it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Predictions for sales in the first year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, I think, I think it's very possible.  The UPS trucks here were very, very busy, dropping off iPads all day long.  Um, and I, based on what I'm seeing, I think it's very possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, there is going to be a lot of interest in this device because of the hand feel.  I think people really, um, are like, it's got an amazing, like the iPhone and has  such major buzz around it, people are just going to get it.  I, I picked it up and went to dinner with my wife and we were using it in a  restaurant and literally we had 15 people around us in the restaurant.  Um, and then we went to the movies.  So I just, as I was walking in the movie theater, I just held it up in the air.  And I said, I have an iPad.  Literally it was very obnoxious, but funny.  I have a video of it.  I have to get from my brother-in-law, but I was just walking around going, this is  an iPad, this is an iPad, would anybody like to touch it?  And literally there were 30 people around me touching the iPad and the manager of  the, um, movie came over and said, you, sorry, you have to stop that.  And I said, stop what?  He goes, you're advertising an iPad.  I said, I don't work for Apple.  He goes, sir, I can't have you trying to sell an iPad in here.  And I said, we never sell my iPad.  What are you talking about?  But it's got that same appeal.  Remember when you, when I first got the iPhone, I just, you know, remember  they was sold out for a month or two.  And, uh, when the first gem one came out and I was at a poker table and I took it  out and I go, look, I flopped an iPhone and I put it on the table and everybody was  like, let me see the iPhone.  $5 and people started throwing me $5 chips to, to, to hold it and play with it.  I give the back, but it's, it's got that same buzz.  So this thing's going to sell millions.  And I think parents are going to buy this for their kids.  I think kids are going to like this more than they like an Xbox.  You know, it's got more appeal than an Xbox or a PlayStation or an, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess, really you'd rather have, you'd rather have this in an Xbox, Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm already looking for a new thing to replace my laptop.  So why can't I replace my Xbox too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wonder if schools, you know, my kids' schools give them a Mac book, uh, when  they matriculate thousand dollar Mac book.  And I'm wondering if these schools might be looking at, uh, this as an alternative.  Uh, I don't know.  Is it as complete?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it can't replace that for school.  You need a keyboard.  I mean, this, this keyboard sucks.  I mean, you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Robert, I haven't looked at the pages app yet, but if it's, if it's good enough  and you have the keyboard attachment, why not load it up and spend the 10 bucks.  All right.  We're spending the 10 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I already bought pages keynote and I work as the whole I work suite and, um,  as many did numbers and you know, it's yeah, it's totally usable.  And I frankly liked the keyboard.  Although all you have to do is give them a $60 Bluetooth keyboard.  They got a full keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Watching Patrick's been typing on the forums on, on the iPad.  He's doing just fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, the keyboard is very useful.  I think, I mean, I would definitely want a physical keyboard if I was  going to write a paper on it, but I have a Bluetooth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  If you're going to write two sentences, you're fine.  If you're going to write over a paragraph, you're dead in the water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What about, and maybe that's why they didn't put cameras in it.  Actually.  What about a textbooks?  I imagine that all your textbooks will be on here, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's where, by the way, that's where you'd want multi-tasking because you  don't want to quit the textbook to go to the word processor to come back to the  textbook.  Absolutely.  So maybe you need this in a laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe.  I mean, at least the screen's big enough.  I mean, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think though that, you know, let me, let me put it this way.  How much it was school books for my kids this year were over $1,500.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you could cut $500 off the cost of the books and throw in an iPad,  it's a push.  You cut even more off the cost of the books.  I'm ahead.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, let's look at what this disrupts, right?  It disrupts the, the book industry.  It disrupts the, the car entertainment industry, right?  Because if you buy a new Toyota and you put a DVD system in there, it costs about  two or $3,000 for that.  Well, I can buy two iPad, two iPads for the back of the car for a thousand.  You're already a thousand ahead and you have better devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Interesting.  Hmm.  A couple of other quick notes.  Ed Roberts, the man who started MITS and made the first kit computer, the  MITS Altair, the computer that was on the cover of Popular Mechanics Magazine,  the cover that so inspired Bill Gates that he and Paul Allen said, quick,  this must need software.  Let's write basic.  They wrote a basic in simulation without access to an Altair, flew to  Phoenix, I'm sorry, Albuquerque where, where Ed Roberts lived and where MITS  was located and sold him basic and began a company called Microsoft.  Ed Roberts passed away this, this week at the age of 68 of pneumonia.  It's interesting story.  He sold his company, MITS a few years later with a five year non-compete,  got out of computers, became a physician, something he'd always wanted to do.  And has been practicing as a physician ever since.  Apparently Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates visited him last week on his deathbed.  Uh, and in quite a moving scene, he was the guy who really made Microsoft happen  and made the personal computer revolution happen and is kind of unknown.  Um, but I think he liked it that way.  I have a feeling he didn't want to be known as a, uh, as a pioneer.  He wanted to be known as a country doctor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We all go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we all go.  That's classy move by Bill Gates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's a re it was really touching.  Let me see if I get the quote.  Cause, uh, he was in Macon, Georgia, Bill Gates flew to his B's at his bedside.  Um, and, uh, let me see if I can find this.  Uh, Ed was willing.  This is a, on, uh, on the website, uh, the Gates notes.com, uh, joint statement  from Bill Gates and, uh, Paul Allen quote, Ed was willing to take a chance on us.  Two young guys interested in computers long before they were commonplace.  And we have always been grateful to him.  So cover popular electronics in January, 1975, uh, Bill dropped out of Harvard.  Paul Allen left his job at Honeywell and a Microsoft and  Microsoft basic were born.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amazing.  The Altair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ed Roberts was interviewed by the New York Times in 2001.  He says Bill Gates was a very bright kid, but he was a constant headache.  Admits you couldn't reason with him.  He added, he did his thing, things his way or not at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is the, um, that was the MO of Gates for a long time.  He basically is people tell me like, if he's in the room, it's  basically like game over, you know, it's he's going to tell you what's what.  And if you tell him, you know, any kind of dissenting opinion, he's going to  explain exactly how wrong you are.  And in 10 minutes, you're going to realize exactly how wrong you are.  And move on, but he's become a real philosopher and very enlightened, you  know, in his, um, third act, I think somebody who knows Steve, uh, fairly

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  well recently said the same thing has happened to Steve jobs, perhaps  because of his illness, uh, Steve was as confrontational as my way or the  highway as bill, in fact, they're both famous for their tempers and, you  know, uh, thinking they're the smartest people in the room and, and, and, you  know, having no, no patience for fools, but, uh, like Bill Gates, who's  mellowed with his retirement, they say that Steve has also, um, become a  little more Zen, a little more centered, a little more focused, less likely  to blow up at you.  She's still very firmly believes in what he believes as I'm sure bill does.  Uh, but, um, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got a chance to talk to bill at Ted and he's just so smart.  He's thinking a lot about, uh, nuclear and other kinds of energy, particularly  for the third world.  Um, and he's just so smart.  It has such a command of the subject that he's interested in.  You know, you can tell he just voraciously reads on, on whatever topic  he's interested in and he memorizes facts in a way that my brain doesn't  memorize them and, uh, he's able to debate and, uh, interact with people  and, and learn from them.  And, uh, I saw this go on right in the hallways.  He was really a remarkable person from that aspect of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, congratulations.  Uh, congratulations condolences I should say to Ed Roberts family and, um,  congratulations to Floyd Norman, our winner of an iPad and to Lisa tickled  pink, Lisa Etheridge, who got herself an iPad for putting up with us.  Thank you very much, Jason Calacanis for being here.  Happy Easter to you both.  I haven't said that.  And, uh, and I love your pictures of London.  You keep those coming.  And, uh, yes, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, it's fatherhood has been the greatest thing of my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hands down.  I guess she's too little to do an Easter egg hunt yet, but too little, but we

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  went to the park today where there was an Easter egg hunt and it's amazing.  I'm like waking up at, I don't know if you had this experience when you first  had kids or whatever, but waking up at six o'clock in the morning, six,  morning, morning, morning, just to hang out with her, you know, like it's, um,  and then I spent two hours with her every morning when she's like the most alert.  It's, it's like the two best hours of the day, every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's so neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm, I'm totally drunk on it.  I know how you feel.  It's just unbelievable.  I like to have these moments when I look at her eyes and I, and like, we're just  sitting there and she starts laughing and I had this amazing feeling of joy and  contentness that I've never experienced in my life.  I highly recommend everybody who's in the Twitter listening, wanting to make a baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Make a baby.  And there is a, or practice there is a Robert's now, where'd you get this video?  Robert of, is it Milan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, this is, this is a taken in the new Kelly park in San Jose, California.  They just re re-decorated the park to a cost of $72 million.  Wow.  Put rides in there.  It's really a great, a great place to take young kids to.  And Milan just loved this roller coaster.  He wants to ride it forever.  So this is actually off of Flickr, which shows again, Flickr has gone  with a iPad compatible video.  And so I shot this on my 5d and uploaded it to Flickr and now you can play that  video on iPad.  Isn't that awesome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that awesome?  And I've been looking at Floyd's Floyd Norman's Twitter account.  In fact, I think he probably joined Twitter to win an iPad cause  Lisa is his second follow.  Second person he followed after creating his Twitter account.  So I have a feeling he's there because of it.  I'm really glad Floyd won it.  I hope we can get him on the show next week.  I thank you all for being here.  Robert Scoble is the Scoble-izer.  Scoble-izer.com is his blog.  Uh, does Patrick have a blog he wants to plug Robert?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  No, not, not at the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He has a, he has a Facebook and a MySpace page, but.  Eh, what are you going to do?  Hold on.  Hold on.  I got a video for you to pull up.  It's a video of the, uh, first, first what it's like to be first in line.  At the, uh, Apple store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I saw that.  That was, that looked like a cult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You were on CNN, right?  Breaking through the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  There you go.  So this is what it's like to be at the Apple store.  We waited 22 hours for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What fun.  Yeah.  We had our cameras out there, but they got tired and went home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And in the line was a kid who wrote Chatroulette.  He stayed all night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, the kid who wrote Chatroulette was in the Palo Alto store line.  I thought he was a Russian kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was there from Moscow.  He went to, he came to Palo Alto just to hang out in line with us.  And, uh, Jason, you think your sites are incredible?  He's in three months.  Chatroulette's gotten 20 million unique views in just the last 30 days.  He showed me his, uh, Google analytics.  It's just crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Unbelievable.  Global trend.  I mean, how are you monetizing what you do from it from here?  I mean, that's really going to be the question, but, uh, there were two, there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  were two VCs, one sleeping on both sides of it.  I'm feeling that somebody has a way to make money with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's the next Mark Andreessen, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what?  That's more reflective of the fact that VCs have no idea what they're doing.  No imagination.  80% of the time.  Yeah.  And 20, you know, 20% having to do with, uh, you know, what he's built,  which is still significant, but venture capitalists are so unimaginative  that if they just see something spike, they're like, Oh, let me throw money at that.  It's good to me.  I'll take it.  Hey, wait, can I see that curve one more time?  The curve is going up like a hockey stick.  I'll take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's some, here's some money.  Jason Calacanis is at mahalo.com.  That's the place to go to find out.  Hey, by the way, thank you for the white label.  What is it?  Twit?  Yeah.  What is it?  Twit questions dot mahalo.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we, uh, no, just quick questions.  Uh, basically we have, um, we took our mahalo answers platform and we made  it white label a bowl, so it's like sort of WordPress for Q and A sites.  So it's twit questions, which has no questions yet.  Um, or we haven't publicized it yet.  That's true.  Or iPad answers, iPad dash answers.  I'm sorry.  We have a dash in the name.  It's terrible, but iPad dash answers is like a little vertical community just for  iPad and all those questions get syndicated back to mahalo.  But if you don't want to deal with mahalo and all the other stuff going on there,  you can just have a pure experience of answering just those questions.  That's cool.  Yeah.  So we're going to do it.  Like we did one for Toyota answers, which is just all Toyota cars.  Uh, so my concept is take the Q and A platform and build it out into verticals  like I did for web logs, Inc, but have all of that content syndicate back up to  a mother load database, uh, questions out there.  So it is a, it's a big strategy to it, but I just threw this together for you.  Thank you.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to play it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We didn't talk about accessories at all for this thing.  Like cases were, uh, Hey, here's a cat stand for your iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is Veronica Belmont's, uh, Stan.  You just put the iPad.  You doesn't need a stand, but you just put it on your, on your cat's butt.  And, uh, you know, the beauty of this because it doesn't get hot, you know,  you don't have to worry about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is the cat, is the cat Bluetooth enabled or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but it does have a USB port.  Hey, all right, everybody.  Thank you for being here.  We really appreciate it.  First time we've had an earthquake live on Twitter.  Uh, thanks to Shani Jardana also at boingboing.net.  We'll see you next week.  I am Leo Laporte.  Another twit is in the can.
