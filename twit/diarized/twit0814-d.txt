Transcript:  It's time for Twitter this week in tech great panel for you. Jason Heiner is here from CNET,  Larry Magid from Connect Safely and from Consumer Reports. I'm really excited.  Nicolas De Leon, he's their senior electronics reporter. There's lots to talk about. Who would  pay 69 million dollars for a JPEG? Well apparently someone would. It's the third largest price ever  for a living artist. Unbelievable. We'll also talk about who we think did it and what the real  reason behind it is. Some good news for internet users in rural areas. We'll talk about that.  Watch out. Time to stop sharing your Netflix password. They're cracking down. It's all coming  up next on Twitter.

It's time for Twit This Week in Tech, the show where we cover the week's  tech news with the best people I can find on short notice. No, it's the best people in tech  journalism like Jason Heiner, editorial director at CNET. Hi, Jason.  Hey, a pleasure to be here as always. For many years, my dear friend at Tech Republic.  Now you've been moved upstairs. Is that right? Yes, it's CNET now, which is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is CNET upstairs from Tech Republic? I mean, it's, it's obviously it's a much bigger brand,  right? It's like 10x the size of the brand. It was all owned by ZD net.  Actually, it was opposite CNET bought ZD net and Tech Republic. Okay, so you were originally ZD

Start time: 194.32

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  net. You got bought by CNET, which then got bought by that by the bigger fish, which is Verizon,

Start time: 212.06
End time: 234.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you're Red Ventures. Okay, that's right. So Red Ventures bought ZD net CNET, all the CBS  interactive properties. That's correct. It's very confusing. So sometimes you have people on like  when Devendra Hardwar from from gadgets on he he has to say, well, I can't talk about that. I work  for Verizon. But I don't think we have to worry about a conflict of interest. There's Red Ventures.

Start time: 254.44

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have been for the last 40 years, I think a subscriber to Consumer Reports. In fact,  I have to say Consumer Reports influenced very much how I do my tech coverage. For one thing,  they don't take ads and they buy the products they review. Now I still have to take ads. I  tried not to but it didn't work. But I do try to buy the products we review. And I was really  thrilled. The other day I got an email from Nicholas De Leon, who is their senior electronics  reporter to talk about something we'd had on an earlier show. And I said, Nicholas, I'm a long time  subscriber and member. I love Consumer Union, the parent organization, come on the show. And he and

Transcript:  his brick wall have agreed. Welcome. Yes. Great to have you. Thank you. Thank you for having me,  Leo. It's funny you say that CR has kind of inspired you. I am a big fan of yours going back  way back. I am not exaggerating when I say that Call for Help back in the day, my god viewing.  Oh my god for me. So this is really quite now I'm feeling old.

Start time: 358.14
End time: 629.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nothing old. Call for Help was one of two shows I did on tech TV. And that was the one that got  saved by the Canada Canada's tech TV and kept doing it up there in Toronto for a while. So  it's nice to meet you, Nicholas. Thank you for coming on. My pleasure. This, I gotta start with  this story because it's just crazy. We've been talking a lot about NFTs of late, non fungible  tokens and which are in some weird way related to crypto currencies and in some weird way related  to blockchain. In fact, I've had we've had many explainers over the last three weeks and I still  don't really get it. We in fact had Trey Radcliffe, the very talented photographer on  Wednesday on this week in Google, because he's doing some NFTs of his work. And I thought,  well, maybe he can explain it. No one can explain it. And then the other shoe dropped this week  at Christie's, which is the big auction site for for art. A creator of art named people  sold one of his JPEGs. It's a digital creation for $69 million. Is it dollars or is it crypto?  Well, it's worth 69 million, whatever it is. It is the is the third largest price paid for a  living artist. Beeple is up there now with Jeff Koons and David Hockney. 69 now nine, to be fair,  $9.3 million went to Christie's, which immediately I'm sure turned the Ethereum into American  cold hard cash. 60 million of it was bid by an anonymous bidder using a pseudonym, although we  think we now know who it is. And I'll explain that in just a second. $60 million. What did you get  for the 60 million? Did you get something you can hang on your wall? No. Did you get,  did you get what did you get? You got you didn't even get the JPEG. I guess you get you could have  the JPEG. You got an address which would give you this JPEG, which by the way, consists of 5,000  images that people has taken. He does a daily art image over the last well, since 2007, whatever  that is 14 years. So I mean, it's you know, the it's kind of the collective works of people.  But you don't even really get anything except a token, a thing that says you own it.  It can be infinitely reproduced, you can print it, anybody can print it, but you own it,  only you can own it. And that's a that's a firm done the blockchain. $60 million. Now the guy who  bought it uses the name Medecovin. But Amy Castor, who I don't know from Adam, but wrote in the blog  and I convinced me that that in fact, is a crypto entrepreneur has been on the scene for about seven  years named Vignesh Sundarasan. And furthermore, Amy Castor kind of explained for the first time  to me, what's really going on here. So it wasn't Medecovin's own Ethereum that he spent. In effect,  he created a another crypto bundle called B.20, bought the painting with that and is selling shares,  bits, fractional portions of the Beeple artwork to other people. In other words, step three profit.  He owns 59% of B.20. Notice who else owns it. Beeple owns a 2% stake. So in effect,  Beeple bought his own painting or part of his own painting. Not that there's any conflict of interest  there or is there. But really, I think if in your mind there is some question, and I'll ask you guys  now to comment, but if there in your mind is some question about what the hell is, how could a JPEG  be worth $69.3 million and why would somebody named Medecovin spend that kind of money on a JPEG?  It now becomes clear he's going to make money on it because he's in effect selling shares in this.

Start time: 630.08
End time: 633.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why would anybody buy a share of the JPEG? The idea of owning a piece of it is even harder for me

Start time: 637.62
End time: 669.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to get my head around. Well, I guess I could liken it to a Hannes Wagner baseball card,  which is on the face of it a piece of cardboard that's worth absolutely nothing, except it isn't.  It's worth $3 million because there's only nine of them. I would bet you most of the people who  have Hannes Wagner cards really weren't Pittsburgh Pirates fans in the 20s. That wasn't what got them  to buy that card. They bought that card because they presumed it would go up in value. It's

Start time: 670.74
End time: 679.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  speculation. Is this the Beanie Babies of our generation? Yes, exactly. By the way, if anybody

Start time: 679.66
End time: 705.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  wants to buy my daughter's Beanie Babies, I have a large collection. Unfortunately, I'd bring them home  and I'd say, don't open that. It's worth money. She'd open it, play with it. That's you've destroyed it.  Take photos of them and turn them into NFTs. Have you had occasion to explain, Nicholas,  to friends and family members what the hell's going on here? What words do you use?

Start time: 707.22
End time: 753.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Well, no, I have pitched this story to CR. It is a little obscure. Well, it was until this past week.  Not obscure. $69 million. No, I hear you. It's worth more than a hundred.  I started pitching this NFT stuff maybe about a month ago because I am fascinated by all this  cryptocurrency stuff. I guess my take is when people ask friends, families, I don't get it.  Why would you pay 69 million for a JPEG? It's like, that's fine. Sure. But I'm not big into,  but I'm inside the NBA Top Shop Discord all day. And there are thousands of people in there.  Have you purchased any NBA highlights? Yes. I have $10 worth. I haven't even opened the  pack yet, to be honest. What do you get? I'm really curious. They've spent, by the way,

Start time: 753.18
End time: 758.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they've sold $200 million worth of NBA highlights. This is the NBA. Does some of that money go to

Start time: 759.00
End time: 819.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the players in the highlight? I have no idea, to be honest. I don't know the...  $200 million! But I liken it to digital trading cards. It's no different than if I were to play  Magic the Gathering or Hearthstone for World of Warcraft. It's like, oh, I get this card.  I think it almost might also be an age thing too, where it's like to a kid, having an NBA  highlight on his phone that he could show his friends and that he could say, oh, I own this.  Whatever that means, it doesn't actually really matter. His friends are impressed by it. He feels  cool that he owns it, quote unquote. Which highlight did you buy? I'm curious, Nicholas.  I didn't even open the packet, to be honest. You don't even know what you got!  I hope it's a good one, I guess. But yeah, if kids are into it, if they think it's neat,  it's like, why do I have to outsmart that kid? He's having fun. That's fine. That seems okay to me.  That's how I try to explain it to people. It's like, it is very weird. It's kind of odd. $69  million. Maybe there's some greater scheme behind it as you just pointed out.

Start time: 819.92
End time: 823.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is a scheme, actually. In this case, there is, absolutely.

Start time: 823.96
End time: 844.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this sort of goes back to, there was CryptoKitties in 2017.  Yeah, it's just like CryptoKitties. CryptoKitties is still around, by the way.  It's all very interesting. What's very interesting to me about all this, it's happening now. This is  literally happening in real time. I can go into the NBA Top Shop Discord and see this unfurling

Start time: 844.74
End time: 864.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  before my eyes. So what in there do they say? Like, anybody want a, I don't know, what?  It's everything. Michael Jordan, nothing but net,  three pointer. Anybody want that? I got it from the 1967, whatever. So is that kind of stuff? Is  that the kind of dialogue? It's that type of stuff. There's technical complaints, people saying,

Start time: 864.60
End time: 887.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  why does it take so long for it to come? People complaining about bots.  When it comes, what comes? Does something come in the mail?  You go to the website and you go to the little section of the website and then you get like a  digital card pack. Like you said a second ago, you're buying like trading cards. It's kind of  virtual trading cards. Oh, so you were able to buy at Site Unseen. You don't know what you got.  Oh, I have no idea. I'm going to open the pack. Is this a limited edition?

Start time: 887.78
End time: 890.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you own it? Yeah, no one else can have that.

Start time: 891.08
End time: 922.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, you have an exclusive access to this. This is where it does get sort of interesting. It's  like I don't own the NBA owns this. This is the NBA is like intellectual property. I think at  most you can say is that I have a license to say that this particular instance of this LeBron James  play belongs to me. If is that worth, you know, $1,000 to you to you to me, I don't know, but to  the guy who bought it, I guess it is because he paid $1,000 for it. But belongs is an interesting

Start time: 922.52
End time: 950.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  word. Right. Yeah. So for instance, here's a perfect replication of a harness Wagner  $3 million worth baseball card. I could print this out, put it on a piece of cardboard. I'd have it.  It's not worth $3 million because it's not real. So one of the things that happens with NFTs is  there is authentication. You can say with authority, this is signed by the NBA. I

Start time: 951.73
End time: 990.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  own whatever this is that I own. Right. It's kind of, it's sort of likened to like a digital  autograph where you could say, okay, this, you know, yeah, of course you could just take a  screenshot and share it, you know, put it on Twitter, who cares, or whatever the case may be.  But this has been kind of authenticated. This has been blessed by this is, this is digitally  signed or autographed. It's imbued with, with, with like special characteristics that people  get a kick out of. And that's kind of where we are. And people are trying to wrap their heads  around like, I don't understand why would you even care? It's a valid question, but people do. And  I don't know. It's kind of neat, I guess. I love the word imbued. It's like, yeah. And,

Start time: 991.08
End time: 1003.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and that boot was imbued with magic by Harry Potter. It's just, you know, it's like that.  Yes. Imbued in that sense. Well, you know, I'm honored to know that you, you would spend $5 on

Start time: 1005.14
End time: 1015.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  NBA Top Shot. I think it was $10. Well, all right, let's be fair. And I haven't even, I hope they're,  I hope they're good. I'm a very casual NBA fan at best, so we'll see. If you get, if you get Steph

Start time: 1015.66
End time: 1020.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Curry three pointer, I'll buy it for $20. You've doubled your money. I'll consider that. There's a

Start time: 1020.98
End time: 1063.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  marketplace. So maybe you'll have to bid with other, maybe, maybe there's a scramble for that.  If you were smart, if you were smart. That's kind of the other part of the appeal of it is like,  you know, you do you own it? Who do you know, that's a little hazy, but you do have the right  to kind of flip it where it's like, okay, I've got this LeBron James or Steph Curry play. I'll put it  on the NBA Top Shot marketplace and someone else can buy it. You know, if I paid, let's say $100  for it and this person wants to pay $500 for it. Well, now I've just made $400. So there is that  kind of speculative, get rich quick. And it does feel very, very young. It does feel like a lot of  kids are into this, where there's kind of that, that like flipping culture or, you know,

Start time: 1063.34
End time: 1067.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they were the people who bought GameStop two months ago. Oh yes. It feels like there's a lot

Start time: 1067.68
End time: 1084.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of overlap between that type of person who, you know, get rich quick. This is kind of fun,  weird internet stuff, which is probably why you struggle to see kind of like mainstream outlets  explain what this is because this is like weird internet culture, young people doing stuff that

Start time: 1084.20
End time: 1099.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  we don't quite understand. You just don't get it, man. You're too old to get it, man.  Jason, does this remind you of ICOs and other kind of blockchain related  things? I mean, ICOs kind of got in trouble. Remember initial coin offerings?

Start time: 1099.92
End time: 1359.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep. I think it has more legs than ICOs. I think that in this case,  this is trying to solve a problem. So the web as we know it was not built for privacy, was not built  for exclusivity. Like when we look at a web page, when we look at an image or a video,  we're not looking at the original, right? It's always copies. We're downloading,  constantly downloading copies. That's how the web was architected. And so that has a number of  challenges around transferring value. So that's why blockchain came along and Bitcoin.  And this is a similar phenomenon because you in the real world, if you have, someone owns the  Mona Lisa, the Louvre in France owns the Mona Lisa. There are copies of the Mona Lisa everywhere,  right? You can buy them very cheaply, but there is only one and it exists there. You have to go  there to see it. People go and pay a lot of money to go all the way to France and then to go to the  Louvre and they want to see that one, even though it looks just like, as a matter of fact, the ones  that you've seen a thousand other places, right? Why is that? Because we place, because people  place a certain value on the one of a kindness of it. And this is the same, this is the digital  version of that one of a kindness using cryptography, using blockchain technology to  create this one of a kindness around digital assets. And so just as you said, there's certain  types of valuable than non-fungible. Fungible is a word we don't use very often, but fungible  just means like transferable, right? So a fungible asset is like my $20 bill and your $20 bill,  Leo, they're worth the same. We could switch them and the value is exactly the same, but  that's a fungible asset. A non-fungible asset is one where I have a beanie baby and you have the  beanie babies and mine's worth five bucks and yours is worth 500 bucks or my baseball card's  worth 20 cents and the one you've got the Honest Wagner, which is worth millions. And so  the value of these things is like anything that they don't really have any intrinsic value other  than in some sense supply and demand, but then also just how much people value them and the value of  those things changes over time. So I think it's just a big way of saying we're going to see lots  of this. And I think we're at the very beginning and it is going to be super interesting to watch.  There's going to be people that make money. There's going to be people lose a lot of money.  One of the other things that we haven't talked about that's kind of interesting is  the idea of selling digital real estate. And so if you remember, I'm sure everybody on this  call remembers Second Life, right? There was like, oh yeah, remember Second Life. Well, now there  are other versions of that where like Earth 2, so earth2.io, one of my colleagues has told me about  this week where you can go and literally buy property in earth 2. And the interesting thing is  even people are buying all kinds of things on there. And it's even just in the past few months,  the base value is double. That used to be $25 per kind of block. Like to buy my house and my yard  is like four blocks. So now it's $50 per block. So it would cost me 200 bucks to buy my house,  essentially, in earth 2. And anybody can go on there and do it. And people are already buying  stadiums and famous landmarks and all this. I was like, well, you know what? I'll go in there  and I'll buy the shopping center. There's like this one really nice shopping center,  shopping area here in Louisville where I am. And I was like, well, I'll get that because that  could actually, if this ends up taking off, it can be worth value. It would be like 30 grand for me  to buy. It's like Monopoly. It's like Monopoly. Boardwalk in Park Place, right? It's right. So  it's really interesting to look at this phenomenon. Is it your shopping center?

Start time: 1360.92
End time: 1390.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. And your shopping center. It really does. What it does is makes you think about,  well, what do these words mean? Belong and ownership and tangible versus intangible,  fungible versus not. What do these words mean? And why do we ascribe value to some things and  others? Larry, I think our generation looks at this and says, no, I don't want to even think  about it. This is you crazy kids because it's nuts. If you talk about it, I have a record

Start time: 1390.66
End time: 1421.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  collection. I used to buy records. Now I didn't own the copyright to the Rubber Cholal. But you  owned the vinyl. I owned the vinyl. Now, I mean, I can't remember the last time I paid money. I  just pay my $10 a month to Spotify and get all my music. But does that devalue the music? Because  you don't have to go out. It certainly devalues it in my mind in a sense. I remember when it was a  lot of money at the time. I would save up my money as a kid. Music has become fungible.  Ironically. The other thing is, you think about diamonds. Why are diamonds so expensive?

Start time: 1422.24
End time: 1451.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's made up. It's completely made up. There is an industrial value to diamonds. But it turns out,  synthetic diamonds are just as, in fact, maybe even more so industrially.  Siri said that's what I figured. Okay, Siri. I don't know. Siri has an opinion on this,  apparently. But yeah, that's in fact, of course, as we know, the beers worked very hard to create  artificial scarcity, so the diamonds would be worth something. I have artwork. I have some

Transcript:  signed prints, one of 20, one of 100. You have to trust that the artist doesn't actually run off  more. Who would know? There's always been a market in that. It is tempting for a certain generation,

Start time: 1469.66
End time: 1498.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and I'll put Larry and me in that generation, to say, oh, this is just those crazy digital kids.  Yeah. This has nothing to do with a real work and a dollar's pay for a dollar's work and all that.  Get off my virtual world. Get off my virtual world. And yet,  frankly, money has always been this way. Money's made up. A dollar bill has no intrinsic value.  It's only because we say it does. That to me is also what's, sorry to cut you off. It's also

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that it's connected to blockchain and all these cryptocurrencies. We've had, Bitcoin has been  around roughly for 10 years in mainstream news coverage. Why is that worth anything? Why? Well,  because people have decided that it's worth something. And if you try to have a conversation  with someone who refuses to meet you halfway and be like, well, I don't get it. This is weird. It's  like, okay, that's fine. But some number of people have decided that Bitcoin is worth roughly $60,000

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  today. That's what's amazing. It's gone up. In fact, I laughed when Elon Musk's Tesla bought  $1.5 billion in Bitcoin. They made a billion dollars on that investment already. If they sold  today, the question is, is it going up more or is it going to plummet? And no one knows because it's

Transcript:  I think that's actually what's going on is that a lot of this money that's floating around for  NFTs is Bitcoin billionaires. There are many who made a lot of money on Bitcoin out of pure luck.  I mean, really. And they need something else to invest in. And so they're buying NFTs.  I just feel like the bubble will burst at some point, but maybe not.

Currently, $2.5 million  dollars is the bid. And there's a little edge. You can see there's a bidding war. The second highest  bid is kind of interesting. Justin Suntron, he is the creator of the Tron Bitcoin currency. He was  also bidding for Beeple's $60 million painting. And in fact, Justin Sun was pissed off. He said,  bid with 30 seconds left, I upped my bid to $70 million. But Christie's didn't accept it,  even though there was 20 seconds left. So he thinks he should have won. He might look back on  this and say, but he could still get in on the, I imagine this Jack Dorsey tweet, which will continue,  the auction will continue, I think through the 21st.

Although you probably shouldn't because every time you do, you're, you're reducing the value.  Really what you should do is put it in a safe and then wait till somebody offers you more.

Is there a way you could lose this? I mean, what if, what if these machine, you know,  if we have an energy crisis and we can no longer continue to invest this energy  into Bitcoin and in a current, does it go away? I mean, there are some risks we can lose it.

Transcript:  Well, there's no tangible Bitcoin. All there is, is the blockchain. Now,  NFTs are done in Ethereum, so it is somewhat different from Bitcoin, but Bitcoin, when you  have a Bitcoin wallet, the first thing you do is you download the blockchain, which at this point  is well over a hundred gigabytes worth of data. And the blockchain contains every transaction from  the moment Satoshi Nakamoto launched this thing to the moment you open the wallet.  That's every transaction, including all the transactions you've made, but all the transactions  everyone's made. So every single person who has a Bitcoin wallet has a copy of that blockchain.  You can prune it. There's, I mean, there's exceptions to that, but, but in effect,  that blockchain is, that's the whole point. It's, it is a ledger of transactions that has no  center. It's not centralized, not kept by a bank. It's not kept by a federal reserve. It's kept by  everybody who engages, who uses this. And so as a result, I think they would argue it's more safe  than if you had a, a gold in the safe deposit vault. Yeah. So my copy is,

Transcript:  The security and the cryptography is really the trust, right? So this is decentralized trust,  a lot of trust, the trust in the U S dollar is essentially trust in the U S government and that,  that the U S government will not fail. And that if something, if there is some kind of  crash or something that the U S government is backing the dollar, right, that trust is  in institutions today. Same thing with banks. Banks are stores of trust more than they are  stores of value. There's, you, you put money and value there because you trust they will be there  and that if you put it there, you'd be able to get it back. And it's the, it's the same way.  That's the intrinsic value of Bitcoin is that it is the most secure of these cryptocurrencies or,  you know, that it is going to be there if you place value in it. And, and obviously the, the  thing that is a question is that value has been really volatile, right? It fluctuates greatly.  And that will eventually even out likely as there are more larger institutions that put more  in it. But it's really a trust game and, and decentralizing trust. You know, Bitcoin came out  after the bank bailouts of 2009 and the, the sort of the failures that happened in the system. And  it is trying to address that. But I do want to address one other thing is like this power issue  because I feel like this is the media re brings this up, this issue up again and again, without  very much context at all. I feel like this is a lot of FUD being driven by probably banking industry  people because the banks use way more power than what Bitcoin does. And the banks are using dirty  power in most cases. And a lot of these Bitcoin things are run off of much cleaner forms of energy  and they use far less energy than these dirty energy that all these bank data centers are run  off of. And even if, you know, I think there's some accounts out there that even if Bitcoin itself  were to mature by more than a hundred times its current size, it still would only equal 2% of all  energy consumption. Right? So this, there's a lot of a sort of false narrative out there about this  power issue. And I feel like it's getting propagated. I don't know this, but I do feel like a lot of it  gets propagated by the people who have a lot to lose because there's a lot of, there are a lot of  institutions that have a lot to lose if Bitcoin starts to replace fiat currency over the next  five to 10 years, which it is likely to do. Fiat currencies as well as gold as a store of value.

The state of Massachusetts has no record of it, unfortunately. Oh dear. But that's  the bad news. But the good news is that it is written down in black and white. I love it that  you have your bank book still, your savings book. I still have it. They don't do that anymore,  do they? Oh God, no. No, what I do do, and this call me paranoid. So here's my folder of all my  savings. So I can use that. Where's that savings account? Can't see it. Anyway, because I do worry  that one day I'm going to log into my checking account or my investment account and that money  that I know is there for whatever reason won't show up.

Transcript:  oldsters don't want to think about this because the truth is that money isn't there. Of course.  There's no money anywhere. That's bits. There's a record of it. There's a record of it is all that  exists. And it's a record that is probably less reliable than blockchain. Your bank book's proof  of that. That bank book has a record that you have $500. Good luck finding it. If it were on  the blockchain, at least you'd be able to claim it. So I think that one of the problems with this  is it raises issues that make people not want to, I mean, I do think there's an energy issue.  I agree with you, Jason. It could be that it's cleaner energy. There's a very good article by  Everest Pipkin on Medium where he claims that Ethereum, which has always supposedly been moving  to the more ecologically friendly proof of stake, hasn't yet, never will. It's kind of one of those  someday things, but it uses, I think, 24 terawatts of power a year. University of New Mexico study  estimated about 50 cents in ecological damage for every dollar of Bitcoin generated. That's half.  So I think that you could say that there is a consequence to this. Maybe it isn't a problem,  but it's got to be something to be thought about. And it is-  But I think it's the same- I'm sorry, Leo.  You're right. The banks are also dirty. I agree. I agree. I mean-

They get used maybe one-tenth or one-twentieth  of the time. They just sit there for most of the time. There's no good economic justification for  that. So I think you're right, Jason, in the sense that all this crypto stuff is just new. And so,  oh gosh, it's economically devastating. But the familiar, ecologically devastating stuff  that we do every single day, we go, well, that's life. That's normal.

It's real to  them, but they refuse to accept that the reason why that's real is because a certain quorum of  people have decided that it is real and we use it and we run with it. But why can't we decide that  Bitcoin is worth something or Ethereum or bunny coins or whatever the heck it is? Or NBA top  shot highlights. Yeah.

As I said, I don't think people of my age or Larry's age really want to  think about the fact that we're hoping to retire on something that is really just bits poorly kept  in some bank's ledger. I think that's why there was for a long time, let's get back to the gold  standard as if somehow tying the dollar to gold would somehow make it real, make it tangible,  make it something. It's not, it's just another thing. The industrial value of gold is nowhere

Transcript:  near the $3,500. So if you know, Leo, I bought a Tesla a couple of years ago and the Tesla is worth,  according to now Kelly Blue Book, I spent about $64, it's worth about $36 now. But $10,000 of that  value is software, is the autopilot, the full self-driving software, which has actually no  value because Tesla can recreate it anytime they want. And so the idea that a third of the value  of my car is something completely intangible. Yeah. Basically, you bought a golf cart that had the

Start time: 2506.12
End time: 2511.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 2512.08
End time: 2551.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  bit of speculation too, Larry, and maybe some wise ones because by some of the analysts'  estimates, Tesla has somewhere between, depending on who you believe, that 30% to 45% chance of  getting this self-driving piece right. They're literally five years ahead of everybody else  because they have so much data because they've had the feature out there longer and all the  users are beta testers. But if they do get that right, then that value of that $10,000 that you  put in that is probably worth closer to like 50 grand. Unless Musk decides to lower the cost,

Transcript:  Love it. Great to have all three of you. Our show today brought to you by Forward Networks. This is a  really cool technology. I got a little demo of it created by four Stanford PhD students. They said,  we developed an empathy for the network operator. We felt so bad because running a network is a  little bit of voodoo. It's a little bit of science, but the problem is there's a lot of mystery.  When you run a network, there's stuff. That's why they draw the cloud as a puffy little cloud that  stuff goes in and happens and then comes out. They wanted to reduce business risk by revolutionizing  the way large networks are managed. Seven years ago, they founded Forward Networks, part of their  work at Stanford, to apply principles of modern software to the network. So this software,  Forward Networks does, delivers a digital twin of your network, completely accurate mathematical  model in software. They have tools that go out and crawl the network, find every device. A couple of  years ago, NASA had a problem because one of the engineers brought a Raspberry Pi in and put it on  the network and they couldn't figure out what was causing these issues. Well, if you had Forward  Networks, you would see that Raspberry Pi immediately would be added to this digital twin  and you would know. Here's what you can do with this. You can verify that your network is configured  to spec, that it's in compliance with policies, that it's behaving as intended. Even more important  these days, before you make a change to the network, you can actually simulate it and predict the  impact of that change across every possible traffic path. How many times have we heard stories about  a network operator changing their BGP router tables and accidentally routing all internet  traffic to a small town in Maine? It happens, not with Forward Networks. Dashboard gives you key  network insights. With visualizations, if you're watching the video, you're seeing them, they're  easily consumable. They can be exported. You actually love it because you can show the board  and your CEO what's going on in a way that everybody can get. But it's an always accurate  network diagram with all the details about the topology of your environment. If you're an  assist admin, if you run a network, I know you want this. It's got a search. You can search network  behavior, configuration and state network-wide. It's got an intuitive and powerful search tool.  You can perform end-to-end path analysis across your network on both on-prem and cloud infrastructure.  You can proactively identify potential connectivity and security policy violations. This goes all the  way to the endpoints. From your servers to the endpoints, they have this thing. If you're a  geek, you know about diffs where you take two text files, you run a diff and you know what the  differences are. You can see how the edits are made. Forward Networks gives you behavioral diffs,  side-by-side comparison in one quick view of what your network looks like now and what it's going  to look like after you change these configuration files. Between any points in time, you'll get 50%  faster resolution of network trouble tickets because you're not in mystery anymore. You'll get  90% faster fixes related to audit processes, 33% reduction in aborted network updates due to  identified errors. Turn it off! Turn it off! Oh my God! Oh my God! Imagine searching your network  for what's causing the problems and even better predicting the problem before it happens.  That's Forward Networks. Used by some of the biggest companies in the world. Telstra uses it  in Australia, Bank of America, Verizon uses it, Goldman Sachs uses it. In fact, they loved it so  much they led their series C funding round. Mark Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz, big fan. He  was also in on the funding round as was Threshold. $65 million round, a very successful round. I love  the story about PayPal. They were, I mean this is it, that's a massive network. They were having  troubles with their network. They thought about maybe we should build something. They really  thought conceptualize something like Forward Networks. But when they found it, they said,  huh, this is better than what we were going to do. They found all the trouble spots that saved them  time and money. You need this thing. Get network automation and verification for your intent-based  network with Forward Networks. Your business depends on it. There's an amazing demo. You've  been seeing some of it if you're watching the video at forwardnetworks.com slash twit. You're  going to play with this thing. And if you're not the decision maker in your business, just take your  boss to forwardnetworks.com slash twit. Say, I got to show you this. They've got a new podcast  to you.

This is research  that turned into something every network operator has to have. It's pretty amazing.  Thank you, Forward Networks, for supporting twit. Apple has announced that the HomePod is gone.  This is kind of, okay, I was skeptical five years ago when they announced the big $400 HomePod.  Matthew Panzerino, they take him in. We've got 50 anechoic chambers we built just to design this  thing. We brought the best sound engineers in the world. This is the best speaker you can get for  this size. They sold it like crazy. And just like, I remember Steve Jobs coming on stage.  Remember they sold the iPod Hi-Fi thing? And Steve Jobs said, I'm getting rid of all my high-end  audio equipment. This sounds so good. They canceled that within a year, by the way. I hope Steve Jobs  got his stereo back. I don't know. People liked the sound. To me, it wasn't even as good as the  Google Home Max, which sold for about the same price. Now Apple's done so well with the mini  version of this, the $100 version of this. They're just discontinuing it. Should we mourn the end of  the HomePod? No. Did you review this at all, Nicholas, for CU?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did not, but we did. And I think our assessment was similar to yours, where we thought the Google  Home Max sounded better. I remember that. Yes. Yeah, I don't know. I personally bought the mini  for my father. He seems to like it. He's a big Apple guy. He's got an iPad. He's got Apple Music.  He loves his Siri. He's always asking funny little Siri stuff. If you like Siri, it's nice to have  Siri in the house. He seems to like it. I know these little speakers. I personally own the Sonos  One. I think it sounds fine. I guess I'm not the most critical listener. It's funny. I saw a joke  on Twitter a couple of weeks ago that sound quality actually peaked in the 80s with the CD,  and now we're listening to compressed Spotify streams. We don't care anymore. It's true.

Start time: 3207.96
End time: 3218.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We don't care. And for most people who grew up listening to those little white headphones coming  out of the iPod to highly compress lossy music, the minis probably sound just as good as the HomePod.

Start time: 3220.58
End time: 3239.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One reason I don't mourn the loss of the HomePod is that I have a little Echo  Dot or something that I bought for practically nothing. 50 bucks or 30 bucks.  It's hooked up to a very nice speaker system. They've got ways to hook them up to nice speakers,  so you don't have to buy a high-end smart speaker. You can buy a dumb one and hook it up to

End time: 3272.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  whatever you want to. I feel like Apple's hype machine overhyped the HomePod. They would have  saved themselves a lot of time and trouble if they only built half as many echoing chambers,  and they didn't sell a $350 speaker because people are happy with a $100 speaker. I have five minis.  I have two HomePods. I'm an idiot. I also have a lot of Sonos gear, including that Sonos one.  I would say that the Google Home Max, which I also have, that big speaker, they discontinued  as well. I think nobody's buying $400 or $300 speakers is the real problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  hook all that stuff up into that. There's also some really good sound bars too. I think the  death of this thing might be ... We've seen it reviews a lot of these and has some good  lists as well as reviews of some of them. Sonos has some great ones. Sonos has some really nice  sound bars. If you want to do high-end audio like this, you're better off just getting a sound bar,  connecting it to your TV, and then you can also use it for this kind of high-end audio too.  It's a product without a market or the market has gotten squeezed out because you're either  going low-end for $100 or less with a little puck, or if you're going to go with really  better quality higher-end audio, you're probably just going to go with a sound bar. There are  great ones out there for great prices too. The Vizio sound bar starts at under $100.

To me, if you have iOS devices, AirPlay too is  great and having an AirPlay 2 device you can play to is very nice, but I guess they dropped the price  to $250. I think Apple misunderstood the market. If you're a high-end audiophile, you're not going  to buy a $300 speaker, and if you're not a high-end audiophile, you're not going to buy a $300 speaker.

Start time: 3395.00
End time: 3432.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So who's going to buy this thing? Nobody. The market kind of changed out from under them. It  went in two different directions. Lower cost for the pucks and then the people are doing really  well selling these sound bars. That was one of the top selling items during the pandemic was people  were like, oh, I can hook up a sound bar to my system, keep the TV I've got, and get really  actually a much nicer experience. That replaced, I think, a lot of what people that would have  bought some of these HomePod, the high-end HomePod or the Google as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The portal. Yeah. So they're going in that direction. I mean, most users still are just like  what Larry mentioned. Those pucks, they're much more interested in that. It's much more practical.  You can put them wherever you want them. As you said, Leo, you can put them in different rooms.  You can get five of them. The price is still pretty minimal relatively. That makes a lot more  sense. But the software behind them has plateaued a bit. Certainly, that's where more work needs to  be done. The hardware part has largely been solved or at least it's not rapidly developing  all of that much. But the software has a lot of work to be done.

Transcript:  Which is probably why this software is not evolving.  I found, I'd never seen this before,  apparently Amazon put this online a couple of weeks ago.  These day one additions, the idea is it's kind of like an Indiegogo for Echo devices.  So Amazon is saying here's three different concepts.  All have Echo built in. One is a cuckoo clock.  Really? One is a smart scale, which looks like a regular kitchen scale.  I guess though you can ask Echo for nutrition info.  I actually pre-ordered this one, the smart sticky note printer, because I'm an idiot.  Really?  Because I'm an idiot and I buy this crap. 88 bucks.  But what it does is it doesn't have Echo in it, but you pair it to an Echo device.  I have a clock paired to an Echo device as well.  And then so you can say Echo print my shopping list or Echo.  And then you get a post-it note.

The cuckoo clock is still, still they got to work a little more work together,  about halfway to their goal.  This is actually smart. Amazon's getting all this consumer information, aren't they?  Yeah, clever.  $80 for the cuckoo clock. The smart scale is a little cheaper. 35 bucks.

So he's given me a list.  These are pre-show clips from 2008. Me and Paul Therot pre-show Windows Weekly.  Me and Megan Maroney pre-show jumping monkeys. A live stream we did on building the ultimate  game machine with Colleen Henry and Ryan shroud security. Now pre-show. This is, these are all  from 2008 from August, 2008 and the daily gives fizz from 2008. It's on here. So these are now,  those are the originals. I just blessed them.  So then what do I do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have the wallet.dat file. And then, and then we put up a QR code with the, with the account  on the website as part of our tip jar. Cause for a while we were, I think we still have a tip jar.  I just, no one knows where it is. And people were, and people gave me a 10th of a Bitcoin  or whatever. And it ended up being 7.85 Bitcoin. I know, cause I can see the wallet  and I know how much is in it. I know all the transactions, but I just can't unlock it.  So what is that worth? That's $480,000 right now.

End time: 4659.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Will you ever be able to recover that value?  Yeah. My feeling is if I had been able to unlock it at any time in the last five years,  I would have sold it. When Bitcoin was a hundred bucks, I would have sold it.  So all I've done is gain value. I figure not being able to sell it is the best thing that

Start time: 4660.24

Start time: 4666.84
End time: 4687.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't access it. So, so I'm figuring here's what, here's my plan.  This is my long, long range plan. Someday quantum computers are going to happen  and there'll be a computer fast enough to crack this wallet.  To crack that password.  By then, yeah, by then it'll be worth millions.  You're right.  Maybe worth a hundred million.

Start time: 4688.96
End time: 4697.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Bitcoin is designed to go to a million a coin, right? Cause it, cause a million,  it's designed to be at that level of scale.

Start time: 4697.72
End time: 4724.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, there's no limit to what it could be. I don't know.  Right.  I mean, cause it can, because you can do fractional coins at any infinitesimal  fraction. And if it's worth a million, you can, you can give somebody a millions of a  Bitcoin. Absolutely. You can do it right now. So yeah. Yeah.  Meanwhile, I'm waiting to see what the IRS says. Is this income?  It's long-term capital gains. What the hell is it?

Start time: 4725.55

Start time: 4728.86
End time: 4773.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are startups out there trying to help folks figure out their Bitcoin tax situation.  Because my sense, you know, same thing with, with all the GameStop stuff, you know, a lot  of folks who are not experienced traders or have not really dealt with, with this stuff  are just selling it and not setting aside taxes. So I do wonder, that was actually a story idea.  I wanted to do for CR, you know, what are your tax liabilities? If you've sold Bitcoin,  if you've translated it into some other coin, I just don't think people know that that is,  that is the case. Yeah. And all these exchanges, whether it's Gemini, whether it's Coinbase,  all the, you know, the U S regulated ones, they will send you the tax forms come tax time.  And they say, Hey, there you go. You know, here's the info, you know, you owe what you owe,  you know, good luck. I don't know if folks are thinking about that.

Start time: 4773.20
End time: 4789.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't even know how the IRS audits it. I mean, it's not like this is secret.  If the IRS has your wallet, your account number, they know what you've got.  The only thing keeping it private is the fact that your account number is not widely disseminated,  although mine was because we put it on the tip chart. And so there's a QR code.

Start time: 4789.76
End time: 4807.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know I just did my taxes literally last week and they do ask you, you know, do you own  cryptocurrencies? And my understanding is that, you know, they just want you to say yes or no.  It's not like they're going to come after you and like look into Nicholas's daily owns. You know,  it's not like I'm a millionaire. If they ever audited you, they might, right?

End time: 4828.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you do anything that is a taxable event, like if you just have Bitcoin in there and it's just  sitting there, accruing value or losing value as the case may be, you know, there's no taxable  event there, but the minute you sell it, boom, there you go. Now you better 1099. So.

Start time: 4830.08
End time: 4848.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. Yeah.  This is all fascinating. And it's, you know, I just honestly,  I've come up with a rationalization for why I can't get to the half million dollars I have in a  Bitcoin wallet. And I'm going to leave it at that. I'm just waiting till it's worth 10 million and  then I'll crack it, right? I'll buy myself. The best thing that ever happened to you.

Start time: 4848.40

End time: 4881.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Because I wouldn't have.  No, you're exactly right. Now, Steve Gibson is a little bit of a different story. He, when Bitcoin  first started, he created a Bitcoin miner because he was curious. And the next morning he gets up,  there's 50 Bitcoin kind of chunk came out of the miner. He has erased the hard drive. He's lost it  forever. He can't recover it. So there's no, for him, there's no, he just doesn't want to even think  about it. That's $4 million or something. What is it now? 2.4 million.

You may have been a  gamer. You may have been mining. I wonder how many people out there in radio land have lost a password,  have a hard drive, have crashed or something, or who have been smart and have held onto it and now  are sitting on a beach in Hawaii or something. But I bet your audience has some pretty interesting

Our show today brought  to you by Podium. Do you know about Podium? Podium is so cool. You might've even used Podium and not  know it. You go to the dentist or you go to the local bagel store and as you're leaving, you get  a text message saying, thanks for visiting. Leave us a review. That's probably Podium. Podium gives  your business, especially small businesses, local businesses, the messaging tools to turn your website  into a thriving storefront. It is so cool, especially nowadays where, you know, you're not  going into a restaurant. You're going to and take out your, you're not, you know, if you visit the  dentist, it's a quick visit. You run and come and go. But with Podium, those local places can close  the deal. They can make it easy to get paid contact free via SMS, via text messages. With  Podium reviews, you can easily text customers to leave an online review, improving search ratings.  And you know what's interesting about text messages? Unlike email, about 20% of emails get open. So if  you're using email to do this, you're, you know, only get into one in five. 98% of text messages get  opened. 98%. And the thing is, if you send somebody a coupon or you send them an invitation to come  back, they're going to see that and they're going to welcome your text messages. Podium also offers  web chat. You can put that on your website so visitors can text with your team and your team  will like it because those text messages on the website turn into text messages on their phone,  makes it easy for them to respond to it. You can meet with customers using Podium's video chat  anywhere, anytime, get paid faster over text with Podium payments.

It's a great way for small businesses to stay connected with their  customers safely without the face-to-face. Podium is everything you need. And look at some of the  people who use Podium. I mentioned dentistry. My local dentist uses it, but so does the South  Tampa Family and Cosmetic Dentistry. They did exactly what my dentist did as customers are leaving.  They asked, oh, don't forget to review us. They collected 1,200 reviews, averaging 4.9 stars.  Dr. Wyatt there said the number of walk-ins as a result of our reviews has skyrocketed.  Before, we might be seeing maybe 50 to 100 new patients a month. Now we're seeing closer to  200. The Bridal Collection uses Podium. Small store. Lynn, the owner, said we don't have to  take credit cards into the store. We could do it completely remotely. Podium has been a godsend  for us in this journey. They've processed over $200,000 in no-contact payments. It's amazing.  America's CarMart used Podium to collect 21,000 leads through their web chat.  TJ, who's in charge of the digital experience at America's CarMart, said before Podium,  we had a contact us form. Remember those little animated mailbox? It could have been days before  anybody got back to that customer. Because it's text messages now, it's easy. Our response time  has cut down to two minutes. I hope I've convinced you.

Remember last week or two weeks ago on twit,  we talked about the fact that Google has announced they're no longer going to use  third party cookies starting next year, nor are they going to invest in ad tech or tracking  technologies. They know people don't want tracking. So what are they going to do instead? Well,  they've introduced something with probably the worst name ever. The federated learning of cohorts  or flock. The EFF says Google's flock is a terrible idea. No one should mourn the death of the cookie  they write as we know it. For more than two decades, third party cookie has been the linchpin  in a shadowy, seedy, multi-billion dollar advertising surveillance industry on the web.  As I mentioned before, my friend Cory Doctorow says ad blockers and cookie blockers is the  largest consumer boycott in history. So many people are using them now that they don't work  anymore. So no wonder people like Google are saying, well, we didn't like those in the first  place. Google's leading the charged EFF rights to replace third party cookies with a new suite of  technologies to target ads on the web. Notice they're not giving up ad targeting. Some of  their proposals show it hasn't learned the right lesson from the ongoing backlash to the surveillance  business model. It's a long article. I'm not going to summarize the whole thing, but  the idea behind flock is instead of individual information about you,  Google is going to create a cohort, a segment that you belong to and tell advertisers,  this is what Facebook does. Facebook never gave your information to advertisers. Just said,  we know men between the age of 25 and 54 who live in Northern California who spend more than $20,000  a year on lottery tickets. Would you like to advertise to them? That's the kind of information  you got from Facebook and that's what Google plans to do with flock. But there are some issues,  I think, with all of this. Do you credit Google, Larry, with doing the right thing or is this just  hand waving in the face of a big consumer boycott against cookies?

Start time: 5345.22
End time: 5372.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's doing what benefits Google and perhaps harms its lesser endowed competitors.  It may be a good thing anyway. I don't mourn the death of the cookie, but I think it is Google  figuring out a way to continue business as usual using a different strategy. At the end, they're  going to make plenty of money from it. You agree, Nicholas?

Start time: 5416.92
End time: 5428.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is something that's top of mind of our readers. Privacy and being online and having  the weird ad track you. We get questions all the time. What is happening? How do I stop this?  Some people don't care, to be fair.

Start time: 5429.32
End time: 5446.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to go out on a limb. I think most people don't care. In fact,  I keep wondering, what are we really worried about?  Wouldn't you prefer an ad for something that you're interested in than an ad for something  that's just wasting your energy? Because you never would want that anyway.

Start time: 5447.06
End time: 5499.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's interesting. When I was younger, I was way more militant about this type of thing,  to be honest. As I've gotten older, I just turned 35 to give you an idea.  My interests are I like tech stuff, I like video games, I like soccer.  Unless you're advertising something in those three buckets,  you're just wasting your money, to be honest. I'm not going to buy your thing.  Advertisers don't want to advertise to you.  And that saves me time and it saves them ad budget. So I guess the question is,  where does that line? Is it better that they know me specifically, my IP address?  Is it better that they go even further and try to fingerprint my machine? That's kind of weird.  Or do they just put me in a cohort or whatever they want to call it.  Here is a mid-30s guy who likes nerd junk. Let's show him some ads for GPUs or mice and keyboards.  That feels okay, I guess, to me.

Start time: 5500.94
End time: 5550.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I understand why people run ad blockers. There are a lot of other good reasons. Ads  take up a huge amount of bandwidth. They slow the page down ridiculously.  They can bring malware into your system. There are lots of good reasons to not want that kind  of advertising. But to me, especially this kind of cohort tracking, the kind that Facebook and Google do,  you know, the only risk as far as I'm concerned, I stopped using Instagram  because their ads were so damn good that I kept buying stuff. They were too good.  Instagram, of all of the platforms, seems to know best exactly what's going to get me to buy  something in the middle of the night when I'm doom scrolling every single time. So I got rid of  Instagram not because I don't love it, I love it, but because I was buying too much crap.  Costing you too much money.  It was costing me too much. It was too good.

Start time: 5552.68
End time: 5656.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they do get, I think the last time I looked, I think they get 3 to 4x the click  throughs on those ads.  Is it the best? Is it the most effective?  I believe it is, at least at scale. I believe it has the highest click rates.  You know, I work for, obviously, work for ad-supported media, but CNET, we do consider  ourselves consumer advocates, and as consumer advocates, we certainly welcome the end of  third-party cookies. They've overreached over the past decade especially. But the idea of cohorts,  to the points that you all have made, there is some good on the other side of that to the  Netflix, or sorry, to the Instagram example of it does let them target things to you better and  provide you useful stuff. The challenge is you may end up, you know, like Leo,  end up finding too many things to buy. That's a whole different issue. But all in all, I think  we have to assume that over time, that AI, deep learning, all of these things are going to get  better and the targeting is going to get really good and effective even without third-party  cookies. Because remember, you're still going to have first-party cookies, so those sites cooking  you for the stuff on their site, they're still going to track what you look at and do on their  site. They're going to know your IP address. They're going to have data on you. And so these  things are going to still get better over time. But what you're removing is the really egregious  stuff that these third-party tracking things were doing and some of these ads that were following

I don't want Cambridge Analytica to put political ads in my Facebook  feed because they've done sentiment analysis and have decided, you know, that's not good.  Although I guess it's another form of ad tracking. I feel like also, you know,  readers of Consumer Reports might use the word creepy, right? To describe this. And I think that  that's what people who don't like technology or don't understand what's going on with technology  always say, oh, that's creepy.

I won't mention the name here, but like a WhatsApp, which I know is encrypted,  but we're talking about this app. And then lo and behold, later that evening, I got an ad.  I think it was in YouTube, if I'm not mistaken. So it's like, I know that that's actually not  what's happening here, but like it's just- You know what I'm- There's all this doubt about like  what- It's so opaque and no one real- Unless you're deep in the weeds of ad tech every day,  it is very, very hard to understand. And one of the things I really appreciate about being  at Consumer Reports is really understanding and empathizing with folks. You know, people have lives,  they have kids, they have jobs, they have things to do. They don't spend all day, you know, on tech  Twitter or refreshing tech meme or whatever. They're living a life. And so if they don't really  understand how this ad stuff works, yeah, maybe they'll use words creepy, but it's just like opaque

I think he bought a Honda or something.  And he still gets ads like, after the purchase was finished, he's still getting ads for like Toyota  and Mazda. And he's like, this doesn't make any sense.

So in some ways it's good. I  mean, maybe it would be worse if they knew that you had bought the Honda. So track me better.  Bottom line, they are wasting your time and their money.

Judge Lucy Coe,  who's been involved because she's a federal judge in the Silicon District includes Silicon  Valley and Northern California District, yelled at Google saying, I can't believe incognito mode  doesn't hide anything from Google. She has approved a class action lawsuit from consumers  who complain that even when they turn off data collection in Chrome, other Google tools used by  websites end up amassing their personal information. Judge Coe wrote, the court  concludes Google did not notify users that Google engages in the alleged data collection  while the user is in private browsing mode. Private implies private. Google says, we strongly  dispute these claims and we will defend ourselves vigorously against them. Incognito mode in Chrome  gives you the choice to browse the internet without your activity being saved to your browser and  device. You're in effect being incognito from yourself. As we clearly state, each time you open  a new incognito tab, websites might be able to collect information about your browsing activity  during your session. I talk to people all the time. Like you, Nicholas, I also talk to the unwashed  masses, normal people, regular folks who listen to the radio show. I mean, they must have some  interest in technology. They wouldn't listen to a technology radio show. But they are always amazed  when I say, oh yeah, incognito mode doesn't hide anything from Google. It just hides it from your

Transcript:  Gibson for discovering the lays crisp subtitle Chrome extension. Our show today brought to you  by extra hop, the solar wind sunburst attack man. What a wake up call in a changing threat  landscape. And I'll even add now the exchange server zero days. Holy cow. Cyber attacks have  only become more advanced, harder to detect. And the problem, the problem, all these people who run  exchange servers are facing right now, or were hacked in the solar winds attack is, is there  somebody in my network? Were they able to use those attacks to live in my network? When cyber  criminals get past your defenses, businesses need a plan for detection and response. And I think we  all understand now that that old model of protection and prevention alone is no longer  enough. That's why you need extra hop and especially extra hop reveal X. It's the only  solution that shows not just where intruders are going, but where they've been intruders love to  cover their tracks with reveal X. They can't, you can investigate incidents and prevent them from  turning into full blown breaches with cyber attacks, make the news. First question I ask our,  our security team, in other words, our it guy, first question, security teams need to know.  First question you must be asking if you're running exchange server, have we been compromised?  That's why reveal X is so great. Get 90 days of record look back, complete network visibility  across the data center, the cloud, the device edge. So security teams can actually do an audit. They  can actually get real answers and they can get it fast because let's face it, response time is  critical. In a post compromised world, your greatest chance of stopping advanced threats  is with extra hops, network detection and response. Respond fast, you'll limit the damage.  Respond slow, sky's the limit. Learn more about how extra hops stops breaches 84% faster. They've  got a great interactive demo you can try at extrahop.com slash twit, extrahop.com slash  twit, something you absolutely need extrahop.com slash twit. We were talking about Google and their  court troubles, Microsoft piling on. I love the little snippy back and forth between  Google and Microsoft. Brad Smith testifying in front of Congress this week.  Let's see, let me see if I can find his, his quotes here.  I got too many, too many stories, too long of a list of things to talk about.  Remember Microsoft with this exchange and SolarWinds thing has really been under the gun.  So I don't have the exact quote but Brad Smith saying, yeah, Google has really been killing  journalism with its search results. It's about time journalists could come to Google and say,  hey, we want some money for link tax. He's talking about what happened in Australia  and apparently is encouraging the United States Congress to follow the same path.  Google's response to this is Microsoft's just trying to say, don't pay any attention to the  SolarWinds exchange hacks. You really ought to be going after Google.  It's really ugly. I got to say it's really ugly to see these guys attacking each other and they  both got, they've both got things to work on in their home. No need to go to Congress and say,  oh yeah, we need a link tax. That's just a bad idea. And I guess the real problem is I don't  trust Congress for a second to do the right thing. They're, you know, they're going to,  oh yeah, that's a good idea. In fact, they already are considering doing what they did in Australia  and Google will probably have to make a deal with, you know, big journalism organizations.  Now you all work for, well, Larry, less so, but Jason, you work for CNET and Nicholas,  you work for Consumer Reports. Do you feel like Google is, Jason, let me start with you,

Start time: 6408.68
End time: 6440.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  isn't it? So the thing is Google puts these snippets. So if Google does see, you know,  is a search index on CNET and, you know, they see the latest story on CNET, they'll put a little  snippet in there. CNET doesn't say this. Rupert Murdoch says it. His contention and other  published contention is, oh, they see this snippet, they don't need to go to the page.  But I think on the other hand, Google points out, look, without us driving traffic to your site,  no one even would know the article exists. We drive far more traffic than we pull away.

Start time: 6441.72
End time: 6502.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And the truth is most of the time you end up in one of those featured snippet boxes,  you're getting a ton of traffic from it. Okay. That's what I'm curious about. I mean,  you know, you know, yeah, that's right. So now you have to be kind of smart about it. Like you,  as you have to know that you're aiming this long tailed story long at something that is kind of  evergreen at one of these snippet boxes, you're going to put enough information in there that's  going to, you know, tease it in some cases, but it's still going to show that you've got more  context if they click through the link and they want more. Right. So you have to understand what  you're what you're doing there. But yeah, I and Google is it's look, it's a fair point to say that  Google is putting more and more of their thing and they want more and more of it on their page  because they have Facebook jealousy, right? Facebook has these long engagement times and Google has

Start time: 6502.82
End time: 6508.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 6509.12
End time: 6530.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  page or do they? I mean, that's what these things are all about. That's what all of these things  are about. That's why they have those little questions too, right? Where you type in, right?  And you can just unpack those questions of like, you know, what is an NFT? Is an NFT work worth as  much as Bitcoin? Whatever it's got those little questions, you hit those questions and it expands

End time: 6560.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But on the other hand, it's something I do write for the Mercury News and I write for Forbes and  I crave high listings on Google News. I mean, when those happen, that's money in the bank. I mean,  that can generate enormous traffic, which can translate into enormous ad revenue if that's how  you're monetizing. So I don't quite understand why it's such a big problem for publishers,  you know, when they benefit from it as well. The bigger problem that it creates is not that

Start time: 6560.60
End time: 6611.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they're stealing traffic. It that essentially Google used to be about that front page, right?  If you had your link on the front page of Google, pretty much any of those like, you know, 10 slots,  you did really well. Now it's being concentrated into a smaller Google white listed version  of the best results and it's more winner take all. So if you end up in one of those featured  snippets or you end up as one of the first two links or you end up in the news box, if it's a  news article, your traffic goes to the moon. If you're not in one of those sort of what we'll call  like the top three, in many cases the top one, then your traffic now, even on the first page of  Google is drastically reduced. And so Google is essentially-

Start time: 6611.86
End time: 6618.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They haven't taken away traffic from you. They just haven't given you any, right? I mean, have  they stolen your traffic or just failed to give you more traffic?

Start time: 6619.58
End time: 6649.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. I'm saying that's the more the risk to understand here is not that Google's stealing  your traffic. It's just that it's making, you know, a much more winner take all game, right?  That's the thing to worry about. But if you end up in one of those, like I said, if you're featured,  you end up in those featured snippets, even though they're technically like taking your  text and putting it on their page, you still get so much traffic out of it, which is I know  what you're getting to Larry as well, that it's more than worth it to end up in one of those.

Start time: 6650.98
End time: 6659.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 6660.54

Start time: 6663.76

Broadcaster on cable news, a cable, I mean, a cable like Comcast, you're not only you're getting  your, your ads are being seen by more people. And if you can get some kind of kickback from the cable  company, you know, even better. So that may be the model that they're looking at. Google called

Transcript:  don't know. In fact, it was a shock when consumer reports, uh, I, what was the, I think they,  they, they downgraded, uh, Tesla for reliability and then upgraded it. And then, but I think there  was also some criticism of the self-driving features. Now it's the NTSB's turn. Right.  They have filed comments blasting the national highway traffic safety administration for a  permissive regulation of driver assistance systems. Uh, the NTSB is the organization  that investigates accidents. The, uh, national highway traffic safety administration, the NHTSA  sets the standard. The NTSB calls out Tesla's autopilot for its lax safety practices and says  the NHTSA should establish some minimum standards. There are none. And in fact, for the last four  years, uh, under, uh, then president Trump, the national highway transportation safety administration  largely let automakers do what they liked when it came to advanced driver assistance systems,  ADAS systems and prototype driverless vehicles. Uh, the NHTSA has generally weighted. This is  from an article in ours, Technica, uh, credits to Timothy B Lee, uh, for this one. The, uh, and  NHTSA has generally weighted. Oh, now I lost, uh, the paragraph, uh, until there's been a problem  before they, uh, address it. But the NTSB singled out Tesla specifically. You may not like this,  Larry, 16 times in the report, partly because there've been so many, there've been six crashes  involving driver's assistance in the last years. Now, four of them were fatal, but how many hundreds  of thousands of people have died in that same time period? Right. That's the, that's the issue. I mean,

Transcript:  look, I recognize that full self driving is far from perfect. And there have been a couple of  cases like I've been driving like road hazard, like there might've been a trash can in the middle  of the road. It might not have stopped had I not been vigilant. So you really do have to watch it.  But by and large, it's a better driver than I am. I mean, when I change lanes, for example, I use  the lane changing and I still look around, but I actually trust it more than I trust me. It has  more eyes than I do. It's processors are sharper than, you know, better memory. Um, again, I look  at it as a, as a safety feature, uh, as long as I'm also being vigilant. The NTSB said Tesla

And you think, and you think drivers who are not trained, I mean,  when Google tests or Waymo test its cars, I presume that the so-called safety drivers are trained  and responsible for how they operate it. Anybody can buy a Tesla and be an idiot if they want to.  Yeah. And often they do. But there is something Muska mentioned the other day that they actually  will take people out of the beta program if they find that you're driving irresponsibly. I saw that.  Do you get your $5,000 back? No, no, no, no, no. Let's not go crazy. I'm not in the beta program.  I haven't been anointed yet. So I just have the regular so-called full self driving, which is  pretty automated already. But the beta program, it actually makes left and right turns and city  streets and does things that the, that the shipping version doesn't do yet. I think, you know, I see

Start time: 7009.34
End time: 7042.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that I see the two competing things. The NHTSA wants to foster this technology and, and as many  jurisdictions have done, for instance, Arizona, we got to, we're going to need this. Humans are  terrible drivers. So let's really make it easier for self driving research to happen. Public streets.  Yeah. But you're not, you're not going to learn unless you go out in public. The NTSB is saying  people should not be dying. You need to make standards. You need to set some standards  so that automakers can't just do whatever they want. I understand both points of view, really.

Start time: 7043.46

Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, Tesla, they did find like there've been, you know, these safety  organizations have done because there have been people that have died. They have done these  investigations of Tesla autopilot. What they found is it is on a highway driving. Right. It is safer  than a human today, like the version that's, that's out there. Right. So there's that. But I think  what this one is getting to is that the, the, there are no, that, that the auto, the agencies  are not setting standards for these things. And so you have, for example, GM, which isn't in very  many cars at all. Right. But they have their standard, which has on the top of the, the wheel,  it has a bar that checks to make sure your eyes are looking straight ahead. Right. So it has what  is essentially a stronger safety feature than what Tesla Osworth's. And GM will only let you use it on

And it, I was trying to test it to see if it would say, Hey Leo,  we're not paying attention. And I could, it was so scary that I didn't want to take my eyes off  the road. So it went like this. I put my hands over my eyes and then peek through to make sure  I wasn't going to hit anything, but it was good enough to trick the camera. And it makes the  seat shake. It sounds an alarm. It really says sit up and pay attention. I thought that was  actually quite good. I feel much, much safer in that. I have to say, I've been testing,

Transcript:  You know what gets me mad? And I don't know how it worked because I know you leased a Tesla.  Yeah. For three years.  And I own my autopilot or full self driving. And if I were to go out and buy a new Tesla,  which I'm tempted to do, I wouldn't get to take the software with me. Unlike Microsoft Office,  which I can move from computer to computer. And so that software-  It stays with the car.  Stays with the car, which I think is the most absurd business model.

Transcript:  it's up to them to decide. But the point is that I'd be tempted to buy a newer Tesla,  but there'd be an additional $10,000 charge over and above the difference in the value of my used  version and the new hardware. So- Well, they are saying that starting in Q2,

Start time: 7236.88
End time: 7260.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that they're going to offer it as a subscription service. Probably estimated like $200 a month.  And at that point, then you sell the car, it doesn't go with the car and you get a new Tesla,  you just keep paying it. That service could also be, yeah, there could be some other  features that go with the service. I think they're calling it Tesla Connect or

So those  of us who spent between $5,000 and $10,000, depending on when you bought it, aren't going  to get the benefit of that. If you really cared, you just-

If you kept  that car for 10 years, you still have the software for the whole length of that.

I can't. Even though the SEC said,  stop tweeting. I wonder if the SEC might go after him for that. Then there is a report that,  remember, Elon did not believe that COVID-19 should shut down his Tesla plant in Fremont.  He opened it in violation of local regulations.

About a thousand satellites  have been deployed. They need 1,200 to do the preliminary first round, which means it'll  probably be turned on soon. Oh yeah, by the way, the Falcon 9 booster came back to the,  of course, I love you barge and landed perfectly, stuck it, which makes this the ninth time it's  been used, which is pretty amazing.

Transcript:  We're going to be testing it.  I was just going to say, it sounds really interesting for a lot of folks in rural areas.  I speak to a lot of our readers are not in New York or San Francisco or in big urban cities.  I remember I was working on a magazine story. Maybe it was a year ago, maybe two years ago.  I spoke to a woman in Michigan. She doesn't have internet in her home. It doesn't exist.  It's a beautiful location. She said she was on a lake.  That's the trade.  But if she wanted to get like to send an email, she would have to drive to some local bar  restaurant. That's terrible.  Good enough reception. So it's like, that's what it is for maybe not that extreme,  but there are a lot of places in this country where the internet is not particularly good.  So if you know, programs, companies like Starlink, that's actually kind of interesting. I don't know.  We'll see. I haven't tried. CR has not tested it to be clear, but it sounds interesting.  And it sounds like it may fill a need that clearly a lot of folks have.

Start time: 7497.98
End time: 7525.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's also expensive. And I guess this is a first world issue because one of the visions of Starlink  is to not only bring internet to that woman in Michigan who maybe can afford $499 for the  satellite and $99 a month for the service, but also to bring it to corners of the world where  internet isn't available and there's not that much money. I'm hoping that they'll let the  rich nations subsidize the poor nations because I think one of the visions for Starlink is to bring

Start time: 7525.62
End time: 7614.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  internet everywhere. Right. I would hope. And there will be economies of scale and also even  what's essentially in here is one connection to potentially one house. You know, there in some  of those places when you're going from a town could buy a dish. Yeah, exactly. You'll have a  town or a village and they'll split it 10 ways or 20 ways or whatever. And at least if you have  even a basic connection, that's an upgrade. And then over time, as the technology scales and the  bandwidth scales, then there's lots of potential there. It's not just Starlink doing it on SpaceX,  but there are two or three others that are going to be competing as well. So that's a good thing.  When are you going to review it?  TBD. It's in process. Like we don't actually have it yet, but we've got somebody who's getting it.  And yeah, but you can see, obviously I want everyone to look at CNET's review. I'm biased  and think it's going to be extremely comprehensive and helpful, but you can go on YouTube and there's  a lot of people who have shared their experiences with it. So if you want to get a first look at  some of those, you absolutely can take a look at half a dozen, a dozen videos of different people

Probably not going to buy it at this point. All right. I think I should order it because I think  we should review it. I presume am I going to have to contract for a year or something?

But how much of  culture is now just coming through the internet? You can't watch Netflix. You can't do HBO Max. You  can't live stream the show. It's like so much of compared to 15 years ago, you didn't if you  didn't have a broadband connection, it wasn't necessarily that big of a deal. Today, it feels  way more critical to just be kept in the loop of what's going on until they participate in society  to have a reliable, this is that digital divide, which Consumer Reports covers very closely. It's  like folks are getting left behind through no fault of their own. And that's bad, obviously not  to endorse Starlink. We haven't tested it. I don't have it. I've seen a YouTube video on it.

Really to address that issue of people who are off the grid, off the internet,  and who can't participate in a modern economy, who can't get work, who can't learn the information  they need to be good voters, all of that stuff. It's called the Accessible Affordable Internet  for All Act. It will of course be heavily debated.

You've got to review it. Once these start rolling out,  there's going to be vast interest. I don't need it. I get gigabit from Comcast at home.  We get 10 gigabits from Sonic here, so I'm really not going to benefit, but I think we should review  it. We should take a look at it and set it up, so I'll order it. It's part of our job.  Cool. You take it on your boat.  Well, that's why I really want it. On your yacht.  No, you know what I want? I want a suitcase-size Starlink that I can carry around,  so as I'm traveling, I could still do the shows, that kind of thing.  Wouldn't that be awesome? That's my dream. Then I'll never retire. As long as I could do this  from Morocco or the Maldives or the Seychelles, I would be happy. I'll be happy. I could go to  Barbados. Actually, we have a friend, one of our sponsors, who spent the last six months in Barbados  because they have that visa where you could do your business from Barbados. He loved it. I asked  him, well, the bandwidth, because I need to have good enough bandwidth to not only do the show but  have a green screen behind me so nobody would know that I'm in Barbados. He said, oh, the bandwidth  is better than at home. This guy works for a big bandwidth company. He knows. He said the bandwidth  was fantastic. They have fiber to the island.

Hey, even if I'm here, I can  pretend I'm in Barbados or London if I want to watch Netflix UK or Tokyo if I want to watch  Netflix Japan. This is absolutely shocking, but it is completely legal for internet service providers  to gather every bit of what you're doing online and sell it to marketers. T-Mobile just announced  a change in their privacy policy saying they were going to do exactly that. Whether it's a  a mobile carrier or your home internet, you're being spied on. And as we now know, incognito mode  does not hide your activity from them. It just hides it from your spouse or your nosy roommate.  So no matter what you're doing or how often you clear your browsing history, your internet  provider can see every single site you visit. They can see every search you do. That's why when  you're at home, you probably should use ExpressVPN. Never go online without ExpressVPN. ExpressVPN is  very easy to do. There are routers. You can put ExpressVPN on routers. They support many routers.  You can put it on any machine. You can put it on your phone. You can even put it on your smart  television. What ExpressVPN does is it hides your IP address. In a sense, instead of using your IP  address, you're using ExpressVPN's IP address. So if you do a Google search, Google doesn't know  it's you. They just know it's coming from that IP address. That's not you. It doesn't matter  if you get your internet from Verizon or Comcast or any of their local ISP. It's completely legal  in the US for them to gather and sell your information to advertisers. Leo, if I could just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  home. It's actually very interesting, isn't it? Yeah. By the way, it's really important. I'm glad  to hear you have ExpressVPN because any VPN will do this. The problem is you're just kicking the  privacy can down the road. The VPN now sees everything that the Comcast saw or Google saw.  You really want to make sure you use a VPN provider that doesn't log, doesn't track you.  ExpressVPN actually goes the extra mile not only not to log you, but to make it impossible to log  you. They use a trusted server technology that when you go to ExpressVPN, when you push that  button that turns it on, it spins up the VPN server in RAM. It's sandboxed. It cannot write to disk.  As soon as you log off, it's gone and literally no trace at all of what you just did online exists.  It's gone forever. They don't know it. No one can know it. It's not free. They invest. It's reasonable,  seven bucks a month thereabouts, but they invest in their bandwidth, in their servers.  And that's why you can watch Netflix in the UK because it's fast enough. You won't even know  you're using it and you're able to watch HD video. Even on your smart TV, you can use ExpressVPN to  protect you. Truthfully, if you have a smart TV, you really need ExpressVPN because if you think  your ISP is bad, your smart TV vendor is far, far worse. They know everything you're doing on  that television. Protect your online activity today. Get the VPN CNET rates number one,  wired rates number one. The one I use, the only one I recommend, the one Larry uses,  expressvpn.com slash twit.

Transcript:  You really want to use it there. Yeah. Yeah. For a lot of a lot of reasons, partly because you can't  get anything you want. That's right. You can't go to the places you want. But whatever you do,  don't share your Netflix password. Okay. Apparently emails are going out now. They want to everybody  who doesn't share. The thing is in the Netflix terms of service, it says you can only share it  with people in your household. Well, my kids are in my household. They don't live with me anymore,  but they're still my kids. So that's the question. What is household? They are now sending out emails.  They're letting people know if you don't live with the owner of this account, you need your own account  to keep watching. And you'll need to verify it with an email or an SMS text message. Otherwise,  if you want to watch this is this is a test, Netflix says. I imagine they're going to wait  and see how many how many screams of pain. A Netflix person told the streamable.com this test  is designed to help ensure people using Netflix are authorized to do so. It still isn't clear if  users in the test all need to have the same IP address to be in the same household. And I'm not  sure what they would do if you were using a VPN IP address. You'll have to let me know. They might  block you. They've been very good in the past. I mean, one of the reasons I use Netflix as an  example, I actually inquired because I thought, well, I don't want to recommend something Netflix  is against. They said, no, if you have a subscription, if you're paying for Netflix,  you can use Netflix Japan with a VPN. That's fine. You pay for it. The only reason they say  we don't recommend it is because the video quality won't be so good. But they say it's not against

Yeah, I can say that I don't know any millennial that actually pays for it, but you know,  it's a, I'm a test group of one, but I think that part of it is they will eventually over time,  right? It's like people were saying that, oh, the housing market is over.  Millennials aren't going to buy houses. Well, you know, is it just, you know, they aged into it.  It is, it's fine. Now it's like the housing market is roaring because so many millennials  are buying houses. And so it is an opportunity though. I really like what Larry was saying  about it's an opportunity for some of the other places to say, like, look, you want to share with  your family and you guys are in different places. Go for it. Who cares?  You just pay us the extra family plan and we're happy to let you do it.  Well, that's what Apple does. That's what Apple does. That's what Google does.

But yeah, I think one way that millennials can afford it is by buying stonks. That's the key.  Get into the stonk market. I'm sure a few millennials bought Roblox when they went  public this week. And if they did, they did okay. 38 billion dollar market cap. This is their first,  this is their public offering. They were valued in the private market in January at 29.5 billion.  So this is a pretty big jump. The stock closed at 69.50. I don't know Roblox. I don't know any kids

The way a  lot of these work, especially SPACs, a lot of these companies that are going and Roblox, Roblox is a  good solid company. I think it's long-term, you know, if you're an investor, it's probably a good,  it's a good thing. But you know, these companies now that are especially high profile, have high  profile consumer products, they come to market. The people who are the insiders who paid for the  stock and got it at a reasonable price, they make a lot of money because as soon as it hits the market,  the stock goes way up.

They just can't wait to do that. And I do think  that there'll be this kind of, this summer might be kind of crazy. I got my second shot a week ago.

Transcript:  I think you're right. Tech, as you write in the Mercury news will become the new normal  after getting us through a tough year. Here's some good news. We can end the show with the  university at Buffalo has created a deep fake spotting tool that is 94% effective  with portrait style photos. People have been very worried about deep fakes. I just, I just saw  a, a mom got arrested for creating deep fakes of other members of the cheerleading squad to help  her daughter get on the cheerleading squad. And I thought, Oh, this has become way too common.  Now we've got a problem. But this tool apparently is very effective because it looks at the light  in the eye. The, anything that's coming to the eye with the light emitting from these sources  will have an image on the cornea. So if you compare the two eyes, they should have very  similar reflective patterns because there's the same seeing the same things. And this artificial  intelligence has been able to, by looking at the eyes, figure out if it's real or a deep fake 94%
