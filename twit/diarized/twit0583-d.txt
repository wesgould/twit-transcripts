Transcript:  Probably don't want to say also with us  This is the all-international edition today from Montreal and I'm or comm our good friend Renee Richie a regular on Mac break weekly  Hi, Renee. Hi Leo. Welcome back. Hey back. I  Even though I was all over the world Russia and  Finland and the Netherlands I was reading I'm or the whole time because I had with me an iPhone 7  And I had to learn how to use it the thing  There's there's a lot of changes and then I got the new  Watch OS and the new Apple watch and then I'm back to I'm or to figure out  How do you have what band to get because you're the king of bands? Yeah, I have so many  The band they ship by the way with this most expensive Apple watch now the  Yes is the worst band ever it's a dirty gray rubber band

Start time: 223.40
End time: 227.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I would really like a ceramic white band to go like I'm figuring the price would double to make that band

Start time: 228.00
End time: 295.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I would still like that option even if we're just the same color as the watch white, but it's dirty gray  Anyway, that's it. That's a first world problem. I think it's the ultimate first  You know this watch was $1,300, but the band is just rubber. Yeah, it's not it's a non combustible Apple product though  Is that true fluoro elastomer does not burn Steve Joe I don't know  Well, what does burn apparently is the note 7 even and this is terrifying the replacement note 7s now  I really want to emphasize  That the invest with there. I want to know more  I cuz maybe this isn't an official replacement  This is the first one we heard about a fire on the Southwest Plain and wasn't plugged in it was in a guy's pocket  Started to heat up he pulled it out threw it on the floor  It burst into flames burning the carpet of the plane and the subflooring forcing the evacuation fortunately the plane was at the gate  Everybody got off right now the fire department has that phone  But Samsung says we want it and the Consumer Product Safety Commission says we want it, but that's not the last story  They've been two more

End time: 313.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Report it fully. I asked Jerry right right before the show so Jerry Hildegrand from  Android Central has been following it all weekend and there have been five in the US now  And four in Asia. Yeah, it's two of them just in the last 12  He said as I was writing one story two more happened how which is where we are right now at this point

Start time: 313.46
End time: 318.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You got to think maybe these are the replacement phones. Well, okay. I've spent some soon

Start time: 318.06
End time: 331.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've spoken to the consumer protection people neither of have had the phones in their hands  They can't be shown but it's looking increasingly likely as though they rushed out the replacement  They didn't think this one through properly and they're in a whole world of hurt from a branding

Start time: 331.74
End time: 374.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's the conspiracy theory they rushed it out. They got it out within a week, right?  They started shipping 20 on the 21st of September and I talked to somebody today on the radio show who had a replacement phone and  His theory and I think it may not may not be far off. He says, you know, this phone doesn't hold a charge very well  I think they changed the firmware  but did not  Retool the phone and of course that maybe makes sense to do it that quickly  They'd have that phone is not is it just like the iPhone is a sealed phone  You'd have to take out the entire battery, but probably also the charging assembly  I don't know if they could get replacement phones in that quantity out within a week  Maybe all they did was change the firmware

Start time: 374.75
End time: 397.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  There's something deeply fishy going on about this because I mean it was there for the taking  Apple was going to get a lot of flack with the iPhone 7 coming out dropping the audio jack  Not really doing that much else to it the market was there's for them  I think they're just like we've got to get this out now  So it's you know, we can get win over disgruntled Apple users and they seem to have screwed the pooch on quite the opposite now

Start time: 398.02
End time: 415.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think a lot of people took their refund on the note 7 and bought iPhone 7 and  For them, but anybody who took a replacement phone by the way all the US carriers and I would imagine this is true worldwide  Are saying fine bring the threats replacement phone back  We'll get we'll make it a whole you whole is it give you a refund or AT&T won't even give you a replacement note 7

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  As I would expect and at this point how bad is this for Samsung Renee?

Start time: 424.42
End time: 492.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So there's a couple things to pull apart here. One is that  We don't know very much about this like Samsung owns 20% of the battery company that made this thing is Samsung SDI  But batteries are very complicated lithium-ion batteries  Especially are very complicated beast and there were stories about maybe the the positive and negative polarity weren't properly separated and that was causing an unusual  Amount there's always some failures always some critical failures  Like you see every phone iPhones have occasionally burnt LG for almost any phone  You can go find a few incidents of this happening to you  But this was happening with alarming regularity which made them think that maybe the chemistry was wrong  And there were rumors of course that they did rush it to market to try to beat Apple to the punch here  But it's also possible that what they thought was wrong is not what was in fact wrong with the battery and whether it was firmware or  They switched supplies because apparently supplies from the other companies that they were pulling from weren't having these incidents  But it just could be that they fail to identify the proper problem or the problem was much deeper than what they thought  There would would it be because those replacement phones did come to market really really really fast  And now I mean, yeah, Samsung hasn't said anything the fire burn hasn't anything but the verge has done a great job  They've gotten photos of the boxes they've they've checked the numbers

Start time: 492.32
End time: 502.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And some of those urge phones are accurate those verge photos are accurate  I think I see no reason not to think so these were the official replacements. Please yeah multiple times. Yeah

Start time: 503.34
End time: 522.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Three or four of them at least they've identified and one of them a Samsung person accidentally texted the owner of the phone  He's saying what do you want me to do try to suppress this?  And it sounds like in Korea there's charges of them trying to suppress it in the media as well and that it's never the story  It's always the crime. It's always the cover-up and that is potentially I think even more explosive than the actual phone incidents

Start time: 522.64
End time: 543.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I saw that I saw that text message and it was just like wow  This is gonna make this so much worse because if they're actually talking about this and they've managed to let on they're talking about it in  These terms that's it  you know, they're gonna have to a complete product recall and redesign the phone because  You know people just aren't gonna trust the brand after this the note 7 the in question here

Start time: 544.70
End time: 596.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Was owned by a fellow from Kentucky it on Tuesday it not only caught fire but sent him to the hospital with smoke inhalation  And Samsung knew about this and didn't say anything about this  They asked him if they could take possession of the phone. He said no  Though the company did pay to have it x-rayed  But according to the verge the damning evidence comes in the form of a text message  That he received accidentally from a Samsung representative quote just now got this I can try and slow him down  If we think it will matter or we just let him do what he keeps threatening to do and see if he does it  so I think  It's a smoking gun  They clearly knew about it and were but they knew what the damage would be  I mean, this is it for the note 7 right that phone is now dead

Start time: 597.38
End time: 614.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean people are capricious and we've seen many examples of where you know  Like people like us will just say never again  Like I've done that with companies that have installed root kits or other forms of malware on their own machines and sold them to me  But other people go and buy the next version immediately. They're rational on it's not fully rational though because really statistically

Start time: 614.96
End time: 627.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Even if you had the original note 7 it was one in 30,000 that you might get a burn  But consumer behavior is never rational. Yeah, I mean well and who wants to take the chance. It's just a phone  I'm not gonna take the chance all

Start time: 628.92
End time: 634.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  One of them say again and that a little girl was one of the people playing with one of them and that's something you  Never ever want to have happen, right?

Start time: 637.10
End time: 647.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you know a few people are asking me and all I could say is well why take the chance get rid of your note 7  Yeah, yeah, but here's the bigger problem. Do you then say should I get a galaxy s7?  No

Start time: 647.88
End time: 658.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hang around get a note 5 if you really want if you really want a stylus get a note 5 if you really want a Samsung  Galaxy s7 if you really want an Android phone get a pixel if you really feel okay about that you shouldn't worry

Start time: 659.44
End time: 677.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, I don't think so. We've had phones and lithium-ion batteries for years and even though some small number  Battery gets punctured, but this is the same but the Tesla's had this problem too with but I mean Reynolds call point

Start time: 677.92
End time: 698.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't use lithium-ion batteries on a mass-market product without once or twice them going nuts  All it takes is a tiny sliver of metal within the actual battery itself breaking loose shorting across and then instant fire  It's an essentially, you know, it's a very safe technology  But when it goes it goes boom and you know, it can be quite dangerous in that regard

Start time: 698.96
End time: 705.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but the note 7 is beyond the statistical norm is beyond the norm. I think people need safety  So yeah, you you need to take it back

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's been on it all weekend. Yeah, absolutely. What's a big story? It's a big story for all consumers  I know when I get calls about something I got a lot of them on the radio show that people are aware of it  And and I think that it will have a long-term damaging effect on Samsung

Start time: 766.76
End time: 802.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Bad things will always happen any this could happen to any manufacturer there, but by the grace of God  It happens to anybody because like it's this technology  but it's how you handle it that really matters and how you deal with consumers and we all we've gone back to that Tylenol incident repeatedly where  They could have just pulled those VAT numbers and tried, you know play the odds  but they pulled everything because they knew their brand was more important and  There's there's concerns over how Samsung was trying to cover up potentially cover up evidence for the washing machines, too  And that that's the part that's gonna hurt  I mean Samsung needs to as a company get in front of this and do everything it can to make sure that their customers feel  That they're protected and it's not Samsung protecting themselves because that's the part that always hurts a company

Start time: 802.60
End time: 808.22

Yeah  You know and I I know you've already talked about this the Google event was this week I'm  Rapidly coming to the point where I think instead of having five phones for Android phones and one iPhone  I will be down to two phones a Google phone and an Apple phone and that will be that and I'm wondering if that isn't  The future going forward certainly Google with its announcement of the pixel  Its price point and the fact that the pixel has features no other Android device has  Kind of sounds to me like Google's going after the other handset manufacturer. Okay, but but Leo Leo

Start time: 936.20
End time: 955.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's here's my question about the pixel and and as usual I'm neurotic  So I need you to talk me through this because I've ordered it and I might cancel it  I don't know. I'm gonna be neurotic. I'm from New York. I'm allowed to be  The the whole notion that AI is available only on this phone  Makes no sense to me because the AI occurs up in the cloud up in the big big big machine somewhere off in Google land

Start time: 956.06
End time: 962.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

End time: 989.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's why I don't also use alo with with Google assistant this week and it doesn't work so well  So I understand I want to have alo available at a crack with the phone  But what I'm saying is I think that Google just pulled a marketing trick and put  Assistants into the new phone because it's a marketing thing  It's not because there's any hardware reason that it should be there or not elsewhere, right?

Start time: 990.14
End time: 995.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There maybe is an argument that they don't want to go wide right away that they want to slowly and this this happens roll it

Start time: 995.78
End time: 1011.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Out you see this is why I'm kind of skeptical about the whole whole sort of Google is going after Samsung with this because they don't  Have the infrastructure in place to do the kind of long-term large infrastructure  So a lot large sales and have the infrastructure that's a bigger problem  So they're not gonna be going up against something

Transcript:  No, I don't well for a couple reasons and I think Matthew Panzerino explained this really really well the other day  It will one is that they make products  So it's always hard to have a scale when you when you're selling that big ad at the bottom for your camera  But the other thing is that the scores they give them the scores and then the scores are generational, but they don't really change  So there's a bunch of cameras that came out two years ago that are obviously worse  But still score high because the scale is never as they were high for that  Yeah for that time and it's unclear what this like I believe the pixel has an outstanding camera  I think there's a whole bunch of smarts in it. But what do those two numbers mean? Like what what is the differential there?  I think they don't do a great job and explaining it which is why I'll wait for the an antech review or some of the other  Reviews like that to tell me what's going on. Well, and also there's more than optics involved

But how much cropped was that like usually when you do?  You do electronics.

Start time: 2711.52
End time: 2726.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

End time: 2780.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ah, but it's a big big but on that of the jpeg  If you're sticking to their standard 16 megapixel  I think it's a 16 megapixel  Resolution then fine you get limited storage if you want to if you have your phone setting higher and  You want to store those raw images then it goes against your 15 your 15 terabytes storage limit

Transcript:  Because it you know like famously I mean there were there were music players before the iPod they were phones before the iPhone  They were tablets before the iPad so to me  There's this thing called copy forward when you say great artists steal  It doesn't mean you do a bit by bit pixel by pixel atom by atom copy  But you take what's come before the best of it and you carry that forward because humans shouldn't have to learn different ways of using  All these things there are very good ways of using it and you build on that and you take it forward now  You can argue that the industrial design of the pixel or the utility of the Google home isn't a significant enough drive forward  But for some people just being able to log into their Google account instead of an iCloud account or an Amazon account is  Exactly the functionality they want in that device  So I think we have to judge them not on their me to it ness but on their on the actual execution of the devices

Transcript:  What I do see and I think is interesting is that Google might be taking might be I say taking a page from Apple  Apple's really built their business on a closed ecosystem where everything interacts with everything else and be and it strongly incensed the consumer to buy all  Apple what you know your watch can wake up your computer  You're can copy and paste from your computer to your phone it all works together seamlessly in theory  Google has in the past kind of been more open like we're gonna work with everybody alo is both iOS and Android that kind of thing  But now with this new range of products and incidentally no mention at all of Chromebooks or Android where yeah, which really  Yeah, or this dual operating system code name Android where got pushed back I think till next year nevertheless it looks like Google's  Forget copying all those devices is copying the idea of a closed ecosystem that if you have a Google phone  You're gonna want the Google home because it's the same assistant  It knows the same things about you that kind of thing they already have that up to a point

Was a huge privacy problem  Where's my calendar appointment which account gets that calendar appointment?

Transcript:  Several but again, like this is a this is the thing that you you can make certain experiment with software when you start experimenting  With Adams and I was about to say that about Google Home  Google is at its best when they put everything behind it and they say we're gonna do Google Home  We're gonna own it. We'll put it on the market and we'll iterate and we'll iterate and we'll iterate will make it great  Google's at their worst when they're like, ah, here's this wave thing  Maybe it won't exist three months from now and people are less tolerant with that with Adams like the nest stuff  I think is a great example of yeah people feel don't feel support the product, right?  You that's really hard to do. So Apple's thing is like is the airport Express?  Should it just be a router? Should it be a mesh router?  Should it be something that downloads all your iCloud information all your updates, you know to your local servers?  You don't have to wait for them anymore. Should it preload that stuff? Should it give you Siri functionality?  How do we do multi-person Siri? How do we do beamforming properly?  So they're gonna answer all these questions and then best case they put out an iPhone  Worst case to put out an Apple watch and a couple years later  It's it's much more coherent but they tend to do that experimenting internally  And I think sometimes they do it too much and things like MacBooks or routers or other things just languish in the meantime

Yeah, or they're yeah, they're editing video  They know that and they are probably more willing to take on the  Responsibility of a general-purpose operating system. You need to be a security expert  You need to kind of be willing to mess with it when it stops working, right?  because it's such a complex beast a Chromebook is for normal people and  If you don't know you need a general hassle  Yeah, if you know you don't know general-purpose operating system, you should be getting a Chromebook  You should only get window windows used to be the default.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, Andromeda is a true combination by rumor of the two OS's hmm whereas  No, it's been it's been guessed for a long time and and reportedly it's being tested on Nexus nines  But my fear is that I know Google's attitude to be two years ago when I sat down with them about the Google plus bit rest  In peace I made some complaints about things I wanted three years ago  Maybe now things I wanted in the in the web version. They said web. Are you kidding? We don't do anything with that anymore  We just do mobile. That's all we do is mobile AI. So my fear is they're gonna abandon any idea of  Of anything bigger. This is Google's biggest problem

End time: 3846.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The abandonment problem. Yes, you can never trust Google whether it's Adams  Renee or bits to stick with anything  Yes, and this pixel thing just exacerbates the problem because we're floating in limbo  They made a very expensive Chromebook people who use it love it. Mm-hmm. The story is internally this is you know people  inside Google love it  But they have not now  Because Google's Chrome OS and chromium Chrome browser and Android are open source projects  What happens is code leaks out and that's why we know about Andromeda. We also in the code see traces of a new pixel  Coding bison that you know, so you can start to see that in the code base  But I think I'd be very nervous

Transcript:  I tend to think like when you hear stories about iOS and Mac OS for example merging or when you hear stories about Chrome and  Android more these are two very very different things with very different runtimes experiences  Security models and all these things and it's often I think often we we see you know  It makes sense to us because all we see is the front end for an individual the interface is the application  So we see these front ends and we think oh I could just throw this app on here  But you know, that's not how the plumbing works  And I think if there is an Andromeda or there is a successor to all these operating systems  It's something that comes next. It's it's what we did when we launched mobile to begin with they think it over  They take the best from both things and they build a platform  From the drivers back on up that does all the things they wanted to do instead of some sort of hodgepodge  Frankenstein OS that really make nobody happy. It's hard to do your nightmare and I'm not sure exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We should have anonymity, but i'm rethinking this idea. I think you know part of it was I had this  Utopian notion that the internet true democracy would give everybody a voice and that could only be for the good  And then I found out that a very very tiny percentage of people are horrible  And and the problem is their voice is amplified to the point where  What's that book say?

Start time: 5205.06
End time: 5285.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

So all right. Pardon me drinking game time  I happen to have a glass of wine right here. Thank you. So from gutenberg, pardon me  On right, uh, I I had to write a piece recently about martin luther  And and and and and if we're in the year 1450 was depressed 1475 is where we are now versus the web, right martin luther was born  In 1483  And he didn't start publishing till about 1505  We're we are martin luther isn't even born yet  So it's too soon to say oh forget all the future. Let's hold on to the old institutions. Let's keep the aristocracy  No  Right, but we haven't we haven't created the replacements in the arab spring. We tore down. We didn't build up, right?  Donald trump of the republican party they tore down they haven't built up right. This is the era of tearing down  Now martin luther did start a new he tore down the catholic church. We built a new church  And and and we're not yet at that stage where we're building what's new  So I do think there is a there is a call to civility  There is a call to rethinking the notion of building civilization on the net  But that does not mean that we kill the future and retain the past that ain't working

Transcript:  Rejection of science with america is appalling  But I think we were at a point where we're not mature enough to be able to have civilization and anonymity at the same time  Because we quickly when you're anonymous you quickly forget about the repercussions of your actions  You're almost drunk. Uh, you know your power crazy on the anonymity  You think suddenly all your all your darker angels can come out and play without any fear of repercussion  So we I think anonymity definitely has value like you said  But when you get a lot of people together into groups, we have not shown the responsibility needed for it

Start time: 5385.30
End time: 5396.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 5404.72
End time: 5417.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, the other the other thing is the freedom of speech is also the freedom to edit  And and this is where people and I think facebook has done some really boneheaded things like killing the the the napalm photo  Not really isn't the pornography of that photo was not

Start time: 5418.80
End time: 5423.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 5423.38
End time: 5451.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but it was mechanical and they reversed it but it was still their right at some level  It is their right to decide what does and does not go on their platform publisher. You have editing power  Yes, and that is a that is a that is a mode of freedom of speech, too  So that you know, you can be 4chan and anything goes you can be reddit and and almost anything goes  And those are places where you can go and do that. But if you're facebook or twitter  Do you choose not to be that now facebook chooses not to be that you're right leo because of identity enable it enables that process

Start time: 5452.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's not there's plenty of jerks on on on facebook. I don't know it rises to the same level though. Does it?

Start time: 5472.04
End time: 5493.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, maybe and twitter also I think the frustration was that they they didn't do things when it seemed like they could like for example  You could give people absolute freedom of speech in their own timeline  But the minute they put an at mention in it not have that same level of freedom because now you're involving other people  And it just looked like they're probably seven or eight different solutions and it looked like they implemented none of them  And I think that's where the like you can you can argue that instagram or facebook. So, okay assuming there is a technological solution

What is the fix? What is the filtration system?  And and how would it work and could we implement that because you could polish this turd?  And turn it into something of great value. I mean there there's no i'm not disagreeing. There's huge value in twitter

Start time: 5590.38
End time: 5604.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean it's it's an iconic brand and a lot of people not just the brand the actual content  Well, yeah, but I mean people people actually love it. They use it on a regular basis. That's fine  But it's making money out of it and they've had years now to try and make money out of it

Start time: 5604.44
End time: 5631.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And they can't do it. I think you're right again. So so so but but but you're both right because leo's saying there's an insight here  Which which you know with ev has always had blogger was an insight that changed the world blogger itself was never a good business  Twitter was inside the change of the world never a good business  But so let's say that twitter gets bought by hedge fund and ruined or gets bought by  Verizon and and gets ruined  But where does the insight go if you were going to build something new knowing what we know about twitter? What would you build? That's interesting

End time: 5674.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know  I think there is a role for anonymity in that it gives people a way that they can speak out  And the the initial idea behind it was good in that you judge people based on what they had said  In the past and you made your judgments about their personality that way  But it's broken down for multiple reasons chiefly that you make as many anonymous accounts as you like and be as nasty as you like

Start time: 5675.20
End time: 5707.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I should point out by the way that we have a very wonderful chat room  Yeah, that embraces anonymity  That you can use a handle you are totally anonymous in there and the reason it works is we have  constant moderation and cultivation  And we pay attention to it  And that's true of any anonymous same thing with forums  You know every forum's gone through that period of if you ignore it the weeds grow and pretty soon  Nobody wants to be there and that's dozens and dozens of moderators in our forums moderation though is the solution

Oh my god now it's gotten so bad that verizon has said  Can we get a billion dollars back? Yeah. Yeah a billion dollars back because we are buying damaged goods. So  First there was the breach the book. Yeah, that's the first thing that happened every it was hundreds of millions of counts, right?  500 million by some accounts the biggest breach of data ever  Uh, I did not get to hear security now were the I presume this stuff was hashed at least

Start time: 6454.08
End time: 6458.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Passwords were hashed and some security questions were hashed, but only some of them

Start time: 6458.96
End time: 6468.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Although I think steve was explaining that they would migrate you to a better hash if you relogged in but many people never relogged in  So they were stuck on the old hash which is not very weak hashes are easily broken. Yeah

Start time: 6468.86
End time: 6477.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, in fact if you have a bad password even good hashes are easily broken  500 million accounts. So that was the first thing I heard I was away how long

Start time: 6477.90
End time: 6482.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That in fact, we didn't know it was two days. They didn't know for how long and then we didn't know for how long right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, didn't say anything well, hey, well first how why did it take so long for yahoo to know that it existed  Is that is that is that they have legitimate excuse for that?

Start time: 6507.22
End time: 6513.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It sounded like they're they didn't care about security at a very deep corporate level like people brought it up to them internally  And they were it was told it was not a priority to them

Start time: 6514.28
End time: 6518.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 6518.88
End time: 6545.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's another story some yahoo staffers actually did go to new york new york times over this and they were  Within the company they were known as the paranoid  And apparently alex stamos who was hired as uh cso went head to head with mayor on this one  Stamos is smart and good and I like alex and that's why and the reason he left is apparently because they weren't taking security seriously  And then the news about the hookup with the intelligence agencies came in and that looks even more like well

Start time: 6546.56
End time: 6559.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's stick with this breach because yahoo at least knew about in august and failed to inform verizon  Until a couple of weeks ago long after the sale so they so they're in deep doo-doo because you can be complicit and incompetent

Start time: 6559.46
End time: 6560.69

Start time: 6562.50
End time: 6573.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They I mean they had a responsibility to disclose this to the potential buyers  They did not that doo-doo has a dollar figure attached to it significant. Maybe a billion dollars  At least that's what verizon wants back. It could well queer the wholesale

Start time: 6574.72
End time: 6583.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean verizon aren't my my reach talking to people at verizon is  A lot of people at verizon aren't that keen on this in the first place and this could give them an ideal get out  Yeah

Start time: 6584.64
End time: 6590.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean they absolutely could walk away at this point either way verizon gets a better deal  Verizon gets out or gets it a hell of a lot cheaper

Start time: 6590.64
End time: 6597.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know what the fee for abandoning the deal is is probably significant. Oh unless there's cause but if there's cause that might go

Transcript:  there wouldn't wouldn't that be the  Brand value especially now when when when when giving over data to third party because when you when you transfer a company  You have to transfer all the personal data to what is basically a third party that is the purchaser  And that's always a big issue as is and now all that data is suspect  Uh or has about it read that suspect it has about it now  these cooties of

Start time: 6628.34
End time: 6635.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 6636.86
End time: 6646.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's it. I mean it is as you say, it's a combination of incompetence and whatever else  But I mean, it's isn't an alphysians would be the word. Well, yeah

Start time: 6649.28
End time: 6668.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That is important and we've seen other companies react to these sorts of things and you did this is just again an abysmal reaction  And that you can't walk away from something bad happens. You do the best thing possible  You treat your customers great you try to solve the problem people sort of respect that  But if something bad happens and you make it worse than that, the damage is extreme. Yeah  then

Start time: 6670.48
End time: 6716.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah a week later. We find out that yahoo complied with a federal request. Oh, it did more than comply. Well, it gets worse  It's been it's getting worse. So the apparently the and this was approved by the secret court the faiza court  Uh, but but it probably shouldn't have been because it was clearly a fishing expedition  Apparently yahoo went through all yahoo mail. It looks like looking for a signature for a malefactor that the  That the feds wanted  um now of course when you get one of these letters you can't tell anybody about it and  You pretty much have to comply although many companies including twitter and facebook and apple have fought these  Uh as hard as they can does there's no evidence that yahoo fought it furthermore in the past

Start time: 6716.60
End time: 6723.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They had in the past. Yeah in the past they fought against the national security letters and they lost  And it looks at this point like they got another one of these things

Start time: 6723.80
End time: 6759.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's just get it done. They spent a lot of money fighting these and they said yeah instead of opening the kimono  Let's just take it off. We're gonna lose much trouble. We're gonna lose why battle  But then they made it then this is  Unclear but so roiders had this original story, but now there's further evidence  That initially we thought oh they just modified a spam filter to do a little bit more straining  No  Apparently they wrote something akin to a root kit  Now i'm unclear on this. Did steve talk about this on tuesday? I don't know. I don't recall. I think not because  This broke afterwards. So we'll talk about it on security now tuesday

Start time: 6760.56
End time: 6784.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's fascinating the thing at the moment  There's only one person who knows the truth of this and that's alex stamos and he's not talking  Yeah, probably for very good legal reasons because i'm presuming he got a gagging clause the second he left yahoo  But he's the only person at this point in time who can tell us exactly what happened because he was in charge of the servers  When this apparently took place so until we hear from him everything else is speculation at the moment

Start time: 6785.34
End time: 6817.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  according to motherboard, uh  yahoo  Engineers didn't merely modify spam  They built a tool installed a root kit on yahoo's mail servers  Without telling anybody stamos and his security team found it and thought they'd been hacked  And then we're told oh, no, no, no, no, no, that's us. We did that on purpose  And it was buggy and poorly designed and as a result exposed  300 million yahoo users themselves  to hacking

Start time: 6818.50
End time: 6828.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, that's what google and apple tell you well  They will never code against their own code their own base because you expose it to far more than just the people who legally  Want an access point to it now we should say these are anonymous sources

Start time: 6829.18
End time: 6836.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  supposedly former yahoo employees who told motherboard this so this is unconfirmed at this point, but  uh that is uh that is

Start time: 6836.98
End time: 6858.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was interesting because when we got in contact with google and facebook and they both said exactly the same thing  Hell no  There's no way we would do this even if we were instructed to by the government  Now they've got deeper pockets than yahoo and they could probably afford to fight it  But this is just death for yahoo's brand. I mean bad enough lose half a half a billion email accounts  What brand well, okay, it still had some you know

Start time: 6858.40
End time: 6865.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You hear that you hear that from rank and file too like people at apple or google will tell you that they would rather quit  Than ever do this sort of thing. Yeah, it's just it's not it's it's well

Start time: 6865.28
End time: 6889.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All you have to do is find one guy who says oh, that's an interesting challenge. I'll write that  Uh, maybe not so good a programmer as it turns out, but anyway, it was apparently done and according to motherboard  Uh, this software would give the nsa or the fbi or whoever requested this  effectively unlimited undetectable access to get this all  yahoo users data

Start time: 6890.32
End time: 6892.34

Start time: 6936.44
End time: 6954.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And this may also explain why?  There's you know, if you're going to get phished  It's going to be because you had a yahoo mail account  It is the it was always been the worst for security, right? And I never could quite understand how well, maybe now we know  Let me ask you this renee. How do you delete your yahoo account? There's no button

Start time: 6954.18
End time: 6994.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So you yeah, there's no button which is you know again appalling in this day and age because you want you want to give people  The ultimate control over their data, but what you can do is you can go in and again i'm cribbing this from steve  So correct me steve i did anything wrong  You go in and you just delete everything you just burn it all down you delete all the mail  If you really care about it, you can download it to an offline service that you run on your own, you know  Theoretically completely sealed computer system at home  But then you just you delete what's on flick you delete what's on yahoo mail you delete anything else that you have there  And then you just change the password to some big pseudo random blob that you don't write down anywhere  And that'll keep you from accessing that account again and anybody else like 64 pseudo random or 32 pseudo random characters  You'll be safe for years to come  Theoretically, wow
