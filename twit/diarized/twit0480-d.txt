Start time: 172.96
End time: 183.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah I mean they they always do the we're gonna give you the rundown of what  we already announced earlier this year but they just kept on doing it. Yeah.  It's the bulk of the announcement I feel like was just old stuff. Oh and there's a Mac mini with

Start time: 183.96

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Red and I mean they were throwing away products but they spent a long time

Start time: 189.34
End time: 194.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  rehashing iOS 8. Yeah and Yosemite. Why? I because they they only had three

Start time: 194.88
End time: 209.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  products. That's why I think they should have waited to do the Apple watch in the  October event instead and you know the iPads you know minor upgrade whatever  looks a little different but if they had waited the Apple watch on that day that  would have been huge and it would have been a much more exciting event. And they

Start time: 209.56
End time: 226.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  completely could have managed expectations they could have leaked that  it's not gonna be in September so nobody would have been super disappointed. Right.  We would have been perfectly happy and had plenty to talk about with the two  iPhones and then this one they could have you know jammed out the iPads real  quick you know and just not even mention the mini. Isn't part of the problem also that there's not even with the

Start time: 226.68
End time: 278.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  new iPad and really only one of the iPads is particularly new the the mini is  just that they added a touch ID and nothing else has changed right? Nothing.  Yeah. Well you can get it in gold. You can get it in gold. So they had a new iPad a minor  revision to the mini and they had the new Mac and then they said and now we  could tell you that Yosemite will be out on today and that Apple Pay will be out  on Monday and iOS 8 one Apple. That was it. I mean I just did in 30 seconds. Yeah.  You just did it. Pretty much the whole thing. Okay that's not to be faulted I mean they  they got a lot of attention they got people like Dieter flying out from the  coast they got a million people watching the stream I don't know how many  watching the stream. We gave them a lot of coverage and and so that's good  marketing. They know what they're doing in terms of marketing but I do feel like  maybe they're running out of steam on in terms of product. Well I think that

Start time: 279.28
End time: 283.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  they they're doing just fine on the iPad Air. I think that they they don't need to

Start time: 283.46
End time: 307.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  update it. What do you mean? Well I mean I mean okay these are minor updates. They put a  better camera in which they should have had in years ago. Well I think the screen is  actually significantly better. The screen is better on the iPad. It's got anti-glare. Yeah.  You can tell. They did add anti-glare. So you both saw it. Yeah. So that's one thing a lot of  people wanted. I didn't even realize this but but but our iPad Today show that was  one of the number one requests is can we get a less glary screen? They say 50%

Start time: 307.72
End time: 328.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  less glary. What are they doing? They put well they did two things. They it's fully  laminated so there's no air gap between the glass and the display and that helps  with reflection a little bit and they put an anti-glare coating finish. Something like that.  But I haven't you know in the hands-on room it's very nice diffuse  lighting so you don't really know how good it is yet. Right. So you both. And

Start time: 328.06
End time: 335.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  apparently. And Touch ID was a big deal too putting that on the iPad finally.  I mean that's okay. If you've used it on your iPhone for this long. Yeah. And you don't have an iPad.

Start time: 336.60
End time: 346.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's a very convenient thing to have. Just as Tim Cook said you know I keep touching the button on the iPad.  I do too. I lock it. I do it every day. Yeah. Yeah. No I was excited about that and apparently you know it

Start time: 346.24
End time: 357.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  seems like you know they have better graphics better chip as they do every  time so you know maybe some games will be better. What's the number one feature they began with? We made it thinner.

Start time: 357.30
End time: 363.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right. Exactly. No one is asking for a thinner iPad or am I wrong? No that's right.

Start time: 363.88
End time: 368.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think everyone is asking for Touch ID and that was about it. And maybe more battery life or whatever.

Start time: 368.74
End time: 374.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But why thinner? Because they're obsessed with anorexic iPads. They're obsessed with making everything like as

Start time: 374.36
End time: 378.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  anorexic as possible. They can't get thinner. They can't get any thinner. I mean come on just stop now.

Start time: 378.84
End time: 382.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No. No I mean honestly I didn't think they needed to go thinner from the iPad Air. I thought the iPad Air was perfect.

Start time: 382.84
End time: 437.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's fine. I was a little shocked with that. Yeah. The one thing no one's ever said oh man I wish this iPad Air were thinner.  Lighter maybe but not thinner. Or gold. Or gold. Oh no I said that. I like that. I kind of wanted a gold one.  I kind of like the Kardashian iPad. I can has opulence. You want the matching set. Yeah it matches everything else of your phones.  Actually I think maybe. Okay so really the two big to me. Not a huge iPhone user or iPad user. To me the two big stories are Apple Pay launches tomorrow.  And this new SIM card in the iPad is very intriguing. So let's do them one at a time. Let's start with Apple Pay.  Tomorrow. What does that mean it launches tomorrow? Am I going to go into my favorite store and all of a sudden there'll be a big Apple terminal?

Start time: 437.74
End time: 442.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No they'll just be the standard point of sale terminals they had before with the little NFC symbol. But I can now tap my iPhone.

Start time: 444.34
End time: 451.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Or presumably if you're going to put the effort in to do that I could also tap my Moto X on it. Or any other NFC phone on it.

Start time: 451.92
End time: 459.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well if you've got a wallet set up on your Android phone which is chances are you don't if most people don't.

Start time: 459.04
End time: 470.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well I have Google Wallet on here. And in fact Android has a tap and go. So you can go anywhere with an NFC pad and it'll work?  I would presume if you're going to upgrade to put Apple Pay into your store.

Start time: 471.74
End time: 476.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No I mean on Google Wallet. Like you right now. It says tap and pay. Well I haven't tried it.

Start time: 477.34
End time: 496.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It works. Well it depends. So you can do it with MasterCard. It works pretty well.  Visa is kind of if he depends on what brand phone you have and depending on what carrier you're on.  This is why Apple Pay is I think such a big deal. Is that it's you know with Android yeah they've had it for a long time.  And other companies have too. But you've had to depend on like OK so who makes my phone. Number one.

Start time: 497.36
End time: 502.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well that's because the sucky characters wanted to use ISIS. Right. The sucky characters.

Start time: 503.32
End time: 522.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or whatever they call it now. Right. But that's the thing right. Like Apple doesn't have you don't have any of that stuff.  So you can use it at MasterCard terminals. But then the big thing too is a lot of banks weren't on board.  So Apple Pay is going to come on board. Like literally I've looked like all of my cards will work with with all my banks.  My Barclays will work. My MasterCard will work. My Visa will work. My debit card will work.

Start time: 523.08
End time: 527.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Did you use. Did you take a picture of them to enter the data in as Apple said you could do.

Start time: 528.66
End time: 542.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't been able to do it yet because I don't have Apple Pay yet.  You have to wait for it one more. OK. Exactly. But I've already checked to see the compatibility and it'll be there.  So yeah I mean you know whereas with Android and like well I can use it with I can use it with my my Capital One card.

Start time: 542.94
End time: 562.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's the only one I can use with on Android. Well I've used you could use any credit card to charge up my Google Wallet.  It is it is a selected payment platform now in my tap and pay. So I'm wondering if I go I presume no merchants going to say oh I'm sorry.  You better get out of here Leo. You don't have an iPhone. I presume that they are going to let me know most of them will work.

Start time: 562.36
End time: 586.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Most of them will work. I mean I know that MasterCard I've talked to them on on Thursday I guess and they were saying that all of the MasterCard places obviously you know all the swipe and pays work with Apple Pay and they'll work with Android too.  But there are some merchants who for instance didn't bother to upgrade to NFC until Apple Pay. So like Staples being one of them.  So Staples where before Monday like you wouldn't even if you had Android you couldn't use it. Now you'll be able to now you'll be able to.

Start time: 586.32
End time: 600.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean that's kind of why it's good for everybody. That's the thing I noted. I mean I can use it. I've been able to use it at Starbucks some gas stations you know McDonald's.  A few places have had tap and pay but you're right. Apple has that's the critical map. I don't know if you could say Apple.

Start time: 602.28
End time: 624.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Until Apple did it nobody wanted to do it. It was just critical mass. Well it's critical mass. But the other thing is if you went to go use tap and pay before you had some Android for it didn't work like oh well.  Life sucks. Everything's really complicated. The world is terrible and I live in a fragmented Android world. It's my fault. It's not the store's fault. But now someone goes to use Apple Pay and it doesn't work. They'll get mad at the bank. They'll get mad at the store and it'll drive more option.

Start time: 624.49
End time: 642.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right.  Also the laws are driving the adoption the move away from signature swiping signature cards to chip and pin. Well we're not going to chip and pin in the U.S.  But that's starting to happen and by next year. It's chip and signature. Chip and signature. But there's at least a move to and you're going to have to upgrade. If you're getting a chip you have to upgrade your payment terminal anyway.

Start time: 643.92
End time: 681.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. I mean that's the thing all the point of sale systems now like come with it when you upgrade it comes with an FCE by default whether it's enabled or not is up to you know the merchant.  But any time you upgrade your point of sale system it's going to have an FCE in it. So that is going to make I think adoption for everybody bigger. But I mean also with Apple you know you're talking about the fact that they've sold what like you think 30 million you know iPhone 6 and 6 pluses in the last month.  That's you know if you say that even 40 percent of those are in the U.S. which is probably a low estimate since it just launched in China. That's a huge number of devices that are going to work with these things that quite frankly are probably more than anybody who's ever bothered.  I mean by probably a factor of at least 10.

Start time: 683.00
End time: 688.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Let me point out Apple market share for iPhones in the U.S. is still 41 percent. It's not even half.

Start time: 689.98
End time: 702.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not like all of a sudden.  Yeah but I mean hang on for the previous NFC.  But everybody who goes to Walgreens has an iPhone?  Like compared to like what percentage of consumers have Google Wallet actually set up.  Exactly. That's what I'm saying.

Start time: 703.76
End time: 704.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But am I going to.  But.

Start time: 705.92
End time: 713.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think people are getting the impression that starting tomorrow everywhere I go I'll be able to tap and pay. Is that the case?

Start time: 714.34
End time: 727.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No it's only what those NFC terminals and then there are also these big retailers who are resistant to it.  Best Buy is resistant to these this Apple Pay thing because they'd get a cut. Apple gets a cut.  Right.  So you can see them like dialing back when they upgrade their POS.

Start time: 728.20
End time: 733.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Apple gets a cut in addition to the credit card companies cut.  Yep.  And the banks cut.  And the banks. So now.

Start time: 733.76
End time: 735.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Teeny tiny but it's.  Teeny tiny but they're getting something.

Start time: 736.44
End time: 740.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  More and more. It's you know it's one percent for them and two percent for them and three percent for them.

Start time: 741.02
End time: 743.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that sucks if you're a merchant. You know everyone's dipping in.

Start time: 744.32
End time: 762.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I actually don't think that with the merchants it's about the cut.  They weren't getting much of it. They weren't getting cuts on those in the first place.  What it is for them is it's the data.  Is if you use Apple Pay it you can't track it as easily because it's a unique pin and you won't know.  And Apple can't track it either.  Right. Apple can't track it either.  And so Best Buy would much rather you pay with something that they can like profile you with.

Start time: 762.98
End time: 772.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Precisely. Right. And Google was much more willing to let them track stuff.  I mean Google basically like came out of their way and we're like oh yeah you can track everything.  We'll give you what do you want to know.

Start time: 772.80
End time: 775.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Anything you want to know.  And that's not very comforting as a user of that.

Start time: 775.86
End time: 777.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No it's not. No it's not.

Start time: 777.98
End time: 780.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well it's been the state of condition with credit cards as well.

Start time: 781.76
End time: 806.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So this is something new.  It's not like this is something we had a choice at any point up to now.  Now I mean that is I think that's a if you trust Apple and you have to admit that there are people who say well Apple you mean the company that let all those nude photos.  So but if you trust Apple then it is a I think that's a good positioning.  Look we aren't going to give the merchant any information.  Right. Right.  The bank has the information by the way.  Yep. Right. Well that's the thing.

Start time: 807.86
End time: 832.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I mean the merchant can still try to track things that they have things like loyalty cards and other stuff which you can do with passbook and other things.  So I mean there's still ways for merchants to track stuff.  It's just not going to be as easy as it would be maybe with with their typical methods.  But I mean I think you know Best Buy dealers right.  You know they're they're resisting this.  But I would put money on the fact that within six months Best Buy will change their tune on this just because they're probably going to get so much feedback from consumers who are going to want to do this.

Start time: 833.70
End time: 851.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's good. That to me is the interesting question is is there going to be a drumbeat.  You've got to support Apple Pay or is this just us saying we'd like it to be there is is the normal consumer going to say hey I got an iPhone.  Why can't I pay with it.  I think we're so used to hauling out the credit card that it's what's not going to be anywhere either.

Start time: 852.08
End time: 861.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's only those terminals with the NFC on them and you know they said two hundred twenty thousand retailers or something like that are going to have it.  But most won't.  Is it places you go.  You still get until I can leave my wallet at home.

Start time: 862.76
End time: 864.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You can't.  We're getting closer.

Start time: 865.21
End time: 896.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You still can't.  But you're getting closer.  I mean you know I can go to Whole Foods.  I can go to Target.  I can go to the Apple Store.  I can go.  It was funny.  I was looking down the list of places that accepted and I was like you know actually there are a lot of places that I go to that are Christina can leave her wallet.  No I still probably can't.  But I mean but it gets closer and I'm waiting for that day because I have actually left my wallet at home before and I've realized this and I've been like kind of in a bind and you've got to like find the Uber or whatever to get back because you don't have a credit card on you.  This has happened to me more than once.  And then you know but if you have the Apple Pay like hey that's cool.

Start time: 897.70
End time: 916.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Again I've set up Google Wallet on here and I have tap and pay and any modern Android phone will.  I should be able to walk into those same stores right and tap.  And I will obviously have the fingerprint reader unless I have a Samsung I'll be entering a pin.  But then I'll pay.  So that's not so bad.  I mean I.  Is that really easier than swiping though?

Start time: 916.76
End time: 917.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Swiping a credit card?

Start time: 918.10
End time: 927.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I like the Apple video where the woman has to dig through the tic tacs and everything in her purse to get her credit card.  It's so hard to get a credit card out.  Somehow she magically has a phone just ready to go.

Start time: 927.78
End time: 936.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well I mean let's face it if you're waiting in line at a store you've got your phone on anyway right.  You're already checking Twitter.  Exactly.  I took Twitter off my phone.

Start time: 936.76
End time: 954.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I have a very strong opinion about that.  We should talk.  We should talk another time.  I think Twitter is the single number one reason that we have such a hostile environment especially for women in the in the in the digital world these days.  Because Twitter is just is just facilitates this and has no desire to stop it.  No they really don't.

Yeah I was just going to say.  That was so good and it was so right to my husband who didn't realize that we were friends and he read it and I was like yeah that's that's my girl Bri.  She's a badass.  And she was I was so glad she wrote that article because she's right.  She's completely the wrong person.  Like they picked the wrong person with her to kind of go up against because.  They don't care.  Well I know they don't care.  Whoever they is that's one guy.  Right but she's she's somebody who won't back down which is what's you know I mean it's terrible what's happened but she won't back down.

They will not stop this as long as they are propping up the stock price.  And you're never going to see the end of this so I have personally withdrawn from Twitter.  I'm not going to kill my account.  I did that once before somebody took it.  So I'm not I will keep my account but I'm not going to participate in this and I think others should stop because Twitter is highly irresponsible in this matter.

Transcript:  I'm telling you they do not want to address this because it would kill their stock price.  This is something they want to sweep under the rug and they're not going to be able to.  And anybody who is in the public eye or anybody who wants to do something about this should just remove themselves from Twitter and I have.  But I didn't want to bring that up.  That's another story entirely.  But it gets me angry because I don't feel they have done anything and they aren't going to do anything until enough people say well screw you Twitter.  They are the sink.  They are single most.  It's like YouTube comments in public.  You know they're the single most cesspool public cesspool and everybody's so hash tag me.  No not anymore.  All right.  We're going to talk more about Apple.  We said Apple Pay was the big thing on Monday but that's not all Yosemite is out.  And then I said something else all the same.  Yeah all the same.  That's something we should be talking about.  But first let's talk about my mattress.  I get in trouble on Twitter.  I have a Casper mattress.  You know Casper is kind of a cool idea.  They said as you've seen this a lot now on the Internet with these companies that are disintermediating the old school monopolistic overpriced super high markup businesses like Iwear shaving and now mattresses.  But you might say well I'm not going to buy a mattress online because I want to lie on it.  Well the question is if you go to a showroom and I've done this and you lie in a mattress for five minutes do you now know enough to buy that mattress.  I could tell you how many mattresses I've bought that have been uncomfortable in the long run.  Here's the beauty with Casper.  The mattress comes to your door.  You have a hundred days.  You can sleep on it for 100 nights and return it and get your money back.  They will even send somebody to pick it up.  Painless returns.  This is so much better than lying down in a showman.  Casper's mattresses are fabulous.  Visit Casper.  I'll tell you how you can save some money.  But let me explain a little bit what they're doing.  These are latex mattresses with memory foam on the top so you get both firm but comfortable long lasting comfort and support.  They I don't know what they're doing.  There's no outgassing.  They smell fabulous when they come out.  In fact you have the video Chad.  Get the video up because I have my Casper mattress.  First of all I don't know how they got a queen size mattress in that little bitty box.  But it comes to your door in a box delivered.  You open the box.  The mattress goes and then suddenly it's there.  It is super comfortable.  Just the right bounce.  Just the right sink.  This is Terry and the Casper team sent me a little book as well with my Casper mattress for reading.  So here it is in the box.  I'm all ready.  I got my jammies on.  Because well hey when you get you know you got to you know and so when you once you open the box.  Once you open the box up and they give you by the way they give you a thing to open up and take off that there's a tie vex sleeve to take you.  They have a you have like a little letter opener that goes right through it and it just opens up for you.  This is the way to try out a mattress.  Get it for 100 days.  Get a feeling of what it's like.  I love it.  I slept.  Watch.  Watch.

It's in the foyer.  Have a seat.  Relax.  Enjoy.  Free delivery.  Painless returns within 100 days.  You are going to love these.  They're made in the USA.  They they sleep cool.  They sleep very comfortably.  Even Ozzy loves my Casper mattress.  And very affordable.  They're eliminating you know the the markup because of the showroom and all that.  Five hundred dollars for a twin.  Nine fifty king size.  That's a lot less than I've paid for mattresses I have not liked nearly as much.  And you will save an additional fifty dollars by going to Casper.com slash twit.  And using twit as the offer code.  I know it may be a little reluctant.  See they have this.  Go visit the website.  You can see how they made it and design it.  And it's just really cool.  It really works.  And trust me it is very comfortable.  Casper.com slash twit.  So when you buy a new iPad Air the Air.

Transcript:  OK.  So I bought it and normally you would say Verizon AT&T T-Mobile.  You say who.  What carrier.  It just says you want the you want LTE in there.  Yeah.  So it's going to come whenever it comes next couple of days with a SIM card.  It's my understanding that SIM card will work with any carrier.  Well what about Verizon.  I don't think Verizon is on board.  Verizon.  Oh of course not.  Verizon.  Are you on Verizon.  But that's up to Verizon.  But that's the point is you don't have to be on anything.  Right.  You can say this month I'll be AT&T.  You buy whatever it costs 20 or 30 bucks.  Next month you can be T-Mobile if you want.  There's no you know you just choose what you want.  They've done a deal with EE in England.  And so if you're in the UK you could do it.  And I hope that this spreads.  This is a fair.  Could they do this with phones.  I hope so.  They could.  I hope so.  This is very interesting and only Apple has the market cloud to do this kind of thing.  Anybody else does this they're going to laugh at.

Start time: 1429.20

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well Apple has a history of doing this kind of thing.  Apple's like screw it we're moving to the micro SIM.  Screw it we're moving to the nano SIM.  And everybody's like wait wait we're going to do something.  And they're like nope we're just doing it.  And they get what they want.  And it's the same thing with this.  And you know it's on the road to there just not being a SIM card at all.  And they just just you know hardwired into the phone.  Which should terrify me because I want I like the idea of the consumer being able to switch SIMs around and having more power than the carrier.  But if it's programmable within iOS.  But if it's definitely programmable and you still can choose your own carrier it's actually better for the end user than the current situation.

Start time: 1464.02
End time: 1480.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I guess they put a SIM slot in so if you wanted to be Verizon you'd go to the Verizon store get a Verizon SIM and put it in there.  That's what it is.  Yeah.  But I love this idea.  I mean and again like Apple Pay this is where Apple's cloud in the marketplace can really make it better for consumers I think.

Transcript:  So Google's going to sell the Nexus 6 and we'll get to this in a little bit.  But they're going to sell it on all the major U.S. carriers.  In fact U.S. cellular as well.  Five carriers which is which is kind of unusual for a Nexus phone.  They're treating this more like a product.  And that the developer edition.  But it would be just so great if Google said well we don't need to be on those carriers.  We're just going to put a universal SIM in here and let you choose.  I just seems like especially on the Nexus phone which they can't possibly expect to sell a lot of.  No.

Start time: 1626.78
End time: 1645.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well no I think I mean I think the reason I mean we can get to this but like the reason Nexus 6 is on all the carriers.  Dan wrote a piece for us about this is that it's they couldn't get the price down.  The thing is six hundred and fifty bucks off contrast.  It's insanely huge.  It's not what a Nexus is usually supposed to be.  I was wondering if that had to do with the fact that they couldn't get the price down or they decided we should make money.

Start time: 1645.82
End time: 1668.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This should be a business for us not a developer platform.  They're going to continue to sell the five.  So if you need an inexpensive phone and developer platform you could buy the Nexus 5.  Did they drop the price on that?  I don't know.  I bet they will though.  Why would you have to?  But the Nexus 6 is such a monster with its got a UHD screen.  It's six inches.  It's not a phone.  I don't know what it is.  It's a tablet is what it is.  It's a tablet.  It's not a phone.  It's a recognition frankly that the modern computing platform is no longer a desktop or even a tablet.

And the question is how big should the screen be if you don't use it as a phone but you  use it primarily as a computer.  How big?  What's the right size?  And I think the marketplace seems to think that the Galaxy Note and now the Shamu, appropriately  named Killer Whale Nexus 6, should be six inches.  I had a 1520, the Nokia 1520.  I still have it.  It's just broke.  But it's not too big.  It's great.  Are you kidding me?  What do you have?  It's too big.  This is my main computer.  He's got the 6 Plus.  Was that too big for you, Christina?

I have to find a new heavy web page.  But that's what we need to do is see.  So I'm holding off on this.  But if it's fast, if it's responsive, I'm going to sell my Mac Pro.  Marco Arment at marco.org said the same thing.  He said, I feel Apple's almost screwed me because for less than a Mac Pro, I'm getting a better screen.  You don't need to find a gold display.

But this should be better.  No, this is what I'm excited about.  And it's interesting because when the first 27-inch iMac came out five years ago,  they did the same thing where it was basically the same price as what Dell was selling that screen for.  And you got the whole computer.  And that was why I bought that iMac.  And I got like a fully tricked out one.  And that's probably why I'm going to get a fully tricked out, you know, 5K iMac.

I don't think for normal folks, like, you know, just you look at Facebook all day or something, should not buy this.

Transcript:  I do think that come June, WWDC, they'll announce an Apple TV update and it'll have an app store.  They'll at least say, look, developers, start developing apps for the Apple TV because we're  going to put an app store in there.  And one of the first apps will be HBO Go because HBO announced this week that they were going  to bypass the cable companies and start selling direct to customers.  That's huge.  Huge.  That's the beginning of the end of the cable monopoly.  And don't think the cable companies don't know it and see it coming.  CBS did the same.  Yep.

Start time: 2316.42
End time: 2328.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep.  The total access thing.  I mean, that I don't think is going to be as successful because I don't see a huge market  of people paying $6 a month for CBS, especially since you don't get everything.  You don't get NFL.  You don't get some of their other shows.  But no, I mean, it's...

Transcript:  Yeah, you basically get the same back catalog that's on Netflix and Amazon.  It's basically the same set they've already licensed otherwise.  So it's really nothing that you wouldn't get otherwise.  Like if you subscribe to Netflix or Amazon, then you get all that CBS content.  Is HBO going to blink?

Start time: 2345.50
End time: 2351.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Start time: 2351.67
End time: 2375.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They already knew.  But Brian, Comcast already knew this was coming.  I mean, HBO has played this, I think, as smart as you could possibly play this.  I mean, I've spoken with them a lot over the years since HBO Go was first announced.  And they were very clear, you know, and still the majority of the revenue for probably the  next five years is going to come from cable subscribers.  They're probably going to charge, I think, I think they should charge 20 a month.  I think they can.  And I think that they're in a very...

Start time: 2377.48
End time: 2388.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You think 20?  Well, that's assuming it's HBO Go, which it might not be.  It might be like a watered down HBO Go.  HBO Go currently is everything.  Everything.  And you can watch it nearly live.  Like when the new episode of Game of Thrones comes on, you can pretty much watch it.

Start time: 2388.42
End time: 2394.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They could do HBO Go, they could do HBO, but like they wouldn't, they'd like take out the movies.  I don't think they're going to do that.

Start time: 2394.42
End time: 2400.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or something like that, yeah.  Nobody wants the movies.  It's a show on the series.  But I really don't think they're going to do that.  The comedy specials and sports.  I don't think they're going to do that at all.

Start time: 2400.40
End time: 2438.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think they're going to do the exact same thing because if you're an HBO direct subscriber,  then why would it be any different than HBO Go?  If they might, they might have, if they had to split it into two offerings, they could,  where maybe you have to log into two different apps, but I don't think they'll do that.  And the thing is they've been so smart about this.  You know, they introduced HBO Go and they basically said, we're going to give up our home video business,  which was profitable, wasn't a huge driver, but we're going to give up anybody buying our stuff on TV.  And we're going to do that so that we can keep subscribers longer so that we don't have the attrition rate that we normally have.  Because usually what happens, Netflix sees this too.  We saw this with their earnings report.  You lose subscribers when your show.

Start time: 2440.06
End time: 2446.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They watch every episode of Game of Thrones or House of Cards.  And now I've done and I'm going to stop paying.  And then they got the subscription.

Start time: 2446.44
End time: 2600.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And HBO goes through that cyclical thing.  So a big part of HBO Go was two things.  One, drop the attrition rate, keep people subscribed longer.  Right.  The second thing was put in this, you know, groundwork for the fact that they can offer a pure, you know, OTA offering.  And the thing is, is that if they price it at 15 or 20 a month, which I think is what they'll do, that's really not any cheaper than what you would pay if you had cable.  Cable can still make the deal to maybe give you, you know, other reasons to want to subscribe to cable, you know,  So you can get your authentication to access the Simpsons World app and access other things and access ABC, you know, their app and all that stuff.  But what HBO is betting on is the fact that, you know, 25 percent of the study came out last week, I think, was that 25 percent of the millennials are not pay TV subscribers.  Well, if HBO can capture even a small percentage of those people now, then when this starts to become a bigger trend, HBO still remains relevant.  So I think that they're doing it in the smartest way possible.  And if they price it what it's worth, and I think that they can charge 15 or 20 a month, I think HBO is one of the networks that's worth that.  I mean, I pay that as part of my cable plan.  And, you know, like one of the main reasons I've had cable for years, I'm not going to give it up just because HBO goes cable free.  But, you know, I when I was in college, true story, we had basic cable and I had you live.  Well, we got free basic cable in the dorm and I called up Comcast.  It was in media one at the time and I ordered a cable box so I could get HBO.  Why? Because I couldn't miss Sex and the City.  And so, you know, I'm one of those people who the power of those shows is huge.  And, you know, I think that if they can, they'll still get most of the revenue from from the cable companies.  But they're going ahead and planting that seed so that they have a real transition opportunity.  And I think that it will work well for them.  And I think the cable companies had to know it was coming.  They had to know when HBO Go was was first coming, that it was going to be an opportunity.  And now it's this point, you know, the cable companies either have to do something better with their, you know, bundling options or they have to offer more value or they have to be ready to say, OK, you know, for the most part, we're also an ISP.  So we are still the pipe regardless.  So how do we now augment this so we can get a cut?  And what that probably means is that when you buy your Internet subscription, you can pay and get bundles where, you know, if you pay X amount of money, you get Netflix and Amazon and HBO Go and maybe the CBS deal.  And in the end of the day, you pay just as much as you paid when it was cable.  And it looks just like cable and it's delivered through the same pipe as cable.  But because it's OTA, you can get it on other on other devices, too, and watch it out of the home.  You know, I got to say that you want that way, too.

Start time: 2601.91
End time: 2614.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like my ideal set of would be HBO, Netflix, ESPN, exactly.  Hulu, maybe maybe Hulu or something.  And then if someone can offer that over the top, done.  That's like, what else do I need to watch?  Oh, Comedy Central. No, totally.

Start time: 2614.40
End time: 2615.32

Start time: 2646.06
End time: 2669.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the thing is, is that I don't know about you, Dieter, but for me, you know, Cablevision is my cable provider and they're my Internet provider.  So regardless, I'm going to get this kind of great to them.  What I'm saying is, is that I already right now they're they're negotiating fees for ESPN and HBO and Fox and Viacom and all those companies.  And they're negotiating those things.  And those carriage rates are being negotiated on the back end.  And that's what's determining the cost of my cable belt.  Yeah.

Start time: 2670.66
End time: 2687.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The point I'm making is like I am fine with HBO playing shenanigans with the cable company for TV.  But once they become an Internet service, then like them playing shenanigans with the idea of Internet starts to feel like it's heading towards encroaching towards being a problem of neutrality.  I see what you're saying.  A little bit.

Start time: 2688.44
End time: 2741.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And I could see that.  But I mean, I think at that point, it just becomes HBO offers the price and this is what the price is.  And if your cable company wants to offer bundles, you know, for packages, then that becomes an option.  But you could still pay 15 or 20 dollars or whatever it is.  But your cable provider might offer you a special deal.  And that's not unheard of.  I mean, they do that already with with other sorts of services.  So I could see I hear what you're saying for the net neutrality thing.  But I think that's probably going to happen.  I don't think they'll be able to charge more.  You'll have the base rate and then the cable company is going to do what they can to entice you to bundle more things together.  And they'll probably do that by doing a discount, which is the same way that, you know, that's how you end up getting Cinemax and the movie channel.  And when you get Showtime or HBO, you don't really care about Cinemax because who watches it?  But it's like free or it's like a dollar.  So I'm like, all right, well, I might as well get Cinemax for a dollar.  You know, I might as well get the movie channel for a dollar because it's free or thereabouts.

Start time: 2741.50
End time: 2776.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What's really clear, though, is this is chaos.  It is going to continue to be chaotic.  And the only hope, it seems to me, is this company with enough clout like Apple and the Apple TV can can make the deals that perhaps make it possible  for this to work. And that's why I think in June you're going to see Apple make some announcements.  And that's when the new Apple TV.  It sounds like that got blown up this year with Time Warner and.  Yeah, I think they've been moving towards it.  And but I hear the drum beat again and again in this HBO announcement and the CBS announcement kind of to me confirms it that that Apple is about ready to do this.  I don't think Apple's got the bandwidth.  But they may not have the clout.

Start time: 3037.40
End time: 3088.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think that really all that mattered about the Mac Mini from their point of view was to get it back to the original $500 price point.  Because they needed an entry-level Mac.  And they had to do whatever they could do to make that work.  They didn't want to cannibalize other Macs by having a Mac that was, you know, the worst nightmare is $499 and it's insanely upgradeable.  You don't want that.  So you want to make a Mac that people will buy who are very price-conscious, but you don't want it to cannibalize existing sales.  I think it actually fills a price point.  It's good to have a $499 Macintosh.  You don't get a keyboard, you don't get a mouse, you don't get a monitor.  But what they've always said about the Mac Mini is, well, if you've already got all of those, i.e. if you're a Windows user, buy a Mac Mini, put it in there, and you can develop for Mac and you can do other stuff.  I think it makes sense.  But I agree. It's not...

And I can upgrade it later because I only got $500 to spend.  It just seems like they change it just to lock it down, and that's kind of offensive to me.

Transcript:  I'm with you.  But it's weird because at this point, it's only the iMac and the Mac Pro that let you upgrade because everything else is soldered in.  I mean, you can get third-party hard drives.  OWC has done a pretty good job of keeping up with the various SSDs.  They come up with the custom ones.  I don't think they have it for the Mac Book Air 2013 or 2014 yet, but they do those.  But basically, they've soldered everything in.  And it's kind of sad because it's such an Apple thing to do, but that has kind of historically been a great thing about the Macs at least.  Even though you can't do tons of upgrades, you could at least upgrade your RAM, you could at least upgrade your hard drive.  And now, even the Mac Mini, you can't do that.  So yeah, I mean, it is a problem.  If you've got $500, you've got to keep in mind, OK, what I buy now is what I'm stuck with.  And if I want to get more RAM later on, I'm screwed.  So you kind of have to tell people, OK, probably buy as much RAM as you can afford when you're buying it because you're never going to be able to do it again.

Transcript:  There's no reason.  I wrote this thing actually last week called the iPad Mini is the new iPod Touch.  And it was kind of my view of that after the iPhone 6 Plus, how they were probably going to position the Mini.  And that's kind of what I think they're doing is they're saying, you know, the iPad Air is going to be our hero device.  That's what we really want to push people towards.  And the iPad Mini is increasingly becoming less important.  But to your point, it is.  But it's such a 180 from what they did last year where they had the iPad Air and the iPad Mini, the same specs.  And now, you know, basically you can get a great deal on last year's iPad Mini.  I think that's actually now a really great value of the tablet.  So they're still selling that.  Yeah, they're still selling it.

I already figured they had to do it.  And then they released a thing and it wasn't cheap at all.  What are you doing?  And they're now finally playing in that cheap tablet space at $250.  But then they've got this high end one at $500?  It starts at $499.  That is a completely terrible deal compared to last year's model, which is like a pretty good deal.  Right.

Something Apple never did, even though they did release a tool to remove it.  Which I did immediately, by the way.  I like U2.  I thought that was beautiful, what Bono said.  I thought it was a little spammy to push it out.  By the way, they said we were going to be working together.

And for me, too, since it was the first time I knew he actually thought about marriage,  he turned over to go to sleep.  Good night, Siri.  Will you sleep well tonight?

Transcript:  I did that with the goldfinch, which is like 800 hours long.  I would read it on the Kindle and then it would pick up the audio where I left off.  It is so great.  And there are times when you're listening to a book, you'd like to see the text, like  how the names are spelled.  Game of Thrones is a good one.  You hear the name, you know, Daenerys Targaryen, and then you see it on the page and you go,  what?  That's kind of a fun little disconnect there.  Audible has 150,000 titles.  Nowadays, audio has become so important because people's longer commutes and everything that  every new book comes out on audible.com.  So you can, for instance, the new Walter Isaacson, which just came out, The Innovators.  I haven't read that, but I know a lot of people are saying good things about it.  Yeah, of course it's on audible.com.  There are so many great books, fiction, nonfiction, books about our business, our industry,  books of science fiction.  I'm a big science fiction buff and audible has, in fact, audible has such a commitment  to science fiction, they went back and they've started recording the classic science fiction,  which was of course never put out on audio books.  Their audible frontiers now has hundreds of titles, including the great stuff from Heinlein  and Asimov, stuff that was never recorded.  I am a big fan.  If you have not tried audible, we understand.  Maybe you're thinking, I don't know, is this for me?  Oh, look, Tim Curry and Alan Cumming, dramatized version of Dracula.  Simon Vance, Catherine Callow.  Oh, this would be awesome.  15 hours, I didn't realize the original Dracula was that long.  This is Bram Stoker's novel, dramatized.  They do this a lot, which is wonderful.  They've done it with Neil Gaiman stuff.  I think it was Neverware, they did such a great dramatization.  So look, there's going to be plenty of choices here.  I invite you to go to audible.com, browse around.  When you're ready, when you find two books, I want you to pick two books,  then go to audible.com slash twit two.  That's audible.com and twit, the number two,  because you are going to get those two books free.  You're going to sign up for the platinum account.  That's two books a month free, plus the Daily Digest  and the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.  Really great stuff if you're driving to work or you're at the gym on the treadmill.  That's nothing more boring than the treadmill, but the audible makes it fun.  In fact, it goes by like that because it's a page turner.  You want to hear the next thing.  Audible.com slash twit two, the platinum account.  The first 30 days are free. That means your first two books are free.  Cancel any time in that first 30 days, you'll pay nothing,  but the books will always be yours. They're yours to keep.  There are so many great choices. Audible.

Lena Dunham's new book, Not That Kind of Girl.  Did she read it?  Yeah, of course.  I have to say, most of the time I don't want the author to read it,  but when it's somebody like Lena Dunham.  If it's a memoir.  If it's a memoir, it's in their voice. It's great.  Oh, this is good. One more thing, stories and other stories.  This is the office folks, BJ Novak, Rainn Wilson, Jenna Fisher.

And that's all I can say.  And if you don't, well, it didn't cost you anything.  What did you lose? Nothing.  You heard some good books.  Okay. Google. Finally. Gosh.  Here we are an hour into the show.  We're finally talking about Google.  Wednesday. They didn't have an event.  They just put out a blog post. That's very Google-y.

Start time: 4104.56

Start time: 4106.44
End time: 4112.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, are they?  In New York.  What about? They're having an open house.  It's kind of like a showcase.  Come see it.

Start time: 4113.58
End time: 4119.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Don't you want to see the Shamu?  I don't care about the Nexus 9. They have a 9-inch tablet.  I couldn't care less.

Start time: 4120.12
End time: 4131.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I care only insofar as I feel like Google and HTC need to be shamed  for making the base model of the tablet only 16 gigs of memory.  Yeah, like who?  Same with the iPad.  That is not enough for a tablet.  You know why they do that.

Start time: 4131.54
End time: 4146.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  To make you spend an extra $100.  Well, they want that price point starting at to be low.  They know no one will buy it.  Unfortunately, you buy an iPad with 16 gigs.  Unfortunately, a lot of people will buy it.  You can't update to iOS 8 because they've got no free space.  I read about this today.

Start time: 4146.64
End time: 4156.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the most annoying thing with Apple's storage pricing.  iOS 8? You can't get it on a new one.  You need 5 gigs.  It's like, how could you?  Okay, okay.  Take a breath.

Start time: 4157.91
End time: 4186.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So anyway, yes, I agree with you.  Shame them.  HTC made the Nexus 9.  It'll be nice, I'm sure.  But I don't even want a tablet anymore.  I want a 6-inch phone, baby.  That's the Nexus 6.  Not priced like traditionally.  Priced like a feature high-end phone.  But what, 650, I think it's 650.  Is that the 16-gig version?  I don't know how many gigs it comes with.  They see the starting price.  It's 32 and 64.

Start time: 4188.40
End time: 4190.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's good.  For 80 bucks more, something like that, you can get the 64.

Start time: 4191.64
End time: 4203.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Does it have an SD card too?  No.  No removable battery.  It's basically a swollen Moto X, right?  Is that the new Moto X?  Yeah.  I mean, this thing is going to feel huge, right?  I mean, the 6 Plus is fine because it's super thin.

Start time: 4206.40
End time: 4217.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's a little bit too big.  It's fine because it's super thin.  But the Shamu is going to feel like a whale.  It's going to feel gigantic.  Really?

Start time: 4218.52
End time: 4232.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is.  No, yeah, it is.  Because I mean, Samsung, the Note 4, even though it's a bigger screen, they do so much  to taper the size that it really doesn't feel much bigger than the 6 Plus.  And this, I mean, at 6 inches, it's going to be gigantic.  I mean, it's enormous.

Start time: 4232.40
End time: 4242.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There are a lot of similarities between the Note 4 and the Nexus 6.  They're both Ultra HD 6.  It's almost 6 inch screens.  No stylus, of course, on the Nexus 6.  That's OK.

Start time: 4243.40
End time: 4247.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  This is basically just, this is also very similar to the, what is it, the LG G3.

Start time: 4248.20
End time: 4269.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, now the G3, people complained about that UHD screen because it was sluggish, right?  And it killed battery life.  Presumably, the Nexus 6 won't have that problem because it has a very big battery in it.  3220mAh.  And the Note 4 battery was great, too.  The Note 4 battery is good.  And the nice thing about the Note 4, as always with Samsung, you can open the back and put  a new battery in.  So just carry a battery around.  Nexus 6, also wireless charging.

Start time: 4270.44
End time: 4271.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Qi charging.  Qi.

Start time: 4272.42
End time: 4284.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Qi.  Qi.  I don't care about that.  I don't care about that because the Nexus 6 has the Qualcomm fast charging capability.  So you're probably going to want to hook it up to a wire.  Which is really nice, by the way.  Is it? Have you played with it?

Start time: 4284.91
End time: 4286.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On the Note 4 I did, yeah, quick charging.

Start time: 4287.04
End time: 4295.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So the idea is it's very quick to charge at the beginning.  It does slow down as you get to the end of the cycle.  But you get the first 50% in an hour.  50% in an hour.

Start time: 4296.40
End time: 4299.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Something like that, yeah.  Oh, in 30 minutes, I think.  30 minutes?

Start time: 4299.40
End time: 4308.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's wicked fast.  But that's mostly what you want, right?  Because you're not saying, well, I want 100%.  I just need to go a little longer.  Exactly.  Let me give this to the bartender and he'll charge it for half an hour.  Right.

Start time: 4309.40
End time: 4311.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you need the special plug.  Right.  Right.

Start time: 4312.56
End time: 4317.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It doesn't work with any plug.  Now, okay, let's ask about that.  Is it really just a high wattage charger?  That I don't know.

Start time: 4317.75
End time: 4320.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it is.  They just told me you can only use it with this charger.

Start time: 4320.40
End time: 4335.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, we'll find out because I'm going to have a Note 4 tomorrow and whenever the 6 comes  out, I'll have that.  And I'm just going to plug it into my high wattage charger.  And I bet you the same thing.  Same thing?  Yeah, it probably will be.  They're pushing more electrons at it.  I would bet.  But I don't know.

Start time: 4336.44
End time: 4338.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's also smart enough to start sipping after it gets to that.

Start time: 4338.68
End time: 4355.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was going to say, I wouldn't be surprised if they did something special maybe with the  plug or something.  Because you can usually charge a little bit faster if you use an iPad charger with your  phone.  Right.  But I have a feeling they're probably doing something to make it sip that much faster,  like Steve is saying.

Start time: 4355.70
End time: 4372.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's a little annoying because I bought the new Moto X and it doesn't come with that.  It comes with the old charger and for $30, I can buy the new charger.  But they are bundling it with the Nexus 6.  Does Samsung bundle it with the Note 4?  Yeah.  In the box.  Oh, and this is what I'll try.  I'll try the Note 4 charger on the Nexus 6 phone.

Start time: 4372.40
End time: 4385.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See, that'll be the interesting thing to see if they align it.  It's all Qualcomm technology.  Right.  But I could just see the Nexus anyway being like, no, you've got to use ours.  No, it's the other way around.  Samsung being like, you've got to use ours.

Start time: 4385.52
End time: 4423.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Samsung flipping a bit so that it doesn't quite.  Right, that's true.  They did that with the USB to go.  They just, it's a little bit different.  So you can't really use anybody else's devices with it.  All right, so Google announced a new tablet.  Okay, good.  I like the Nexus 7.  You'll get Lollipop.  That's the other thing.  They're going to ship these both, this new phone, the Nexus 6 and the Nexus 9 tablet  with the next version of Android, Android 5.0, and we learned it's Lollipop.  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  So that's good.  It's not, do you think they tried to make a deal with lifesavers like they did with Hershey's?  Lemonhead.  Lemonhead.  Laughing taffy.

Start time: 4423.62
End time: 4429.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't like that Kit Kat business.  I'm glad it was generic.  I didn't want to do an ad for a candy bar every time I mentioned the new version of Android.

Start time: 4431.50
End time: 4456.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it was weird too because it's like Nestle in the UK and then it's like Hershey and Google.  It was weird and just, yeah, so you felt like you were shilling for two different companies.  Yeah.  Now what's interesting about the Nexus 9 is it's 4 by 3, right?  So it's iPad style, which is interesting, I think, for an Android tablet.  I personally think that especially for that size, I think 4 by 3 is superior for a lot of purposes.  I do too.  So I'm actually really excited to have a 4 by 3 Android tablet.

Start time: 4456.54
End time: 4475.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We have a big enough problem getting Android apps looking decent on Android tablets bigger than the Nexus 7 in the first place.  And so to ask them to be bigger and to be on a 4 by 3 tablet, I just, I expect that it's going to just be a bummer of waiting for software.  It has always been on Android tablets.

Start time: 4475.74
End time: 4478.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This will be a good test of the scaling libraries.

Start time: 4478.40
End time: 4490.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I was going to say that's what Kevin Marks has always told me.  He's like, oh, but the scaling libraries in Android is so much better and that's why it's so much.  And I'm like, yeah, and then why do all of the tablet apps look completely terrible?  I suspect.  And no one has an answer for that.

Start time: 4490.40
End time: 4502.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I suspect it's because they don't use the scalers.  They hand code the screens and then they go, whoops, whoops, there's a new screen.  Oops.  But I don't know.  I can't pretend to know.  It's got that K1 processor.

Start time: 4504.40
End time: 4508.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, and boom sound.  This is the new Tegra.  Good old boom sound.  And to me, this is exciting.

Start time: 4508.50
End time: 4532.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You're talking about the Nexus 6 now.  On the Moto X, they put ports for two speakers, but one is the music speaker and one is the phone speaker.  They don't do stereo left, right.  They had the good sense to duplicate HTC's one and put left, right stereo speakers on the front.  That'll be the only other fun with that.  And I think that's great.  Sounds great, too.  I don't know if it'll sound like boom sound.  Boom sound is boom sound.

Start time: 4534.48
End time: 4558.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, I mean, hey, it's a six inch phone, right?  So I mean, if it's even halfway decent, if it's even got a little bit of power in it, like that actually probably wouldn't be a terrible little like mini kind of Bluetooth.  Maybe there's a subwoofer that you could add.  Yeah, I mean, you could probably pair it with something to make it sound really good.  I'm just saying it's big enough.  I'm just saying it's big enough.  It's bigger than like my jam box at that point.  My jam box mini is probably smaller than the Nexus 6.

Start time: 4559.23
End time: 4574.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Do you think this is Google's attempt?  I think it is to kind of not release a developer platform.  This was going to be the silver, right?  This is their, this is an actual product.  And Google says, no, we could sell phones.  Apple could sell phones.  We're going to sell phones.

Start time: 4575.10
End time: 4580.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but they've tried this how many times now, Leo, and they failed every single time.  The Nexus one was supposed to be a consumer product.

Start time: 4581.02
End time: 4588.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  One of the great phones, by the way, one of the great phones of all time.  But that's exactly what they did wrong.  They pissed off the carriers and it was a huge failure.

Start time: 4589.84
End time: 4603.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then they tried, you know, with a couple other things, even some of their first, I mean, they bought Motorola and then sold Motorola for scraps.  This baffles me.  So it's funny to me that they're doing this big phone and doing this product a year after they sold Motorola.

Start time: 4604.32
End time: 4612.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's also interesting that you can now go into any major carrier store and buy a Nexus phone, which you haven't been able to really do.  Right.  That's why are they doing that?

Start time: 4612.80
End time: 4627.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They've done a deal with Verizon, Sprint, AT&T, T-Mobile, US Cellular.  They're in brick and mortar stores now.  You can go to Target, you go to Best Buy.  So what I don't understand, why did they do that now?  What's different?  Is it now them saying, oh, we're sorry, carriers, we should have done a deal with you.  Now we're going to?

Start time: 4628.82
End time: 4637.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's probably they just didn't know how to do it before because they've always been like, oh, we're going to we're going to disrupt the carrier.  They didn't like the carriers.  They didn't really sell.  They didn't know how to sell consumer products.

Start time: 4639.77
End time: 4646.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's a shame because I think that they should continue to disrupt the carriers.  But they don't have the cloud.  It's not working and they don't have physical stores.

Start time: 4646.40
End time: 4651.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, people still go into physical stores a lot to check out the new phones and touch them and stuff.  You do want to do that with Nexus.

Start time: 4653.08
End time: 4661.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Although a lot of the nerds in this audience and I'll include us, but everybody watching at home will buy a Nexus six site unseen.  Of course, we trust it.  Yeah, totally.

Start time: 4661.80
End time: 4687.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But then the problem is, I mean, and you run into this even if you're a nerd, like you buy the phone and then it has a problem.  And then there's no one you can call.  Right.  Like you've got to get on the phone.  Like at this point, I guess it'll be Motorola and whoever you can talk to.  But like you've got to email somebody to like get a return set up because there's literally no phone number to call.  So I mean, that does actually become a little bit frustrating from the buying perspective.  At least this way you're able to go into a store and if it doesn't work or you've got an issue with it, you can at least physically take it back someplace.  And the carriers have that help.

And she found a phone number in Indonesia.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  You all know what's next.  She called it.  They said, well, OK, two hundred ninety nine bucks.  We'll fix this. Oh, by the way, we need remote access to your machine.  So they got her credit card number.  They got three hundred bucks.  They got access to her machine.  And then she had something else.  So she Googled it again and found somebody in Russia or somewhere.  I can't remember. Oh, Qatar.  Soccer capital of the world in Qatar.  And they charge only 50 bucks, but they also had access.  And I said, you know what?  You're done.  Just take the computer, throw it out the car window because you're gone.  It's done. Yeah.  And people. But people want to call somebody.

And I mean, you know, my father, the reason I refuse to give him tech support  anymore is he's not once, not twice, but thrice installed the fake antivirus.  Oh, yeah.  And the second time he did it, I was like, I'm done, dad.  I'm done. Like I told you to buy a Mac. You refused.  If you're going to insist on doing this, I'm not helping you anymore.  Like I'm not doing it. Like I live in another state now.  I'm not doing it. You could have bought a Mac and we would have been fine,  but you insisted on not. So you are cold.

This is  I guess a lot of pressure from the European Union.  This is why Google and Apple and others  store their money  in effect in Ireland. They have  this double Irish  tax break used often  with tax havens like  Luxembourg or the Canary Islands  to hide profits.  These companies funnel profits  over there. Dublin, for instance, has  a Google, the largest Google  headquarters outside the United States, 2,500  people.  The subsidiary  generates revenue, mostly from  online advertising, pays it in  royalties to a separate Google unit registered  in Ireland but resident in Bermuda for tax

Anyway, Google  hasn't said anything but apparently European  Union has put a lot of pressure on Ireland and  they're now really basically going to  phase that out. I bet you  the United States has something to do with that  as well. A little  tip, we have mentioned before  that the Samsung 840 EVO,  the EVO hard  drives are great hard drives, but something  weird happens with them. They slow down  over time. My friend Alan  Vantano writes for PC Perspective and is  our SSD guru,  says there is now a tool  available from Samsung for these drives  that will fix this problem.  So if you've purchased an  840 EVO SSD, get  this tool. It's free for download.  It'll be in the firmware, I'm sure,  in new SSDs  from Samsung. In fact,  don't buy the 840 because the 850 is due  out any minute now. And Alan  says it's a killer.  Good news on that.  Let's see, what else?

Transcript:  If you wanted a Chromecast or you have a Chromecast  and you use that, which I do all the time.  Chromecast is so great. This adds Chromecast capability  to the TV as well. I love Chromecast.  Just buy a Chromecast. That's my answer.

Transcript:  But then I've  hacked my fire TV.  Like I've got XPMC and Plex running on it.  What?  You can actually remarkably, it's very easy  to hack and mod. I've got like an external hard drive  connected to it. I've got Plex. I've got XPMC  on it. I've got all kinds of  little front ends. It's probably the best  XPMC box I've had in quite some time.

Start time: 6078.44

Transcript:  a Roku, but then when you add the other stuff with it,  it's like an awesome $100. It's like  everything that Uyal was supposed to be, but then like  failed miserably at. Right. So  this, I mean, I've got to say that the Nexus box  is probably a pretty good, you know,  XPMC Plex, or what is XPMC called now?  It's a Kodo or something.  They changed it, but it starts with a K.  Anyway, whatever, that and Plex,  probably is a pretty good friend for that. So,  you know, I think most people probably buy  Roku. K-O-D-I. Kodi.  But I mean, you know,  why not? Why not  try again? This is a quad core 1.8

Well, you know, that's not  enough, but maybe you can hack this too.  It's got a USB. Does it have? Yeah, it has a USB

Start time: 6133.05
End time: 6138.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Start time: 6142.48
End time: 6183.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  really simple. In fact, actually, what's cool about it  is that you can enable developer mode  and do SSH over Wi-Fi, so you don't even  have to connect it to the computer  to send APKs over.  And then you just load in a few files and a few  root commands so that you can connect an external  hard drive to it and do some other stuff.  And then I can literally just fling stuff from my  computer to the box. I don't even  have to connect it. And then once I had  it set up, like I just had a small little portable,  you know, USB hard drive that I had connected.  But you could even use like  a thumb drive, actually. I mean, that'd be great.  And I mean, I should write it up  actually. That's probably something I should write up from  Mashable. It's how to, you know, hack your fire  TV because it took me,  you know, only a couple hours in an afternoon  to completely trick it out.

Start time: 6196.42
End time: 6212.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you root it. Yeah, super simple. You root it.  I mean, the thing is you don't even really have to root it. You like  enable developer mode and  enable advanced, you know, advanced  settings, like in the settings on the fire  TV. That's all you really have to do.  And then you can connect remotely  over Wi-Fi. It's very similar

Start time: 6212.88
End time: 6216.40

Start time: 6264.46
End time: 6299.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  check. So the idea is if the  actually the way they've implemented is quite clever.  If you have a Facebook app on your phone,  it knows your location. If  it says, hey, wait a minute, there was a big earthquake  in that area, it will then pop  up a message on your phone saying. It pushes it right  out to you, right? Yeah, it pushes it to you. It says, do you want to alert  your friends? Are you OK?  You can push I'm safe or I'm not in the area.  And then I guess it will do it in a status  update. I'm not sure, but it will let your  friends and family know. It will also  allow you to mark your friends as safe.  So you can say, I know everybody  here is OK. I think that is actually  a good use of Facebook. Yeah.  Yeah. Safety check.

Start time: 6301.41
End time: 6304.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So there's no answer for no.  Are you safe? I'm safe

Start time: 6304.58
End time: 6313.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  or I'm not in the area. If you're not safe, I imagine you've  got better concerns.  You probably aren't responding.  Yeah. That's an interesting thing.  Yeah, they need something like I'm OK, but I don't have

Start time: 6314.48
End time: 6318.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 6318.74
End time: 6339.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or at least a link to like contact authorities.  Right. Yeah. Actually, we should make  actually be. No, but that could be  interesting. Think about it like if you maybe like Facebook  pushes something to you, maybe you're in a position  where you can't reach out. Maybe Facebook would be able  to like send if you authorize it,  of course, send stuff out to, you know, first responders  and whatnot and say, hey, we know that this person  or these people in this location are  in need of some assistance.

Start time: 6340.40
End time: 6348.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Actually, I shouldn't be so flippant about  this because this is, I think,  the 25th anniversary of  the Great Earthquake of 1989.  Yeah.

Start time: 6350.54
End time: 6352.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Start time: 6352.40
End time: 6378.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I was there. I was at Candlestick Park when that happened.  But there were some other  people in our business who were not in  such a safe place.  John Anderson and  Derek von Alstein, who were  writers for Mac user  magazine, were caught  in the earthquake. A brick wall tumbled  on them and both were killed.  And it's probably good for us to  mention that it was 25 years ago,  October 17th, that that happened.

Start time: 6378.72
End time: 6384.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they had a, not a memorial,  but something this  week for it, right? Yeah, I think so.

Start time: 6384.48
End time: 6425.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Fred Davis, who was the editor of Mac user at the time,  posted on Facebook. That's what alerted  me to it.  They were,  they were,  John was a great guy. They were really  fun, exciting,  young guys, kind of your age,  getting into the business. And  it was a great tragedy. And not many people,  not a whole lot of people died  in that earthquake. But  those are two who we really will  miss. So that's 25  years ago today. And now you could just  say on Facebook, I'm OK.  We didn't have it then.  Hey, I'm going to, on that  brightenship, I'm going to wrap  and anything else? Did I leave  anything out you guys wanted to talk about?

Transcript:  I kind of want to loop back to iPads for a second because  tomorrow Apple's  reporting earnings and we get to see how the  iPad business is doing. And it's been kind of something.

Start time: 6435.51
End time: 6446.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's been two quarters  now for two quarters. Will it be down  for a third? I bet you it will. I bet it  will be. Yeah, for sure. And I have to think  the 6 Plus will continue that trend.  Why do you need an iPad for?

Start time: 6446.56
End time: 6482.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly. I think the 6 Plus will. But I think that the  iPad Air 2 is a good  enough upgrade that a lot of people who have iPad  2s will probably be saying, you know,  the touch ID, the faster stuff, the better camera,  the thinner body, the, you know,  the glare resistant screen. I've  had this iPad 2 for three years now. I might  as well go ahead and upgrade. So they might  end up getting a good upgrade  cycle. But I think that, yeah, I mean, I think we'd  all, all of us had underestimated.  A, we all first didn't think the iPad would be  as successful as it was. I was bullish  on it, but I wasn't expecting it to be what it  was. And then I think we all  overestimated how  frequently people would update these things.

Start time: 6482.44
End time: 6515.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right. What do you think the cycle is?  Three years? Four years? At least three.  I think it's probably two. Easily four. Two and a half, three.  It's an expensive thing. People don't have  an unlimited budget to buy phones  and tablets and computers.  And I think the  iPad 3 is good enough.  If you have a retina, anything, you're  fine. Touch ID is not going to push you in.  Thinner is not going to push you in.  A faster processor is not going to push you in.  So a lot of people without retina, it's anybody  who doesn't have retina yet,  probably should look. And you probably shouldn't get  a mini. No.  Oh, you get last year's mini.

Start time: 6516.50
End time: 6582.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Last year's mini, you can get a great price. But it's interesting that they're still selling the mini from  two years ago because at this point,  it's the same guts as the iPad 2.  And my friend Alan Pike wrote a really  interesting blog post about developers.  Basically, it's kind of saying that developers  now are basically going to be expected to support  the iPad 2 at least  through 2017. And  that's kind of putting them in a weird  position when it comes to games and some other things because  the hardware just isn't keeping up.  But I think until it gets to the point where  the iPad 1 reached it really early because it only had  256 MB of RAM and  it's a first gen product,  until it gets to the point that it's  really slow for people. Most people who have  an iPad, they use it for web browsing,  use it for games, use it for Facebook.  You kind of don't  need to upgrade. It's nice  to have the better screen. It's nice to have maybe the  Touch ID or the other stuff. But for a lot  of people, it does exactly what they need it to do.  And it's not significantly slower or  worse than it was before. So until  it gets to that point where it's really just kind of  crawling, which happens with  the phones, a lot of people  aren't going to need to have that itch  to upgrade to a new tablet. There's still a lot of

Start time: 6582.40
End time: 6585.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  iPad 2s up there. My mom still uses them.  They only stopped selling them six months ago.

Start time: 6586.40
End time: 6589.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's what I'm saying. And the guts are the same on the iPad  Mini, which they're still going to sell.

Start time: 6592.48
End time: 6612.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they've sold a ton of those to education.  And so, yeah, I think that you're probably right.  It's probably one of those things where  three, four years as an upgrade  cycle, which is, you know, two  and a half times as long as maybe a phone  cycle. And  yeah, so I mean, I think that's probably  why the business is slowing primarily. People just  don't need to replace them this frequently.
