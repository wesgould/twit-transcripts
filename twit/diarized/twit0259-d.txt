End time: 217.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So I'm digging around the closet trying to clean out the place and I found this hat.  But more importantly, and I'm putting this up for auction, ladies and gentlemen, and I  couldn't believe I even had it.  A Bob Frisbee.  Wow.

Start time: 219.31

Start time: 221.70
End time: 246.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'm thinking more.  Do you think there's a marketplace for Bob?  For Bob memorabilia?  Yeah.  No.  No.  That's unfortunate.  Who would want that?  I don't know.  I think the hat would be good.  What about that paperclip guy?  That hat, by the way, is the hat that Steven Spielberg, not this exact one, but he wore  a Bob hat when they rolled out the first announcement for DreamWorks.  Oh, wow.  Spielberg had a Bob hat on.

Start time: 246.14

Start time: 273.84
End time: 282.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really?  Oh, yeah.  I was dragged into duties, extraordinary circumstances called for the activation of my services as  co-producer of this week's show.

Start time: 283.00
End time: 289.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think you're the official runner up.  So if I'm unable to perform my duties, you step in.  He's the vice Leo.

Start time: 290.36
End time: 296.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you wreck it.  As long as I get a gun, I'm happy.  You get a gun?  Yeah.  All right.

Start time: 296.84
End time: 311.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Things can go crazy.  You never know.  So Baratunde actually did some work prepping for this show and since he's the only one  who did, we're going to deputize him and let him start.  But we were talking before the show began, we were talking about something.  Well, you know about photo bombing, right?  Photo bombing, everybody knows about.

Start time: 311.56
End time: 313.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just heard that out of your mouth for the first time right now.

Start time: 313.56
End time: 321.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I don't know if it's like a Google bombing thing or the whole jumping in the background  and ruining other people's.  It's the jumping in the background.  Exactly.  Yeah, messing up other people's photos.

Start time: 321.86
End time: 340.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  So there's a new photo bombing where you take a photo bomb.  Photo bomb is like there's a cute couple posing for the picture and then a waitress in the  back going, ah!  And you don't know that it happened until you go home and you look at your pictures  and go, oh, this is ruined by that waitress.  But digital cameras ruin that because now you know right away.

Start time: 341.46
End time: 344.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true.  But digital editing software solves it because we have Photoshop now.

Start time: 345.10
End time: 361.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Photoshop, well, it's Photoshop bombing.  I think this is what's happened now.  So this is a meme that is now making the rounds where you take a photo bomb and instead of  editing out the bad, you take the funny face and you put it on everybody's face.

Start time: 364.53
End time: 366.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, I smell an NSFW episode here.

Start time: 367.20
End time: 373.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think this is the kind of thing you do on NSFW.  And then do you do it in real time, though?  You ask people to submit theirs.

Start time: 373.26
End time: 377.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  No, we unleash the demon hordes of the Internet and it's amazing what they can accomplish  in no time.

Start time: 378.76
End time: 380.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So go to thisisfotobomb.com.

Start time: 381.90

Transcript:  Thisisfotobomb.com?

Start time: 383.08
End time: 396.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, and go down to, let's see, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven photos down  and you'll see a classic example of what we're talking about.  OK.  It's the guy with the sunglasses and somebody behind him.

Start time: 397.56
End time: 410.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  Well, it looks like it's Baratunde, but that's because I haven't pressed the button.  All right, here's the guy.  It looks he's wearing sunglasses.  But behind him, I think the woman there seems to be a guy's gut.

Start time: 412.72
End time: 418.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's horrifying.  So that's I'm scared.

Start time: 418.28
End time: 441.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's not a new meme.  That's the old meme.  Now we got we got this funny.  It's very fun, but it's still the best.  Well, it's good to explain what photobombing is so that I'm trying to find.  I was looking at this all day all day this morning and it was so funny and now I can't  find it.  It's where you Photoshop the photobomb.  Somebody will send me a chat room link, right?  Yeah, the demon hordes.

Start time: 442.20
End time: 448.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is lying, right?  We're just we're calling it photobombing, but it's lying, right?  That's what we're doing.  It's the next.  Yeah.

Start time: 448.64
End time: 457.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's the next stage.  photobomb and then you add other people's you take the bad picture and you put you spread  it throughout.

Start time: 457.66
End time: 461.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Is it like man babies?  Remember that man babies.com?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.

Start time: 462.79
End time: 468.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's exactly like man babies.  But I can't now I can't find the link.  So I'm sorry.

Start time: 468.94
End time: 471.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I even brought it.  Well, there we go.  The whole segment goes down the.

Start time: 471.80
End time: 482.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is wrong with that?  That didn't take long.  Yeah.  And you know what?  Part of me hopes that this was all just a big mistake and it was something that Leo  dreamed and we start right now.  Wouldn't that be good?

Start time: 482.68
End time: 494.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It could be.  It could be.  I just dreamed it.  No, I was looking at it.  You know what?  It'll probably be on here.  I was looking at it on my pooter.  My iPad.  I'm sorry.  Excuse me.  This was a dream.

Start time: 494.70
End time: 497.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My pooter had it.  OK, I'm sorry.  I even brought it up.

Start time: 498.14
End time: 509.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, what happened to the unofficial guy who's supposed to keep track of things here?  Would you step in, Deputy Dan, and fix this show?

Start time: 510.72
End time: 545.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's get the show actually started.  Big story.  We're going to write that segment off.  Let's get a big story.  As sort of an audio-video test phase of the show.  And why don't we start off.  Actually, this is a pretty interesting story.  Clive Thompson, the great writer who does work with Wired and also some other magazines,  had a story about how no one's making phone calls anymore.  The incredible shrinking cell phone bill.  Through his studies, especially of younger people, it's something we've all sort of anecdotally  probably observed, but minutes of use per cell phone user as tracked by the official  sources are actually declining.  Does this surprise anybody?

Start time: 546.52
End time: 551.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anybody at all?  I mean, doesn't everybody text now?  Felicia, you probably don't make phone calls anymore, do you?

Start time: 552.16
End time: 565.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I actually hate phone calls more than anything.  I have kind of a phone phobia.  So if there's any way that I can avoid speaking to somebody, I mean, I literally, if somebody  calls me and I'm not expecting it, it's like somebody's showing up on my doorstep.  It's so invasive to me.

Start time: 566.16
End time: 570.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't want to talk to somebody on the phone.  But see, me, I don't want to make a phone call.

Start time: 571.47
End time: 573.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Leo, you don't want to talk to anybody.

Start time: 573.14
End time: 584.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's true.  And you know why after that last segment, you know why.  I'm embarrassed that I'm so goofy.  I'm so messed up.  Are you shy, Felicia?  Are you shy?  Is that what's going on?

Start time: 584.98
End time: 604.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I mean, I just don't like things that are unexpected.  So yeah, I don't like, generally phone calls are something, somebody wanting something  or like business or, you know, I love my mom, but sometimes she wants to talk about like  the steaks that are on sale at Target for like an hour and I don't have time for that.

Start time: 605.04
End time: 617.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They sell steak at Target?  Yeah, they do.  They sell everything at Target.  Really?  Are they good steaks?  Yeah.  I'm not sure we don't have one in LA.  We only have the tinier ones.  Would you have your mom call me?  I'd like to know more.

Start time: 618.42
End time: 661.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this point that you raised, Felicia, about, you know, you don't want, people want  something and I think like we're used to such asymmetric communication.  Like a text is not that distracting because you don't have to engage with it when it comes  in.  Same with an email.  To some extent, even with an instant message, that's not necessarily synchronous.  You can pretend you're not there and kind of let the conversation go, walk away from  your computer.  But a phone call is this sort of old school, like I want your time.  I want it right now.  I don't care what you're doing.  What Clive talks about in the article is that there's no presence detection.  People don't know if you're busy or not.  So someone just calling you out of the blue, you could be in the middle of something very  important.  There's no status associated with phone availability the same way there is with these other communications.

Start time: 661.44
End time: 668.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This reminds me of the discovery that people must have made when the phone was first invented.  It's like, what is this thing ringing in my living room?  I don't want it there.

Start time: 669.04
End time: 695.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think the novelty early on made it clearly the best mode of communication compared  to Pony Express.  What I like most about the article is the asymmetry allows certain things.  For example, you sound smarter when you send a text message because you get to rewrite  it four or five times and you get to make sure you say exactly what you want and exactly  the right amount of words.  And you have, by its very nature, it's acceptable to get it, as you mentioned, either 30 seconds  or five minutes or even hours away.  I think text.

Start time: 696.16
End time: 698.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you sound dumber when you spell your, you are?

Start time: 699.84
End time: 716.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I think I can't handle it, man.  When everyone sends me like, shortened, you are, letter U, letter R, it's like, I will  rewrite, I write in complete sentences using proper punctuation and I just can't not do  it and I don't know why.  That's kind of encouraged self-centeredness, doesn't it?

Start time: 716.84
End time: 722.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Because it's like, we're going to communicate on our own terms and not really care about  what the other person needs or wants from us.  I mean, that basically, right?

Start time: 723.08
End time: 726.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we've just proven that this entire panel is intensely neurotic.

Start time: 726.64
End time: 737.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'm not buying into any of it.  I think these guys are just...  Self-absorbed.  Self-absorbed and neurotic.  And neurotic, demanding.  Yeah.  But if you think about it...

Start time: 737.60
End time: 745.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  There's so many ways that people can get to you.  I mean, there's just no solitude anymore.  So I don't know, I kind of look at it like that.

Start time: 745.18
End time: 756.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You know, I look at my caller ID and I say, do I want to take this call?  No.  And so I just don't answer the phone.  And if I do answer the phone, I'm curt and terse.  You can do that too, you know.

Start time: 756.56
End time: 768.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But don't people...  Why are you calling me?  Yeah, actually, John invented this.  You can call John...  You didn't have an answering machine.  Oh, I still don't.  So if you call John, it rings.  And that's all.

Start time: 768.94
End time: 769.56
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's it.

Start time: 769.82
End time: 775.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like he has a phone and he puts them...  You invented this, John.  What am I talking about?  This is your...

Start time: 776.19
End time: 792.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's philosophical.  Let me give you a backstory because this actually began when these little...  You used to buy these voice answering machines and they used to play tapes.  And for a while, you had a few of your friends do these cute tapes that were kind of little  plays or crazy things.  Oh, I hated that.  They would go on for hours.

Start time: 792.82
End time: 794.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nobody's home.  Nobody's home.

Start time: 794.78
End time: 798.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Nobody's home.  Nobody's home.  Stuff like that.  Only not quite that lame.

Start time: 799.04
End time: 800.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was better than most of them, I thought.

Start time: 801.36
End time: 823.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, maybe.  So anyway, what happens is that I was traveling a lot during this era and then I'd come back  and there'd be 95 phone calls backed up.  And then I had one or two guys chew me out.  Why didn't you return my call?  And so what I noticed is that if you don't pick up at all, in other words, the phone  just rings forever, nobody gets mad at you.  It's their responsibility.

Start time: 823.44
End time: 826.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Felicia, you should try this.  This is a new thing you could do.  Just don't answer.

Start time: 827.56
End time: 829.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I don't ever answer the phone.  And take off the voicemail.

Start time: 829.98
End time: 833.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  She's already doing it, apparently.  No, but she has voicemail.  See, there's your mistake.  Voicemail is no good.

Start time: 834.04
End time: 836.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because voicemail, they think they reached you.

Start time: 836.74
End time: 844.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, but it's like a pit.  It's a vast pit.  So people know after a while that if they leave a message, they'll get me 20 times faster  if they just email me or text me.

Start time: 844.56
End time: 860.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How long before I think we're going to see a movement in this country of resisters who  don't have...  I'm the first.  You don't have Facebook.  You don't have Twitter.  You don't have voicemail.  You don't even have email.  We're going to see people who are going to turn away from all this technology because  it's overloading us.

Start time: 861.52
End time: 875.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to go out on a limb and say you're in a different position than most of America.  Most people don't have that problem?  Most people are not inundated with thousands of requests for their attention every single  day.  Just me and Felicia.  Some people are looking for their call from the job that you're looking for.

Start time: 875.14
End time: 876.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some people want to get calls.  Is that what you're saying?

Start time: 877.12
End time: 880.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like meanwhile, I'm about tempted to give out my public cell phone number right  now.

Start time: 880.70

Transcript:  That's what's weird about the fact that...  Go ahead, Baratunde.  Here's my key question about this, because I got the original iPhone and jail broke it  to work on T-Mobile, so I didn't break my plan and I loved it.  I had Syria apps running.  It tasted like freedom and I like freedom.  Tastes like freedom.  But I also ironically felt like a fugitive because I was running week to week, month  to month in fear of the latest software update.  So I'm kind of like sniffing around.  I don't want to have my phone on jailbroken by Apple's latest push.  Does this new ruling that jailbreaking is legal now prevent Apple from undoing your  jailbreak in its latest software updates?  Are they still going to have that practice of sabotaging your phone at their own whim?

We got a very unusual access to the assembly line floor.  We actually went down in the assembly.  I rode the conveyor belt.  Robots?  The guy screwed a bolt right into my...  But no, I rode the conveyor belt.  It's really cool.  It's really fun.  It was a beautiful factory.  It's the F-150 truck factory.  And then we went to the test track.  And he took me for a ride.  I actually screamed like a girl.  I screamed like a girl.  He took me for a ride in the Cobra.  And then they said, okay, here's the Flex.  You want to try this auto-park.  Well, it's not auto-park.  It's assisted parking.  But you thought it was auto-park.  I thought it was automatic.  So they said, just take your hands off the wheel.  They didn't mention keep your foot on the brake.  Oh, that's funny.  Oh, no.  So you drive by a parking...  You've tried this before.  So you drive by a parking space.  And the thing beeps at you saying...  First, you have to press a button that says, I want a parking space.  As you're driving...  Because the Flex is a big vehicle.  So it's a perfect thing for the Flex.  So you're driving by.  And it goes beep.  That space is big enough.  Now, they had set this up on the test track.  They had cars in front of me, cars in back of me.  They made it really tough.  And they said, now watch.  It parks itself.  So they said, take your hands off the wheel.  Press the button.  And the wheels go...  And it's parking me.  Except you're supposed to keep your foot on the brake because you're supposed to stop when you get to the parking space.  And I didn't.  And there's video of this, unfortunately.  So what you're saying is that it's almost idiot-proof.

And there's people in the Fiesta.  There's actually engineers laughing in the back in the Fiesta.  And I hit it hard.  And I thought, oh, this is a big car with a big bumper.  I felt so terrible.  I thought, oh my God, they're going to...  I mean, I'm so embarrassed.  And I got out and this is all on video.  Not a scratch on the Fiesta.  Not a scratch on the Flex.  So actually it was a pretty good test.  Thank God.  I don't know.  So the Fiesta is a brand new design from Ford, the most fuel-efficient compact car out there.  EPA estimated, get ready for this, is not a hybrid.  This is a gas car, 40 miles to the gallon.  Amazing engine in the 2011 Fiesta.  It's the 1.6 liter Duratec.  A lot of initials here.

Transcript:  It's the backlight.  It gives me like really dry eyes.  I notice if I wake up the next morning and I've been reading a book on that versus being  able to read.  And I also read more like a page versus like skimming a website.  I'll, I noticed myself skimming more if I'm reading a book on the Kindle.

End time: 2471.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's what, it's funny because that's the ironic thing is I always thought the Kindle  was bad for skimming.  It's good for very linear reading, but bad for newspapers or anything you would want  to scan.  But you think it's better for scanning.

Transcript:  They have to be in a race for that magic $99 moment where if they can hit that number, and  especially if they can get to the point where you could join a book of the month club and  get a Kindle for free, then it becomes like the book to read things on, the object to  read books on.

Start time: 2528.76
End time: 2547.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wasn't though that what we were debating was what is the cost of the Kindle to make?  And would they be able to sell it that cheaply?  And I guess that's the answer is that even if they're losing money at $139, they make  money on the books.  And at this point, they're in a fight to the death with Apple.  Well, it seems like...  And Barnes & Noble.  No.  No?  You don't think so?

Start time: 2548.21
End time: 2574.60

Transcript:  Nah.  I don't think that...  I mean, you know, it's like I did the last Cranky Geeks a week or so ago with this one  of our tech guys who owns everything.  And it was about the Kmart thing.  I realized that there's a bunch of people out there.  It's not like I was zero sum game with this gear.  He says, oh yeah, no, I've got an iPad, but I'm going to get that Kmart 159 thing.  He's going to have two or three of these.  So they're like Felicia.  They have both.  Perfect example.  You have every phone.  I mean, nobody's as extreme as you are.

End time: 2589.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But you're close enough to it.  I mean, if it wasn't your business, you'd still have a couple of more devices than the  one lone device.  And so I think a lot of iPad users will have a Kindle.  Why not?  The new one's only eight ounces or so.  It's really light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  iPad users will get a Kindle if...  If it's 99 bucks.  Well, not even price, but if the Kindle does exactly one thing and does it better than  anyone else.  iPad is its own device because it does a million things.  And yes, you can read books using the Kindle app on an iPad.  But what Kindle needs to do is not add any more functionality.  It needs to focus on being slimmer and lighter and more durable and cheaper.  And once it does it, it wins the branding battle.  And when I say electronic books, only one word comes to your mind and that's Kindle.

Start time: 2618.46
End time: 2662.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I would add to that, first of all, brilliant analysis, Shwood.  I love you, Baratunde.  Really.  Secondly...  There's no more words to be said about this.  But I will add words because I do love the sound of my voice.  It's just the analogy to camera phones versus digital cameras is great.  I mean, for many people, the camera phone is becoming good enough and even more than  good enough with being able to shoot HD video.  But there's still people who carry dedicated Canon or Kodak or whatever they have  because they want a device that nails one function really well.  So your list of things that Amazon needs to do is also keep their catalog the best  possible, largest, most diverse catalog out there because there's still so many books  in the Kindle library that are not yet available in the iBooks library.

Start time: 2662.60
End time: 2695.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yes, it's so frustrating if I want to discover a new series and they have number three on  the Kindle and not number one and two.  And I generally, I basically won't read that series because I'm like, guys, have the first  one at least.  And then maybe I'll be more inclined if I really love the book to buy a physical copy  of the third one.  But if I don't have the first one right there at my fingertips, I'm probably going to just  forget.  And the problem with it is also if you request something on Kindle, I feel like Amazon should  collect those or you should be able to save it to a bin.  There's no feedback loop there.  Yeah.  So they'll tell you when it's actually available.

Start time: 2696.60
End time: 2710.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, actually, they do something very smart.  In a lot of cases where there's a trilogy, they give away the first book on the trilogy,  knowing that you're going to be buying two and three.  Wow, that's very clever.  Isn't that smart?  I didn't even know they did that.  It is awesome.  There are quite a few at least sci-fi trilogies where the first book is free.

Start time: 2710.76

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I got some behind the scenes experience with the Kindle because for like, it must  have been eight years ago, I published a book called The Professional's Guide to Fire-Eating.  And the idea was that it would be the one book that if anyone wanted to eat fire, they  would buy it.  And I priced it.

Start time: 2724.66

Start time: 2731.92
End time: 2784.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But when I put the book out, I made it the most expensive book on the subject out there  because the idea being that nobody's going to say, I want to eat fire and I want to spend  as little money as possible learning how to do it.  That's true.  So I put it out at-  That comes up all the time, doesn't it?  Yeah, right?  So I put it out for $39.95 and just like three days ago, I was like, well, let me put it  out on the Kindle.  Let me see what we do.  So I uploaded the PDF, did the whole process and I got to the end and it said, it had this  little question.  It was like, would you rather make 35% commission on these or 70% commission on these?  And how do you get 70?  I was like, well, that's dumb.  I want 70, duh.  And so I click on it and then it says, okay, what price do you want to charge?  I was like, well, it's an ebook and it's going to be DRM'd.  I don't feel like I should charge full price.  I tell you what, I'll give a break.  I'll incentivize it.  So I'll do 20 bucks.  you said you wanted 70%, which means the most you can charge is 9.99.

Start time: 2786.43
End time: 2792.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, this is how Amazon does it now.  Because the publishers really resisted this forced pricing.  So the way they do it is they commission you higher.

Start time: 2792.87
End time: 2820.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  So I'm trying a short term experiment.  Like the book genuinely, and I reserve the right to yank the book at any given time.  But for the moment, like I'm going to put it out for 9.99 and see what happens.  But as a professional's guide to fire eating on Kindle.  And I finally bought it myself on my iPad.  And I was a little disappointed because the PDF formatting is all jacked up.  I'm trying to fix that.  But for the moment, limited time, it's still I'm going to have it up there for 10 bucks and see what happens.

Transcript:  I use it at the.  It's not that you're going to use 3G a lot, but it's those unpredictable moments when  you just finish a book.  You can't predict where you're going to be and if Wi-Fi is going to be available at that  point.  So you could try to build cues in these like discrete moments.  Okay, I'm at home.  Let me do my book shopping before I leave town for the weekend or go on this flight  or whatever.  But it's those little in-between moments.  Even if there's like a few times a year where like, oh, I should have just maybe sprung  with the extra 50.  Then I wouldn't have this irritation feeling.  And have this irritation factor.

Transcript:  I should disclose that a good friend of mine is the founder of this company.  So everybody listening should realize that I have some interest in his success  because maybe he'll buy me lunch.  Already working on how to be a founder.  But essentially, I'm not...  The concept behind Snapgoods, Crunch Gear wrote it up.  So this is all public, but it's kind of like a zip car for your stuff.  I think their motto is something like own less, do more.  And it's somewhat related to what Neighbor Goods does  and that you can loan out your stuff for a daily or weekly or even monthly rate.  If you have an iron board, a mop, cooking equipment, an immersion cooker.  Like there are things that not everybody needs to own.  Just as zip car has done with cars.  We don't all necessarily need cars.  We do occasionally need to use a car.  So can we tap into our very, very local communities  with a lot of verification and trust behind it  and loan out our stuff and make a little bit of money  or borrow things from other people in what they're calling this access economy.  They're trying to build this not just for peer-to-peer,  but also for marketers to be able to use so that companies...  Imagine if you could try an iPad.  That might not be the best example, but some other device you're just not sure about.  Other than the 14-day return policy,  there's not a great way for people to experience these newer and newer technologies  without risking hundreds or even thousands of dollars.  So if you could pay five or ten bucks a day  to try out this iPad or Chrome pad, would that be worth it?  Then to convert that into a sale, you might have more loyal customers  really understand what they're thinking.

Transcript:  They're using a deposit system right now.  They don't have insurance built in yet.  It's such a new service.  They don't know the actuarial math behind all these different goods that are in the system.  So essentially, people put a deposit in escrow against any damages that might happen.  And so if someone breaks your phone while it's on loan out,  then you get their deposit.  And you just set that price as something that would probably be close to the replacement cost  of whatever it is.

No, I think the key difference, I mean, they're both in the same space  in terms of neighbors sharing things with other neighbors.  The twist that I understand from SnapGoods is that they're also going after  actual companies with goods to sell.  So there might be new items.  They buy all products, not just to try things that people already own.  So that's one difference.

The premise is one of our satellites has wormhole technology,  which allows us to pull in news segments from 127 years into the future.  It's a really dark world  where the United States isn't really anymore.  California is run by robots.

Yeah, and the great thing is that  they really let us make our show.  They really don't impose their...  It's not like branded entertainment  is what I'm saying.  Because a lot of web video is going the way of  basically an extended narrative commercial.  And I feel like that doesn't really push  the medium forward in a way that  allows the most creative...  There's some really good  branded entertainment shows out there, but they're  definitely two different sides of the  pyramid coin.

There were volunteers  who volunteer and they escort us  to the panel room, to the  signing, through the crowds.  And a woman accompanied me and in the middle  of it running, I was like, I gotta pee.  So this woman takes me to the bathroom  and then we go  back and then the next day when I get  home, I get an email saying, hey, we're not allowed  to do this during the hours, but  I just want to say I'm a huge fan of yours, Gina

She helped us to their Comic Con booth.  I saw her fleetingly this year, but it  was just like, I wish you told me then because I'm a huge fan of you.  Oh, that's really neat.

Like, I know in Cataclysm, they're doing a bunch of  quests for goblins where you're essentially  going on like frat boy beer runs and that kind of thing.  Really? Yeah, yeah, they change all the names,  but it's very clever.

Start time: 4097.76
End time: 4142.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They just got it patented for no good reason.  Just in case.  What do you think they're going to do with it?  Well, I know what they're going to say they're going to do with it  and I think what they're going to do with it initially.  Google's approach  to things is they have a lot of  they're well intentioned.  In this case, they're going to  put the mouse tracker on you.  As you're tracking around on a page, they can say,  well, that's interesting.  With the placement of the button down in the lower  left, it's like that eyeball tracking software.  But you have to bring somebody in to do that.  This way they can do it remotely. They can kind of figure  out what you're more likely  what part of this page you're more likely to click  on, what you're more attracted to  and all that sort of thing and what you actually do  click on.  It all goes into the big giant database in the sky so they can  figure out how to sell you more

Start time: 4143.96
End time: 4181.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  crap. I'd hate to say it, but this is the  kind of thing they do to great  result in video games. Valve had  people when they were doing Half Life 2, they  would have them play through the entire game and they would  notice sections of the games where people  would go like a minute at a time without  jumping. They would  add in something to jump over so that you were  doing as many different things for as long as  you could so you got a very engaging  experience where you were always moving in  all these different ways. I  could see applying a similar idea to  layout, to search  results, that kind of thing.  Now that I think about it, I really  do tend to mouse over whatever  I'm looking at at all times.

Start time: 4181.60
End time: 4189.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just going to point out, all they've done is apply  for a patent. They probably have been  doing this. You don't have to patent it to do it.  They just want to protect it. They just realize

Transcript:  When I first signed up for YouTube, I got one of those director  accounts where you could go as long as you wanted.  And everyone's saying like that was a limited time deal.  Did that go away altogether? Can you still get those?  We have a director's account. Director accounts

Start time: 4441.70

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  still exist. Most people don't sign  up for that. The average consumer account, if you sign  up as a musician, comedian, these  other sort of account labels they have, they've  had this 10-minute limit for years.  And the thing I found  actually interesting about the story is I thought that was  their sort of way to manage storage.  And Google obviously has access to a lot of storage  but video is huge and people are uploading  larger HD type files.  Within their blog post, what it really comes down  to is their fingerprinting copyright  detection technology. Oh, isn't that interesting.  And the 10-minute limit was really about  making it less practical for people to upload  television shows and  movie content.  They were able to go to 15 because they basically  got a lot more support from the official  copyright holding industry  with the fact that they were able to digitally fingerprint  and do the, I forgot the name of the  technology that they're using. I'll try to  figure it out pretty quickly. But essentially it allows  content owners to be flagged  when it looks like their content is uploaded  to an account not run by them. And then you can claim  it and throw ads against it, etc.  So they perfected that so now we can go from 10  to 15.  That's great news. Well that would be good because now I

It's my opinion that, well I just aired  something, well I guess  it's from The Onion, they're probably not going to get  complaints, but we frequently put clips in  like that. Right. And from other  sources. It's a news show. So you put in a clip  as a news coverage, that's fair use in my  limited knowledge of the law. It is fair

Transcript:  use. That's what I think. Well I ran into the same  thing. I do a lecture, a skeptic lecture called  Scam Sasquatch and the Supernatural, which is all  about debunking pseudoscience and the  paranormal. And in the whole lecture, there's  a 60 second clip  where to explain the concept of cold reading,  which fraudulent psychics use to make it look like  they're talking to dead relatives, I play  a clip of South Park's explanation  of it. And it sat there  for years and years and then out of nowhere, like that section  of the lecture just got yanked  because of a claim from Viacom.

Transcript:  Really? Yeah. That's  not generally how we do things.  So I'm going to actually look into that. Basically,  what YouTube allows content people to do  instead of looking like  douchebags and pulling things is  flag it and claim the video.  Because we're not really interested in pulling  journalistic references. There are a lot of people who will  take the iTunes file that's in our  podcast feed. Yeah, yeah.  I wasn't stealing it. In fact, I'm sure I sent

But that's also kind of an  interesting problem if basically  something's done kind of in our name  without us being notified of it.  That's not a great system either because  we can't control our public action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Well, here's what their blog  post says about the 10 minute things. We spend  significant resources on creating and improving  our state of the art content ID system  and many other powerful tools for  copyright owners. Now, all the major  U.S. movie studios, music  labels, and over a thousand other global partners  use content ID to manage their content on  YouTube. Because of the success of these  ongoing technological efforts,  we're able to increase the upload limit today.  So that's all it has to do  with is the fact that content ID is more accepted  by people who hold copyrights

Start time: 4681.80
End time: 4733.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to major podcasts. I think the content ID is great.  I mean, that, you know, first of all,  Facebook got a great, Facebook, Google,  and YouTube got a great decision in the  Viacom case where the judge ruled...  Hell, go Internet. Yeah.  So they were protected by the safe harbor provisions  of the DMCA that they do have an effective  takedown procedure. They do have this  very effective content recognition system.  So the judge ruled, well, they're doing everything  they need to do. They are not a publisher.  They're a common carrier.  And I think that that's important. But  you know, if some stuff gets pulled  off, mine gets pulled off YouTube,  so be it. It's not it's not our chief  distribution medium. Hey, here's some good news.  The billionth tweet.  I'm sorry. Did I say?  Was that good news? The 28 billionth  the 20 billionth tweet. Would you like to see it?  No.  Is it safe for Twitter?  I don't know. It could be. It might not be.  Go, go, go, go, go.

In a way, I'm not  thrilled about it, to be honest, because I think in some  ways it's a regressive device.  As much as I think it's a great device,  it is not a content creation device.

Transcript:  Flipbook. Oh, yeah, that thing is great.  I have some comments about... Flipboard  is what it's called? Right, that too.  So, here's... I have  to throw this in because I have not yet read  much criticism of some pretty  outlandish statements that their  president or CEO has been saying.  They do this really cool thing with your tweets  and your Facebooks to make it visually stimulating  and pull the pictures. But what they're doing with  publisher content  seems very like 1990s  scraping, republishing  stuff that I thought we had sort of moved  past in the age of the internet. So, they're taking  not just the RSS feed, but I think using  readability to pull multiple  paragraphs of content and so restyling  people's stuff. And what he says, the  president, is that they're going  to sell ads against this  and then share that ad revenue with publishers.  Oh, thanks. Isn't that nice of you?  To be able to do so at 10  times the rate publishers can get on  their own, which I believe is  based on nothing.  And I haven't been able to find any publishers who  can say like, oh yeah, we've been talking to Flipbook  and they've proven they can get...  They haven't sold a single ad yet as far as  I know. So, I just... I don't know how you can make big  statements in the Chronicle about  how you can sell at 10 times the rate.  You know, that layout that you just

Start time: 5194.15
End time: 5215.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is it's actually a Twitter  scraper. So, what it does first, you sign  into your Twitter or Facebook account. What it  does first is it gets your Twitter  feed and then it gets all the articles  linked within the feed and creates a  magazine out of it. And if you want to read more,  they say we're only putting as much  material in this as the  RSS would. We're not putting...  Even though it is scraped. And that's not true.

And just the idea  of we're going to redirect  existing views  and take them to this ad-free  environment that not just ad-free, but they  change the design. You know, people put a lot  of thought and time into how they want  their stuff to look and you're going to manipulate  that and then claim you're  doing them a favor.

And in fact, this is why I have some misgivings  about the iPad. In some  ways, it feels like moving back to the  walled garden of content.  And  what the focus is, is on beauty  of presentation and less so  on content itself.  It does worry me just a little bit.  I have to say, now I'm a big fan of Hacker News,  the Y Combinator  news feed, which in its feed  only gives you the headline. So already  this is giving you far more than the headline.

Which I think, again, is just a weird way  to do business. It's like, I'm going to take your stuff  and put it over here.

Transcript:  This is just the second iteration.  This is a new dance, a new iteration  of the same dance that YouTube did. YouTube launched  it was a great idea, it was the right implementation.  Unfortunately, it was filled with pirated content.  But once it grew to prominence,  they were able to work things out. Now  we have a sensible system that works as far as revenue sharing.  People can put music inside their  videos. I'm sure they're going to hash this out.

And they somehow put some  advertising revenue about it. This case  has already been settled. It was done years ago  with that news site that  used frames around  the outside of regular newspaper  articles. They got sued.

Millions of users. In this case, this is a corporate  entity called Flipbook with $10  million of VC funding. Yeah, that's fair enough.  It has 15 employees  who are actually hand doing this.

Transcript:  that'll be sued out of existence.  It's kind of what Dave Weiner said should happen. Actually  I thought that the father of RSS  might have something more serious  to say about this. And in fact  on his blog post he said, well, you know, I'm tempted  to say this is horrible and this is  violating the tenets of RSS.  What I'd like to say is we got to work  to make a kind  of RSS or a way of signaling  from a publisher how they'd like to be included  or whether they don't want to be included at all  in a compilation like this. But to me  the reason I bring it  I think it's very appropriate as we talk about  the five millionth iPad being  sold in the next month or so.  This is what  to me this is what happens with the iPad.  Is you become very focused on the beauty  of it not where the source is. And frankly  as I'm reading The Economist, yeah, I can push  a button that says read the rest of the article. But  three paragraphs in, that's enough. I'm moving on.

Transcript:  I think web analytics will prove you're a rare reader  to actually read the full story.  And just everybody in the chat room keeps saying this is just  an RSS feed. It's not. It is most definitely  absolutely not an RSS  feed. It's a scrape. As the operator  some RSS feeds that are in this app. I can guarantee you  it's not the case. And you can see that from  others, the images, the multiple paragraphs.  They're using some kind of extra scraping.  Which again I think is based on readability  which is a really cool web plugin.  But it's not just RSS.  So that's kind of the part of the issue.  Yeah. The guy who... The guy who
