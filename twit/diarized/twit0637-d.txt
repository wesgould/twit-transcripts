Start time: 285.38
End time: 426.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm glad we're starting in a light note because I have a heavy thing to talk about.  We won't spend a lot of time on it because it really...  It's not a tech story but it applies to somebody who's a regular on this show  and a guy I know very well. I've known for 20 years.  We're talking about the Scoble story and I'm sure many of you saw the Medium post  which Scoble was accused of totally inappropriate behavior at an O'Reilly food camp.  That's been confirmed, by the way, by the O'Reilly publicist who said,  yeah, he was banned from then on from going to food camp.  That's a true story. It was before Robert got sober.  He very publicly got sober two years ago.  But now two more women have come forward to accuse him of harassment.  I know Robert very well.  I know others have heard stories about Robert. I had never heard any of these stories.  I was at that food camp, went to bed before the incident happened  and never heard anything the next day.  So while it's not a complete surprise because I knew Robert was pretty wild in his drunken days,  it is very sad to me and I really love Robert.  On the other hand, I don't love what he did.  And that if there's any good to come out of this,  I hope that this will be a message to all men that that's not okay.  And more importantly, that it's no longer going to be kept secret  because it does happen. It happens every day.  I don't know a woman who it hasn't happened to.  But men have bound together and kept this stuff secret.  And many of the victims are afraid for good reason to say anything about it.  That's changing. And I think that's for the better.  I hope Robert gets help. I know he wants to. He has apologized.  I care a lot about him. And I know he knows he did something terrible.  And let's hope it doesn't happen again.  And more importantly, hope that this sets a tone that keeps it happening everywhere.  Tech is not immune to it.  So this is the time for all of us to say that's not going to happen anymore.  Women are going to be respected as equals, going to be treated as partners and not as sexual objects.  So as a woman, do you have anything you want to add to that, Flo?  I don't want to be just a guy talking about this.  But I feel like I had to bring it up because I know everybody knows Robert's been a regular here.  He was here three weeks ago.

Start time: 426.04
End time: 447.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think the important thing to take away from all this is to believe women when they say something.  That's the important thing.  I mean, we have bred a culture here.  Society has a culture in the United States, particularly.  We've bred a culture that allows this sort of thing to fly under the radar.  And we just believe her when she says something to you.

Start time: 450.16
End time: 457.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And guys, if you see it happening, stop it.  Yeah. Don't do it.  Don't do it. To begin with.  And help others not to do it.

Start time: 458.50
End time: 466.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if you see something happening, stand up and say something.  Report it to HR or whomever in your organization.

Start time: 466.10
End time: 495.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Part of the problem is that HR is not always there.  As we know with Uber and Susan Fowler's story.  They're on the side of the corporation. They're not on your side.  Anyway, it's sad for me for all many, many reasons.  And I hope Robert gets help and can rejuvenate his reputation.  Because at this point, I doubt he'll be asked to speak.  Oh, no.  I don't think this man will have work.

Start time: 495.53
End time: 497.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The word radioactive was invented for his situation.

Start time: 497.00
End time: 551.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Radioactive is a good word for it.  All right. Enough of that.  I felt like I had to say something because I know people are watching saying,  well, what does Leo have to say about this?  You know, it was a top of tech meme this morning.  I'm thinking, oh my God, this is a nightmare.  Robert did apologize on Facebook.  But I think impairment, being an alcoholic is no excuse.  It's not.  Although seeking treatment is somewhat mitigating because he acknowledges that he had a problem.  And he hit bottom and he did something really bad or many things really bad.  He's trying to make amends for that.  It's an active step.  It's a step.  And it's a and I support him in that.  And OK, so you brought something fun.  Let's cheer up.  Flow, when we did the Google of Gadget Porn.  Gadget Porn.  You're right. You can't add point almost anything.  When we. This is a.  If you missed the pre-show, they made a lot more sense before.

We'll figure out some way to incorporate it to the show.  So when you were here, when we did the Google announcement of the.  We did. You and I both ordered.  We did. We took a break from talking live.

Start time: 572.00
End time: 573.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 574.02
End time: 575.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Start time: 577.04
End time: 584.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You also ordered Panda with the purported display issues that have been going crazy amok.  I want to talk about that because I went into a Verizon store on Friday to take.

Start time: 585.02
End time: 591.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah. And to try to get one and I couldn't.  Yeah. But you were smart.  You ordered the pixel to I did.

Start time: 591.48
End time: 606.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I ordered the pixel to personally, I will say I ordered it because this is the one made by HCC.  And I just I kind of feel like HCC is going to maybe I don't know.  I kind of trusted them in this batch.  No, I mean, pretty old fashioned.

Start time: 607.02
End time: 610.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Listen, let me take it.  I mean, this is the pixel one.

Start time: 611.04
End time: 611.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's got giant bezels.

Start time: 612.12
End time: 616.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not judging.  Yeah. No, I mean, but then think about my privilege as a reviewer.

Start time: 618.06
End time: 625.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like I don't want to have those.  I can just grab another phone.  This is the phone that you could have.  I got that phone to know.

Start time: 625.41
End time: 640.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Bezels.  Sorry.  That's a no date.  Yeah.  The thing you did avoid though.  The thing you did avoid though is that blotchy so-called blotchy screen, the LG OLED that they put into the XL.  Same one that's in the V30.

Start time: 641.20
End time: 651.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which I'm using, by the way.  And this is not a pre-production unit.  Do you notice the blotch?  No, there's no blotch.  I mean, it's blue tinted when you tint it to the side, but that's just the OLED panel.  It was my understanding.

Start time: 652.60
End time: 683.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I went into the Verizon store because they have an exclusive when and on Friday to get it or at least look at it.  They have the slider turned all the way up on brightness.  Of course, that makes it look better.  So the first thing you do is you turn off automatic dimming and you turn the brightness down.  And that's when you look to see, well, is it blotchy?  Yeah.  OK.  Admittedly, it is blotchy.  The way they dim it seems to be by turning pixels off selectively or something like that.  But if you hadn't said something, I would never have noticed it.  I don't think it's going to be a deal breaker.

Start time: 684.29
End time: 691.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a huge...  But the thing is the Android community is not OK with this.  Especially Reddit.

Start time: 692.37
End time: 693.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You go to Reddit and it's like...

Start time: 694.08
End time: 697.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, that's Reddit every day on every topic, though.  That's not special.

Start time: 698.12
End time: 705.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But like if this happened to Apple, though, this would be a huge deal.  Like people would be returning their phones, which I think is going to happen.

Start time: 705.90
End time: 714.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It would never happen to Apple only because of preconceived expectations.  People are not going to look at an Apple screen no matter how bad and say that's bad.

Start time: 715.02
End time: 731.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But they have the bend gate or whatever they had.  And then before that, they had the antenna issues, the antenna gate.  So I just mean to say that minor little things for a company like Apple, I feel, might get more exposure.

Start time: 732.06
End time: 740.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They wisely bought the Samsung OLEDs for the iPhone X, although they have a deal with LG as well.  But they are using the Samsung OLEDs in the iPhone X.

Start time: 741.56
End time: 757.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The iPhone X, a little notch at the top, is getting very bad reviews.  I mean, on the outline, there was a long piece about how Apple's bad at design for that reason.  So I feel like they are getting picked apart for small design issues.  Now, I think three years ago, the argument made more sense that people just wouldn't care.  I think that shine is now falling away.  I don't know.

Start time: 758.00
End time: 775.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You remember the mouse that you charged by putting the thing in the bottom of it so you could use it?  I use it every day and it's hilarious.  Do you remember, well, on your iPad Pro, the way you charge the pencil is you stick it in the charging port.  So you can't... it's where it could spray broken.  I mean, Apple is not perfect. They are not flawless.

Start time: 775.04
End time: 784.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I agree with that entirely.  I'm not a fanboy of either team, but I feel like the Android community's anger about the screen issue could be the fact that they are just very, very serious about this and the average person in the public won't care.

Start time: 785.02
End time: 789.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's also an expensive device.  I forgot how much the XL2 costs off the top of my head.

Start time: 791.06
End time: 811.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  $930? Come on, you're getting display issues now.  This phone I only paid $654 or something around there.  Such a deal.  I got the 64 gig Pixel 2, which is manufactured by HTC.  Why did you not get $128?  I didn't want to pay that much.  Yeah, good reason.  That's a good reason.

Start time: 812.36
End time: 818.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  She wanted to have money in her story.  $64 is enough.  This is my own money, that's why.  Unless you put a lot of music on in her videos, it's enough.

Start time: 818.77
End time: 827.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and I back up my photos all the time to Google Photos.  I take advantage of that.  So this is my first... this is my unboxing of it, by the way.  Let's see. Hold it. I don't know if you can do it.

Start time: 837.66

End time: 847.11

Start time: 883.20
End time: 888.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yep.  And no headphones.  There's an adapter inside, so there's no headphones.  And that is the Pixel. Wow, it really is nice.

Transcript:  Now, one of the things you might want to do  is immediately sign up for the Oreo beta,  because that way you'll get 8.1,  which turns on...  True.  ...that system on a chip in there that's just for the camera.  This is a dedicated image processor  that isn't active right now.  True.  But the developer beta has it,  and presumably the public beta.

Start time: 1077.32
End time: 1099.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But the problem with having 8.1  is that a lot of apps,  and because I cover a lot of IoT now,  don't work with the new version of Android.  Which is partly why I've stuck with the V30,  is so that I can actually  use these apps that I need to set up light bulbs  and to set up all my IoT switches around the house.  So yeah, that's one reason I've been kind of  avoiding switching to stock Android.  Yep. Yep.

Transcript:  are getting serious.  I'm sure you guys have seen some of the benchmarks  on the A11.  It's pretty ridiculous.  It's faster than a MacBook Pro.  Yeah, we've done some  testing to try some of it out and have  been able to replicate some of what  some of these benchmarks have shown.  It's impressive stuff. So this is cool, too.  I look forward to sort of running this  through its paces and seeing what kind of  driving  really more powerful  things, especially  video, photo, multimedia kind of  things, which tends to be slow. It's one of the  more frustrating things on a phone, is that some of the multimedia  stuff is just kind of cumbersome  and slow and not very impressive.  So it's a good sign. Google Pixel

Interesting.  So you have to  dig deep, and kudos to Marcus  Brownlee, who did a whole video on why you shouldn't use  that top line number when you look at  DXO Mark. You have to look at  these guys look at everything  and look at all the numbers.  The Huawei  gotten marked  down a little bit because  his video wasn't as good as Google, and so it ended up  with a lower total number, but photo  number, look at that,  So the average is lower  because it's got a 91 on mobile, which is still not  bad. And I have to wonder  is two point difference  enough to notice?  But still, that's a  big, that's amazing.  And the Mate is kind of interesting.

And that's  a sad state because that was a very  interesting small form factor.  Interesting material, ceramic and titanium.  Unfortunately,  and this is why I don't do pre  production reviews. All  of the essential phone reviews were with pre  pro models. They all complained  about the camera. Oh.  And while I think the camera  I had problems with the purchased  model that I got, they fixed it  within a few weeks.  But that doesn't matter. It's done. The damage is done.  The damage is done.

That made the wireless connect technology  that's I believe used in the little  doohickeys that you adapt  to the phone. They  sent 20 engineers over.  They did all the due diligence.  This is that old Microsoft technique.  The golf and devour technique  where you find out everything you  can about a product. And then  you say, hey, you know, we thought  about it.

Transcript:  People with hair, people with no hair.  I don't know.  Our show today, brought to you by  Rocket to Mortgage.  My friends, I have to tell you  a sad tale of woe.  When we bought our house four years ago,  we made the mistake of going to a bank.  Going to a bank, the big bank,  with the stagecoach and the horses and the whips.  And I mean whips.  It took them  almost two months to get us a home loan.  So long that we couldn't, we almost lost  the house. And they kept, the thing that  bugged us most was they kept coming back saying,  well, okay, we need some more documents.  We need some more documents. At one point we said,  could you just ask for everything you want and we'll get them all together.  We went on vacation and we were still faxing stuff  from vacation to this big bank.  Now, thank God, you don't have to  do that anymore. The big bank  is still the number one lender in the country.  Number two lender, but the best in my heart,  Quicken Loans. I know you've heard  about them. They're revitalizing  Detroit, the Quicken Loans arena  in Cleveland, right? I mean, these guys are  super cool and they love  geeks. And they realize that  this process that Lisa and I  went through a few years ago, just not, it's not  appropriate anymore. We live in the age of technology,  of the internet, of computers. So they created  an entirely online mortgage approval  process. You can do it from your phone.  You just go to rocketmortgage.com slash  twit and the number two, rocketmortgage.com  slash twit two.  But here's the thing. In the time it took us  to drive to the bank to apply  for a loan, you can get  a loan on Rocket  Mortgage. Because you don't have to  get any paperwork. You don't have to go  anywhere. You could do it from an open house.  Say, look, let's buy this house. Go to  rocketmortgage.com slash twit two.  You give them some basic information. They have  trusted relationships with all the financial institutions.  So they can get what they need. You just have to give them  permission. You say, okay, go out.  They go out. They get the numbers. They crunch  them. And within minutes,  like, because it's computers,  within minutes, based on your income,  your assets, your credit, they're going to analyze all the  home loan options out there. They're going to give you  the ones for which you qualify. You choose the rate,  the term, the down payment. And  you're done. You're approved. You could  show the realtor at that open house. Look, we're  approved. Let's take it.  That's it. In fact, it's dangerous. It's so  easy.

The modular era that we all liked when  PCs were essentially hand-built, or could be,  is over for modern laptops. We  made it thinness and this is what we pay for it.

Transcript:  This to me is part of the problem.  This is the same problem I have with Adobe  now. I think  for a while, Amazon, for instance,  really promoted  this notion, customer comes first,  we succeed when we  super-serve the customer. And I think Apple had  that attitude in the early days. I'm still  a big Apple fan, but I was a really big Apple  fan back then. At some point,  something happened in Silicon Valley,  and maybe it was the profit motive,  where companies made  changes that were less customer-friendly,  like taking the headphone jack out,  or these butterfly keys, which  I don't...

Transcript:  make jokes on Twitter. I don't want to make this a slam Apple  show, so I'll mention Adobe, too.  Because Adobe, as you know,  moved, stopped,  Microsoft's done this too, and is doing it,  stopped selling boxed software  and started selling subscription software,  the Adobe Creative Cloud. And actually,  the photography subscription was a pretty good deal.  10 dollars a month, you get Photoshop and Lightroom.  So Adobe Macs this week,  they have split Lightroom.  There's a new Lightroom,  Lightroom Creative Cloud, costs a little  bit more, keeps all your photos in the cloud.  You have to specifically  say, I want them on the hard drive, if you want them on the hard drive.  And they completely change the user  interface. So much  so that it is, well, it's just a different  program, it's 100% different program. It's  designed for simpletons, or

Transcript:  Lightroom? No! Actually, you know what  really reminds me a little bit of what Apple did with  iPhoto to Photos or Final Cut.  Final Cut 10.  Final Cut 10 was the problem. It's a very  big problem. Now, knowing that people  like you and me would be upset, Flo,  they released a version called  Lightroom Classic CC.  Which is, they haven't updated  Lightroom. Last version of Lightroom came out  in 2015, they've done some patching. This is  the first time. It's faster, it's  more compact.  But the name Classic is  really worrying people. Even though Adobe says  no, no, we're going to keep doing it.  It looks like the future of Adobe is this more  expensive solution that's designed to work  with an iPad. It's very cloud  focused, it's designed to be easier to use.  It's almost Instagram filter like.  And that's a different audience for  Adobe. And I can't think  that this is what their customers were asking.

I think they're  you look at, you know, they are eating up  market share, you know, disrupting all kinds of markets  with that approach  playing the long game.

Transcript:  of tech CEOs.  I think pretty effectively.  Going back to the user interface changes  and how it impacts functionality, I think there's kind of  two ways that I think about it. There's the crappy  the crapification of software  which is Final Cut X when it becomes  the child version of it and everything gets worse.  And then there's the Office 2003 to Office  2007 change, which was a dramatic  UI interface reformation with the  ribbon, but ended up making a lot better  versions of Office down the road. So I think people  hated that ribbon. Really? My parents,  who I still run tech support for, lost  their, I can't swear, lost  their stuff. I don't know whatever that phrase is  because they couldn't take it. But by Office 2010,  it was so much better than anything they could  have done before. So I'm in favor  of this reformation and the complaints you get  if you're actually increasing functionality  and not taking it away. That's what Adobe would say.

I'm looking for all that. None of  that's there. The formerly  20 pages of preferences  in Lightroom are now one page  and all, really there's a checkbox that  says you want to store your photos on the drive too?

Transcript:  let's turn on the smoking lamp then.  Our show today brought to you by Wordpress.  When you create your small business  website on Wordpress, you suddenly give  yourself a global presence.  I know you think, oh,  no, I have a Facebook page.  That's a bad idea.  First of all, you don't own it. Facebook does.  You have a Twitter account. Same thing.  You should have all that, but it should all point  back to your site, the site you own, the site  you control, and that's at  Wordpress.com. Maybe it's too hard.  You say, I don't, you don't, it's not.  It's not. With Wordpress.com, you don't  need any prior experience. You don't need to hire  somebody to do it for you.  They guide you through the entire process. They take  care of all the technical stuff.  It keeps your site up and running. Look, I know how  to set up. I ran my own Wordpress site for  years on my own host, but  I use Wordpress.com because it's so much easier.  They keep it up to date. They keep it secure.  You choose from hundreds of beautiful  designs, and now with the business  plan, you can install any plugin you want.  You can install any theme you want. You're not limited  at all. You could,  the automatic features are fabulous.  Boost your visibility with built-in search engine  optimization. Your  customers will help generate  business for you because every post  on your site has social sharing, so they could say,  hey, I really like this restaurant.  Share it on Facebook. Share it on Twitter.  And if you need help, they've got  a customer support team that is the best  in the world. I just love these people. I actually called  them a couple of times because I just, I had  some questions. They're Wordpress experts.  They're eager to help you get the most from your site  and they're there 24 hours a day, Monday through Friday,  and on weekends too. Plans  start at just $4 a month.  There's a reason why 28% of  all the websites in the world run  on Wordpress. It's just the best.  Wordpress.com slash  Twitter. Start today.  You'll get 15% off your new plan purchase  if you go to Wordpress.com  slash Twitter. My blog's on it, leolaport.com.  But also some of the biggest publications,  Quartz uses Wordpress. A lot of  publications use Wordpress. It's a really  powerful tool.  Wordpress.com  slash  Twitter.  28% is pretty strong. Isn't that amazing?  It was 27% when we  started doing the ads, so I take credit for that last one.

Transcript:  Three of my favorite people.  Friday, I interviewed an amazing illegal immigrant.  And he said, I said, you're an immigrant.  He said, no, I'm an illegal immigrant.  Philippe Kahn, the man who started Borland International.  He came to America on a tourist visa, stayed for years.  Didn't have a green card, so he couldn't get a job.  So he worked as a consultant.  He had worked in Switzerland.  He was a mathematics, master's degree in mathematics.  And he'd worked with Niklaus Viertz.  He was a professor of mathematics.  He was a professor of mathematics.  He was a master's degree in mathematics.  And he'd worked with Niklaus Viertz in Switzerland.  The guy who invented Pascal.  So he came to America.  He released a $50 Pascal compiler that was 10 times faster than anything out there called Turbo Pascal.  Changed the world.  Then sold the company.  Went public, sold the company.  His next company was...  Well, he did Sidekick too.  Which you won't remember, but if you ever used DOS,  Sidekick allowed you to do a calendar and a notepad.  You're not.  No, it was before the phone.  That was my first thought too.  I was barely... nevermind.  It was a DOS program that allowed you to multitask in DOS.  Which you couldn't, right?  But you'd press a keystroke and it would pop up.  It was amazing.  Then he did Starfish, which did synchronizing technology.  That was adopted and licensed by many, many companies.  Sold that company.  His next company...  I'm missing one.  Lightwave.  He invented the camera phone.  I'm sorry.  Is this guy on TrainGalation or something?  He's one of my heroes.  He's an amazing guy.  20 years ago, his wife was having a baby.  He had brought his Star Trek phone.  He thought, gosh, I wish I could...  I have this Casio digital camera.  Crap, 640x40 digital camera.  How can I get the pictures out of this camera  onto the phone so that our friends and family  could see our newborn baby when she comes?  So he asks his wife.  He runs downstairs.  He rips something out of his car, the Bluetooth...  It wasn't Bluetooth, but the music player out of his car.  And gets a soldering iron.  Comes upstairs.  In the hospital room, he's soldering a StarTek  to his digital camera.  He has a server running.  So he uses the connectivity of the StarTek  to get to the server.  He takes a picture.  Time Magazine said it was one of the most important pictures  of the last 100 years.  That is so MacGyver.  That is totally MacGyver.

You've heard of Motion X. Maybe you haven't,  but the motion sensors in the Jawbone Up he invented,  licensed.  Your Apple Watch,  every accelerometer in your phone,  that's all his invention.

And then five minutes go by, we're sorry to inform you that milkshake duck is racist.  Whenever the internet finds something that's lovely and nice, it turns out to be bad.  So if you found a herb that was non-verified,  he may become milkshake duck and actually be racist,  and KFC has to apologize,  thus ruining the moment.

We're talking about a better way to invest.  Betterment, they're the largest independent online financial advisor.  Because talk about customer centric.  This is a financial advisor that has a fiduciary responsibility to take care of you.  They are a fiduciary.  No commissions for recommending funds.  They don't have funds of their own.  They do what's right for you and they do it at a great price.  Betterment takes advanced investment strategies.  Uses technology to deliver them now to more than 270,000 customers who love Betterment.  Here's what I like.  Based on the information you share, they'll ask you when you first sign up, what's your time frame?  What do you want?  Are you saving for a house, retirement, college education?  It'll make tailored recommendations like how much to invest, how much risk to take.  The type of investment you should have.  They have by the way, and I can't invest in them because SEC rules prohibit me from doing ads and being a customer.  Which is interesting, right?  But if I were, I would do their socially responsible investing portfolio.  And you could feel good because the stuff you're investing in is making the world a better place.  You can reduce your investment in companies that don't meet certain social, environmental, and governance benchmarks.  But here's the thing.  It's only 0.25% annual fee.  Now the nice thing is you get unlimited access to licensed financial experts.  But for 0.25%, you don't call them.  And I don't actually want to talk to them.  You can text them and they'll text you back.  It's all in the app.  If you do want to talk to them, I'm not a I want to talk to you kind of guy to be honest with you.  I'd much prefer to text with them.  But you can for 0.4% get unlimited phone access.  And again, these are certified financial planners.  They are fiduciaries.  They do not invest.  They do not get commissions.  They are working for you.  Of course, the Betterman app is fantastic.  Two-factor authentication, advanced data encryption.  They're protecting your data, protecting your money, and helping you grow your savings.  Now investing always involves risk.  So I want you to go there and find out more.  In fact, here's something you could do for free.  They will review your investments.  Take about five minutes.  Assess your investment accounts, your tax strategies, your fees, your risk exposure.  Find out how you stand.  Betterman.com slash twit.  That does not require a sign up.  But if you do the review, I think you'll get an idea of how helpful.  Betterment can be at redirecting what you're investing.  If you start now, you young people, you'll be way ahead of somebody who starts later.  It's the magic of compound interest, as Warren Buffett always says.  Betterment.com slash twit.  Betterment, rethink what your money can do.  I know.  I feel like they're out of order right now.  It's out of order.

It's really, really good.  I haven't thought about it.  They scribble out an idea, you know, three sentences.  Like I want to do a story on this. They're like sold.  And then they like sell, they've got three ideas sold  and they're working on two scripts.  And like they're just barely scribbled out in an email or whatever.  It's good for writers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well that's, see, eight billion.  Four times what HBO spent.  And then Apple's saying, oh we're going to spend a billion.  I'm sorry, that's a drop in the bucket.  You've got HBO spending twice that.  Netflix spending eight times that.

Start time: 4945.00
End time: 4957.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I wonder how much of Netflix's stuff is actually  as effective in terms of spend  as HBO. HBO's stuff  tends to be a solid B plus and above.  Netflix, in my experience, and I love it,  a little lower.  I agree.

Transcript:  A significant number of people will...  I mean, they know, by the way. They see it.  They made, for instance, House of Cards.  $100 million to make House of Cards.  They made ten times that  in new subscribers.  Oh, I believe them.  So the economics work for them and more importantly,  they know what the economics are.  There's no mystery. They can see the result.  They have the data.  And that's where somebody like Reed Hastings  really has an advantage because he comes from that background.  I think that's why coming from a tech background  in Hollywood, normally,  you're not a creative, but having the data  and being able to use the data,  this is where something, actually, surprisingly,  Jeff Bezos has not done very well.  Amazon seems to have stumbled with its originals.  They won a lot of Emmys. Transparent was amazing.  But that was it.  But that was, it was kind of, that's it, right?

Transcript:  creative over the long term. There's a long tail effect to this.  If you build it, you own it forever. You pay for it  once. You nailed it. And so Netflix here is dropping $8 billion  this year. It sounds like a lot of money.  But that investment will persist.  They'll be selling it again and again and again.

Transcript:  And they're caught between a rock and a hard place.  In fact, as much as I  admire Bezos, I think Reed Hastings  is actually quite brilliant. He got dinged.  He got a lot of heat and pushback  when he split the company into their... Quickster.  Yeah, whatever happened. He was going to do  DVD rental under Quickster and then have a  streaming company. But he knew  there's no future in the DVD rental company.  We're going to do streaming. He saw that  happening. And then he saw the movie company  squeezing in the cotton. They weren't getting  first run movies. They were only getting kind of crappy  stuff. And he said, we got to solve this.  We're going to do... They were one of the  first to do original programming. I mean, HBO  is a content company. But  this was a digital... They  rented DVDs. And they turned  into a content creation company.  I think you got to give Reed Hastings a lot of credit.

Start time: 5107.14
End time: 5114.56

Transcript:  be really fearless  in a way to start a DVD business, try  to get rid of it halfway through when it's still your  cash flow driver, and then  start spending billions of dollars a year on original content.  I mean, that's amazing. But he did that when Blockbuster

Is the ability  to step up and say,  I'm going to do the very, very risky thing.  It's the innovator's dilemma.  It's very tempting to just say, hey, we got an iPhone.  We got some great success.

And they  want to be in the middle of every single transaction  on Earth for those two things.  That's why I said, and when we talked about it  a few months ago, I think they eventually  buy UPS or make their own delivery  company because...

Transcript:  Actually, here's what's going on.  And especially after the Microsoft  acquisition, and this was by the way why  Mark Benioff at Salesforce was so upset  about Microsoft's acquisition of LinkedIn.  He was trying to get LinkedIn, remember,  because he's afraid, the value of  LinkedIn is the data.  Just as with Facebook,  but this is maybe more valuable than Facebook.  It's what it knows about every employee, every CEO,  every business person in the country is huge.  And that's why Microsoft wanted it.  They had a bidding war with Salesforce, and Salesforce  is afraid that Microsoft  will keep that all to itself.

Transcript:  I mean, we joke. I really  hope this helps. Like sarcasm  aside, snark aside, if they can make Twitter  a better place so that we all stay there and we don't lose  this app that we mostly love,  we can usually enjoy it. Well, in a way, that's what's interesting

Start time: 5641.04
End time: 5645.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they are the free speech wing  of the free speech party, which worked for a long time  until you could, people have learned how to brigade  essentially on Twitter and turn  the openness of the platform against it and therefore  take what made Twitter beautiful to start into a  poisonous environment. And this is why we can't have  those things. Because as we talked about  in the car on the way up here, people are bad.  And they should be ashamed of themselves.

Start time: 5665.79
End time: 5682.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The thing  is Twitter has for a long  time leaned on this argument  that it is a platform  for free speech, as Alex  is saying, but it's used that  I feel like as an excuse  to not do the hard work.  You know what happened? The Arab Spring.

Start time: 5683.04
End time: 5726.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So I think  Twitter knew, I think Jack knew,  I have knew that there was a problem.  But then the Arab Spring happened.  And whether this is true or not, and I think it's  maybe a little bit more myth than  truth, the organizers  of the revolts in the Middle East  used Twitter to organize, to band  together, to encourage each other, and that  they take credit for  the Arab Spring.  And that was  to them the justification.  See? Free speech  works because it can make a huge difference.  Look what we did. Look how we helped.  Now, and they know there's a downside.  But they said, but the  downside is justified because  we also give people without a voice  a voice. Yeah. And even before that

Start time: 5727.22
End time: 5752.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's true, because even before that, in 2009,  the Iranian presidential elections, remember  which there was massive  fraud and  dislocation.  They were about to run a maintenance update.  And the U.S. government  came to them and said, don't,  please don't do that. They're like  there's like, it's too important.  There's stuff going on. And these  activists, this is the only way they have  to connect to each other.

Start time: 5753.00
End time: 5756.54

Start time: 5757.20
End time: 5770.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  were. And they were. It's legitimate.  And it was used for evil. And it was used for evil. So you know  what I'm really glad? I don't have to solve that mix.  It's going to be super, super  hard to keep the platform open for people  who are serious and not horrible Nazis.  And to get the Nazis involved. I would, I actually

Start time: 5771.24
End time: 5788.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  would disagree. I think  the value you and I  and everybody finds on Twitter has  nothing to do with hate speech  or Nazis or reprehensible speech or  bots or any of that stuff.  It has to do with people really talking  legitimately. Absolutely. And to the degree they  can get rid of that stuff, that's how much better Twitter

Start time: 5789.16
End time: 5794.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  it. Rhetoric. I would say  there's enough, the stuff we just described  is not gray. Agreed.  To ban that stuff, that will make  it a better place. And it's not a gray, there's no gray area  if you've got swastikas or hate speech  on your page. I'm agreeing

No, I know they can. But I'm not  sure they're going to do a good job and the problem is if they  say we're going to end certain things by certain dates, people  expect them to pull through. And if your point about  the gray area  is their position,  they will not ban or block some things  that some people think do fall afoul of those  rules and they are going to get beaten up.  Twitter is in a no-win situation  with a hard technological and media  problem at the same time run by non-journalists.  It's going to be a mess. You follow this talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  in crack shock.  Here we are for years,  for a decade, saying  no problem, you can use Wi-Fi. It's very  safe. Don't use WEP. We know WEP's been broken.  Wired equivalent protocol is not safe.  But good news, WPA2,  especially if you use the AES version,  safe. Mathematically  proven.  Mathematically proven safe.  The math. And on Monday  we found out, no it's not.  We had, actually it was great on Thursday  on Tech News Weekly, we had  Maddie, is it Van Hoeven? Is that  his name? The guy, the kid who discovered this.  And he even said,  it took me years to figure this out.  It was mathematically proven solid, but I  had a feeling, he found  an odd bug. I think a lot  of the reporting has been inaccurate, so I want to clear  it up. If you want to hear the details, listen to  Security Now on Tuesday, or go  to crackattacks.com, Maddie's website.  It does not affect  wireless access points.  That's not where the patches  have to happen. It's the things that connect  to them. Your laptop, your phone, your internet of things  devices. That's  where the attack happens.  They can interrupt the communication,  request the nonce three  times, get the key,  and then from that point on,  intercept all the traffic from that  client into  the access point. So  big deal if it's your oven.  Bigger deal if it's a camera  in your house. Or  maybe biggest deal of all if it's your laptop,  phone, or tablet because they can see all the traffic.  Now if your traffic is encrypted, using  SSL, it's probably safe, although apparently  there's some sort of additional man in  the middle that may happen.  So that potentially is problematic as well.  If you use a VPN, you  should be safe. And the best news is  it's not a hardware problem.  It's fixable and the software fixes  are rushing out. In fact, FreeBSD  put it out before  the revelation, which upset some people. People said,  you shouldn't have done that. Now the bad guys will  know what we're going to tell you on Monday.  FreeBSD said, yeah, but people,  we don't want our...  That's a weird complaint.  Well, it's understandable.  That's how this thing works. We'll hold back  on the revelation and give everybody a chance  to fix it, but don't fix it too soon.

Transcript:  So Microsoft didn't have to fix  it because it turns out their implementation of WPA2  was flawed. It doesn't have the flaw.  They did it differently.  Same with iOS. Nevertheless, there should be  fixes coming out for both those.  Linux has fixes.  Most importantly, though, you want to look at fixes for your  Internet of Things devices.  Looking at me?  Yeah, when they come out. And Android,  Google says they'll have it in the next security fix.  That's a couple of weeks.  It's not...  Somebody would have to be  on your network or near your network. So they'd have to  be sitting on your curb. They'd have to be parked  in your curb with their laptop.  On an open access point, it's kind of like you're on an open  access point. Think of it as that way.  If you're using somebody's Wi-Fi,  think of it as potentially open.  So use a VPN or stay on encrypted sites  and you're probably okay.

It's like the hits keep coming in 2017.  We need some  good news.  But I think this is one of those  things that you look and you just  think how long has this been  an issue and how long  have attackers been exploiting  it. That's a lot of times what I wonder when these really  bad things happen.  We don't really...  We don't know the answer. We won't know the answer for  a little bit until researchers, you know,  dig into it. But  man. By the way, I have to

Transcript:  more? It's getting worse. But partially...  I think it's the same. Security  is getting better. But  we're finally paying  for decades of  the tech industry  putting so much emphasis on innovation and  security being an afterthought. I think the products  that are built today are  better. Like the products built in the last few years  are better and are more secure. All the stuff  that's getting attacked tends to be  stuff that was built before that in  years often and sometimes even decades  before.

Transcript:  because there's money.  But all software has always been flawed,  right? And the good news is I think because  of all this we're getting better at making safer software.  Windows is a very  good example. Windows was a nightmare  for a long time. But it got to the point where they  patched it regularly enough and they patched it and they  patched it that actually got very secure.  In fact, attacks moved off of Windows to  Flash and browsers and other

Start time: 6193.04
End time: 6214.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  another thing that's made it worse, the NSA.  So now you have government actors  finding flaws, looking actively  for flaws and using those flaws.  And then like the NSA, not protecting  them so that the equation  group works can be leaked  out and used by bad guys. And of course  that's WannaCry, the WannaCry ransomware  used in NSA flaw.

I can't remember where. This time he's in North Korea.  He said, oh, where are you? He said, well, I'm a little north of Seoul.  I said, how far north? He's pretty far north.  He's a cyber analyst.  He's a government contractor. I'm sure he works for the NSA.  Cyber analyst.  He says, don't worry, I'm not going to be here much longer.  I'm going to Ukraine.  He's very excited that he's going to Ukraine  because that's ground zero  for all the Russian attacks.

I know he talked about them last week.  I wanted to get more out of it.  If you're interested in this topic,  read the stuff Dan Patterson's written on it.  Also, Steve Ranger  for us out of London  went to Estonia  in Tallinn.  Basically, the UN  is running all of these mock  cyber warfare scenarios.  Steve actually was an  embedded journalist in the middle of  part of the scenario.  Part of the scenario is what do you tell the public  if one of these really bad  challenges happen.  Steve then  wrote a long form about  what they're doing and how they're preparing for this  and the kind of attacks they're worried about  and the kind of things that could happen.  If you read those two things,  you'll get a pretty good sense for  what's being done to protect  against these things  and the things that potentially  are the biggest dangers.

I think in the answer to your question,  it's both getting worse and getting better.  We're getting more aware of it and I think we are  finally taking it seriously.  Cyber warfare has been a real threat for years.  We're clearly starting to take it seriously.

We're not paying attention.  I think it's fair. They were all Democrats.  I think it's fair to say that  I don't have a lot of confidence  not just in the White House  but in Congress in general  that they are doing the things  we need to do. Maybe the military is.  I feel pretty good that the military has the skills  the knowledge and understands the problem.  I just hope they get the tools they need.  We don't need ten times more nuclear weapons.

Every week I say  I wish I had an audible ad so I could tell you about all  the great books out there.  The Man Booker Prize just went  to one of my very favorite audible  books. I highly  recommend it.  Man Booker is the British prize. In fact  there was some controversy because it's an American  author. Lincoln and  the Bardo. Have you listened to that yet?  No.  OMG.

He's in his 50s but he'd written many  many short stories. Wonderful short story novelist  writer. Nick Offerman  narrates it.  David Sedaris. George Sanders.  Carrie Brownstein. Miranda  July. Lena Dunham. It is a  full cast performance.  And it's  I mean read the book if you  prefer reading but this is  a great audible book. We're actually  going to set you up with  a free book. So it's one  look I'm going to give you way too many choices.  Okay. So that's one.  But given that he just won the Man  Booker Award and I agree it is one  of the best novels I've ever read and  the absolute best way to consume  it is listening to it on audible.  So that's one.  And then of course we got to mention Follow the  Geeks. This is a great  a great audio book.  Your co-author  Lindsay Gilpin. You read it.  And 10 digital innovators  in the future of work.

Kate Patello  and I did the screen savers.  And it was the first time we ever  did a public appearance. And when we  started Tech TV we didn't think anybody was watching.  Nobody was watching. We weren't anywhere.  Except that the Las Vegas cable  company picked it up. So our first  big audience was Las Vegas. So Kate and  they said we're going to go down to Las Vegas.  There's a mall. They're going to set the cable company. You know how  they set up tents and give away  stickers. We said can we go?  We never thought of that. Okay.  So that's the point where  we're arriving in the parking lot. Kate  gets out of the car and she grabs me and she says  there are people here.  There was a big crowd.  It was 110 degrees.  We were outside in the parking lot.  But there was a huge crowd. It was the first time I think  either Kate or I ever realized anybody's actually  watching Tech TV.

Transcript:  I think we all feel like we're getting whiplash.  Yeah. Trying to keep up.  So here's the deal. Audible's fantastic.  It's the best readers  bringing to life the best  fiction, non-fiction, classics.  They have a great sci-fi selection.  In fact one of the things Audible did  and I really praise them for this is they realized  a lot of the great science fiction novels  were never made as audio books  because in those days they were just kind of pulp fiction.  So they went back and they created the Audible  Frontiers program and recorded  a great many of the classics.  So you could pretty much get all of the classic  science fiction. It's a great way  maybe for your kids to get introduced to science fiction  if you love science fiction or for you to rediscover  Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein  and Larry Niven  and of course the great Jerry Pornell.  Wonderful stuff.

For those of you who need two audiobooks to give Audible  a try, what we're going to do is we're going to give you the gold  plus one plan.  You get two free audiobooks. That's good. We gave you  like five.  Two free audiobooks to try out. And then  after that one book credit a month.  So we kind of jump start you with two right off the bat.  You may, I know you  like podcasts, you're listening to this, but you may not  know if you're going to like a book on audio.  You will, but just in case  it's a great idea to try  before you buy, go to Audible and  pick a couple of books  and enjoy.  As with all the other plans, you get a free  subscription to the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times  Daily Digest.  Offer is good in the US and Canada.  I should show you.

Clearly we love Audible.  Audible.com slash twit two.  So I've been promoting this. In fact, when I was in Estonia  last year, I almost got one of these. I think this is  such a brilliant idea. They call them their digital  identity cards. They're  e-cards. They have a chip on them.  You have your public key on  it. So you can  use it to verify your identity. I mean,  it's a really powerful technology.  And anybody in the world can get it.  Except  I guess this is an Infineon  chip because it turns out  Infineon chips have a bug  that allows an attacker  if he has your public  key, which is the key you give out to everybody  to deduce your private  key and from then after decrypt  all the traffic to you on  PGP and other key, RSA keys  on public key crypto.  It basically breaks public key crypto.

It's difficult  to fix. Millions of keys  are crippled.  This didn't get as much attention as Kraken.  I'm kind of surprised.  Maybe it didn't have as good a name.  But we were worried that  public key crypto would be broken by quantum computing.  We didn't think it would be broken so  soon. Broken by a bug.  It's in an RSA library  developed by Infineon.  If you use  as I do OpenGPG  to generate your keys and software, you're safe.  If however you used a  Yuba key, which can generate PGP  keys  earlier this year  they fixed it. But any key I think before July  of this year has that flaw. You're going to want to generate  new keys.  It's a pretty  scary thing. It's hard to  know what your  keys are and so forth.  There is a site you can go to  to figure it out.  But I just  want to let you know.  Talking about Kraken, but forget Kraken, we got  Roca. Almond.  See if he'd named it Almond  Roca. That would have been amazing.  A tasty treat, but bad news

This would be in response  to the illegal  ads on Facebook from  the Russians.  Two Democrats,  John McCain obviously a Republican, it would  require tech giants for the first time.

And so  it's fun to see his name on this because it implies  there's probably some intellectual heft behind  the movement or the idea. And then it may actually  get out of committee.

They've got six months to fix this.  I hope this honest ad act  passes because that's  the right way to do it. If it's  in public,  they may be buying the ads, but at least it can be exposed.  People can write about it. They can say,  you see what people are saying? Right now, these dark ads,  the only people who see it are the targeted people.

There's a lot of money  out there being thrown at companies  like Uber that never  made any money, like Magic Leap has never even made  a product, because you've got  to invest somewhere, and  if you hit the next big thing, which  both of those potentially could be,  there's big returns. But these are  big boy and big girl investors who know  enough to know that in all likelihood  you're not going to make money.

Transcript:  No, I don't think so in this case.  If you write a check for more than 100 million  dollars, you are not gambling in that way  if you're an outside investor. A 5 million dollar  Series A check is a gamble. A 1 million dollar  seed check, complete wager.  And is this because they guarantee they'll get paid  first? No, everything's more mature.  If you put money into a Series C enterprise  SaaS corporation, you see their cash flow  statement and their growth. You kind of have a good picture of them.  Magic Leap should have proven tech  they can use now to show people and say, look,  I wouldn't put in half a billion dollars unless I  saw it. Investors do get  to see it.
