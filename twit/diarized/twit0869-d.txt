Okay, so so so this is a common thing  This has come up a lot and and I've kind of tried to joke about it online  I'm like it's people like you're being so dramatic you you know saying you're leaving Microsoft and like you went down the street  granted  Maybe a little dramatic  it's kind of like like like Schrodinger's like Microsoft like depending on like  Like what look at the box is it or is it not because here's here's the situation obviously yes  Microsoft is the parent company, but it's it's run independently so  There's different email system. I have a different payroll system. I have different health benefits  You know like like so it's pretty independent badge. Yeah, will you be talking to the same people?

It's a lot more broad  It's like it doesn't matter. You know like what what cloud you're on or if you're self-hosting or what the situation is  It's about you know creating the best tools and experiences and community for developers

Transcript:  It's just a joke don't take no I'm just kidding boy I was a little upset with wise this week  Wyze I've been recommending their cameras. I thought they were the best thing ever up your way Christina in Seattle  Because they were selling what would normally be very expensive  Cameras and other electronic products for remarkably low prices like twenty and thirty dollars  And they were good stuff. They sell now sprinkler controllers and noise-canceling headphones and and earbuds  But it was the wise cam number one  That was the amazing first product turns out it was hackable for three years  Three years  They did nothing about it. They didn't tell anybody they knew  That that hackers could remotely access your camera  Without much fanfare earlier this year. They discontinued it without a full explanation  Eventually, they sent out a little note to wise cam version one owners saying hey friends  It's a new year that comes with some important updates  Protecting you and your security always top of mind for us to do that. We'll need you to update your wise app  Update your camera firmware and oh by the way if it's version one throw it out. No, they don't say that but that's what you should do  Because there are no updates version one now there is some debate over how hackable  It was but  Hackable at all and if it's known at the company and they don't tell you is a big deal

Start time: 649.40
End time: 673.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if it was the big a bowl, but it they did say that it wasn't just  Intercepting a stream but actually reading the memory card. Yes  And so when you have the trigger set up where it only triggers useful events, that's way more of  Pot of interesting information rather than just tapping into a random web cams everything the camera is recorded

Start time: 674.56
End time: 687.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Specifically things that trigger it which are the things that people want to see right?  Nobody's people aren't combing through hours and hours of footage to try and find like oh now  I found the like one minute in this footage. That's interesting. They're getting the highlight reel now

Start time: 688.12
End time: 741.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I first became aware of it with Sean Hollister's article in the verge. I'm done with wise. I'm throwing them all out  And he got a little bit wrong wise reached out to tell him that there was  Well, basically security through obscurity  In order for the attack to work  It'd need an initial camera ID  Which is a non predictable string that can only be acquired if you're on the same network as the device  So hackers would have to camp outside get into your Wi-Fi  For instance and see it that way or perhaps get into your house, but it doesn't eliminate the evil maid attack and  I don't care vulnerable is vulnerable and  I mean  How I guess this is an interesting question how much Christina how much should we hold wise  To the feats to the fire for this. I mean, I think that if

Start time: 742.92
End time: 796.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look if you make the decision that you were not going to update a product for whatever reason  That's one thing and and I think that especially given what type of product this is that that that's  Customers should probably look at it and be like, okay  Well, I'm never going to buy anything from you again if this is how you do it  But the fact that like it seems like they waited so long three years three years before even alerting people  That to me like when you know  That's the unacceptable part  If you don't want if you don't have the money or the time the resources or the the engineering talent or whatever the case  Maybe to update your old product fine. That's we can critique that but but whatever but but to not even bother to let people know  Hey this security device which you are selling us a security device that is capturing pretty sensitive information  Has vulnerabilities where people could take over it and could do things to it and you're not telling anyone  That's not that that's not that's not acceptable at all  I think we should definitely hold their feet to the fire

Start time: 796.88
End time: 871.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are some also questions about Bitdefender because they learned about this vulnerability in  March of 2019  notified wise  Normally with the security company there's a responsible disclosure  Agreement where you wait a certain amount of time usually three months and if the company doesn't fix it  you then disclose it because  It's only a matter of time before hackers discovered if Bitdefender could have discovered it for some reason  Bitdefender decided not to do that  And so I'm not Bitdefender's  PR director told the verge our findings were so serious  our decision regardless of our usually 90 day with grace period extensions policy was that publishing this report without wise's acknowledgement and  Mitigation was going to expose potentially millions of customers with unknown implications  And since the vendor didn't have as far as we knew a security process  We just delayed publishing and you know, that's one of the arguments for never disclosing but at the same time  It's if you could find a Bitdefender couldn't guys. Yeah  Yeah

Start time: 872.14
End time: 906.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's also interesting that like as they point out wise didn't seem to have a security framework in place  Which is a strange decision for a company that's you know making smart home tech, right?  We all know that smart home tech is a big vector for for cyber attack  So he feels like you would have this in place and I can't help but think you know the sort of the fact that wise has  Been able to sell these devices at such a low cost  And generally we had felt previously like good quality  But it makes you think well there are corners perhaps being cut here or there and it feels maybe a little fly by night at times

Start time: 908.36
End time: 1000.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's puzzling to me I have to say  The wise their whole deal especially with the wise camera one was that they didn't make any of the hardware they got cheap  hardware from Chinese manufacturers and  Only thing that they did was the software so they wrote their own software and so knowing  that they were  willing to wash their hands of  At least that part is almost like what?  What is their expertise at that point because they are just now just passing on just a cheap like the  stereotypical cheap Chinese knockoff hardware stuff where it could be really really  like hacked or not done in a way that it was secure and so now knowing that they are in themselves like  At least at that point in time did not do all the safeguards needed to really protect their users and make sure that things  Were done at the high quality that they claimed  It's almost like I wish that they had at that point of time  Been outed and they most likely that would have killed the company sadly  But now these these cameras are everywhere and people have them set up and people are relying on them and  This this this specific article even though now it's widely released  How many of those cameras will hear about this right the people who are really?  Right the people who are operating these cameras and so they probably would not have had them if this came out three years ago

Start time: 1003.56
End time: 1036.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Should so I feel bad because I've been telling people for many years to buy wise  Cameras back to those $20 version one cameras. We even have a few  Is this bad enough that you don't recommend wise ever again because you know clearly they don't care about security or is this a  Mistake that could easily be made by a new young company they decided because you'd have to have access to the network  It wasn't that big a deal  I mean we disclose lots of flaws that require physical access to the machine that's it still should be disclosed  Well, yeah

Start time: 1037.10
End time: 1050.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean and deciding that it's not making the decision for your customers that it's not that big a deal strikes me as the thing  That's kind of feels uncomfortable right like that should be up to the owners of these cameras to decide whether or not  That's an acceptable level of risk

Start time: 1051.08
End time: 1066.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I never not telling the company if they announce it and say and I guess wise didn't have a way to push updates  But they could have sent you know they could have said down. You know take that mini SD card  Copy this file to it. Maybe they had no way to update it. I don't know

Start time: 1068.60
End time: 1083.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Software yeah, I mean every software company has you to your point Leo about like you know places  Don't not holding it against companies like every software company has to cause happen every single one right  It's never not going to be a case, so it's all in how you handle it

Start time: 1084.36
End time: 1127.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And and of course this underscores the very good advice  Stacey Higginbotham on her twig show gives she's an IOT expert and many others do not buy an IOT device  That doesn't have a security framework. That doesn't have a way that patches can be applied especially  ideally pushed to the device and  Google's nest cameras they can push patches they'd have the ring doorbell they can push patches they have  stuff happens mistakes happen, but but ideally the company should be able to  Repair that device even if you're not paying attention and apparently  Wise did not I don't know what their current situation is I?

Start time: 1130.62
End time: 1241.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mean I think the fact that it was three years me for me personally  I would say that this becomes like a deal breaker right like if you wanted to say three months six months  We're investigating we're trying to figure this out given the severity of what this is  We don't want someone to create a zero-day  Sort of click and whatever thing because if someone's local you know it was exposed to the open internet  Which was some people's configurations might be you know that could be a problem  Whatever I would still have a problem with this  But I could be more sympathetic a new company and whatnot, but this number of years of  You know this is a long time when you're now and I'm like what version are they on other products on version 3?  I think yeah version 3 you know so you release subsequent products that don't have this issue and in their own  Explanation of this they said okay well the the the small memory amount which was the whole reason we had to go to  Version 2 this is why we haven't been able to update version 1  Okay, well if you know this and if you're running into this issue  Then that means you need to alert people in my opinion then in there you need to say  Hey, this is a problem this can't be updated this has a vulnerability  And you need to offer some sort of trade-in and you need to offer some sort of amount of credit if you don't  Like a goodwill thing this is okay. Here's you know like like $50 off. You know a  version 2 or something right like  Or at the very least because they are a low price point if people want to get mad  Then they could have that say okay  Well, I was only spending you know $20 a pop on these things fine  But let you got a lot people know and the fact that you didn't and and as you know  More of these things might be on the market that that just becomes to me  I don't think I could ever in good conscience  Recommend this again not the least without without like a very full a complete security audit of their framework and also of what's what?  devices they are  You know bringing in what that's a good idea

Start time: 1242.82
End time: 1265.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Third party and do a vulnerability and and you know they do have a whole page at wise.com on how to record report a security  Vulnerability and you know presumably the newer devices have enough memory to do an update and things like that  I guess maybe there's a secondary moral which is you shouldn't pay $20 for a camera and expect it to be secure  Get we pay for yeah, right

Start time: 1266.86
End time: 1309.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean and I think to me that almost is is on the one hand  I think that makes a lot of common sense. I think the reason why this is  Troubling is because this was a company that their whole you know raised on de Turel was to say we can sell it at these  Cut-rate prices, but we're not skimping on the software. We're actually taking that seriously  We're doing this right so their their entire sales pitch was basically yes  We're the you know the Chinese knockoff price  But like we're actually doing doing real work on the software end and it turns out  That's just not true at least based on what we've seen I mean at the very least from the security standpoint  You know if you're going three years without even letting people know that there's this vulnerability  I

Start time: 1311.14
End time: 1370.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't know and I just I want to stress that the issue  I think if I remember if I read correctly was that it's the web server making or exposing the the mounted  Drive to the web and so from from from my modest  Opinion I feel that this is something where they could have fixed it, but they chose not to fix it  So I'm gonna I'm gonna be very very skeptical about them saying that they could not fix this  I don't think that they've gone through the trouble to fix it  And it probably would been a lot of rewrite in order to make sure that that does work  But I want to stress that I don't think the issue is that they could not have fixed it and keep in mind the same  Time three years ago. They're releasing all the products that you just showed when you showed wise and the headphones the  Gun safe whatever that's great. Yeah vacuum cleaners. Whatever all that stuff that they're  Accelerating which they are choosing to ignore or push this off  Instead of actually fixing. Yeah, so that was a constant choice of where they put their resources

Transcript:  Absolutely, or even I mean it's interesting because I look at this and I'm like it this even feels remember the issue that Western Digital had  Last year were some of their old  Connected drives that hadn't been updated and had been end of life for years people were able to remotely wipe them  Because they were connected to the internet, right?  Do you remember that? Yeah, and it was it was it was a terrible situation  It was a huge black mark for a big company like Western Digital and I thought that they'd handle it fairly poorly to be honest  With you, but at least they were going out of their way once it became clear  How bad it was to instruct everyone unplug these things from the internet like to me?  In addition to having to do I think like the the full like no zoom, you know apology tour  They need to be doing a bunch better job getting the word out because it's not like they don't have everyone's email  Because because the whole point weight how these companies work and one of the reasons they can get the the economies of scale  Somewhat the way that they are all the way although I bet they're losing a bunch of money on this anyway is  By by you know getting every single bit of information from all their purchasers and and selling that so it's not like they don't have  The emails of everyone who bought one of these things  So, you know, why are you not emailing people loud and clear saying?

Transcript:  Kids are all right in one way. Yeah, they're gonna be able to get jobs. Let's put it that way  Lapses first la ps us dollar sign which tells you a little bit about their motivations first surfaced December of 2021  With an extortion demand on Brazil's Ministry of Health  I think as I remember they released a bunch of records there  They broke in an Nvidia released source code from Nvidia. They broke into Samsung. They broke into Vodafone  They broke into Microsoft released the source code for a bunch of Microsoft project products including teams and I think Windows  As well, although Microsoft said they had disrupted the download before it could finish  So they didn't get all of all of it and then maybe most notoriously they were the group that broke into Okta  Okta says they didn't get very far. Yeah, but that's a big one because it's a security firm  That's used by many other companies for you know, single sign on in their security. So  We're starting to learn a little bit more  Okta was two teenagers  16 and 17 in the UK. They both been released on bail because what are you gonna do, right?  Both teenagers charged with three counts of unauthorized access with intent to a pair operation of or hinder access to a computer  To accounts of two counts of fraud by false representation. I'll explain why that  Those are the charges  This the father of the 16 year old said we just thought he was in the basement playing games  We were shocked I say shocked to find out  obviously fairly fairly skilled  Around the same time as news of the arrests emerged according to the BBC  Lapses told its 45,000 followers on telegram that some of its members would be taking a vacation  On Wednesday they started posting again after the arrest releasing stolen material from a software development company in Argentina  So the kids are alright I like that  Lapses did the same thing as the solar wind hackers  Breaking through two-factor in a couple of interesting ways  One of the ways of course two-factor works and this is very popular Microsoft uses it  GitHub uses it now by the way, I noticed  Yeah  Where it sends a push to your phone and you approve and it logs in so one of the tricks is quite simple  It logs in so one of the tricks is called MFA bombing multi-factor bombing  where you just keep had hitting it so that the  Victim keeps getting pop-ups over and over saying you proved you proved and finally just says oh screw it. I approve  And apparently that works  There is also a sort of a slow motion  MFA bombing where you do one or two prompts a day  But apparently there's still a good chance  According to a red team hacker that was talking to  Ars Technica that people will still say yeah. Yeah, you can also call the target. There's more of a social  This is probably where they got the charge of impersonation  Sort of a social attack pretending to be called the target saying hey, I'm with github Christina  I'm just I need to send you an MFA make sure we're all in set up  So just I'm gonna send you an MFA just to prove it. Okay, we'll just make sure that you're single sign-ons working  And you know Christina you're new at the company right? Okay. Yeah, sure. I'll wait. Oh, yeah, I see it. Thank you  And you hit okay  MFA bombing  It works kids  In fact lapses, of course did not invent this it's been going on for some time, but  There you go, don't even two-factor is not necessarily enough to protect you against it makes me wonder if there was no pandemic

That was a mosconi south by southwest was gone like things are happening and I could understand even ces in january  Exactly. Exactly. Although obviously that was much reduced  Much reduced because of the omicron outbreak really changed the tenor on that  But for them to be canceling it in in april and in what it was supposed to be in june, right?  That's usually when it is  To me that means they didn't have enough. Um vendors like they didn't have enough booths sold is is the only thing I can think of  On that is that they were they had something where they had to get out of of their you know, commitment.

Yeah  Yeah, I mean and it's hard to imagine quite who is e3's audience  It's competing against a lot of other different conferences that draw people in for different things like packs  The various packs is still huge as far as I can. Yeah, I mean so  They I think they struggled right because it was not for a long time. E3 was only sort of industry, right?  Wasn't it? It wasn't really open to the public  So I think they kind of walled themselves off so long that by the time they're like, oh no, we  The industry is not enough to keep us afloat. We need to open this up in order to stay viable  It was kind of too late and a lot of other conferences have sort of eaten their lunch

Like like so many tools  Nintendo's not there, you know Microsoft  Um, uh shows up intermittently various studios are there so similar to what dan was talking about with macworld, right?  Like macworld was kind of on its last legs  Basically as soon as apple announced and what was it? I think it was 2009  that was going to be their last year and at that point like it carried on for another couple of years, but  I mean that that was the anchor and and at this point, you know, the anchors  Are not really there for for e3  In addition to the the fact that you know, there are the the direct consumer  Shows that are around and the direct developer shows. So yeah, kind of like apple

Start time: 2625.12
End time: 2646.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like they can go the the big companies your microsoft's or sony's nintendo's can go direct to the consumer  Right, like they don't need a trade show to show off their latest games or their latest consoles people are going to show up  To hear them no matter what so they don't need e3 anymore  And like christina said if you don't have them holding down your your tent poles then your tents blown away.

Transcript:  Sony is speaking of uh that uh merging their ps now and ps  plus  streaming uh subscriptions to create a three tier  Subscriptions, this is a ridiculously complicated story. I couldn't it's so complicated. I couldn't really so figure it out

Start time: 2715.86

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I I just got it wrong  I just got a a ps5. It was sort of an early birthday present for my wife. Yeah, also a great device  I mean wonderful. Yeah, and I haven't I had been I have an xbox one  I was a long time xbox user and game pass has been great on that  and so I almost was like sort of holding off buying some stuff some games for the ps5 because like I had seen the  Rumors about the streaming service and then it came out. I'm like, I I don't know which of these things would get me  The thing I want right like where where in this sort of three tier subscription do I fit so?  I haven't I still haven't figured it still haven't figured it out frankly  so

Start time: 2753.92
End time: 2800.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Should I try to explain it now?  It's probably not it's probably not worth it. There's ps plus essentials ps plus extra  And ps plus premium  Which is the the top priced?  Essentials is essentially the same as what you got today with ps plus  Two monthly downloadable games online multiplayer access game discounts and cloud storage  extra  Adds 400 ps4 and ps5 games to be downloaded  Uh including god of war some big big names mortal kombat 11 spider-man  Uh, they're gonna add more titles on a regular basis then premium  Also adds and maybe this is I it's funny. This is the most expensive part  classic games from playstation 1 2 and the psp

Start time: 2805.64
End time: 2837.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't help but feel that this is reactionary to the activision  acquisition from microsoft  because of the  possibility of losing some of their titles and that  drawing on their past  like bank bankable  um like  Properties that they have then they were just saying how do we eke out more profit from that in order to make up for the  Possible future restrictions of some of these AAA titles. Yeah, that makes sense. There's definitely nostalgia

Start time: 2837.32
End time: 2856.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean anybody who's buying a gaming console these days  Is likely somebody  An older man  In his middle age  Who has some nostalgia for kirby and stuff, you know, it's like, uh,  The good old days. I don't know. I think that that's probably the case. Am I wrong?

Start time: 2857.00
End time: 2869.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, or or or a kid who can't find a graphics card  I mean there there are varying reasons because I think nostalgia is a big one. I think to me  Um, I have to be honest. I feel like the the price is wrong on this. I think that if they wanted to be competitive

Start time: 2870.24
End time: 2874.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's fairly expensive as much as ten dollars a month, right? Right. Well, that's the thing right?

Start time: 2874.22
End time: 2944.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like if you and if you're going to get it  You should probably pay for the annual price because it's like I think that it's 60 dollars a year or  Or or or ten dollars a month for the lowest tier option  And and it and it's similar in those other things and I think that that's been like I think your options annually are 60 100  120 dollars  Now you probably will have people who will pay, you know  To be complete as to will be okay with those older retro games that only happen streaming  From sony servers incidentally they they don't they haven't invested into like, you know  Having good emulation stuff on the on the console itself, but I feel like  They made it clear. They're not going to do  Day one availability on their flagships for all the studios they own and and sony's whole  Thing I mean the reason that the playstation is section amazing ecosystem is that first party stuff, right?  They're similar to nintendo in that way and that they just have a killer exclusive first party lineup  And if you're saying okay, we're gonna cost as much as game pass ultimate  Which works on pc and um, you know cloud devices and console  But we're not going to have  Like the the day one availability  To me, you can't charge that same price

Start time: 2945.76

Transcript:  With xcloud. Yeah, the only way the price makes sense is if you have access to other hardware  So if they do the netflix model, right?  Pay this premium and you you don't need to have a play it everywhere in order to play it, right?

Start time: 2965.52
End time: 3021.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, okay fair enough. Yes, and if they did do something like that  Which again like if they brought like an xcloud sort of component where they were like, okay  You don't need because the way that a lot of their streaming stuff works now is actually  You're streaming it off of your home console  Um on your pc, right like it's not a real streaming thing  They have the streaming stuff is is is is is related to a number of games  I think you're right. I think if they did that where they said, okay, basically, you know kind of their g-force now xcloud whatever, you know  Competitor whatever you want to call it stadia, I guess  Then yeah, I think maybe they could charge what they're charging but as it stands right now  I just feel like 15 a month is too high. I feel like if they come in at 10 a month for that option  Then you have something that is is price competitive. Um  considering you're not going to have the the day one releases, which is  Obviously one of the big appeals of um of game pass actually by not buying an xbox live subscription

No, we promptly notified customers  We told them what to do  Uh, we we notify the public in the next filing with the sec, but krebs  intentionally  Ignored all that  In order to drive traffic and I have to say these look kind of lawsuits almost never succeed  You'd have to prove malicious intent on his part  um  I I feel like it's mostly a nuisance suit, but of course brian's gonna have to defend it now  I have a lot of respect for brian krebs  I I think this does not reflect well on ubiquity to be honest, although  Uh, you know their their side of the story  Is somewhat damning

Like it's one of those things where people kind of you call things to question, especially since  Look, the the data breach was bad, but the fact that it was internal and whatnot  Does change the tenor of how it looks a little bit right like there can always be bad actors and whatnot and you can do better  Things internally, but that is very different from like a person who broke on the inside  Exactly, then then like okay.

In fact, he does have a film coming to apple

I mean, it's a very it's a very  Depressing time for a lot of people and it's it's been hard and like something that has a more uplifting thing  I think that was one of the things with the power of the dog. A lot of people were like kind of grim  Yeah, exactly  And it's like maybe we need you know  And you can't there's only so much you can do with money to buy that right like having that at your disposal in terms  Of something that feels like hey, it's a feel-good movie, right?

Transcript:  There's no question though that's streaming  You know in fact as we were talking about kind of the end of the line for e3  After this oscars, I think it might be the end of the line for traditional theatrical movies  And that streaming really is dominant netflix had 27 nominations  That's including the 12 for power of the dog  And four for don't look up  Apple had nominations also for joel cohen's macbeth three of them. So there were a lot of streaming  Nominations and I really i've seen actually a number of articles and and there have been a number of directors including ridley scott  um and squarcese himself who say you know the idea of a small film or  An art film or even just a thoughtful film doing well in the theaters is pretty much gone  It's going to be comic book movies extravaganzas going to be dunes  Going forward in that with with the streamers and this is what you were talking about earlier dan with the idea of writing a series  as a novelist  Having more than one book to develop a story and characters. It's kind of I think it's kind of the same for streamers  It's not just movies, but six episodes of something like the dropout can be so much more compelling than a two-hour movie

Start time: 4134.56

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean it gets people bought in they come back right it's kind of the equivalent of like recurring revenue in some ways  Because people don't I mean look at disney plus disney plus is a great example of this  They've carefully set up their schedule so that like there's there's never a time that you don't want to be watching disney plus  Or subscribe to disney plus and I think a lot of the other streamers are following the same tack where it's like  Let's have this sort of constant  Roll out of things so that we can keep bringing people back and that that helps right Netflix  I think in some ways has struggled more with the film aspect right because they they've dropped a ton of films  But to your point earlier about scorsese and like the you know finding the the signal to noise ratio there where it's like well  You know there's a movie  Coming out or 10 movies coming out on this one day and it's like do I really want to invest my time in that?  Or do I want to do something where I can sort of watch over a long term and get to get comfortable with it?  Because I think I don't know for myself  I  Much easier for me to like reach for a remote and start watching a new episode of something that i'm already invested in  And to commit any two hours to like a movie that's I didn't even think about that psychology thing

I somebody mentioned this it might have been julia alexander on twitter talking about this  Like the netflix and the studios have almost a very adversarial relationship, right?  Because netflix's whole point was like we're kind of trying to supplant the existing model  Whereas yep all the people to your point christina about apple like having a little more goodwill like  People in hollywood use apple products. They like apple products  That gives a sort of a positive spin on it and that's not apple's only business, right?  They're not there just to put hollywood out of business. They're there to sell phones. That's just the sideline for them

Transcript:  ooh  Exciting our show today brought to you by  noreva  Uh, you know, it's exciting people coming back to work. I missed you guys. It's really nice  We have the lunches and things but at the same time there's still people at home  Because they've got small kids or they just aren't comfortable coming in  So a lot of us now a lot of businesses we're doing the hybrid thing  And that means your conference room becomes one of the most important places in the business and conference room audio  Becomes super important if you're still talking to that little spider in the middle of the table  You're leaving out all those people working from home. They can't hear you worse  I see big companies do this. They bring in av companies the engineers crawl around they install speakers microphones  wires everywhere  It's expensive. There's lots of calibration involved and you really never get off  the the the wagon train because they're gonna have to come back and calibrate it again and again and  Upgrade and so forth  I have a much better solution  It's called noreva and they've got a patented technology that is amazing  Essentially, it's as easy as installing a soundbar with one or two of these noreva speaker bars  You're not only going to have great sound you're going to fill the room  With thousands of virtual microphones. It's their patented microphone mist  Technology which means  Everyone in the room can be heard clearly no matter where they are no matter where they're facing  So if people want to get up and move around if they want to make sure there's good social distance, it doesn't matter  it  auto-calibrates  every single time  meetings and class participants can completely relax completely be natural but remote participants don't feel left out because they can hear everything that's going on  And thanks to continuous auto calibration your rooms are always instantly ready with optimized audio  No outside technician required your it department will love it if you have multiple  conference rooms or huddle rooms because they get a console  That lets them monitor manage and adjust the system sitting at their desk. They don't have to go from room to room  They don't have to get up at all and the installation is so easy. Go to the noreva website noreva.com  n-u-r-e-v-a  Noreva.com if you can install a soundbar you can install it yourself  No big expensive installation just put it right up on the wall and it just works  You're gonna love it. There it is. There's the animated gif  Of installing it could not be easier  Learn more about noreva. It's the great perfect solution  Not as expensive as those custom avs installs  and and not as  Crappy sounding as those little spiders in the middle of the table noreva ask yourself before you just do the obvious  costly complicated traditional system  Make the leap to simple economical noreva and you are eva  Dot com. We thank them so much for their support of  this week in tech noreva.com  A great product. It is nice to be going back now. You've always been wesley. You've always been remote, right?

Yeah, and  I have a nice lighting some nice mic a nice camera. So it's it's almost as if I am there  But the companies especially in the tech space  especially during the hiring crunch it makes it so much better to hire remote because  Not having an office or not having requiring someone to be next to a hub or pay for relocation  Makes hiring so much easier and allows you to tap into the work  uh potential of so many more employees and for me, um  the flexibility of being at home or being close to my family is a  Good perk that would be the differentiator between me working from one company to another with the same pay. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's it's what's really ironic is I never stopped coming in but I was the only it was me and john  And that was pretty much it during for the last two years in covid  Because I it's hard for me to do broad to do  Especially the radio show but even twit to do that at home. There's just I just can't get my energy level up  I need to go to a studio  To do stuff. I need bright lights in my eyes before I can even wake up.

It's been really I did kind of miss people  It's kind of fun to have people come back  but I love it that people can do work from home and I think that's the that's absolutely going to be the  The way to go  Speaking of macworld you have an article dan and macworld this week apple is at its best  When it doesn't know best  And and you're using the mac studio and studio display as an example of  What you mean?

Start time: 5124.22
End time: 5164.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean I I think and I sort of jokingly my lead on this one was like the inside of apple are two wolves, right?  and  It's there is this fundamental there is this tension there that apple has always had which is to say like their their sort of company  Line is the whole we like to surprise and delight our users and that is when they they do  Such good work is when they come up with answers to problems. You didn't even know you had and you're like, oh, well, that's great  That makes my life so much easier  But the sort of flip side of that the other element that they deal with is this whole like we have one way  It's our way of the highway, right?  Like we know how we're going to do this  You're going to do it this way or you're not going to do it at all  And I think those are kind of two sides of the same coin

Yeah an apple an apple machine that it's not  Let's be honest. It's not the best looking mac that's ever been made, right? It's not that it's totally unattractive, but it's it's functional

Thanks very much circular piece of crap  Right and in the end of day it didn't do the job it needed to get done  so I think it's refreshing to have a situation where they're like  We understand this is a machine that you want to get your work done  And we're gonna make it as easy as possible and accommodate what you're trying to do with it  I think that's that's good. It speaks well  To where they're going with these product lines

End time: 5337.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know. I there's a lot of debate about it and I can't tell how much of that is sort of  The amount of  Created versus how much of it is actually impacting people because people wanted like, you know  After the pro display xdr came out with its humongous price tag people were like, oh just put the 27 inch  iMac panel in a monitor  And let me buy it and that's what they did, you know, and it's you know, it's 1600 bucks  It's not cheap, but for an apple product, it's pretty cheap  You know  I don't think it's a bad quality monitor  I think a lot of people who are used to having an iMac on their desk would be very happy with this  There's been a lot of complaints about this and that and how it matches up to other things  But I think one of the things is there's not there's not really a super  Like comparable product to this right everybody who was using a mac mini  Or wanted to hook up an external display to their macbook pro a lot of them were using the lg the ultra fines  I am especially yeah a lot of people had complaints about those too  I've got a lot of people who are frustrated and there were they're poorly shielded

Transcript:  Into a $1,500 product. Oh, it's it's look I I have  Many complaints that I spent the money that I spent on it. Like i'm not happy to buy it to be very clear, but  But there are no other 5k displays and that actually does matter to me. Does 5k make that much of a difference?

Start time: 5381.00
End time: 5381.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's lots of 4k

Start time: 5382.84
End time: 5432.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah for me  I really do I have to say because like for for pc stuff or gaming whatnot 4k is fine  I can use like a tv as a monitor for that, but i've been using a 5k iMac  For god like like 10 years at this point and it's hard to go back  And it's hard to go back  so the reason I ultimately ended up getting the lg was because I was like I just wasn't happy with any other display that I  Got like having them side by side. It really bothered me and even hooking my mac up to I just didn't like  the the way that you know, the the the display scaling happens, so  I I think I think it's stupid that I spend this much money on something that doesn't have local dimming zones, but  That honestly, you know like I  Would have been nice. Yes, but did I expect it? No  Um higher refresh rate. I don't think that's  Was ever going to happen  Anyway, that that matters to me less

Start time: 5432.88
End time: 5447.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's another thing that bugs the hell out of me apple put an hdmi 2.0 port on its studio display so it can't do high  Frame rate. I would love 120. I have 120  I mean  Hurts monitors that I can't you know get that speed on right?

End time: 5535.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think there's something to christina's point about for whatever reason I think especially if you get used to something like the 5k display on the imac  The I think the the resolution issue hits people harder than a lot of those other bullet point features  So you'd rather have 5k than hdr  As someone who has used an imac 5k for five years  Yeah, I don't I I don't know what i'm missing  Maybe is probably part of it like if I saw that and we're like, oh, yeah  That would be nice to have on there  But it's hard to have a sort of apples to apples comparison, pardon the expression because there  There isn't another monitor that chooses to emphasize the things that apple is choosing to emphasize in its in its displays

Transcript:  By the way, I think this is hysterical in the product  Photographs for the samsung m8 they show apple tv  Playing on the m8 just in case you didn't really get the connection right away  Um, yeah  I'm an apple fanboy and look I bought four studios for various  People I did have a studio display in order which I cancelled  uh, but  I i'm starting to feel like  Apple's really just selling us an iphone with a big fan  Can I spitball something?

It only uses two  Exactly, and so it's like okay you could and i'm not sure like what the you know  They would need to have some sort of ui on it because of course, there's no input selection  But it's like wouldn't it be great if they just made this?

Start time: 5716.62

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Drawing board. I think I have to do you think I think there is a there's a gap there  I mean, there's I wrote about this a little bit too  but there's a performance gap too because I was in the market to replace this 27 inch imac because it's still an intel model and  I can't get anything that's between the studio which starts at two  $2,000 exactly and an m1 and it's like I already have an m1 air  I don't want to take a lateral move of like having this is my workhorse machine. I do podcast editing on this  I do stuff that actually requires some horsepower  I do things that require more than like two thunderbolt ports  And so I wanted to buy something i was like there's really nothing in that price range between  Roughly, you know the the imac and the the mac studio and it feels like there should be something there because the m1 pro  Chip which they've used in the macbook pro doesn't exist on the desktop  There is no configuration of a desktop machine that uses that one chip that's between the m1 and the m1 max and you're like  That's weird, right you have a chip it can do this stuff  You could stick it in an imac or in a or in a mac mini, but remember to be fair

Transcript:  I mean which which is I have to say like that becomes what will be interesting about uh, the mac pro  Yes, you know update is is okay  If they went all in on the redesign that they started, you know five years after the the failure of the trash can and finally  In 2017 they finally were like, okay. Well now we'll do a listening tour  And we'll start on this earnestly in 2018 and then they come out with it  You know a year and a half later like they finally were like look we brought back upgrade ability and you can  Add stuff and make changes and touch your own ram. Oh my god, you know, um  For them, they can't get rid of that like it's how it feels  But I don't know how they're going to handle that given the design clearly of all of this being, you know

Transcript:  Connected their gpus are turning out to be woefully inadequate compared to nvidia and and radion  Uh a set, you know, let's not forget that they call it m1, but it's an a14  It's the same chip as in your iphone 12  It is an a14 with a bunch of different extra little side things  Um, i'm not convinced  i'm wondering honestly if they might be running at a runway that the problem with the mac pro is  We're having trouble getting it be a lot faster in all of the speed comparisons  They compare power to power which is important on a laptop and a phone  Much less important on a desktop  and if you want real power you're going to turn your  Nvidia  3090ti up to 400 watts you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna have an airplane taken off in your on your desk  But you're gonna get the job done twice as fast  And I think on a desktop power is not as much of a consideration and apple's big selling point  Is kind of built in because they're basically using an iphone

Start time: 5952.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's an a14. It's not even as fast as the iphone  13 chip  The m2 is the a15  Uh, anyway, I know i'm  This is i'm swimming upstream on this. In fact, neil cybart had a big article  Yesterday and above avalon a couple of days ago apple is in a league of its own  And uh, and it is true if you look at numbers, wow  Uh new iphone users 60 million a year  Apple watch new users 30 million a year ipad new users 30 million a year  mac users new users 15 million  A year and he says it's all because they changed their strategy where it used to be  The what what he called a pull strategy?  where apple would  take a product  and  Be aggressive with that product the products that we're going to sell the best store  He says capable of making technology more relevant and personal  And then have that pull all the other product lines along so here your airpods watch phones then ipads  Then laptops and desktops pulling them through which meant that the stuff on the right hand side  The imac the laptops  And even the ipads are kind of lagging  He says now they have a new strategy the  Push strategy in which every major product category is told go for it  Just go for it  I'm, not sure I agree with neil because I I have to point out they're all using the same chips  Which really has a lot to do with the overall speed  Capable, I mean you follow him dan you follow him closely. What do you think of neil neil's?  I mean, I think neil's analysis is always very good. What do you think of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I think it it makes a certain degree of sense in terms of  Despite the fact that the the hardware and the chips are consistent across the line  I think apple's often tried to differentiate it by use cases right? I mean the devices they're pushing  Are not like hey, you know, let's try to like sell somebody  This product when they could be using any other product right like, you know  Try to get everybody into an ipad right instead of an iphone or a mac or something like that  And rather having an opportunity  Not only to be able to say let's pitch the device that works best  For whatever you're trying to do but also, you know to be fair  Try to sell you on multiple devices, right if they can sell you an iphone and a mac and an ipad  Then that's great business for them that helps them jump up all those users and then helps them broaden their user base and  You know deepen their product lines as well. So  I mean, I think he's not wrong that it's  Having all of those those product lines sort of push individually as opposed to sort of  Prioritizing the ones that are the like the hot sellers  I think it probably helps them just end up with a deeper bench

Transcript:  Well, and it is true and mark german predicted this that they announced they are this year  They're going to announce a ton of new products  And they're going to announce everything all at once and it is going to be kind of an overwhelming avalanche  Of stuff on the other side of the aisle. I'm really happy to see ours technica andrew cunningham  Had a benchmark some of the new alder lake  chips the i3 12 100 and the i5 12 400  and  intel is starting to  Speed up become a little bit better. They're finally doing  Something apple pioneered which is these uh, actually maybe qualcomm did or arm did but these efficiency cores and and power cores combined  and  I've always made fun of the i3s, but actually the i3s are starting to benchmark  Fairly. Well, the i5 is really starting to benchmark  pretty well  Uh and being very compatible competitive and one of the things that was interesting in this article, by the way  Is among all these benchmarks he started to include some m1 chips and apple honestly didn't look all that good  Compared to some of these intel chips these alder lake chips and  You know some people have called it scalder lake because these chips are not exactly  skimpy on power consumption  Look at this. This is handbrake energy use  for 1080p and code apple easily beats everybody  else  with  24.95 kilojoules  Compared to say, you know the max which was an i3 127 almost under 28 kilojoules, but  If you give them more power they perform pretty well in the mp4 and code the i3 was as fast as the m1  the i3  And an i7  was  better than twice as fast  Uh that you know that really puts these apple graphs into perspective. Yeah  If you only look at power consumption apple's amazing  But if you just want to get work done maybe an i3 is as fast as an m1  That's scary numbers

Transcript:  I I think last time I was on the show we talked about this specifically and I said that this lead is great  It's temporary. You were right  Uh, the reason why I said this specifically  Related to amd is I think they just acquired xilinx. I think um where  Some of this acceleration is done by some specialty  Accelerators that are on the chip and so they move the memory of course closer for the m1 and the the m1 family  um, but there are  there's also um an accelerator for  Uh javascript, I think also on the m1 chip, which is really great

End time: 6373.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and when you see this  emphasis on accelerators for specialty applications  That is something that you can absolutely do on other processors, uh, just to make sure that things run quicker and  Um, I I see that happening in the somewhat near future where you know, apple will still be competitive  They they're all they will  Each like best each other in different categories, um, but I can say it's it's not a panacea. Um, so  this is  uh  Yes m1 is great  There are also some other consequences when you move over to your own type of architecture  We mentioned earlier about breaches and security concerns  when you're uh  When you're now going to be or moving into the majority of some of the install bases of some of these

Transcript:  uh  Apple does have a slight advantage because they make the operating system. They control the whole stack. So intel or  Amd if they do add additional, you know capabilities  They still are making a general purpose off the shelf chip for a variety of situations  So they can't be quite, you know as as tightly integrated as look at the xbox

Start time: 6417.72
End time: 6427.30

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, like like I imagine that there will be I mean we've already seen this like a like amazon is doing their own  um, you know, uh arm 64 chips in the server room and um, you know nvidia is is getting um into that space  Uh the the data center space too  And so I think we'll see a lot of these more specialty use chips similar to kind of how the m1 has been developed  you know, um on you know the arm architecture  going at after different things but  You know x86 is this great kind of general purpose thing that can be used in a variety of different ways and apple  Even though they're selling way more than a lot of other individual  Companies is still just a small fraction of the of the number of you know, like computing devices sold  So they don't have to have the same amount of like yield that like, you know, intel does or even amd does  Um in terms of how well, I actually i'm not sure I i'd have i'd be curious to know who ships more chips amd or apple  But certainly, you know intel ships more chips  So because they have to be used in in so many different things that apple just doesn't have to care about

Start time: 6501.52
End time: 6508.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Fundamentally different business models too, right? Their job is to sell chips, right intel and amd. That's their business apple is about selling devices

Start time: 6508.14
End time: 6513.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're making the chips exactly. I would even argue apple selling lifestyles more than anything  right

Start time: 6514.46
End time: 6524.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  well, I mean  You could argue that's always been the case. I mean and people, you know people have been quick to point that out  but it's it's you know, it's something that people are buying right if

Start time: 6525.68
End time: 6558.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If they are it's working it works. Let me just ask this question. So if  Uh, if we're talking about volume for microsoft and the xbox  What if a company like hp or dell saying we would like our own processor, please  Um, and what kind of volume difference do you think they could push?  I think it'd be at least competitive with the xbox. And so they could be a diff it could be differentiated to the point where  Dell has their own processor to differentiate themselves from hp hp has their own processor  I think they can push enough units to make it that's really interesting

Start time: 6559.74
End time: 6604.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could I think the challenge there you could definitely do that  I think the challenge there is then around always around on the software side, right?  Like like how what differences are you going to make and what sort of performance things are you going to do to make sure?  That the software that is running is going to run well  Like apple has the advantage there and and xbox too to a certain degree in that like they're controlling the full thing  so they're you know, determining what software can be written and um, you know with with the  Processes there same thing with um, you know, like the custom ships  Inside of an xbox  whereas I feel like unless it's at a very specific thing like does does a dell or an hp do they  Have the resources to dedicate towards having their own software stack to run on these dedicated machines

Start time: 6605.44
End time: 6638.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the marketing side of it as well  I mean if you're hp or dell you've made your business with we sell computers to everybody for every possible purpose  What is you know?  I think a lot of people would be hard pressed to say like hp as a brand is like  Well, i'll buy you know, especially stuff to make my excel functions run better in my office environment  I mean, I don't I don't think they have as strong a brand to enable them to specify that deeply  In what they're doing. They're not a company even like  You throw out something like alienware or something like that, right? Which is again has a very clear market sort of niche they're going for

Start time: 6638.88

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 6640.22
End time: 6649.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's harder for dell which is you know, if anything their corporate identity is sort of  We're cheap, right? Like we're affordable. That's kind of a commodity type thing people can customize their own thing

Start time: 6649.86
End time: 6666.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah  I mean, I think what they'd have to do is like an hp uses do you know itanium like their own kind of custom processors and  they had their own like, you know variations of of unix and whatnot and  And um all that stuff  But like I think that if they were to go that direction would be basically what sun was right before before sun

Start time: 6666.58
End time: 6669.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it didn't go so well for pa risk and it didn't go so well for sun

Start time: 6669.96
End time: 6685.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I was gonna say that's the problem right is that apple like you like you would need them in those specialized cases  And apple has found that sweet spot. Yeah, qualcomm could probably do it to be honest, right?  Like qualcomm could and and has to a certain degree. Yeah, you could argue every android phone in the u.s. Is designed around qualcomm

Start time: 6686.66
End time: 6731.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. So yeah  I don't know. I think apple does have a unique market position though  And and and you know selling the lifestyle is not a bad way to go you you said in our discord chat christine christina that  Uh, it's silent when it's running and you know, I have it sitting next. That's the uh, I have the  Max studio my wife has the ultra  When I was able I maxed all 20 cores on it  The fan did not ramp up. It didn't get hot. It was absolutely silent on the other side. I have a  An amd  ryzen 50 5900 in a  Nvidia gpu and the fans sound like a jet airplane's taken off, right? It's faster

Start time: 6732.42
End time: 6801.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's but is it the lifestyle I want right? It's the trade-off right and I think it depends on what you're doing  I think that for really high purpose like, you know high performance computing applications and stuff  I this this is the interesting thing for me is I feel like the value prop for the mac pro  It's they're at an interesting inflection point like I i'll be interested in seeing what they're going to do on the gpu side  like what they're what their answer to that is going to be because  There were people who were buying  The intel mac pros who probably didn't need it all but um maybe needed just enough and and for their various workloads and stuff  They're like, okay, even though it's going to be really loud and even though it's gonna be hot like we need these yawns  We need this ram. We need this upgraded  We need video or amd video  Exactly and and and at this point I would say anybody who's buying a mac pro  And it's not adding it to something additional like in I would say probably in  99 out of 100 cases maybe 999 out of a thousand cases would be better off buying  More commodity hardware and running lennox and some way that's that's the situation that they need if you need speed much better

Start time: 6801.64
End time: 6804.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why apple's got a real challenge with the mac pro at the end of this year

Start time: 6804.86
End time: 6815.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree. I think that that's the thing. Yeah, because I feel like the ultra is  Going to fit that like 80 point but like how are you going to go after that?  How do you get any better than that?

Start time: 6815.49
End time: 6815.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah

Start time: 6815.86
End time: 6850.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and the question too is audience as well because I mean the mac pro has historically been one of the  Smallest sellers in their lineup exactly because it's just a tiny audience  Right because their their appeal is consumers  So, you know and a lot of those people are getting perfectly happy with a macbook air or an imac or what have you  So they're really trying to hit that that one percent or whatever of their markets. It really needs that it's important to them  It is important because they they're influencers. They need to get those absolutely people and I think as christina says it's really interesting question  They've teased that the mac pro is coming. So they know that's a challenge they have to deal with

Start time: 6850.80
End time: 6859.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But how are they going to address it? It's not going to be as simple as just stacking another couple of processors  No, I really don't think that's going to solve the issue because you don't have the gpu

Start time: 6860.50
End time: 6868.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's hard to imagine also at the same time that now that they've deployed an architecture  That's basically the same throughout the rest of their product lines. We're going to have one product that has

Start time: 6875.46
End time: 6887.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think honestly they should write off that market. It's such a small market  they've you know  I don't think it's important. I think it's a tough proposition for them. They're gonna lose them because honestly they don't compete

Start time: 6887.80
End time: 6911.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're not competitive right because at this point they're not if you're spending ten thousand dollars plus, you know on a machine  If you're going to that thing then  At this point the software advantage that you have with apple. I don't know  Where that is because most people who are doing that levels of computing the gpu frankly are doing machine learning stuff  They're using kuda which is nvidia. They're not using amd anyway, right or they're using customized, you know, very specifically

They're all using python. I mean, come on really  That's not  That's not the fastest  Well, anyway, um, you know, there are all sorts of considerations and that's why being a lifestyle company  Is interesting and it does that that isn't the same thing as being a a pro product  That's a very very different thing. I don't think they need that pro market to be honest  It's we'll have a lot to talk about in a few months maybe in june at wwdc  Let's take a little break our show today brought to you by wealth front  Now we were talking earlier about you know getting into venture capital and stuff but for  I would say everybody job one  Is is being sensible not playing the stonks market not diamond hands not to the moon  But putting away money to build your wealth step by step  Trust me retirement comes faster than you think  It's just around the corner the kids will be going to college just around the corner, uh, you want to get that house  stock trading, I think  As fun as it is  Best enjoyed in moderation.

Transcript:  You know, okay, but but objectively though  Okay, when I was in high school when when like 20 years ago  We had a way where there was an open protocol messaging plot thing that a number of different services could use and we could have  a  some adm and pigeon  Adm and trillion and and dead aim and those where you could be talking to your friends on all those different services in one interface  You know even 15 years ago. We had that with with iChat that was built into you know, um,  Max and in adm and all that stuff  So  I mean there's a point where I think you're right like part of it is nostalgia for sure and and and people like overly being  glorified, you know glorifying the past  But I also feel like we definitely lost something that existed when then people and I will say twitter  Didn't start out necessarily in this way where it actually it was pretty cool before ashton kutcher joined it  Well, but also they were fairly open in terms of standards and protocols and things like that  They were and then they made the decision because they they saw it as a competitive advantage  He's saying I did. Yeah. Yeah, and and then that's what I think that  I i'm glad that he's saying that and taking responsibility because  I I feel like it's not his fault  but I feel like it's if  all the the web 2 companies that started out really embracing the open aspects of the web and interoperability  Hadn't then made an about face and and cut off api access to certain companies and and say oh no  We're we're not going to work with these sorts of standards and we're going to silo our data streams and whatnot  Then you know  I think that things would be a lot better and a lot different and you might not have  Some of the same kind of grifters that are glomming on to I think a very good idea, which is decentralization.

Transcript:  And the vcs who are promoting web the only way things change is if motivations change and if it's always going to be about money  It's always going to be a power grab where they'll try to centralize it  So it's there's going to be someone else who's going to have to take on that mantle  But if it's at the heart going to be for money  Then the no, I mean a government might need to do it, but who's going to trust them?

Start time: 7489.08
End time: 7517.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's kind of somewhere in between but I think there is a there's also the argument that a lot of the reason that these things  Are still there but aren't necessarily as well traveled is because a lot of the centralization also made things easier for a lot of people  And and that's for good and for bad right like there  The fact that it's just so much more accessible and that this stuff works better because the money got shoveled into it and they were  Able to design fundamentally a product that was much more user friendly

Transcript:  Well, but I think but it's interesting right because in one sense I agree with you wesley  But I am going to push back a little bit like I feel like it the the motives need to change sure  But I also feel like the the monetary thing  I think sometimes that can change if you can prove that you can make money by doing things more openly  case in point even though obviously  Like facebook's like whole mission basically has been to kind of create an operating system for the web and and we have created these silos  the open web  Beed out the the online services, right?  Like that that was the because people realized that they could make more money not being tied into those  Closed ecosystems. Um, you know the compuServe the america online's the you know prodigies and and that sort of thing like the open web  one  Um big time and and lots of companies had been betting on on the so-called information superhighway and that wasn't what succeeded  It was the worldwide web

Transcript:  I mean, well, well, no, no the internet was the web wasn't I mean it was it was created by by researchers  My profit, yeah nonprofits, but my point being like  The the but still you had all these big corporations  You had their invested reasons for wanting people to stay in their own siloed things and it didn't work now  you've had things become re-siloized, but  I feel like there will always be  Some sort of value to me. I think that's what makes the web special is that it  Even though we can de facto be owned and controlled by a number of large groups and depending on where you live in the world  And how you have access you might only see a certain type of it  Kind of the beauty of it is that it doesn't have to be that way and in fact how it spread  Was not that way. So I mean i'm not trying to be like, you know overly optimistic but

End time: 7738.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  While human nature is against us in our greed. It's also on our side because humans do like  small  Groups they do like small  You know, they like uh approachable networks  um, I think we loved facebook and I think we've turned against it now because of  How it it became corporatized and not as intimate and not as personal  And I I do think that in the long run things like mastodon  Uh, you know our twitch social instance is small, but we all know each other  It's a community and people like communities  And so what's happening is the big companies are developing technologies. It can trickle down  To these smaller companies. We have discord now instead of irc. The discord is a great community  and uh discord to their credit has resisted  Microsoft tried to buy them and they said no  Uh, they're still kind of small private at some point, you know, what's going to happen?  They're going to become big business  And then we'll move on to something similar  But I honestly think that that's good. I think humans will humans natural tendency to form community will find a way  And that's a good thing. I think

What causes that critical mass?

They're really dumb  And I just don't  Have the confidence levels in it. So that's just I i'm not convinced  I mean  I think the the adding the the safety features that they have done over the past several years to  Driver, you know cars with drivers. I think it's been a really positive thing and I think there are definitely some cases where self-driving cars  Work, you know could be really beneficial, especially on highways long drive, etc. But I live in boston  There's no way a self-driving car is going to be able to navigate boston streets. I'm sorry  I will put money down on that. It is a mess, right? Oh boston  Can't drive boston

Transcript:  No one right now tesla has the name brand of self-driving and it has a horrible reputation  I remember the first time I got into a friend's  self-driving car  um, it was a  Tank girl, uh miramajor and we were she showed me her screen and it showed the lines and the lines were doing this  And this is where the car I was like, uh-uh  You don't know where the line is like I am not no that let's not do self-drive  It's just one of those things where it's just like I do not trust it  And so in order for people to then gain that trust that you're going to need to  Tell more than saying it's self-driving. They're going to have to say this is a technology we use  This is how far we've come  This is all the mitigation that we have done and here are the use cases where it's optimal  Here's some that is not optimal so people can really understand how it works  What it's good for when it's not good for which is the part that really needs to be defined  So people can understand does this?  Just like the bad reviews on amazon if you are using a hairdryer in the bathtub and it doesn't doesn't work  And you got shocked, you know, like I don't use a hairdryer  So there needs to be a clear clear understanding of  When this does work and where it fails and they need to be upfront about it before people can start trusting it.

Transcript:  I I have hopes I think the technology is going to come around. Are we there yet?  I don't think we are but I actually think that the wesley I think what you said was perfect  Which is there are going to be some use cases where I think this would really work  Like I think that on large stretches of highway where we know exactly what's going on and we have a really clear vision on this  I think that it could be really good and in that case like this is one of the reasons why  Big trucking has been one of the areas where they've experimented the most with with self-driving cars because you could drastically change  How much you can deliver things by you know, not having to always have like a human and car that that you know  The hours that the truckers do already are you know pretty brutal but this would allow even more things to happen that way  but in in places like boston or in other places where like, you know, you might have  Really difficult to kind of  I guess predict traffic patterns or you have a lot of like pedestrian mix in where people don't always follow the the correct rules  I don't know if it's the right avenue for that and then there's the tweet from elon yesterday

Transcript:  Uh, let's see. What else is going on?  I maybe we'll take a little quick break because it is getting late and I don't want to keep you guys too late  But uh one more break and then we'll wrap it up with our esteemed  Panel christina warren and wesley faulkner and uh, dan mooren. It's really fun to hang out with you guys on a sunday evening  Our show today brought you by podium  I think one thing we learned during the pandemic is that people don't want to talk on the phone. They want to text  Texting is great. There aren't enough hours in the day to waste time playing phone tag  And if you're a business owner, you know the list of customers you need to reach out to isn't getting any shorter  Especially as business starts to get better. That's why local businesses everywhere  Turn to podium  Podium makes every interaction as easy as sending a text  So everything that makes your business great can be get done faster  I remember leaving the dentist. I was so surprised as I was going out the door  I got the text which I always love your appointment is scheduled for the day with you know  If you do on the iphone, I just click the link and it adds it to my calendar  And then a text saying leave us a review if you hadn't liked our service  Awesome, by the way a great way to get reviews on yelp or google or wherever by just  Texting your customer as they leave  Much more likely to respond if they've had a good experience  Podium can collect money. You can pay your bills with podium. You can make bids  More and more I don't call contractors or repair people or plumbers. I just text them  And the one that answers the fastest is the one's going to get the job  And generally the one that answers fastest is when using podium a single inbox means it's easy  To respond all your employees will like it. It's not just a better way to communicate  It's a better way to do everything not just gathering reviews and collecting payments but marketing your customers  It's all as easy as pressing send. There's nothing comes even close  So you'll you'll be in touch with your customer better  You can also put it on your website, which is great  And again a single inbox means you don't have to deal with a lot of different inputs  You can handle it all in one podium inbox. You not only free up time. You'll grow your business  You'll get more done with podium who close deals with customers before the competition even has a chance to call them back  Join the more than 100 000 businesses that already use podium. I bet you you know a few businesses that do  In your neck of the woods, they streamline their customer interactions and you know what many of them are doing it free  That's right  You can get started free  podium.com  slash  twit  If you sign up for a paid podium account you get a free credit card reader  So either way whatever works for you. There are some restrictions of course podium podium.com  Twit it really is the easiest way to stay in touch and you know what as speaking as a customer  It's the best way I far prefer a text message from a business. I don't want to call  An email forget it. I'm never going to see it  So don't even don't even bother  Hey, we had a great week this week on twit you want to watch a promo too bad you're gonna hear  It's funny. I I don't know if other people are noticing it  But I have just really noticed that everything and the stress levels are much higher. There's a lot of tension  Uh interactions.

So  Um, i'm i'm hoping to do something around that. I do like that idea of using git for non programmers other ways like novelists or
