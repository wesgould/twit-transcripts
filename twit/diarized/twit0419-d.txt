Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know if this is a problem for a lot of people, but it's my problem. But I  find that the people I know on path who tend to be in the tech industry use it  for like the bragging that they wouldn't feel comfortable doing on Facebook and  Twitter. That makes it really unappealing. And it's like, oh, you know, you can't post  your private jet or you're like backstage with Jay-Z photo because that would be  more than humble bragging. But you can put it on path.  I think your seat is filled with pictures of Jay-Z and private jet.  This is how many people I know who are backstage at the random. I mean, that  sounds like I'm bragging now.  Now you're bragging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it was right in the middle of everything.  Oh, wow. It was when it looked like they were going more towards Facebook.  So it's kind of funny if you watch it back, because they talked about how  they talked to get down, Google, a lot, which was interesting. Right. Right.

End time: 374.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. That's kind of surprising, actually.  You don't want to save those tapes.  WhatsApp, which is still independent, but valued immensely.  That's a social app that you don't use it.  You don't know about it. If you use it, you really know about it.  It replaces text messaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I just noticed I was looking at my SoundCloud account  where I put some of my podcasts and you can share them directly on Pinterest.  I don't know what they look like on Pinterest or sound like.  But so I may actually start using it now because I create zero  interesting things to look at.  But if you can put on interest.

Start time: 430.08
End time: 435.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what the point of these humiliations are.  But you guys are talking about valuation.

Start time: 435.72
End time: 453.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, OK, so I'm going to that's not the only thing.  I'm going somewhere with valuation.  No, but that's the point.  Where is there's this vast amount of money floating around this stuff?  But none of this really seems to have much traction.  You know what I'm saying is that I don't.  Pinterest could be gone tomorrow.  And it's not like there's going to be.

Start time: 454.34
End time: 467.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I actually totally disagree with you.  And I think that's why it's interesting, because people, you know,  don't use Pinterest and it still has a massive audience because we're now  at this point where there's so many people who are connected to broadband  and using smartphones that you don't know all of them.

Start time: 467.76
End time: 475.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  I'll just post some photos on Pinterest.  I'll link to some photos that I've taken on Pinterest.  And so people follow my photography board.  And that's great. But I end up doing the home improvement stuff.  I had a board for home improvement.  And we're working on this edition on our house right now.  And we were at the hardware store today and I had to pick out these new cabinets.  And I and I had remembered that we picked this pantry design.  I pinned it like eight months ago on Pinterest.  And that's the one we ended up going with.  It was the first time I was using Pinterest, like all day today  for the first time in a while.  But I had pinned it all there.  It was all there and I was able to use it.

End time: 524.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you couldn't like just save this in a folder someplace on your own machine?  Well, of course, it's useful for him.  But the question is, you know, if I think let's go back to the premise  or the original question was this thing disappears tomorrow.  What difference does it make?  Does everybody go up in arms?  They start protesting around the White House.

End time: 570.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 571.08
End time: 580.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I agree. Thumbs down. Yeah.  Trey, I think, told me he gets more traffic through Pinterest  for sales of his photographic prints anywhere else.  But even then, he that is the reason people think.

Start time: 580.26
End time: 586.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, then I'm all for it is the referral traffic,  which is which is not really an exciting thing to talk about.  Nothing like mercantilism.

Start time: 587.16
End time: 606.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Crafts and things up there and they don't want to use a marketplace like Etsy.  So all of these independent craftmakers who are making really unique things,  able to sell and get their website noticed through through a site like Pinterest,  where you have all of these people who are trying to replicate those crafts  or birthday parties and get togethers and all those sorts of things.  I mean, I think it's really doing a lot of a lot of interesting things.

Start time: 606.80
End time: 616.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is going to show my ignorance.  So I searched for Clayton Morris.  I obviously found Clayton Morris.  You have your name up here.  That's because I'm logged into my Pinterest account.  But how do I follow you?

Start time: 617.60
End time: 621.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 654.13
End time: 663.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no, this is weird.  I just searched for myself.  People actually pin things about me.  I don't know who these people are.  It's like I'm being pinned by guys.

Start time: 663.74
End time: 668.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought, OK, there you go.  Clip of the day.  Yeah.

Start time: 668.44
End time: 670.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe you have to move over to this side of the table now.

Start time: 670.94
End time: 678.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, so you could search for pins,  which is things that are pinned about me.  God, that's a horrible picture.

Start time: 678.36
End time: 682.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at that terrible picture of you.  Tell it to just get rid of it.  Who did that?

Start time: 683.50
End time: 684.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We should report the content.

Start time: 684.80
End time: 687.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can't you wipe it out?  No, somebody's pinned it.

Start time: 687.62
End time: 726.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Flag it for being inappropriate.  This is people who are pinning stuff about me.  Yeah.  And then pinners, which would be me and some guy named me.  All right.  So now we've had a little mini.  All right, that's enough.  Enough promotion for this.  But I'm just I'm just wondering how there's so many social media.  So you think it's just because it's massive and it's universal,  that it's fragmented and there are people in different groups.  But as somebody who's trying to invest, and I'm not,  but I mean, and all these massive valuations,  I wonder how you pick who's going to be a winner.  It's hard to know, isn't it?  Because it's it's very narrow slices of.

Start time: 727.50
End time: 732.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a lot harder than it used to be because it really depends on network  effects and VCs can't create network effects.

Start time: 732.82
End time: 742.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And then what does this mean for Facebook?  Which is the overarching giant.  Yeah. Is is Facebook in trouble because they aren't specific enough?

Start time: 743.16
End time: 762.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, actually, I think that's why they're successful.  I think that the fact that there will be niches and they'll be Facebook  and Facebook will, number one, be the link that brings you to many of these sites.  Right. How many of them have clicking or what they all have?  Yeah. And it's it's still the it's still the overall arch.  So I think it's I think it's fine for Facebook.  If I were Facebook, I'd actually be happy about it.

Start time: 763.44
End time: 788.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All your pins go right to Facebook.  If you put it right, if you if you select it that way, just the same with path.  Right. If I just tweeted out a picture I took on path using the Lumia 1020  to take a picture of my screen of Leo just a minute ago, I decided I'm going to push  that out to Twitter. Right.  It's home is on path the same the same as with Pinterest.  I'm able to then push that to Facebook.  A lot of the traffic I ended up getting on Pinterest was as a result of Facebook.  Right. So I was just talking to someone from Pinterest.

Start time: 788.66
End time: 809.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I interviewed on Friday.  So pretty recently and they were saying that don't comparing us.  So this is an internal opinion of theirs comparing us to Twitter and Facebook  doesn't make sense.  What makes more sense is comparing us to a discovery version of Google.  So instead of searching for things, you're finding things based on other people's  inspirations. And it's a re indexing of everything versus, you know,  a way to connect your friends.

Start time: 809.94
End time: 836.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And presumably people who use Pinterest would agree with that.  That's what they're using it. That's how they're using it.  It sounds like I just I think it's interesting because what we're what we're  seeing is a huge fragmentation.  We see the top of the iceberg, the Twitter, the Facebook.  And then there's this fragmentation below that's only going to increase.  And I just that's not bad.  That's not a bad thing at all.  It just means it's hard to pick a winner because what does it mean to be a winner?

Start time: 837.16
End time: 854.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's also hard to pick as a consumer.  It's hard to pick where you want to post. Right.  Like I can't post on every single network out there.  So, you know, I'm into Facebook.  I'm into Twitter.  Play around a little bit with Instagram.  But at some point you get tired of jumping around.  So how do how do we users figure out where to go?  I think that's a great question.

Start time: 855.24
End time: 856.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's a great question.

Start time: 856.16
End time: 863.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, because I think Google Plus had a great question.  It's because two out of three said it was a great question.  Oh, well, there's a vote where we got Liz.  There she has made a vote.

Start time: 864.82
End time: 865.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was reading the chat.

Start time: 866.58
End time: 915.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, look at Google Plus. Right.  I mean, we all we all wrote Google Plus off at the beginning, right.  After Google Buzz came out and we thought, well, you know, what a disaster that was.  Yeah. And we wrote off Google Plus.  How are you going to come out and have gangbusters support  and create a massive social network in the face of Facebook and Twitter?  How are you going to do it?  And, you know, Google, Google Plus at the beginning was a little  there was no one there.  Now it's beautiful.  And I spend more time now on Google Plus because of the way that I can,  you know, integrate photos.  It's clean. It just has this clean.  It's sort of my brain works.  I just want to see clean, nice looking time.  If I'm going to spend and get some news, a little bit of news,  I'm going to post some photos, look at some other people's photographs,  some communities, you know, have some technology communities  and some Phillies communities and those sorts of things.  And then I'm out, you know, and I don't need the craziness.  The mess of Facebook is an absolute disaster.

Start time: 916.22
End time: 919.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I go first to Google Plus in the morning and I do not go to Facebook.

Start time: 920.50
End time: 934.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's ironic what you just said, Clayton, is because Facebook was the  alternative to MySpace, which was the absolute absolute disaster.  And Facebook with a clean, well lighted version of MySpace.  And now you're saying that Facebook is too messy, which is I find.

Start time: 935.16
End time: 982.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess part of the reason I ask the question is because of the  that the two word phrase is so important, the network effect that right  up to now, what was important was you get the mass audience.  The network effect happens because it snowballs.  And once you get a certain level, then everybody follows you.  And it was I am was that way when, you know, when there are 15 I am clients.  It was hard to know where your friends were.  But if everybody's on AOL or aim, then that's where you are going to be.  And and in fact, it actually broke down along national borders.  Microsoft Messenger was huge in Canada, not big here, but huge in Canada.  And so if you wanted to talk to somebody in Canada, you'd go on MSN Messenger.  So the now it's fragmented and it's a good thing.  It's because everybody has their own niche, but that kind of then  eliminates the network effect.  I don't know how the network.  I don't think it was ever a network.

Start time: 982.08
End time: 1000.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Fragmented. It's just bigger.  So I was just what I was just looking up as there was a new  like tweets per second record. How big is it now?  So it's just massively, massively bigger than it was six months ago.  And before that, everybody's on Twitter.  The fact well, but like there's just it's not like we're leaving  my space to go to Facebook anymore.  There's just more. Right.

Start time: 1001.04
End time: 1033.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That by the way, this is not by the way, this is not a network effect.  I think there's a mistake.  I think you're looking at increasing returns of the economic model,  which is the one where everyone goes to where everyone is,  which was the thing that Microsoft was fighting against the government  because there was a Stanford couple, Stanford economics professors  came up with increasing returns because we always had diminishing returns  when we went to college.  It turns out with these tech things, it's the other way. Right.  Because if everyone's developing apps for the iPhone,  that's where the market becomes because there's more apps there.  And so everyone develops more apps and more people buy the iPhone.  And it's like you don't get the other effect.

Transcript:  Think about it. All right.  Things that are popular succeed.  Well, this might be a reason why.  And I love Lorenzo.  Just Lorenzo Arano just tweeted me, said,  this is an important point to bring up about Pinterest.  It's that it's about pictures and where I might not be following  personally on Facebook to see that I like these shoes.  He makes the point that it's very successful in the fashion wedding industry  and that if a woman sees a pair of shoes, she might not be able to speak Spanish,  but she knows the love of shoes.  And so she clicks on it.  She pins that she might buy those shoes from Spain.  She can't even read the Spanish that's associated with that post.  She's not going to be friends with a person who might be from Spain  if she doesn't speak that language.  So Pinterest offers something that Facebook simply does not offer.  I think that's a very interesting point.  This is an aside, but we were talking about how I got married four years ago.

I mean, you're going to be even sadder if you got married.  I'm OK with it.  I didn't need to have like an every detail is perfect wedding,  but it could have been pretty neat to find things because of it.

Transcript:  I guess my model is the wrong model because I have the media model.  So in the old days, there were the big media, you know, NBC, CBS, ABC.  We all watched that.  That was the one you talked about when you came in in the morning.  You watched what was on Carson.  Everybody watched the same thing.  And then the media got highly fragmented and became very niche.  And, you know, besides Shark Week, there's no thing that we all watch  at the same time anymore.  And and I think in some ways that's hurt.  And in some ways, it's been beneficial for media.  So that's one thing.

Transcript:  But then collectively, you all come together around big events, right?  Because I still. Yeah. Right.  And so we still want that.  I think there was a study a few years ago that pointed out that we had this idea  that because of the DVR and because of streaming, we weren't going to have  these sort of collective experiences anymore.  That was going to go away, right?  We weren't ever going to be able to gather around the water cooler  and talk about things anymore.  We were just going to be drones waddling away.  But that's not the case.  People are still the we're still having these big event shows.  We're still having these big event watch watching experiences.  And we're still having these communities, whether they're taking place  on social media or other places.

You know, I used to watch Walter Cronkite and everybody I knew  could talk about what was on the CBS, even if it made him hugely influential.  Huge. But now it's all Twitter.  Now it's it's what are people tweeting?  What are people posting on Facebook?  How is social media interpreting whether you see it on Fox or NBC or CBS?  Doesn't matter.  Most of us are probably reading it on the web to begin with.  But how many of us actually get our news from Twitter?  I mean, I sometimes get my breaking news on Twitter, and then I go off  to media to try to get some depth on it.  I think that we you're right.  We do still have a bit of that water cooler. Just different.

And OK, let's presume it's going to be 18 years.  What of these is going to be around 18 years from now? Squarespace.  You know what I told her, and it came from that Google ad.  I said, create a Gmail account  and mail her pictures and stories and letters to her.  And then when she's 18, give her the account.  And that was the only thing I could think of that.

Well, first of all, if the only the only way it succeeds is because it is about  this mythic character.  And so and some of these stories are all very well known.  So it's not nothing new.  It's it's probably it's probably nothing.  No, there's certainly no realizations in there.  But this because the stories are so great, you know, of Steve Jobs,  you know, firing people and so forth, it that's entertaining in that level.  But to see Ashton Kutcher smirk at the end of every scene was just too much to bear.  And at one point, you know, he makes a big deal about he studies Steve's walk  and he learned it.  First of all, I mean, Steve didn't have a particularly unusual walk.

And afterwards, we had this little impromptu conversation.  Everybody who had seen it just was standing around and all these guys  who had worked with jobs and I, of course, who followed covered jobs over the years.

I mean, it was it was a worse portrayal of Steve Jobs  in the social network was of Mark Zuckerberg, and that was pretty bad.  And, you know, and it's hard.  I know you've got a person that just died.  So a lot of people actually know him.  If this were Abraham Lincoln, you know, it's hard to sit around  for that reason and talk about what he was really like.  But it was a very bad portrayal of him.  And he also didn't even deal with the point where jobs was actually a success  after he took up Apple, it just kind of ended with the iPod coming out.  And never really got to the point where where he actually made a huge contribution.

And so then his complaint was, you guys really shouldn't write to me on my birthday  because I feel obliged to look at all of them.  And so you're making me stay up all night.

End time: 2093.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 2093.70
End time: 2111.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, he had a conflict.  Can general terms. I mean, he'd go meet the guy.  The guys, let's face it, Carl Icahn comes in someplace.  The first thing you're not going to do is say, Carl, our next quarter earnings  through the roof, there's going to be way over analyst prediction.  Get in. Now, that would be a little sketchy.

Start time: 2131.02
End time: 2167.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But so I can't know unless he told him something that's insider information,  technically that can be actionable by the FCC, the FCC, the SEC.  It's totally legal. Here's what you do.  You go and you talk to some guy.  This is a great guy. I love this guy.  In fact, I actually had a conversation once with Ross Perot, believe it or not,  when Steve Jobs was starting next, and they had chatted with each other.  And Perot says, I just like what he said.  That was the reason he invested because he just likes the guy.  So I can't go in this is this a guy like is a guy you hang out, maybe have a beer.  I love this guy. I'm investing in the company.  That's actually legal.

Start time: 2174.16
End time: 2196.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It could be a pump and dump.  I mean, look at the look at this is what bothers me.  Look at the price jump.  So when he talked and tweeted Apple was at four hundred seventy five bucks,  it jumped as a result and has ended the week at five hundred two bucks.  That's about, I don't know what, a five percent increase.  If he bought a billion dollars and made a lot of money immediately,  that would be questionable.

Start time: 2196.46
End time: 2231.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I had a long conversation with Horowitz about this, whether  where do you draw the line at pump and dump?  I mean, it seems to me that, you know, there's people tweeting stuff.  There's that thing with the head of Netflix who actually  he tweeted the situate, you know, something about a stock is going to really rock.  And then they sued him.  And then it turns out now that Twitter is is enough of a public forum  that now that consider public.  Yeah. So there's a public comment, which shows that the stock goes up.  That this is like making an announcement or press release.  And so I can sketch who is a a a a what is he?

Start time: 2231.24
End time: 2263.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do they call him? An activist investor.  He's the guy who's causing all sorts of problems right now.  A tell with the Dell.  Yeah. I mean, he's so and he's got enough cash.  He can move in with a big position, a billion dollars.  What he wants, it turns out, is for Apple to buy back more stock.  And in fact, his subsequent tweet was had a nice conversation  with Tim Cook today discussed my opinion that a larger buyback should be done now.  We plan to speak again shortly.  And the impression that one would get from this is, oh, good.  Carl's buying a billion.  He must think there's a big buyback coming.

Start time: 2264.12
End time: 2277.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If a buyback comes, it changes the price earnings ratio.  And usually the stock goes up.  It's a it's a something of a scam.  And this maybe went in there to lecture Tim Cook.  Who knows what the conversation was like, but whatever the case,

Start time: 2278.92
End time: 2284.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  guarantee you, Tim didn't say, you know, you're right, Carl.  We're going to buy more stock back.  Thank you for calling.  All he has to do is nod his head.

Start time: 2284.88
End time: 2296.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, I like your theory, Clayton.  I'm not thinking, you know, Carl says, I'm thinking about buying a new timepiece for my wrist.  It's just an idea.  Should I buy it now or should I wait till after the holidays?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the point really is that it isn't anything to do with new technologies,  although many of us assume that, well, September 10th is coming.  Maybe there's a big announcement.  It has more to do with the stock buyback than anything else.

Start time: 2317.48
End time: 2334.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's the whole thing.  I mean, the market, the market often does not reflect the reality of the real market.  Often the consumer market.  Always.  And I in many ways, I get annoyed when I get called all the time.  They want me to comment on the market jump.  And it just doesn't correlate to the real world of what you and I are buying in the,  you know, in the stores.

Start time: 2334.54
End time: 2364.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My other question.  Well, actually, we should take a break and come back.  My other question has more to do with the iPhone and the iWatch  and what Apple's going to announce September 10th.  Not so much with Carl Icahn.  Well, tell us now.  Well, let's take a break and come back.  We'll talk about the new iPhone.  Have a snack. It's a good time to get your blood sugar going and feel better.  Tease.

Transcript:  No, that's good. Actually, I just dug the laser disk player out of storage and I said it.  I put it on the shelf with the intention of the next time I'm there to plug it in and fire it up.  Because I gotta be honest with you, there are actually a lot of those Criterion Edition discs that I have and some of those other ones that they've never reproduced on DVD.

Start time: 2463.32
End time: 2482.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oxidizes.  And they're huge. And so the likelihood of getting a big seal on a device that big, I suppose a little one.  Same thing happens with DVDs, but less likely.  Right, because they're smaller and you have a better, those leverages are different.  But yeah, most laser disks are no good.  Oh, that's sad.  We have a. There's one brand in particular, no one.

We were talking about Squarespace.  You may remember a guy named Dane Atkinson was one of the founders of Squarespace.  He has a new company, which I love.  We've talked about it before called SumAll.  It has been an insane month for SumAll.  Twenty percent growth over the last month.  Now, 60,000 companies and customers are using it.  It's a data analytics service gives you the kind of business intelligence  the big guys have for you for free.  And there's lots of value in it.  You connect all your services, Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus,  blogger, Tumblr, Google Analytics, Bitly.  Look at all the Amazon.  They've they've merged it all in together into one big blob.  PayPal, authorized.net, AdWords, Shopify, Bing.  And then they just added Instagram, Foursquare, Tumblr, Blogger,  Moe's, Stripe, Braintree, BigCommerce and more.  So if you're doing commerce, if you have, for instance, a Squarespace platform  using Stripe for your e-commerce, you add that to the analytics.  And suddenly you're getting great analytics, great information, great presentations.  You connecting all your services.  And here's something really exciting.  SumAll has announced an API,  which means you and your customers are going to get improved modern analytics  and integrate that into the stuff you've got internally.  You can get personalized daily or weekly emails.  They're going to have a mobile app or you could have a mobile app for your data.  SumAll, if you want to get in line and get get get going on that new SumAll API,  visit sumall.com slash developer.  Make sure you mention Twitter when you do that.

Sixty thousand companies now using SumAll, and you can do it to  reserve your spot in the SumAll API at SumAll.  S-U-M-A-L-L dot com slash developer.  Liz is doing it right now.

My friend, Renee Richie, Diemore says, yeah, I got a call right after that  from a very, very good source confirming it.  And then, of course, we know it's true because Dow Ripple said, yep. Right.  Yeah, I'm down.  Ripple, the loop apparently is somehow like the guy.  And if he says, yep, that's just written in stone.  You might as well just book the flight.  But everybody agrees.

They have not set a specific date,  but they did the fifth beta last week.  I think it's very close to done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why do you say this?  Because there's too much diversity in the market.  It's like Pinterest.  There's too much that's fractured now.  So you're saying there's not going to be a line.  And I say that as somebody waited six hours  to get the first iPhone.

Start time: 3159.76
End time: 3188.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's a combination of, first of all, pre-ordering online.  A lot of people don't need to go online.  I think there's going to be a line.  There haven't been lines in years.  No, it hasn't been years.  And it also depends on what they announce.  If they announce something, it's really groundbreaking, maybe.  But if it's what most people think it's going to be,  a minor upgrade, a few bells and whistles,  I don't see long lines.  And I think Leo is right.  I mean, people are buying all sorts of phones these days.  Apple doesn't no longer dominates the market.  So they may manufacture a line,  but I don't think there'll be a natural one.

But it's to stay asleep under those circumstances is quite difficult.  Because as soon as you know you're in a dream, you wake up.  You start to wake up and you try to force.

Start time: 3277.00
End time: 3289.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because you're becoming a very mercantile person since you started this company.  No idea why this was in my mind.  You talk about valuations.  So I'm talking with one of our former co-op interns, Jeff Needles.

End time: 3321.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he said, oh, they don't make any money on this.  And no, no, those are ads.  And let's let's estimate they're doing maybe 50 a day and and that they have,  you know, they make maybe they charge five bucks each.  I'm starting to do math in my head.  And then I said, the question is how many stores they have.  And I literally in my sleep, I said, OK, Google now.  How many stores does Kmart have?  Now, the funny thing is, in my dream, it didn't do a good job of this.  It actually does this perfectly.  See if they've got one thousand three hundred and seven.

Start time: 3321.16
End time: 3328.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's kind of creepy that it was sitting there listening to us that whole time.  And as soon as he said that, it just woke up.  Isn't that weird? And it gave me the answer.

Start time: 3329.02
End time: 3341.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But in the in the dream, it gave me the wrong answer.  He said twenty two thousand.  And I said, well, that means they're making one hundred fifty million dollars a year.  I did the math in my head how much they were making a year.  This is weird, you know, is that creepy or weird or what?

Start time: 3380.20
End time: 3403.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. So the other thing that it does, which is cool, we mentioned this before,  but I've got it paired with the Bluetooth here.  So it's unlocked when I'm next to my computer.  So because the OK Google now does not work when you're locked.  Maybe that's what I did it again.  That's why it didn't work in my dreams because my my phone wasn't unlocked.  Maybe I think it's really time. It's a dream.  There's a lot of reasons to understand context better.

Start time: 3403.60
End time: 3415.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because I mean, that's a really much better experience  that is connected by Bluetooth to your computer.  Like and it should be does it do that when you're getting your car?  Does it know your Bluetooth in your car?  Yeah, once you get it, it sends text messages saying you want that to be authenticated.

Start time: 3415.04
End time: 3426.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You want to be that to be a permission to unlock and you say yes.  And then, yeah, they have this this thing where you set it up  with the Motorola assist where when you're driving, how does it does it read?

Start time: 3426.98
End time: 3441.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is kind of a pet pet cause.  But I think we are woefully unaddressing the lax.  We are not.  It is the we are terribly underdressed.  We are terribly unsafe when we're driving our cars with our phones nearby.  We have so what is this?

Start time: 3442.02
End time: 3450.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This will if I don't pick up, it'll send a text.  I'm driving and I'll get back to you soon.  Unfortunately, it says sent by Motorola assist and you can't edit that.  Oh, it drives me nuts.

Start time: 3451.36
End time: 3466.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So one advantage of the of the Google phone is that when you're driving,  you can get directions without even like with Apple.  You've got to touch the Siri button.  And of course, you get directions.  Come on, Apple Maps, which I hate.  But with Google, you could actually get car directions  without taking your hands off the wheel.  I think that's a good thing.

Start time: 3466.24
End time: 3483.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I guess the point is that Apple is entering a very crowded space with some.  I mean, I'm not saying the Motorola X is the best phone  or the HTC One is the best phone or the Galaxy is the best phone.  But there are some really good phones.  Now you're hedging your bet.  I'm just saying that the whole reason we brought this up like a note at 1020.

By the way, speaking of sad stories, this is the week Blackberry finally said,  yeah, we're going to throw in the towel, I think they said we're in it for a buyer.  And Windows Phone had the same problem, which is it came to the market late.  Blackberry missed the market by six years.  Windows Phone only three years, but still it's a crowded market.  And if you don't get mindshare early on, Windows Phone is about three  point seven percent of the market worldwide.  And it's tough when you've got Android just eating it up.

Transcript:  It's just it's some of some of this, though, is historic.  And I talked to Rich Overholt, who was the guy who at Motorola,  who showed us the Moto X, but was the guy who created Moto Blur,  which was the worst, by the way, carrier or a handset manufacturer  adaptation of Android.  I said, Rich, that Moto Blur, you want to take credit for that?  He said, well, you got to understand that Android version two three three  gingerbread was terrible, wasn't really ready for end users.  We had to do stuff.  But I think that that's changed.  And I think that's what he said.  And he's responsible for this.  And it's good enough now.  Jelly Bean is so, so simple, clean, fast.  It's great. It's in fact the interoperability between apps.

Transcript:  Leo, I think is the key. Right.  I did like an informal survey on social media just a few days ago  because I was curious about this.  I posted it up to like this, you know, tons of people on Google Plus,  Facebook, all over.  What five apps are you using?  Doesn't matter what Android, iOS, whatever.  What five things do you launch every day, which you find indispensable?  So I went through these and began to collate some of this overwhelmingly.  The top one, two and three responses were all social media.  And so in Android, the ability to share with one click from any app  to any of the things you have installed, whereas in iOS, two, three,  four clicks sometimes to get into the app, then to share it to that place  or to move it over here.

Transcript:  It's easy if you're going to share it to an Apple approved place  like Facebook or Twitter. Right.  Not so easy otherwise. Apple controls it.  Let me show you. I just took a picture of you and Liz on my Moto X.  One of the things I like about the camera app is you slide it over  to get to the gallery.  And here's the share button.  Now it shows me what I shared to last up here, which is Instagram.  All of the Androids do this.  But then it shows me the next three that I've used the most common.  And then if I see all these are instead of Apple's, you know, very  such a better experience.  I mean, it's got everything I've installed that I could reasonably share to,  including my television set, Tumblr, Flipboard,  Skitch, Evernote, Foursquare.  Ours is on the sheet.  Now, now Apple users might look at that and go, well,  that's overwhelmingly too much.  But I think they handled it well because they show me one.  So last one. Then they show me three.  Then they show me all.  And it will remember the ones that I've used the most.  I think that that's an example of Google.  And after many iterations will be fair, getting it right.  And I bet you were now in a different situation where companies that over  customized are going to be losing good  and that companies that make it pretty much a clean Google experience  are going to do better.  And this Moto X, that's a perfect example.  I don't even use a launcher on this because I wanted to say,  what does it really look like if you just out of the box, the plain experience?

Here's the difference between the iOS YouTube app and in the YouTube app  for Android, unless I'm completely wrong about this.  But I don't find a very easy way to find the trending videos within the iOS app.  In fact, I don't think it's there at all.  It's not it's not a major link right inside the app.  And so Google makes both these apps. So it's not Apple's fault.  Have the trending version. I don't know, but they just left it out.  So sitting there just on the Chromecast, launching the YouTube app.  And we watched like the top five trending videos on YouTube.  And we loved it.  We watched the Manning brothers do that direct TV football ad.  You know, the top five.  I'm like, it was funny.  But like, I wouldn't have known that these were the videos.  And I enjoyed all five of them. Right.

But so, by the way, they have a whole page now on great books  that you should read before you or listen to before you read the movie.  And this is really fun. Everything.

And probably, you know, if in a normal business environment would say,  let's talk to the publishers and they're going to say, no, don't do it.  And he wouldn't release it.  But he wanted to make sure that this publishers got the heat for this, not him.  So he released it full bore and let them sue him.  And he looks like the good guy and they look like the bad guy as they are.  And I think that that was a smart I think I guessing completely.  But I guess that that's the chess game Bezos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  or the only people going to install iOS seven are people who paid 99 bucks  and are developers.  Part of the agreement you sign to become a developer is that you will not speak  of it. You cannot talk like Fight Club.  You can be in it, but you can't speak of it.  So we don't like that.  We don't know if you are in Fight Club, Clayton.

We have been working for the last eight to nine months on the iPhone version.  It's still in review.  And I was hoping by the end of Twitter, it may be available to download.

Transcript:  It's all it's only been iPad up to now, but now it'll be on the iPhone.  And just can you see my screen chat or not? Yeah.  So this is what it looks like.  The idea of read quick, because Clayton's like a fan of the Evelyn Wood,  you know, all the speed reading stuff.  He created this app where it's one word at a time.  Now you set the speed.  And what's interesting is you actually can absorb this this way.  And it teaches you right, Clayton, it teaches you to read faster.

And Peter was saying when I was he was like he's up to like 650 words a minute.  Wow. He was helping me with the app way back when.  And I couldn't believe it.  I mean, I was up to about 500 words per minute.  But most human beings, they read out loud to themselves.  And the idea is that you want to get past the point of verbalizing  every word to yourself and your brain actually sees every word as a photograph.  And so people were the number one request we had from from our from our users.  We want an iPhone version.  We want an iPhone version.  And, you know, you're standing.

Transcript:  I mean, to get.  Because so many people wanted to be able to have pauses  for 15 letter words or longer, just enough.  You know, they're there.  And I agree with them, but they're all these little refinements.  So what type, you know, how is it going to slow down for this?  And you create a timed playlist.  So if I've got 20 minutes on the train, can I read these 20 articles in 20 minutes  and have, you know, and be able to absorb that?  So I'm going to add this to the playlist, making partnerships.

I've never been able to read the news before.  This is the first time I've been able to read the news  because it gets rid of all of the clutter on the side of the screen.

Transcript:  So.  Microsoft and Google don't seem to like each other too much.  It all started a few months ago when, you know, you you  there was never a YouTube app for Windows Phone,  which is a little wave of Google saying up yours, Microsoft. Right.  So Microsoft wrote one.  But it was an unusual app because it allowed you, first of all, didn't show ads  and any of the ads, you know, the embedded ads, nothing.  And it allowed you to download a YouTube video,  which you've never been able to do except with, you know, third party software.  That's maybe a little sketch.  And it's pretty obvious that if you're going to make an app  that breaks all of YouTube's terms of service, YouTube's going to get mad.  So they blocked Microsoft and Microsoft came back and they black and forth.  Finally, they said, OK, we're going to work together.  And apparently they worked together and a new YouTube app  came out a few days ago for Windows Phone.  It did play the ads, I guess.  But after a couple of days, Google has blocked it again.  And I think this is Microsoft sandbagging Google.  I do not blame Google for this. I blame Microsoft.  I think they they set them up the first time.  They knew perfectly well if they released an app that didn't show the ads  and didn't download the videos that Google is going to block it.

Start time: 4928.42

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So basically, you read my column last week.  Did you say this? Yeah.  Same. Tell me the story, because I think it's like I think this is  I agree with you. It's the exact same thesis.  It's that Microsoft's playing Google. They're playing.  They know perfectly well. Like the bad guy, because they can still show.  You can still play the YouTube's by just going to the mobile app.  But they pull that and make it sound as though Google's just a mean company.  They're setting them up. Yeah, I think so, too.

Start time: 4952.40
End time: 4972.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's just and I bet you that most of the people are going to say,  Oh, Google blocked Microsoft again, that that's going to be the.  And yeah, and of course, they missed the point because they say, well,  Google insists in its terms of service that the app be HTML five based  and Google on its own Android app doesn't have HTML five. Right.  Which makes them look like idiots. Right.

Start time: 4974.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

It's in the terms of service.  And I suspect HTML five will be supported on iOS and Android.  So what happens on a Windows phone if you try to play a YouTube video

Apparently, Mayor Bloomberg's spokesman has inadvertently revealed that the next iPhone  will have a fingerprint reader in it.  Clayton got it.  Why does he or she know?  Look, no, I'm telling...  I've been hearing about this for months from...  The comment came after Bloomberg-Turkey for suggesting residents of the city's public  housing be fingerprinted to access their homes.  Bloomberg's remark was made while discussing how to reduce crime in public housing while  defending the mayor, his press secretary, Mark Lavornia, said the following in an email  to Politicker, all security is moving towards biometrics.

First of all, I've been poo-pooing this on MacBreak Weekly every week.  You're probably snickering in the background, Clayton, while you're listening to the show.  As you know better.  But it just seemed to me this is not, and Andy Anakko agreed, I think Renee Richie even  agreed, this is an unlikely thing for Apple to be so far ahead of the pack.

I would expect Apple to have perfected this before they use it.  One.  Two, in order to get this to work, it's the same problem with NFC.  You've got to get merchants and everybody to get on board.  Now, I admit, Apple has a lot of clout in this market.  Do they today have enough clout?  And do they have enough market penetration for stores to say, okay, we're all in, we're  going to...  Because if you do that, you've got to have an iPhone, right?

Hundreds and hundreds of people.  I walk down the aisle, almost all of them on iPhones.  Yeah.  I mean, this is still...  Yes, I'm sure that many, many of them have Android phones and I see a bunch of Android  phones.  But the ability to...  Think about when we talk about voice technology just two...  Not even two years ago now, when the release of the 4S with Siri.  They don't call it voice dictation.  People call it Siri.  Do you have Siri on your phone?  They refer to it that way.  I mean, that's the power of the marketing machine.  That is Apple.  You're going to see millions and millions and millions of dollars spent on holiday advertising  for this.  A feature that's truly ready.

I mean, maybe your New Jersey friends on the train all on iPhones, but the fact of the  matter is that Android's outselling them.  So it seems to me that just as Apple eventually put the iPod on Windows, it would make sense  to make it something that was cross platforming.  That would make it clear.

If I go into a store and they take this Apple thing and you can do a deal with your fingerprint  and I don't have it, I'll just use something else.

And so you stand there waiting and then, especially in California, they load the groceries into  these beat up old Trader Joe bags that are dirty and there's flies buzzing around them  because you have to use these recyclable bags.  It's a disgusting situation.  I hate shopping in these stores with these people.

Transcript:  And by the way, it's not one system, right?  You're using a Visa, MasterCard, American Express.  They are all using different merchant accounts.  If you have a Discover Card system at your shop, you have to pay Discover separately  so that you can have that credit card included in the bundle of credit cards and merchant  account stuff that you accept.  You have a Square account.  It's the same technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, Robin, you don't want to have separate readers.  Like the coffee shop I go to in the morning has a Square reader, which is great.  But I mean, you want to have a system where you don't have to ask the person, oh, which  payment system are you going to use now so I can grab the right piece of technology to  scan your credit card?

Start time: 5971.82
End time: 5991.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Well, no, because I can pay by Square.  There's a phone pay by Square thing.  So I have already set that up when I walk in.  For a store that supports that.  The merchant says, oh, Leo, you're in here.  And all I say is, that's me, charge it to my account.  It's a nice friction-free solution.  And I like it, but it has not taken the world by storm, despite its cross-platform.

I get a free cup of coffee every 15 times I use it.  You can get free flavor boosts.  Yeah, free stuff like that.  But the point of it, it actually is kind of cool.  I do like using it.  And I probably drink more Starbucks coffee than I would otherwise drink if it weren't  for the fact that I take it.

Transcript:  So credit to Mike Elgin, who said that this is going to change identity.  He said this six months ago that I knew iPhone will have a fingerprint reader and it's going  to change everything.  So, I mean, it's true.  Apple is one of the few companies that can move these markets in that way.  Yeah.  Wow.  And Google is that neat?  I don't think they're ready.

Transcript:  But let me be clear.  I don't, from what my sources say, I passbook, still a mess, right?  I know that Apple and maybe they're going to shock us.  It has no credit cards at all right now.  It's just tickets and stuff.  But remember Keychain.  Keychain and iOS 7 was a big feature, of course, at WWDC being able to put replacing sort of  one, you know, last pass and one password on your iPhone.  So storing all of your credit card information in there and you sign in with your iCloud  account, you've got that extra level of encryption, you've got an extra code that you have to  put in as a result of that.  So you have that backup and you have all your credit cards and movie stubs and stubs, your  AMC loyalty cards and your CVS card and all of those things you can store in there.  And using a fingerprint scanner to give authentication for that, that this is in fact the person  who has a CVS card that's going to go pick up their prescription, could be a big thing.  Passbook though is not there yet and I don't know, it may take another year before we see  that next big feature, a passbook.  So I don't know that Apple's there yet with passbook integration with the fingerprint  scanner from all I know.  It's just unlocking right now.

Transcript:  So right.  I mean, the ideal, if they could pass it through to your bank or Facebook or Twitter every  time you have to enter a password, like my bank for good reasons requires me to enter  the password every time I load its app.  And it would be nice if I could just hit the fingerprint reader instead of having to type  in the password.  But will Apple allow its developers to access that data?

Transcript:  I'm excited because I really feel like that if Apple just did kind of a minor improvement,  iOS 7 on the 5S, it would be a big problem for Apple.  But if Apple can do something that is unique and an exciting feature that gets people excited,  that's very important.  And it's going to take something like on this level.  So I'm excited and I believe you Clayton because I know you have great sources.  So I think that's a huge story.

Transcript:  Yeah I've heard it from a couple of spots and it's interesting Renee Richie's point,  our mutual friend.  He made the point, I think he and I were going back and forth online a little bit about  this a few weeks ago, but he had made the point I think on Mac Break Weekly publicly,  so I don't want to put words in his mouth, that this will be that sort of tent pole feature  they'll feature during the holidays.  You'll see those ads.  He's making the point that you could see a Santa Claus ad like you see with Siri doing  something interesting with security or touching the screen and those types of ads.

It may be the thing that may say to parents, you know, hey this is, we're thinking about  getting our son or daughter for Christmas this particular phone.  Why wouldn't we go with the one that seems to be now the most secure because you need  to use your finger and it's Apple after all.

Transcript:  That's also one of WWDC, one of the big features of WWDC, forgive me for forgetting what feature  it was, but Apple's extra layer of security that they featured which was the having to  sign in with your Apple ID.  It has to be the person who is signing with their Apple ID which I think would go a long  way to deter theft on these devices.  So you have a fingerprint scanner and you have that extra layer.

Transcript:  Oh, you can wipe it and start over.  That's the point.  As long as you can wipe, you have to wipe it, then it's all right.  Because the data is wiped off of it.  I think there's two things that have to happen here.  First of all, it has to work, which is far from a far gone conclusion.  A lot of this fingerprint stuff is wonky.  And you know, we have a lot of Android stuff, you have face recognition that works half  the time.  It must be 100% accurate, 100% reliable.  That's challenging.  I believe Apple could do it and I don't think Apple will release it unless it is.  And secondly, they have to find a way to market it that convinces normal people this is something  you really want.  I think that's one good angle, which is never lose your data again.  That's actually might be a better angle in the commerce angle.

It was gone and immediately panicked and talked to the staff, thought it's got to be  here. My gym is out of nowhere.  So went downstairs, went to the one information desk and she said, have you trying to find  my iPhone yet? She knew all about it.  She said, I just two days ago had my iPhone stolen from me.  She was an employee at the gym.  She tracked it. She tracked it down.  Was someone who had gone to the gym and was an employee, was a member of the gym,  tracked it down, went to the person's house because she was able to look it up in the  computer. So she tracked it down, knocked on the door.  She heard it beeping in the house and said, my phone is here.  And the woman said, what? And the woman, she said, I can see that my phone is here right  now. Can I have my phone back, please?  And she said, oh, I didn't know I found it.  I was going to turn it in.  And I sent the beacon off from I find my iPad and I heard it buzzing upstairs and someone  had picked it up.

In fact, my wife is going to be hosting a MasterChef hangout  with the team from MasterChef, the ones who have gotten kicked off the show.  The Gordon Ramsay show.  Your our friends, our mutual friends from Pixel Core  are going to be coming into our house tomorrow and do a hangout,  do a live hangout at our house tomorrow.  Oh, that's neat.  And so this integration live on the show during the broadcast saying, hey, watch,  watch Bree here, who just has been kicked off.  She's going to go and do this hangout where she's going to be fighting  to get back on the show on this Google Hangout.  And they're promoting these things live on the show.  And I know that when my wife and I watch like Top Chef Masters,  they have the extra bonus ones that are only available online.  You have to go to Bravo TV to watch them.  We do it because it's great.  So this cross promotion between these two platforms, it's interesting to see  now that Nielsen has built in.  I'm sure, Larry, I'm  but you have a lot of thoughts on this building in Twitter integration  for Nielsen ratings and seeing hashtag results in the conversations  that are happening around engagement online, driving Nielsen ratings in part,  not fully, but in part.

Transcript:  But for instance, it was 11 a.m.  in California a couple of weeks ago when they announced the new Doctor Who.  And if you were those maniacs, yeah, that could be.  Yeah. I mean, if you if if you wanted to, you know, keep that a secret in your head,  there was no way you had to be watching 11 a.m.  Pacific on Twitter because that was the evening announcement in the in England.  And there's no way to keep secrets anymore.  You know, I mean, it's good luck.

Start time: 7111.42
End time: 7137.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I wonder how much, though, this is weighted against the broadcast audience.  So if you've got two million viewers on a particular show  and then you have maybe 200, 300,000 viewers on another show,  but you have incredible online engagement on that smaller show.  That metric, I'm not sure exactly how the metrics fare it out as it relates to Nielsen,  is now being weighted against the larger broadcast audience.  As it should, because if you're an advertiser,

Start time: 7138.30
End time: 7141.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you'd prefer 200,000 engaged viewers to two million unengaged viewers.

Start time: 7142.72
End time: 7171.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Absolutely. Yeah, that's that's true.  I don't know. That's what ratings are about is advertisement.  Everything's about advertising.  But isn't it also eyeballed?  I mean, it's the it's the it's the debate about how many people  if you're engaging over particular topics on a show, does that translate  to purchasing products? I don't know.  Or would you rather have two million people watching a particular show  and getting brand awareness about your new Ford truck? I don't know.  I think they're still grappling with this.  I just worry though.  I talked to somebody at the General Mills.

Start time: 7171.64

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, this is kind of mainstream. You're selling cereal, right?  So this is what you're going for. Oats.  No, no, no, no. I wasn't trying to pitch them.

Start time: 7189.66
End time: 7207.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Following General Mills on Facebook, for instance, and like getting a coupon,  liking it, getting a coupon.  This stuff is much more valuable than an ad that you might see for Cheerios  on on a TV show.  And I think that that makes a lot of sense.  This is a very big change.  You got to readjust the CPMs.

Start time: 7207.48
End time: 7222.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the budget they're spending on social media is a fraction.  Right. It's been a television.  That's why it's more effective for them.  Yeah. They haven't quite figured out the social media companies  haven't quite figured out a way to fully monetize that yet.  It's called gouging.  They haven't figured out how to goug.

And she was she was very negative about all of these new, you know,  dot McDonald's domain names.  These she said this is a terrible idea.  Good news, ICANN has killed Google's plan for the dotless search T.L.D.

So you go into Google, you go in the lobby, they have that list of search terms  going by real time. It's funny.  You know what the number one search term last time I was there was Yahoo.  They just because you know why, because people go to their browser  and instead of typing Yahoo dot com, they just type Yahoo.  And you know what you get on Google when you type Yahoo, you get Yahoo.  Yeah, there you go. So it's like kind of cross the streams.

Start time: 7341.14
End time: 7348.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 7348.42
End time: 7356.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Consumer Reports has already seen it reviewed and says the best HDTV  they've ever reviewed.  CNET said that as well. Yeah, it's pretty remarkable.  Deep, deep blacks.  The curve, I don't know how much that adds to the Samsung says it adds  to the immersiveness.  But one thing it does do, it makes it impossible to hang it on a wall. Right.  I don't know if the I don't know if the curve is is germane or not,  but it's, you know, cool looking. It's a gimmick problem. Cool.

I would notice a difference.  I think I don't know.  Maybe if they really got in very detailed programming, but for just,  you know, watching even what they were showing, standing back far enough,  it was you could see it, but not enough to pay 25K.

But, you know, I don't know if it's going to be Red Ray or what they're going to do  to make this doable, but you can't do it on a Blu Ray.  You can't, you know, Sony's shipping a hard drive with their 4K set full of movies.  That's the only way you can do it.  Well, and certainly bandwidth is insufficient.

But that Larry Page did steal Android and doesn't give us  I mean, Java for Android doesn't give us credit.  And then Charlie asked him about jobs and Apple and the future of Apple.  And I think he was widely misquoted because the quote was,  Ellison says Apple's doomed without Steve Jones.  All he did is he waved his finger.  I don't think that's equals doom.  So what he said was, well, he said we've already.  Yeah, it's a good call.  So we've already done the experiment.  Apple with Steve Jobs, Apple without Steve Jobs.  Yeah, it's bulldo.

Say just a little a few words, have a little wake.  Our show today brought to you by Carbonite Online Backup, the backup service that is secure,  is encrypted, is private and is everything you want in a backup service.  It's automatic, so you don't have to remember it.  It's continuous, so it's always up to date and it's in the cloud.  So if the worst happens, and really frankly backup is all about planning for the worst,  you don't have to worry about it.  Is backing up your files on your to-do list today?  I bet it's not.  I bet it's in the back of your mind though.  I really should back up that stuff.  Don't worry about it.  Don't lose any sleep.  Carbonite.com.  And by the way, if you've got a small business and you're saying, oh no, don't worry, Joey  does the backup.  Every week Joey backs up every...  Don't trust Joey.  It's a bad idea.  Because it's...  I know it doesn't say Joey in here.  I made that up.  But it's probably Joey.  It could be Sally.  It could be Fred.  There's got to be...  Heinrich.  Heinrich.  Oh no, see I trust Heinrich.  Okay.

By the way, they have to trust no one.  Encryption where you hold the keys, nobody else does.  You don't have to worry about the federal subpoenas.  Is that right?  Yeah.  With carbonate?  Yeah.  You can get it here for one, that's $59.99 a year.  Sometimes I say $59.99, people go, for that kind of level of service, that must be $5,999.  No.  $59.99, under $60 a year for everything on your computer.  It's amazing.  Don't send your kids to college without carbonate on the laptop.  You don't want that phone call, daddy, I lost my paper.  You want to make sure they've got it backed up safely offsite.  Oh, by the way, it's great for college because you run carbonate on your desktop in your  room and then you log into your carbonate account at the library on a completely different  computer and there's your stuff.  You can work on it, save it again.  It's great.  Carbonate, try it today.  No credit card required, just our offer code TWIT and when you buy, you'll get two free  months if you use the offer code TWIT at carbonite.com, especially you small business owners.  Should Blackberry be thrown in the towel or should they be fighting, fighting to stay  alive?  They've said this week that they are seeking a way out basically.

All these private companies and some that could go on the record, some that couldn't,  of course they've got private government contracts, others that are doing, you know, people like  iRobot were there, of course, showing off some cool things, but because it's Washington,  So many people with Blackberrys, and again, I know that that's a microcosm, but even people  I talked to in New York that use Blackberrys couldn't wait to get their hands on the Z10  and they are just huge fans of Blackberry and they say it.  I mean, they're just, they're still, they're still such advocates of it.  But of course, I don't know that that's reflected in any kind of sales numbers.  Can't they downsize?

They also offer a network.  So they've got to have enough money to keep that going.  I don't know how much that costs.  Why don't they find some way to maintain that network in some other form?

People are, of course, concerned they're being recorded by cameras.  Most cameras were square inch in London than anywhere else, I think.  I think they still hold that record.  It recorded a unique identification number for any electronic device, something like  probably the Mac address.  As long as the Wi-Fi, yeah, it must be because it was Wi-Fi enabled.  And so they're going to turn that off, they say.  How would you know if they didn't?  Well, the little red light.  I think that's what they're going to turn off.  Actually, we're not.  Or they can do what I do, tape it.  We're going to turn it off per se.  We're going to turn off the little red light.

She accidentally posted a...  She was listening to Pavarotti with my dad and she accidentally, you know how some people  put fake music profile things up on path or whatever they do.
