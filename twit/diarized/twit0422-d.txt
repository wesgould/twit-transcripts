We thought he'd be here, but he's decided not to come to San Francisco for iOS 7.  But he does have all the colorful bubbles. Mr. Renee Richie, Imor.com. Nice to see you, Renee.  Nice to see you too, Leo. Are you disappointed? I guess what? You got a little sickness and you can't come down here.

Transcript:  You don't need to be there for that. You stay in Montreal. Yeah.  Also with us, we haven't seen him in a while. I'm so glad to have him back. Dan Patterson formerly of a, was it NBC, CBS, some network radio? ABC.  ABC, some network radio news operation. Then Occupy Wall Street happened. You did an amazing job of covering that on Storify using new media entirely to cover it, which was awesome.  And since you've kind of gone the freelance route, which is I think so commendable, you're trying to reinvent journalism.

Start time: 180.26
End time: 228.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, well, trying. You know, I did exactly what we talk about pretty frequently on the network here, which is I left my job at ABC intentionally to run a podcasting network last year.  And I made just enough money to successfully run a failed company. But you know, you got to start somewhere.  And I did that all within the studios here at Summall in New York City. And now I do data journalism.  So we're provided big buckets of data by partners like the Clinton Foundation or Ashen Kutcher's We Are Thorn.  They give us big buckets of data and say, find stuff in here. And so I work with a team of analysts to go through and find really interesting stuff about, you know, in the spring, I studied the spread of child pornography on the web.  And right now I'm studying the spread of prescription drugs and how the web influences that. So really fascinating stuff now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No kidding. And Dana Atkinson, of course, Summall is a sponsor. We got to distinguish Summall.com, which is the sponsor.  And frankly, they're a great company that offers free kind of sophisticated business analysis to customers with you work for the Summall Foundation, the nonprofit on Summall.org.

End time: 266.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and I certainly don't want to plug anything or get those wires confused. You know, they do a lot of, you know, we talked about in the pre show kind of subsidized journalism that there has to be a space for interesting long form work to exist.  And they are subsidizing this work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we just want to say that this show brought to you by Kit Kat and.  Why would sponsorship ruin anything? Anyway, we're thrilled that we're thrilled to have you, Dan.  It's really great to have you and see you again. I haven't seen you in ages. And I think we'd like to see more of you.  This is a great opportunity for us to get your services. And I have to say that this is a fascinating area for journalism to explore this idea that big data might offer up nuggets of information that isn't immediately obvious.

Start time: 298.66
End time: 314.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, right. Exactly. And that we are living in the age, particularly with wearable computing that I think we'll talk a little bit about later in the show.  You know, this is the day and age of bending the data curve and using information instead of big scary buckets of data, making it personal and accessible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I love that. Well, great. It's good to have you. Appreciate it. We wanted to give you give people the disclaimer up front, not that we'll be talking about Summall in any way.  There is so much big news. I don't even know where to start. This is the week that Microsoft bought Nokia, Android announced version 4.4 of Android Kit Kat in a deal that they say no money was exchanged.  Yeah, right. Apple has a little bit of a party coming up on Tuesday. We could talk about that.  And we found out that the NSA knows a lot more about us than we even thought. Not to mention the Galaxy Note 3, the Galaxy Gear, an all new Kindle paper wipe, a potential for a free smartphone from Amazon.  The Yahoo logo is here. But most importantly, CBS and Time Warner have finally buried the hatchet. What a shock. The week before the NFL season kicks off. Shocking.  Shocking. I don't know. I don't know where to start. What's the you pick, Renee? What's the big story of the week? At least one story number one here. Is it Nokia?

Start time: 380.00
End time: 404.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I guess it has to be Nokia just because it changes the Apple's going to announce a new phone. Google's going to put out a new version of their software. But Microsoft is buying a first party hardware manufacturer.  Yeah. And it's such a perfect encapsulation of Bomber's job at CEO. And it reminds me of that Karate Kid movie where you either make the software yes or you make the hardware no, but he's always kind of so-so about it.

Start time: 405.04
End time: 450.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, in fact, according to All Things D, they've done a lot of All Things D seems to have a lot of information about what happened in the behind the scenes negotiations, which makes me think that perhaps they're being fed this information from Microsoft.  But according to I think it was All Things D that said that that that Bomber was the one who actually initiated this conversation with Nokia back in January. And it was a they met at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, which was in the spring and had a lot of difficulty coming to any kind of agreement at all.  In other words, Microsoft wanted Nokia long before Nokia could see their way clear to selling to Microsoft.

Transcript:  And it was interesting that Maps was a huge sticking point that just shows you the value of services compared to hardware these days.

Start time: 455.56
End time: 482.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Microsoft wanted the here Maps. They use it in Bing. It is their mapping tool. And Nokia was completely unwilling to sell. In fact, that was the thing that was the final piece of the deal that made it possible.  Nokia licensed access to Maps to Microsoft and Microsoft agreed to so that Microsoft could modify it. But they agreed to contribute back, I think any modifications they made into the code set.

Start time: 483.76
End time: 530.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the license. Yeah, it seems almost as though Microsoft bought established systems. And I know that this idea has been floating around for the last week or so. But but I mean, Nokia had to retain some sort of identity.  You know, they can't just be a galoshes manufacturer, go back to that. And they had to retain something. And I piece seems to be the thing or at least the the software in here seems to be the thing they really stuck on.  But Microsoft was able to get these established systems and we can kind of assume that they also got things like supply chain and they'll be able to to make their their process more efficient by this.  But they didn't really get anything that that would do anything more than kind of make them feature complete within an already crowded marketplace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was it the joy of tech that did the the cartoon that implied that basically ELOP was inserted into Nokia to make sure that the company the company failed so that Microsoft could get a good deal from them.  The evaluator. Yeah, I don't think that's what happened, although you might be a little suspicious about the whole thing, right?

Start time: 555.02
End time: 595.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's hard to see what benefits Nokia in any of this. I mean, I think Ben Thompson made that argument that, you know, this helps Microsoft because Nokia was not doing well with Windows Phone.  Arguably, they might have been they might have done better with Android because their claim to fame was always fantastic hardware.  And given the marketplace for Android, they could have been the premier Android manufacturer with the best hardware, the best cameras all around.  And that might have been a much better business for them.  And if that changed hands, Microsoft would have very little visibility in smartphones because Samsung and HTC are not falling all over each other to make Windows Phones anymore.  And but Microsoft, you know, they get to solidify their place in the market.  Now they get to make sure that Windows Phones keep getting produced and they have the money to do it.

Start time: 596.96
End time: 620.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and Nokia kind of existed, you know, in the early days, the gestation period, the first, you know, maybe 18 or 36 months of of Android.  Nokia was still kind of dinking around with their own operating systems and they didn't really integrate with Android at what could have been a very pivotal time.  And now they almost need this as as or needed this deal with Microsoft to have a purpose.

Start time: 620.66
End time: 667.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did they, though? You know, one of the things that might have triggered this negotiation is the fact that Nokia's deal with Microsoft ended at the end of next year and 2014.  And of course, there were a lot of rumors.  It's probably too late, by the way, if it were to end the end of this year, then maybe it would have made sense for Nokia to pivot into Android.  I mean, I would buy a 10 20 based on Android in a heartbeat because of the great hardware.  Nokia makes great hardware. They've always been a crappy software company.  They made the first smartphones. I owned a few of them like the e-70 and Migo and Symbian was great.  Migo, I kept buying things like the N nine hundred.  And the crap software really killed what was brilliant hardware.  They still have Asha, which is an inexpensive platform popular in places like India.

Start time: 669.31
End time: 677.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The big knock against them was that they were an engineering led company.  The engineers would figure out the hardware and they try to slap some software on it to make it work.  And that wasn't going to be viable in a post iPhone post.

Start time: 677.44
End time: 688.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Had they been able to adopt Android like now?  Would I mean, wouldn't they have a chance? A shot at it?  Or is it just is it to commoditize an operating system? There's too much competition.

Start time: 688.89
End time: 690.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It might be that place.

Start time: 690.38
End time: 727.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it might be exactly that.  That Samsung really, really did this forward leading, very aggressive strategy a year, year and a half ago.  And that might have just made it more difficult.  Yeah, it might have been just too late.  Microsoft also might be getting I mean, this could be a little too out there, but but Nokia is also very well entrenched,  particularly with distribution into the developing world.  And Microsoft could have seen that as an opportunity to say, well, OK, Europe, North America, maybe we can't fight the fight here,  but we can certainly, you know, weave our fingers into the rest of the world.  And that's certainly something that Nokia has done competently for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's, by the way, the best this all things D piece is great.  I mean, they actually cover this from beginning to end.  But the best part is the meeting on the weekend of May 24th in the London offices of Microsoft's law firm on Friday, May 24th.  A potential deal was starting to get some momentum in some areas, they write, while other topics remain sticky.  By evening, the parties from Microsoft and Nokia were the only ones left in the building.  Each side had retreated to separate parts of a floor to go over what the other side had presented.  And at one point, Balmer and Smith were walking back to their conference room together.  But in and and and Balmer in a moment, he was gone and there was a loud scream,  the kind of yell that only comes from the uncommonly strong lungs of the voluble Microsoft CEO.  The roar startled the Nokia team who figured Balmer had reacted particularly negatively to one of their proposals.  While those in the Microsoft conference room had no idea what was going on, they heard the sound of people running.  It turned out Balmer had walked into a clear glass coffee table and had tripped on it and gashed his forehead.  The Microsoft security team ran off in search of a first aid kit.  They patched him up and negotiations continued.

Transcript:  So this was back in May and it goes back and forth.  They met in Batvik, which is a small town 30 kilometers west of Mike of Nokia's offices in Finland.  This sounds like something straight out of The Girl with the Dragon tattoo.  I could see them coming in a train to a snow drifted town.  Anyway, they eventually eventually were able to work out the details just recently.  So this isn't this was a Balmer deal, maybe his last deal.  A lot of people have wondered if perhaps like much like the Apple acquisition of next, they're getting not only an operating system, not only a phone,  well, they're not getting an operating system, a phone manufacturer, but also getting a CEO.  Does this is next?  Does this put Stephen Elop, former Microsofty running Nokia in as the front runner now as the next CEO at Microsoft?

Start time: 863.60
End time: 865.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, puts him in the mix. I don't know about the front runner.

Start time: 865.60
End time: 868.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's running the devices and services division.

Start time: 870.68
End time: 913.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jobs came back to Apple and he brought a culture with me.  Steve Jobs had a singular vision of focus and he created he turned Apple into a product.  There's no evidence at all that Stephen Elop is anything like a product visionary or a cultural phenomenon like Steve Jobs.  Far from it, actually.  Yeah, his is Nokia got money out of this and they apparently already access their line of credit and they needed money badly.  So you can see it from Nokia's point of view.  But in my West Wing reference for the week, there's no there's no indication that Microsoft will be Microsoft.  Let Microsoft be Microsoft. They're so obsessed with being Apple.  I mean, granted, IBM is not a sexy computer saving customer saving facing business, but it's an amazing business.  And Microsoft is with this move saying we don't want that.  We don't want to be enterprise. That was what was in their consumer.

Start time: 913.56
End time: 951.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was in their future until they did this.  And they say and you know, Microsoft says we're a devices and services company.  Devices, Windows Phone, Surface tablets with Windows RT.  Now, nobody's going to make that except Microsoft and Nokia.  In fact, you can pretty much kiss goodbye.  The other part is going to make Windows phones, right?  Why would you make Windows phones if Microsoft owns Nokia? That's it.  So nobody's going to make RT. Nobody's going to make Windows phones.  Microsoft's going to make Windows in office. But that's kind of.  Is that the services part of the business?  This is this is Microsoft in a Hail Mary. It almost feels like Office 365.

Start time: 952.32
End time: 976.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, that's their best product right now.  Asia is a fantastic product, but it seems like they give it very little attention compared to failed tablet and phone projects, which is very interesting given.  I mean, they have never made good devices.  Even Xbox was an accident and came with tremendous write downs.  And it's a small niche category, much smaller than smartphones.  And it's interesting to see them put so much focus and so much of this on an area that it's like Apple with Internet services, an area that they've been so unsuccessful in.

Start time: 976.48
End time: 981.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In their history. So is this good for Microsoft or bad for Microsoft?

Start time: 981.38
End time: 1023.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the what's what's some? I mean, Leo, you could be absolutely right that this is a Hail Mary.  And this I mean, this might not be a binary.  This is absolutely Hail Mary for Microsoft, but it's also a company that is really good at landing those Hail Marys, right?  I mean, for whatever reason, they've been able to stick around.  They've never been the sexiest. They've never been the most innovative or at least for 20 years hasn't haven't been the most innovative.  But they have always been able to kind of march with iterative change successfully.  It's the same to me. This really feels like Internet Explorer one to Internet Explorer five.  Right. Both were kind of junky, but they did something and they stayed relevant.  Nobody cared. But they were a few people love them, but they stayed relevant.

Start time: 1024.56
End time: 1057.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and then you also have to look at the fact that Microsoft has given a seat on the board to an activist investment group,  Value Act, a hedge fund. As Bomber steps down, Value Act was threatening them with a proxy fight,  which apparently Microsoft thought was so scary that they're giving a seat on the board to this to this value act.  Now, value act owns less than one percent of the company, but still worth billions.  I think they have a two billion dollar stake in Microsoft, two point two billion dollars at current prices.

Start time: 1057.38
End time: 1089.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's hard to see where this is successful. If three years ago, Microsoft had put out an X phone and an X slate that had Halo and Gears of War and fantastic exchange and office support and, you know,  SharePoint and everything like that and really leverage the things that make Microsoft great, could have been a fantastic product.  It could have been on the shelf. They could have had Call of Duty Special Edition right next to an iPhone.  But it's hard to see what they can do so many years later when iOS and Android are so far ahead and everyone HTC making fantastic phones that are as good as Nokia phones, you know, where there's space for them.

Transcript:  According to John Petchkowski writing in All Things D, the number one thing Microsoft is going to add to Nokia, they're going to get better names.  Steve Bomber says, I think we could probably do better for consumer names than Nokia, Lumia, Windows Phone 1020. Oh, good.  This is from the company that created Windows XP 64 bit edition for 64 bit extended systems says Petchkowski.  These two companies belong together.  Holy cow. You know, it's such it's you saw so many editorial cartoons, one in the I think was the New York.  No, it was the Economist, two giant fishes swimming along Google and Apple.  And then these two little fishes, Microsoft and Nokia and the Microsoft fishes eating the Nokia fish.  It's like not even players in this game.  You know, it's the four percent company bought it buying the two percent company.  Still interesting to watch.  You know, I'm rooting for him. Let's I'd love you know, you know, Microsoft.  People think I hate Microsoft.  Microsoft made the PC revolution without somebody a company coming along and saying this is a standard that developers can write to.  We would not have the PC revolution.  This is an important company to the ecosystem.  And and and frankly, if you're a Finnish, I imagine you think the same of Nokia.  So let's hope for the best for both Nokia.  Do they still have the Goulash division?  Or do they get out of that entirely when they moved into phones?

Transcript:  We're talking about the week's tech news.  I've got Kit Kat bars and we're going to we're going to share them with the entire crew in just a little bit.  But first, let's take a little break and talk about Squarespace dot com, the greatest place to create your new website.  Squarespace is hosting.  When you say hosting, that sounds boring.

And just it's a pure coincidence that the letter K is the next letter in the Android Galaxy.  And we thought it was going to be key lime pie.  In a surprise announcement this week, Google says Android 4.4 is Kit Kat.  They also said no money changed hands.

That's that's what I've been racking my brain trying to understand.  And it happened.  Right. Right.  The details seem kind of fuzzy although I mean they are emerging and I like the fact that they say at least no money changed hands.  And it does seem kind of fun.

But now you've got the little green Android character on every Kit Kat bar and people.  Oh wait a minute.  There's this Android thing that actually runs my phone.  This is clever isn't it.

I think it's a little annoying but I guess I can't really complain.  You got an advertising company.  Some people are pointing out in fact another joy of tech comic that Nestle is not the cleanest brand name in history is it.  Nestle associated with selling baby formula in the third world associated with some nasty labor practices.  Here's a here's the joy of tech comic.  Mommy mommy I'm scared.  What's wrong honey.  There's a green ghost on this chocolate bar.  Oh don't be silly.  It's just a Google Android.  It can't hurt you.  So I shouldn't worry that an omnipresent technology company that knows everything we do online and with our phones is joining forces with a multinational food corporation that has a long history of nefarious activity including child labor the promotion of infant formula over breastfeeding rainforest deforestation price fixing and whose CEO once said the idea of water as a basic human right was extreme.  Daddy daddy we're scared.  I think that's it.  It isn't necessarily the cleanest brand to be associated with but who doesn't love Nestle right.  Nothing to say that dramatic radio rate reading choke you up.  All right enough to say about Kit Kat.  There is other there are other Google stories in fact an interesting revelation about Google Chrome apps and I'm really curious what you guys think about this.  Google has launched Chrome apps for Windows 8 perhaps revealing their secret plan all along.  I kind of mocked the idea of Chrome OS but these are essentially taking the extensions that you add to your Chrome browser and Chrome OS and making them apps.  They're going to do it on Mac too.  They haven't yet but they currently are apps on Windows 8.  Is it native cliently.

Transcript:  Well I mean Google is I mean they went they forked WebKit they made blink.  They've been doing V8 for a long time.  They've been working on native client and it looks like they're going to be doing technology that requires you to write code.  That requires you to write to Chrome instead of to write to the right to the Web which was an open platform.  And for a company who historically superficially embrace the open Web it's a sign.  I mean it's a whole Adobe thing.  You know don't be locked down to a platform be locked down to our platform.  I don't like that.  Yeah.  Vertical versus horizontal lockdown.  Yeah.

Start time: 1913.50
End time: 1939.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it also increases the top of mind right.  And the more these things function much like apps and I see them in that context outside of just the browser context.  The more I think about and simply interoperate with the Google ecosystem and it's one more.  I don't think it's a big deal like this is a huge deal but it is a big deal in that this is one more big footstep of Google into your life.  And once that step is taken it's hard to bring that back.

Start time: 1940.26
End time: 1965.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And like some people have said that is open source so other people can go ahead and make Chrome maps or at least add like Safari could theoretically add support for this.  But when you're in the real world in a pragmatic world Apple and Microsoft.  I don't know what Firefox would do.  We probably don't want to introduce competitors technology into their products.  They would do it if the World Wide Web Consortium came out with a native client standard.  So it's again it's filling space in the market but it's doing it in a way that's particular to one vendor which is always dangerous on the web.

Transcript:  Google also when they rolled out Kit Kat you know that's traditionally they put the statue on the Google lawn of the Kit Kat you know Android.  They have jelly beans.  They have donuts.  They have eclairs.  I'm not sure if they did this on purpose.  My guess is they did.  There's a happy go lucky fella in the rollout video taking a picture with an odd looking Nexus phone.  Let's go let's zoom in a little closer why that looks like not the Nexus for who very by the way conveniently the young lady next to him is using.  So for comparison purposes this guy doesn't even look like he's paying attention.  It's looked like somebody said OK run out there and hold up the phone and pretend you're taking a picture.  This is it feels to me like an intentional leak of what I guess would be the Nexus 5.  At the same time as this happened and Google pulled down the video from YouTube.  Oops.  The same time this happened the FCC got a filing for a phone that interestingly enough matches this exactly.  And people were able to piece them together and and show that they are in fact the same bigger sensor bigger phone screen obviously looks nice.  When when when will we now see now I'm sad because I got Jeff Jarvis to open his Moto X on this week in Google on Thursday and he's going to be mad at me because he's been waiting for a Nexus 5.  Is this in fact the Nexus 4 is out of stock in the 8 gigabyte.  8 gigabyte.  Yeah.  Is this so that means the 5 is imminent.

Samsung of course jumped the boat a little bit and I think you have to figure that their September 4th announcement date has something to do with the September 10th announcement day for an iPhone.  They wanted to scoop them a little bit.  They announced the Galaxy Note 3 and it kind of an incremental improve improvement on the Note 2 a little bit bigger 5.7 inches a little bit thinner a bit much better leathery.

And I see that note and note too on a daily basis.  I love it.  Right I would be very surprised if this doesn't sell well and it seems like it's carried by professionals or people who are you know doing something that does require that additional screen real estate which makes it a little less silly.  I think pink might be targeting.

Transcript:  This is going to have windowing.  It's got the stylus the S Pen and some new stylus features hovering and so forth.  But I thought the most interesting feature written about by Kevin Fitchard at Giga Ohm is this new chip from Quantenze.  This will be the first appearance of the Quantenze ET chip.  It's an envelope tracking chip which could make a significant difference he says in battery life.  It modifies how the radio works with LTE.  As anybody knows who got an early LTE phone that is a real power drain.  And it's because of the very peaky nature of the LTE signal the phone in order to maintain a uniform envelope of power has to kind of over drive the phone.  This Quantenze chip allows the radio to fluctuate in response to the signal fluctuation and apparently can save a significant amount of juice.

Start time: 2272.72
End time: 2320.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  LTE is funny in that if you're on a really good LTE signal it's much better for battery because the chip powers up.  It sucks down the data quickly and powers off.  But in areas where you're close to LTE and it has to drop out anytime the radio screams for a signal it's bad.  The interesting thing to me about this though is that in North America big phones haven't historically done as well.  I mean the iPhone mostly if you look at AT&T or Verizon figures and certainly Apple Store figures it outsells all bigger screen phones combined.  But both Sasha Sagan and Ben Thompson turned me around on this when you look at outside the US markets where people a phone might be a primary computer.  And people can't necessarily get a phone and a tablet.  To them the computer part becomes more important than the phone part and that's where devices like the Galaxy Mega and the Note 3 and the LG, I forget what it's called, the giant LG phone become much more important to emerging markets.

Transcript:  They claim 25% overall device battery life improvement with this Quantan C G chip on LTE.  I'm in an area where LTE is up and down and in fact I often go into the phone and turn off LTE if I can because it really can't kill the battery.  So solving this will be good. This will not be exclusive to the Note 3. It's just the first one to have it.  But that's encouraging.  They also announced...  Right.  I don't know what to call it. Is it a watch? I guess it's a watch. The Galaxy Gear.  It's a big ass watch.  Watch?  And it will only work with the Note 3 initially.  Although they say with the update to 4.3 on...I guess it needs Bluetooth low energy right?  So the Galaxy S4 will work with it and maybe even the Galaxy S3 once the update to the Android comes.

How I mean selling this as a standalone device seems like a non-starter but packaging it with something else subsidized.  I can see that working maybe not in North America but I can certainly see this bundled with whatever else you get for free if you're buying this somewhere.  But I mean how they intend to market this just seems like it'll be a lot of fun to watch.

It just may not capture the imagination like that real dopamine spike of the first iPhone release and the iPad release.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah I mean Apple's thing isn't that.  The iPhone accidentally did that in the iPad a little bit but you know we discussed last time Leo.  A lot of people said the iPad was unimaginable just a big iPhone.  Apple will do something that they hope I mean watches are a much smaller category than phones or tablets and consumer electronics.  They'll do something that they think a lot of mainstream people for whom a smartphone is too much technology maybe they still want to have a feature phone.  But they want either the informational benefits of all their stuff being displayed on a small screen or the health stuff like the glucose reader, blood pressure reader.  And it'll be more it'll look more like a band than a phone.  It probably won't look like a watch.  It'll have a watch app the way the iPhone has a phone app but it'll be a very different thing.  And Tim Cook will have to make the case the way Steve Jobs did with the iPad that this exists underneath the phone category.  You're absolutely right Renee.

The iPhone is something even the iPad and most of us.  You knew you wanted it.  Right.  You see it and you know what it does.  Right.  But a Fitbit you kind of have to use for a month or two before you go, ah, light bulb.  I see why this is wonderful.  And I think that might be this.  Apple is aware of that with a quantified self-product.

Transcript:  The iPhone Leo, we had trios or Blackberries before that.  The original iPhone was nowhere near as feature complete, but Steve Jobs showed inertial scrolling and the bounce back and pinch to zoom.  No stylus.  I mean, you know.  Yeah.  It wasn't as functional, but he made the experience look so compelling.  Same with the iPad.  He sat there and browsed the web and used, you know, Mike Mattis's little photo interface where you could peek inside photos.  And that was appealing to not, you know, geeks, certainly the geeks like us, but to the mainstream people.  When I went to the iPad 2 lineup, I saw all my old high school teachers there.  It was 90 percent people 10 or 20 years older than me.  And that's the people that they call to.  Yeah, not the Galaxy Gear market.  Right.

And the dynamic between them and who knows what young upstart or startup company or other technology company will come out of nowhere.  And it's Apple doesn't have to do it alone.  There's a there's a better chance for it happening because there's more competitive companies.  Right.

Transcript:  Fingerprint reader on the face of it's exciting.  In fact, Mike Elgin, months ago, credit to Mike, was one of the first to report a fingerprint reader.  Everybody go...  In fact, you, Renee and Andy and I sat here saying, no, they'll never do that.  We knew Apple had bought Authenttec last year for billions of dollars.  So they had the technology.  They owned it.  Mike Elgin speculated if they'd put it in the iPhone, it would be a revolution for authentication.  And authentication is critical to online payments, payments of any kind.  If I'm going to give you a charge card, the most important part of that transaction is that you know I am who I say I am, that it's my card.  And you know what?  If you're buying things online, that you are who you say you are.  If both ends are securely and accurately authenticated, it makes online currency transactions friction free.  But currently, there is no way to really do that.  There's a certain amount of trust that's involved in using a credit card.  If Apple could get a reliable, and it would have to be very reliable, right, accurate fingerprint sensor on that phone, that could transform things.  So that was Mike's contention.  But I have to say having, and boy I'm going to sound like Mr. Apple knockers here.  I think that was Marilyn Monroe's first film actually.  But that's another story, another kind.  But I'm not, but I'm just pointing out that it is, it happens, every company does it, where they come out with something that is potentially huge.  But execution lacks, and it's just another thing.  You can say Siri, Leo, it's okay.  Siri is a very good example.  If this thing isn't exactly, if it doesn't really, if on the screen it says put your finger on here or give us your pin to unlock, that's not it.

Start time: 3231.48
End time: 3237.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well you need the pin, for example, if you want to give your phone to Lisa, she doesn't have your conference.  You always need a back door for people who aren't new using your device.

Start time: 3237.34
End time: 3256.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it has to be 100% reliable, secure, and dependable.  And even if they do that, it also has to have the back end.  Merchants have to support it.  They have to take a passbook and make it, you know, have money in it.  There's no money in it right now.  It's just Fandango tickets and things.  Starbucks.

Start time: 3257.60
End time: 3319.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My understanding is that, well passbook was written, I think it's called Passbook Kit or something, where it's highly abstracted.  So you know this iOS 7, Apple's adding some things to it.  Eventually they could add NFC or they could add a fingerprint reader.  It's very easy for them to do that because they built it in a smart way.  What I've heard so far is that they're testing it with a ton of people because it's not a trivial problem.  People really do hold their phones differently.  People have different sized fingers and they left-handed or right-handed and there's all sorts of things.  And they could either make it very secure where it requires a high level of certainty to unlock your device,  in which case it will have false negatives, or they could make it much laxer.  They'd need fewer points of identification, in which case it might put someone into it, shouldn't.  But it won't.  Well I think Apple is usually consumer focused.  So if you start getting frustrated you can't open their phone, that's bad.  If a theoretical one out of a million other people could open it, that's probably less of a problem where you're concerned.  And for people who are really security conscious, they could probably say you need a thumbprint and your PIN code.  So it's something you are and something you know and then you've got two-factor at least working for you.

Transcript:  Dr. Maum, one of our regular chatters who's a physician, says that they use fingerprint readers in the hospital  to unlock narcotics. And she says even there they're only about 75% reliable.

Start time: 3333.97
End time: 3352.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's an interesting, that's the flip side of this where people might get upset about it,  is that it establishes your identity in a good and a bad way.  Because if you unlock that cabinet and get the narcotics, they know it's you.  There's no deniability there. And if you've got a fingerprint on your transaction or your email  and that's ever an issue, you've got no excuse that oh my friend downloaded that MP3 file.

Start time: 3353.74
End time: 3394.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what it reminds me, what I'm concerned about is you know many Android devices have face unlocking.  Where you know this was a cool thing for Samsung to show off. You see your face and it unlocks it.  Google showed it with 4.2 I think. Nobody uses it. It's ridiculous.  You can fool it with a photo.  Well it's just dumb. It's unreliable, it's not reliable enough to count on it.  It's not, it doesn't just work, it takes a long time. It's so much easier to enter in a PIN  that it just doesn't make any sense. So my question is, is this going to be a great thing?  And Apple's done this in the past. Everybody goes wow that's neat and nobody uses it.  Or could this really be a significant...

Start time: 3395.32
End time: 3423.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the degree to which this is a gimmick versus something that is deeply integrated across the platform.  And all of the negatives aside, this is something that if it permeates the Apple environment  within the next let's say two or three iterations of iOS devices,  it is something that really does have the potential to change the landscape entirely.  All of these other hangups however really increase the likelihood that this is a gimmick like Siri was.

Start time: 3423.36
End time: 3459.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean I think I've heard and I know other people have heard that Apple has been testing it in a wide range of things  and it could just unlock the device. That might be it this time, but it could also become your Apple ID.  So instead of putting in your iTunes password, you can just authenticate with your thumbprint.  Which is entering passcodes on mobile sucks. It doesn't matter what platform you're on.  You can't put in a secure platform. Horrible.  And then the next step is integrating it with Passbook.  But it's like Ford and cars will tell you that people are adverse to change and adverse to technology.  And you have to walk them through things slowly.  They just don't want the car to drive on its own the first day.  So it could be that Apple slowly rolls out features over the course of the next few software updates.

Start time: 3459.38
End time: 3496.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and limiting it also limits consumer expectation while also allowing consumer imagination to flourish, right?  If it is something that just unlocks your phone or replaces a password in just your iTunes and App Store transactions,  then that's something where people are more forgiving with failures and also can see the future where it is an improved device.  But if this is something that Apple really presses as the differentiating feature between this and the five,  which it seems like they will, this really could fall into novelty, like, OK, cutesy territory.

Start time: 3496.42
End time: 3523.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. It's not all bad because all they need is that demo.  Like you buy your new iPhone, you go and show your friends, look, it's got a thumbprint reader.  You really don't care that it works. You care that you have something cool to show your friend.  And Apple has the Santa Claus commercial where Scrooge can't get into your iPhone, but boy, Santa can unlock it.  Get the Christmas list and save Christmas.  And that's all they really need is that one feature to show off a visually not very different phone and that Christmas commercial.  And that's their their holiday season. Yeah.

It'll have a much better chipset, much better digital signal processor.  It'll have the gold and maybe the steel coloring as well.  So at least people will because one of the big problems with the S lines is people got upset that no one could tell you had the new iPhone.  So gold and maybe steel would at least let your friends know that you have the new iPhone and it's a hugely popular color.  So it's an incremental update. But, you know, Apple doesn't intend for anybody but us geeks to buy phones year after year anyway.  It's mostly for people on a forest or a forest. Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's, you know, what's most interesting, I know that we've probably been saying this a lot lately.  But what's most interesting is you remember three years ago with the discovery of the iPhone 4 and that that even then leaks were something that happened.  You know, there are few and far between. And the degree to which this is last year maybe.  But this year is really the year where we know so much about this product before it's it's announced, you know, and that really the change in how Apple controls its, you know, the the the entire chain has really changed a lot.

I think the time we would see an iWatch would mostly be in the spring where they can test out products.

Transcript:  What's your definition of a new app? I mean, Apple TV is getting that's one of the things the problems with the news cycles.  Apple TV is getting iOS 7. They don't call it that, but it gets whatever the new software built for other iOS devices is and that'll come with radio.  Yeah, they call it something dumb. It has two different OS names. Neither of them are the proper OS name.  I don't know why they do that. But whenever a new beta comes out for the phone or the iPad, that same beta comes out for the Apple TV.  And when the release comes out within a few days, the Apple TV is updated to the same basic structure of iOS.  And that can that's to allow for compatibility and features like AirPlay and AirPlay mirroring to work.  So it'll get a new OS, it'll get iTunes radio and it'll get some other stuff.

Transcript:  You know, one thing I could see, we haven't discussed this very, very much.  But one thing I could see that is a surprise could be plastic back iPod touch.  You know, we kind of look at the shrinking iPod market and particularly the price of that device.  You know, that's that's an entry level device for a lot of people who don't want to get tied down to a contract.  And it seems very obvious that a touch with a plastic back is something that that is, you know, it's a it's a no brainer.  It would make the product cheaper and easier to access.

Start time: 3742.34

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the iPod sales are tanking. I mean, you season after season.  Last year, Apple did iPods the same time they did the iPhones.  And we've had very little leaks about anything new in the iPod space.  And it could be that they're they're getting so small that the traditional gateway drug to the App Store and to iOS is going to be replaced with the iPhone 5C.  And one of the things we don't know, because Apple doesn't have to get it out to partners that early, is what the price tag on that will be.  Because if it's four hundred and fifty dollars, which is one of the rumors, that's pretty close to Apple subsidies.  So could it be zero dollars in subsidy markets?  Does Apple want to maintain perception of value, make it forty dollars or one hundred dollars?  And then does all those trade ins and refurbs go even below that in cost in Latin America and Africa and countries like that?  And Apple starts to have a range of pricing and especially in emerging markets.  So there's a lot of small things that are still interesting.

Start time: 4312.59
End time: 4359.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So that seems like a big part of YouTube.  It really was.  So back in the day, you know, vloggers would upload a video and then you could make a video in response to that video and it would show up underneath and you could easily.  It's like a comment, but it's more it's a little more than that.  Right.  And so they're getting rid of it, which is really I mean, if anything else has been sort of an outline of where they want to go in the future, they do not.  They don't like this whole social network stuff that's going on on YouTube.  That's terrible.  Yeah.  It's really kind of disappointing because that's how I got into YouTube is from from making my own video responses.  And it's completely gone.  It's completely gone.  And they've been downplaying it for over two years now.  They've been moving it lower and lower on the page.  You have to go to a separate little tab.

Transcript:  I still don't understand the Vine thing.  I don't.  The kids love it, Leo.  The kids. It's all about the kids.  Big story.  We're going to talk about it on Wednesday.  I had Steve Gibson's talking about it on the radio show.  More of the Snowden leaks are coming out.  And now this most recent story is essentially that the National Security Agency has done a huge amount to bypass privacy on the Web to undermine encryption.  They dedicate, according to the story, as much as 250 million dollars a year of their secret budget to subverting companies like Microsoft.  They they literally are planning agents within these companies to put back doors in their encryption.  They've subverted the National Institute for Standards and Technology, which is a standards body in the United States that, among other things,  protect, you know, create standards for government encryption.  It seems as if we've got an out of control surveillance state.  What is your you know, you're not an American, American Renee.  You're in Montreal from from outside of the US.  What is what is your take?  What do you see going on here?  My real concern, I think this is Bruce Schneier and others have raised this.  My real concern is that the United States is in effect undermining the basis of the Internet and it's making United States products.  If nothing else, if you're not worried about privacy, it means that no nation outside the United States should even consider United States product.  The US government told us last year, don't buy phones from Huawei and ZTE because they're made by the Chinese government in effect.  And they're spying on us.  Well, we're doing the same thing.

Start time: 4537.66
End time: 4623.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's interesting to me because exactly what you say, there are a lot of states in which you live under the presumption of surveillance.  A lot of people in England say their laws are written in such a way that this is perfectly legal and they don't understand the outcry in North America.  We have CESIS in Canada and I believe part of their purview is to is domestic surveillance.  So there's a lot of there's a lot of countries where you can barely do anything without the oversight of the government.  But the difference in the United States is that theoretically this should not be possible.  And if it is, if their government, sorry, if agencies want to do this, they should go and pass the prerequisite laws required to make this legal and allow people to the Congress and the Senate to vote on those laws.  And if it's not legal, they shouldn't be allowed to do it.  I mean, they should have to go and make their case in a free society to a Republican, sorry, to a Republic society and make it legal and then go ahead and do it.  But what it does is exactly what you said about China.  You can't have confidence in buying a Chinese device because you found spyware on the photography frame that you bought at the local Costco or whatever it is.  And the same thing now is true.  I believe that it's so badly broken that I'm just never going to trust any technology company or any technology product ever again, because it's the kind of trust that once broken, you can never get back.  If they can lie about spying now, there's no point in them saying we've stopped doing it because you'll never believe them.  And it undermines not only the Internet, it undermines your faith in any product you use on any service ever for the rest of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bruce Bruce Bruce says it undermines the very fabric of the Internet.  It is doing huge damage.  Now, Gibson came on and said, look, a lot of this is essentially link bait from these news agencies.  He says, understand what's happening here.  The and Schneier says is to the math is still good.  Strong encryption has not been cracked.  There's no reason to think that the NSA has such supercomputer powers in the basement there that they're able to get through, you know, 2048 or much less 4096 bit, you know, RSA encryption strong encryption still works.  But the NSA realized before 9 11 and stepped it up after 9 11 that the Internet was rapidly going dark for them.  And so has created an effort in which they spend a quarter billion dollars a year, at least to get around this.  And so they talk about a very commonly used telecom program that has been that the NSA placed a back door and I'm presuming it's Skype.  You have to presume that any closed source encryption like Microsoft's BitLocker or Apple's FileVault could very well have a back door in it.  But but Steve pointed out, and this is absolutely true, if you're using TrueCrypt or OpenPGP, if you're using an open source solution, you're likely still able to send secure messaging.  Go ahead, Dan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think much of what's happening here is is confusing and it can be perceived as clickbait.  But this is an incredibly James Bamford, who you can find his books on on Audible is a security research researcher who's come to many of the same conclusions that you have on security now.  And that is what's happened here is far more than simple failings of technology or or are the ability of technology.  What's very scary about this is policy decisions that led to infiltrations within the technology industry in the late 90s and early 2000s.  It is not simply it's difficult to articulate how important this is without seeming hyperbolic and clickbait yourself.  But this is an incredibly important story, not just because of the technology components, but because of the duplicity involved in the in the secrecy involved in infiltrating on a human level, the entire industry from ProPublica.

Transcript:  Cryptographers have long suspected that the NSA planted vulnerabilities in a standard adopted in 2006 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the U.S.  encryption standards body and later by IOS, which has 163 companies, countries as members, classified NSA memos memos appear to confirm that the fatal weakness discovered by Microsoft cryptographers, by the way, in 2007 was engineered by the agency.  They're actually subverting NIST.  The NSA wrote the standard and aggressively pushed it on the international group privately calling the effort in these memos quote a challenge in finesse.  They created the standard.

Start time: 4814.38
End time: 4856.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's two scary things about this is not only that they created backdoors.  There's no guarantee that other people haven't found them and use them.  I mean, just because the NSA is using them doesn't mean people that you'd be much more worried about than the NSA aren't using them.  And also they store this stuff.  So while the strong encryption is good now, who knows how good it'll be in five years with the advance of computers or 10 years.  But I do think that it's nice in America, at least that there is a debate about this stuff going on because in a lot of countries it's just assumed or your government is legally allowed to do this thing and there's no dialogue going on about it or people are just not aware about it.  And at least here and I don't know if it's click bait or not the level of awareness to a culture that usually doesn't care about anything because privacy is they'd rather have convenience and privacy.  I'm really glad the debate at least is going on.

Start time: 4857.48

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and we are living through a moment where we are learning incrementally almost week by week.  We are learning things that either confirm things that we've taught in the past or simply are.  I mean, some of the comments in here were that when the NSA showed this to their counterpart in Britain that they were quote unquote gobsmacked by this, particularly the ability to to decrypt things from the past.  And this is important because if you think of of, you know, the degree to which the the and I'm very nonpartisan but you think of the degree to which the Bradley Manning files really set off a firestorm because of the cables and what what was revealed in those cables.  That was a very small, very small amount of documents compared to what we are now able to access.  We are able to see many of the secrets that were kept in the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s.  And that really does inform our policy positions going forward with our allies and our enemies.

Start time: 4917.96
End time: 5042.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and even more securing we've, I'm sorry, securing even more scary.  We've been assuming that SSL is secure.  Yeah.  And it looks like it's Steve had hypothesized this and on security now that the agency was looking for SSL certificates from companies like Google.  Should they be able to get those certificates, they'd be able to un encrypt all SSL traffic to and from Google.  And apparently they have been doing exactly that.  Now, interestingly, Google's response, one of Google's responses is to encrypt traffic going from server to server in Google.  They're trying to foil this.  And what's interesting, I'd be very interested to see if this is seen as an unpatriotic move by some, you know, to thwart the NSA spying.  Is that is that to to thwart our own interests, national interests?  I believe we have the right to privacy from these police agencies.  And I also believe and I think this is very important that once a state becomes a surveillance state, there's no going backwards.  You don't go back.  V for Vendetta.  It's almost always the first step toward a totalitarian government.  We are able to have this conversation.  Thank God now without worrying about people banging down our doors.  But but we're moving in the very much the wrong direction.  If you want to do something about this, Representative Rush Holt, who is a Democrat from New Jersey in the House of Representatives, has introduced a bill called the Surveillance State Repeal Act.  I think good timing.  It would repeal the Patriot Act and the FISA Amendments Act.  I don't know if this thing has a chance in hell.  Probably not.  When you have a Congress, well, it's apparently in the back pocket of the NSA.  But I think you should write your member of Congress.  One thing we know that they do care about is their constituency.  And if you write them and say, please support the Surveillance State Repeal Act, if enough people write to them, I think they start to pay attention to this.  This is really scary.

I think that works is great because you can hack the kernel if you want.  I can't.  You know, I can't verify PGP.  You have to take someone's word for it.

Transcript:  I think there are sufficient people in the open source community to look at this code and to vet it.  I do believe that it is secure and safe.  This is a big community of people who feel very strongly.  I think the privacy is important.  And I think it would be difficult to be more than difficult.  It's impossible to get a back door into open source encryption.  And that's the key.  By the way, Rush is Rush Holt is a physicist.  So he's somebody in Congress who actually understands all of this stuff.  Wow.  He says that the NSA is overreaching and could hurt American interests.  And this is the way to attack it in Congress anyway, including the reputations of American companies whose products the agencies may have altered or influenced.  Holt says we pay them to spy.  But if in the process they degrade the security of the encryption we all use, it's a net national disservice.

There's widespread Dan Kaminsky, who's a great security researcher, a great hacker.  He said there's widespread disappointment among Internet security experts.  This has been the stuff of wild eyed accusations for years.  A lot of people are heartbroken to find out it's not just wild eyed accusations.  Yes.  Sasha Meinrath, who's director of the Open Technology Institute, a research group in Washington, said the reports were a startling indication the U.S. has been a remarkably irresponsible steward of the Internet.

And I'm not inclined to wear a tinfoil hat.  Yet this is stuff, you know, if you're interested in this, follow at Jack Rice on Twitter.  He's a colleague, former colleague of mine who was in the CIA for years.  And Jack generally is able to, you know, get rid of the FUD and get down to the brass tacks on issues.

They always have great political action information who to write to, how to write to them, how to make it work.  And I'm, you know, at this point, we ought to be pretty damn glad that Edward Snowden did leak what he leaked, because, boy, the more we learn about this, the worse it's sounding.  Moving on, let's take a break.  When we come back, we have a new Kindle, the paper white, shipping September 30th.  Amazon should do events. You know, I think Jeff Bezos on stage could have some fun.  He did. He did the Kindle HD event.  That's right. Why didn't they do event for this?  Well, anyway, Amazon also and then people like to ask him what he's going to do with the Washington Post.  And Jessica Lesson writes that Amazon looks to be offering a free smartphone, even if you're not buying, you know, not even subsidized, just free free.  We'll talk about the new Yahoo logo and more.  Go to meeting from HD Faces, our sponsor today, the folks at Citrix have created the best way to meet online.  Go to meeting. You've probably heard about it. It's been around for some time.  Just gets better and better.  One of the beauties of Go to Meeting is, you know, every time you start a meeting, you'll get new features, new benefits.  Meetings, I hate to admit it, are an essential way to getting things done.  It's how ideas get shared, problems get solved. You cut through the bureaucracy and you get things done.  Creative solutions. It's hard with the team spread out. Everybody's in different locations.  We're all global now. We use Go to Meeting with HD Faces a lot, not just to present to clients, but to meet with colleagues.  I know teams that keep Go to Meeting running all day.  No matter where you're located, Go to Meeting allows you to share the same screen, making it easier to be on the same page.  And with HD Faces, you see the other people you're meeting with. You need crystal clear HD video.  What's cool is you can do this even on an iPad or an iPhone.  In fact, you could present from an iPad. They'll see your picture. It's really cool.  I want you to try it free, 30 days free. Go to meeting.com.  Click that orange Try It Free button there and enter our offer code TWIT for 30 days free.  Go to meeting.com.  So let's see. Paperwhite. Have you seen anything played with it? What is new on the new Kindle paper?  I like the paper, the first Paperwhite. It had a very nice glowing backlight that made it very legible.  And unlike other Kindles, you could actually use it in the dark.  Apparently, improved touch screen, faster processor, integration with Goodreads. Amazon purchased that.  They now own both Shelfari and Goodreads, both of the big social reading networks.  And there's a kid friendly mode called free time.  I don't know what that does exactly.

Start playing more video games.  $119 with advertisements, $139 without advertisements available September 30th.  So I like this story. I don't know.  Jessica Lesson, who used to work at the Wall Street Journal and is apparently on her way to a new enterprise, has a blog right now, jessicaleson.com.  She and Amir Afradi are writing some pretty good stuff.  Initially claimed that they were going to do a free phone. Amazon is now saying, no, no, no, no, we're not going to do a free phone.  But this is the challenge that Apple faces. Companies like Amazon and Google don't need to make money on the hardware, do they?

Start time: 5501.21
End time: 5544.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The interesting thing is that Microsoft disrupted the entire industry with really cheap software a long time ago.  And now Google's come in and they did free services because their business does not depend on services revenue.  And the same way Apple devalued software on the app store so that it was complimentary and they could sell more iPhones and iPads,  Google and Amazon are devaluing hardware, which is dangerous for Apple because that's how Apple makes all their money.  And after cheap, the next step is free.  And that's really interesting because a company like Apple can't go there, but Google and Amazon theoretically could.  And it's not really a disruption because things go in cycles and you can compete with free by having better.  But it's a dangerous territory because very few other companies can afford.  I mean, it's destroyed Microsoft's mobile business, Google's model.

Transcript:  There you go. Now, this was a big story all week.  Everybody was talking about this and Amazon didn't comment initially.  But today they said, no, we're not going to launch a smartphone this year.  And if we did, it will not be free. So, yeah, they might as well have tacked on a nope.

End time: 5583.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not yet. To the end of that, is that what it is really? Not yet.  It it sounds like it. And I think I think for all the reasons that Renee pointed out, this is, you know, we've seen this this erosion in the cost or at least the perceived cost of hardware.  And Amazon is is, I think, dying to go all in with a free or very low cost device to acquire that market.

Start time: 5583.58
End time: 5609.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. The problem with Amazon that Google doesn't have is that Amazon can't put devices in many countries because they care.  They count on content. Yeah, they don't have.  I mean, Apple was super lucky that iTunes was there with cash registers everywhere when they launched the App Store.  Amazon's got five countries with the Kindle fire and there's no way they're going to go easily into China.  Google can't even do a lot of services in China.  So there is some protection. But in countries like America, it's a very interesting model.

Start time: 5609.98
End time: 5636.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually see that as being the one of the huge selling points and maybe the buried lead of the Kindle, the paper white and the Kindle readers themselves.  Although it's not a sexy device, these standalone single purpose devices really can get so cheap that they allow Amazon into these other markets where, you know,  a mobile device or a tablet, you know, a phone and a tablet are perceived so differently than a dedicated reading device.

Transcript:  I got to love Marissa Meyer, who has used Tumblr of all things.  And now that they own Tumblr, I guess it makes more sense to get the corporate word out.  Yes. She has a great blog post on Tumblr on the new Yahoo logo.  I can't get really excited about the new Yahoo logo.  They try to gin up some excitement by having a different typeface every day for the last 30 days.  But this is it. The official Yahoo logo. Wow. It's purple.  It's just it's not it's a new typeface.  But I fell in love with it a little bit more because Marissa Meyer did a great blog post that is the ultimate geeky blog post.

Start time: 5734.44

End time: 5760.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love this. But she did it. She did everything.  But I mean, this is offensive to designers, Leo, because she took a bunch of people in a put them in a room and thought that you could manufacture design by committee.  If you took the same people and said, hold the next version of Yahoo or people would, you know, they would come out with a useless product, but people would be offended.  But design is equally as important to marketing and to development.

Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, one of my early radio mentors, when I was very young, trying to to be a program director, he said, you know, you hire a music director you like or you fire him.  And get one that you do. You never program a radio station by committee. Yeah. Right. Right.  And the same thing with this. You don't you don't do a logo by committee.  Although, you know, I love that she used Tumblr and an old school Tumblr theme to write. This is like a really old thing.

Start time: 5792.68
End time: 5819.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So she writes on a personal level. I love brands. We knew this about Marissa Meyer on a personal level.  I love brands, logos, color design and most of all Adobe Illustrator. What?  Yeah, that when I read that, I thought whatever's coming is going to be different.  I think it's one of the most incredible software packages ever made.  I'm not a pro, but I know enough to be dangerous. Smiley face. So what does she ever.  So you really hate this, don't you? That's interesting.

Transcript:  Yes. So she writes one weekend this summer, I rolled up my sleeves and dove into the trenches with our logo design team.  We spent the majority of Saturday and Sunday designing the logo from start to finish.  She spent a whole weekend doing it. What are you talking about, Renee?  And we had a ton of fun weighing every minute detail. So we didn't want any straight lines in the logo.  We preferred letters that had thicker and thinner strokes. Serifs were a big part of the old logo.  We felt it was wrong to give them up all together. So we went for a sans serif font with scallops.  All right. All right. Our existing logo felt like the iconic Yahoo yodel.  We wanted to preserve that and do something playful with the O's.  The funniest thing is that they are last move was to tilt the exclamation point by nine degrees to add just a bit of whimsy.

Start time: 5880.65

Start time: 5891.40
End time: 5927.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. But I, you know, I mean, I don't think the logo is that big a deal.  So I'm not going to slam her on that. I love it that she put this post out. It's particularly geeky.  And then and then she said, here's a fun video created by our amazing intern, Max.  It feels like a startup, doesn't it? This is what a startup would write.  And they show the whole process in the blueprint. But really now, see, did you study design, Renee?  Sounds like yes, I have a design background. OK, there you go.  Nothing is bitchier than a designer who has been wronged. So so you feel this demeans the profession?

Start time: 5927.98
End time: 5947.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's the same thing when you get a bad press release.  Like, you know, you get those badly written and it's such an easy thing to get right.  You almost have to go out of your way to get it wrong.  And I feel bad for Yahoo as a brand that she let them go out of their way to get this wrong.  Does it matter? Come on. It's just a dollar company. It's purple.  It's got a Corel draw bevel on it. I mean, it doesn't really matter.

Start time: 5947.52
End time: 5954.30

If you live in L.A. and Dallas and New York City, you can watch the NFL on CBS.  They ended the blackout this week right in time for the football season.  What a shock. I think CBS just knew they just said, well, just sit it out.  They'll come to their senses. There's no, you know, we got this clock ticking.  So nobody's saying what the deal is, but I got to think CBS got what I wanted.  And, you know, just all time Warner has to do is pass it along to the consumers.

Transcript:  One fifth. This is a this is a story that's a little close to home for me, according to Quartz.  One fifth. Actually, it's not Quartz, but the Quartz story quotes PageFair, which is a service websites used to measure the extent of ad blocking.  Twenty two point seven percent of people who visit websites block the ads.  PageFair estimates. Now, remember, this is their business.  So they're, you know, there may be some conflict of interest here, but they say one of its typical clients with a 25 percent blocking rate loses about half a million dollars a year due to ad blockers.  Websites are most website ads are most often blocked when they tend to cater to the technologically savvy.  So this is a graph of ad blocking by site category.  Number one, gaming sites, one out of three visitors block ads, technology sites, one out of every four for travel websites, only five percent, one out of 20 because people don't know how to block.

Transcript:  Well, what this what this does not address is very, you know, there's certainly, you know, the integrated type of advertising that you do here on Twitter.  But this doesn't address native advertising that has been pioneered by BuzzFeed and Huffington Post and by native advertising.  That is the jargon, the industry, the media and advertising industry term for advertising that looks and sometimes is almost indistinguishable from the content that you will also find on these sites.  And in fact, these these companies in particular, but others as well, have started creating native advertising for other publishers, for other media publishers.  And so although we are seeing this, you know, at scale, of course, the cheap remainder of ads are blocked.  Of course, this this doesn't address the massive rise of native advertising and how that's influencing the content business as a whole.

But, you know, at Gawker and Huffington Post and BuzzFeed, they these companies have studios that create native advertising.  They create this is product placement on crack.  It is advertising that looks and feels and is placed on site so that it should look and feel just like content.  That is that is something that is is here to stay and going to become even more.

And I mentioned that we had considered studio naming and she was all upset that that I would mention studio naming or consider selling the studio name.  And I want to say, you know, this I spend literally millions of dollars a year in my own money to build a studio to do all this stuff costs a lot of money and we need to monetize it.  You don't get free Internet content without somebody paying for it.  Now, I think advertising should be handled should be done ethically.  It should be. And when we do ads, I think it's pretty clear it's an ad.  We don't let it influence the content.  We certainly don't sneak.  I think it should never be sneaky ads.  You know, ads should be clearly ads.  But I know if people block ads, you're going to something's going to have to happen.  Either these sites will shut down. We don't have Dan's podcast anymore.

The Ladi blasted off a couple of nights ago.  There's John, you're going to have to explain this to me.  There's apparently been a question for 40 years back to the Apollo 17 mission.  Eugene Cernan saw what he described as streamers, an aurora borealis effect bursting from the lunar horizon.  And we've never in 30 years, 40 years figured out what the hell's going on there.  So we we've launched a program Ladi to try to solve this mystery.  So there NASA still NASA still alive.  It's going to use a laser based.  This is the thing that's really cool. John's so he's jumping up and down a laser based communication system basically giving us broadband access to the moon at two hundred thirty eight thousand miles away.  That's pretty cool.  So Ladi will be collecting information and sending it back here at megabits a second.  But we still can't figure out how to get high speed Internet in half the country.

And that is that we have access to data and we have the ability to analyze that data.  And I have the ability to write about it.  And so somebody should be doing that.

John, John Selenia, you're waving at me.  Nothing to say or you wanted a Kit Kat.  I'm sorry.  He's our applause sign.  I got to feed him.  Yeah, there you go, John.  All right.  Thanks for joining us.  Ready, everybody?  We'll see you next week.  Another twit is in the can.  Yeah, see, that's what John does.
