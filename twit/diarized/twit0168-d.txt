I'm going to start with the people who are in studio with us, starting with Sarah Lane, who's back from Revision Thri-  No, I'm sorry, from Tech TV.  No, from G4.  She's on her own right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I call myself an in the in the ater.

Transcript:  An in the ater?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Independent creator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like it.  Well, that's with the number eight in there.  It could be.  Yeah, could be.  Is that your license in the ater?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I just made it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Also here, formerly of Revision Three, another great friend from Tech TV many, many years, Mr. Martin Sargent.  We love Marty and it's so glad to see you.  What a pleasure to be here.  Of the Internet Superstar Show.  You're lying now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Web Drifter.  And Web Drifter.  And Revision Three, which may not be gone.  May not be gone.  That's excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's great news.  Also here, Mr. John C. Dvorak, who's been long away.  And we sorry that we haven't been able to hook up, John, but thank you for being here today.  We miss you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think I'm supposed to be here to crack the whip on staying on topic.  That's what everyone tells me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's your actual job on the show.  It is absolutely true.  I understand you got beat up on no agenda this week, though.  That'll be the day.  Adam Curry did not beat up on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I guess in some kind of a bizarro world, but not in any sense that I know of.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right.  Did you and he talk about the election?  Because you predicted McCain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, two years ago.  And I was close.  You came as close as you can get.  Well, without hitting it.  But I was thinking it was going to be a McCain-Hillary election.  And then, you know, Barack flipped it.  Who could have predicted Barack Obama two years ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right after Iowa.  And I won $100 off that bet.  From?  Yeah, from some guy at the bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Move your microphone closer to your lips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can actually bend it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you can bend it.  You won't hurt it.  It's a bendable microphone.  Also here, I'm really glad to get him on.  It's not good.  We've had him on TV many times, but we've never had him on Twitter.  Am I going to have to slap you two around?  No.  We have never had...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought John is supposed to crack the whip and keep them in shape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think because I'm in the same room as them and it'll be my physical...  It's going to be tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't want to take the blame for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If we stay on topic, I'm not going to have anything to say.  And by the way, I should just tell you, Steve and Martin and Sarah  and anybody else listening, anytime John C. Dvorak says dvorak.org slash blog,  you must take a drink.  And John, we're counting on you now.  OK, I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm driving, so be nice, Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can always have somebody else drive.  Didn't you have a car service?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, but we will next time, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I waited.  I waited and waited and that service never came.  I'm so sorry.  So I had to get in the clinic.  We have a little bedroom upstairs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a clawfoot tub.  You can be very comfortable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like that bathroom.  Isn't that cute?  It's really cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Steve Bass is formerly at PC World and now of techbite.com.  He's another one of the pink slip army on the show today.  But you're still contributing editor, so you still have a role at PC World.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they came back and they said, listen, we want you on the Masshead  because it'll cost you money to take you off the Masshead.  So stay on.  They want to do the type setting.  That's it. That's it.  But no, really, they are hiring.  It's six and a half bucks an hour.  So any of you who want can jump on in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Any of you in India looking for work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's what they're going to be using soon.  Yeah, they're going to outsource.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what happened?  Who got laid off over there?  And what was the rationale?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, because people might be listening.  I can't say what the real rationale is, but some people are saying that  Pat McGovern needs to keep food on his table.  He's IDG. He's PC World.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know Pat personally, but he's just  well, he makes the money from China alone to keep food on his table  for the next 100 years, but no case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, him and Shelley.  But beyond that, it was Dan Tynan, Steve Mannes, me.  And I just heard that  Stuart Johnson, the Bugs and Fixes guy, also got nailed  two, three days ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is not a good time to be in the print business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or even in the online business.  Really? Yeah.  Oh, boy. Yeah, because all of us are being replaced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not in the online business.  Not really. Well, you are, but you're Leo.  Yeah, I can't fire myself.  That's right. I'm in the twit business.  That's Buona McCall. Hello, Buona.  Hey, Leo, how's it going?  It's great to have you.  Buona is a social media gadfly.  Is that a good way to describe you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, yeah, I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Buona.org. Let's go with that.  I first noticed you maybe a year ago and probably was on Twitter.  Then I see you everywhere now on Friendfly, on social media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm a social media junkie.  I'm not too proud of that, but that's good that you found me there, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. And it's great.  I've been wanting to get you on for some time.  So it's great to have you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but the important thing, Leo, is is he hiring?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, are you hiring Buona?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't pay very well, but I'm hiring.  $6.50 an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, listen, you go to seven and I'm with you, pal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it is tough times all around, I have to say.  But, you know, we'll see what happens in the long run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, John, what's the name of the blog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, come on now.  That's pretty... Oh, because...  It's early in the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am not taking it.  I'm not taking the bait.  I want to be...  I think it's pathetic that someone would just keep plugging their product over and over  and over again.  And I'm not going to take part in that kind of thing.  But since you asked, dvorak.org slash blog.  Have a drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you very much.  Cheers to all.  That's good.  So I'm drinking water.  I'll give you a pathetic.  You want pathetic?  I want pathetic.  You want pathetic?  So Google says to Yahoo, you know, the Department of Justice, just a little too hot right now.  That ad deal we were talking about.  Forget about it.  So Jerry Yang at the Web 2.0 Summit says, you know, I think it'd be a really good thing  for Microsoft to acquire Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, God.  Oh, wow.  He still thinks so.  That was bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How high did that offer get?  Thirty three bucks?  Thirty three.  He wanted thirty seven.  And what is Yahoo at now?  Twelve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Heading for under 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And he still has a job.  This is what's amazing to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's this company.  Yeah, but why?  Can I interrupt here and just say what I keep saying over and over and over again?  If that deal ever goes through at any price whatsoever, the EU would kill it.  It would never really consummate.  So I think the whole thing is academic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's really what happened with the Google Yahoo thing, right?  It wasn't Google saying, oh, hey, let's pretend it.  Offer Yahoo a bailout.  Then Microsoft will go away and then we can pull the rug out from under.  It's really kind of a Lucy moment pulling the foot.  When did your Peter Laurie show up?  You know, I don't know.  I might have to do with the Fez.  Oh, gosh.  I'm wearing a Fez.  That was Balmer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That wasn't Peter.  You have a you have an audience.  And so now you're bringing in new voices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll bring in new voices at a drop of a hat or a Fez,  the case might be.  You look like Groucho Marx, I swear.  It's probably the cigar and the black mustache.  What does Sarah Lane look like?  She's wearing a cowgirl hat.  Oh, Sarah Jessica Parker.  Really? No, no, no.  Sarah Jessica is not looking that good these days, to be honest with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you know, I know that he says I look, you know, 40 something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're much less equine.  Thank you. Equine.  There's a good word.  Jessica Parker looks like a rock spot.  Equine is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I've heard that, though.  Horsey is a very good monkey like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If horses have big unsightly moles on their cheeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, this is this one's supposed to jump in and say we're supposed to be talking  about tech. Yeah, what happened?  What? Good job. Good job.  Thank you. Thank you.  It's true. It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've got a little little white, a little pink thing on your cheek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's his mic angle.  That's his mic phone.  And it is giving him that Sarah Jessica Parker look.  We're going to give him the U.S. Coast Guard chiefs hat.  That's a real life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a Marty hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. Snap off a salute and that sucker and man,  I'm ready to set sail, skipper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd ride your boat.  So so so what about technology?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yahoo, Microsoft, Google.  How long before the Yahoo stockholders finally boot this guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What are they going to do when they boot them?  They're going to put into some other loser like they had before.  I mean, I don't see that it's going to help at all.  They got to bear down and sell ads.  So it's hopeless.  You know, it's not hopeless.  It's a multibillion dollar company.  They have huge revenues.  They're even profitable.  Yeah, they just have to bear down and keep their eye on the ball  and do all these cliched things and just, you know, get out of this idea of,  you know, right now, nobody's in the growth.  I mean, look at look at you talking about this.  Look at Intel.  It's like 14 dollars.  I mean, and they're moaning about the price of the of the Yahoo stock.  Come on.  It's 14 bucks. Yeah.  Go buy some. It's a bargain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it is. It is.  As soon as I get some work from Warner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who is the bargain?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who's the bargain out there?  Is Google a bargain now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I don't think I do.  What you want to look at, if you really want to look for,  at least for the technical bargains in the classic tradition,  go to Yahoo and try to find out what the PEG,  the price earnings to growth ratio is and look for that number.  And anything that's got under one is a is a bargain.  Everything over one is not a bargain.  And Yahoo is over one.  So actually, the stock should go down more.  And what is Intel's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or Borland's Borland stock must be pretty good.  Orland's good. Yeah. Goodbye right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, actually, we've you say that.  But Philippe Kahn did OK because he invented  I remember we had him on the screensavers, the technology that every

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  camera phone uses. Yeah, no, he's made.  I talked to him recently, too. He's made out.  He's got to be a billionaire now.  He's close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Every time I see him on Facebook, he says he's got a new sailboat  or he's got a new Ferrari.  He's thought that.  I've already liked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But, you know, this shows you  you want to make money, be an infrastructure, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or work for or work for Philippe Kahn or Buona McCall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I'm waiting for him to give me a buzz.  So Yahoo's P2E is eighteen point three to one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's the that's the P.E.  But you want to pay.  P.E.G. That's different than G.E.  Yeah, the price earnings is the is the peg is the  the old thinking is, is that your price earnings should reflect your growth rate.  And the peg is actually that number.  And one means your price earnings reflects the growth rate right on the money.  And anything over one means that your growth rate is lower than your price earnings.  And so the stock should be technically overpriced,  but there may be something a foot.  And then anything under one means that your growth rate is high,  but your price earnings is low.  It's a bargain, technically, unless, you know, the whole world's going to collapse.  The one to look at for that, by the way, if you're looking for something  to eyeball is U.S. steel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's their peg?  Point two. Wow.  But but isn't all the steel moving offshore to Japan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, it's moving.  Most of us going to India, but it's not that U.S.  steel doesn't have interest there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And U.S. steel is so boring.  I mean, yeah, well, there you go.  There you have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to buy Apple.  Apple's fun. Apple's cool.  Apple's got an iPhone. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So talking about sexy, something provocative and U.S. steel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's that's the problem.  So anyway, it was we're talking about something to buy and something sexy.  And not boring.  So I go to Costco. Yeah.  And I don't know if you get I mean, I really haven't priced laptops recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, man. You get two hundred dollar laptops now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they had a loaded a beautiful loaded and is enameled  and kind of a red candy apple gateway  Vista machine with a big screen, 15 something inches.  And it was fairly light for like five ninety nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. But but, John, John, the problem is they shrink wrap four of them.  And you have to buy a full.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  Oh, that's the deal.  And they throw in a case of toilet paper.  Intel's peg is one point four six.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. So it's it's in the ballpark.  No, I see. Well, that's fine.  As long as it's not over over like two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's a great bug.  I tried this on my G one, the Google phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, we. Wow. Yeah.  It work. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they went in the in the Google phone that came out.  I guess they're shipping a patch at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Some of the phones already have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. I guess they're pushing it and rolling it out.  Yeah, mine doesn't.  I got one patch, but it didn't fix this.  They left some switch on that everything you type,  everything you type from the keyboard goes to the Linux command line on the phone.  So if you type reboot, the phone reboots.  Oops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I logical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a Linux command line on the on the screen and you can tell.  No, it's not on the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the thing. It's going to behind the screen.  It's doing. Oh, you don't know.  Everything you type goes to the command line.  So if you type a bash command, it'll execute it.  Yes, some might.  That's a good.  It probably does, but you can't see the output.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody left this thing in debug mode.  Yeah, they released it because that's that's the only explanation I can think of.  That's just crazy.  It's pretty. You can't turn it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's also saving everything, you know, all your keystrokes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's saving them. That's interesting.  It is. Oh, that's not good.  That's called key logging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But but to what avail?  Well, I guess if it's saving all.  Yeah, that's what you get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're when did you get your phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got it. I ordered preordered it.  So it came September 22nd or whatever it was that all the phones came out.  And so it's a first, you know, it's the first generation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You've had it long enough to tell us what you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I like it.  You think I know you hated the battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The battery life is the killer.  It's got less than two or three hours.  If you just use it normally, you just can't get past noon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's not acceptable.  You can't use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact, what happened is I have it and I have an iPhone  and I was going to give it a chance and back to the iPhone.  But I'm going to keep the G one because I do think it'll get better.  I expect a patch.  You know, the iPhone's battery life was pretty bad until a two two came out.  Here, Martin, here's a fun game you can play.  You've got some islanders and you've got to keep them alive.  Go ahead and enjoy that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, how much battery life now are you getting on the iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  iPhone is fine. It gets me through the day easily through the day easily.  Yeah. But any smartphone, I don't expect more than that.  I'm going to charge it at night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My Blackberry Pearl.  I know it's not the cool phone anymore.  It's like it's like a week.  Yeah, I know. I charge it probably once a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wanda, what are you using for a phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got an iPhone. I'm an iPhone junkie.  Yeah, but as far as the battery life is concerned,  is the 3G and the push emails a killer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think all of the radio stuff that's going on is bad.  You know, you've got a GPS.  This is the G one, too.  You got a GPS. You got Bluetooth. You got Wi-Fi.  You've got your EVDO or whatever it is.  HSDPA. All of that is going at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I also have a Blackberry Pearl, too, and I like that as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I have a curve that I'm this the G one replaced the curve.  I would say it's comparable to the curve if it had battery life.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, that should be John, what do you use?  I'm using a Nokia E 72.  I thought you only use burners.  This is a company phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like a company. What company would that be?  Mevio. I just like him to say Mevio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to have a drink on that.  No, it's the Devonk.org slash blog.  Why are we drinking a Mevio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. Wait. No, no. Wait a minute.  If if if if Devonk is going to wait, I've got to see Tech Byte.  Tech Byte. Tech Byte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. You haven't been on the show long enough, Steve.  You're not going to get a drinking game on Tech Byte.  You got to work on your, you know, you got to be well known before  there's an actual drinking game around your appearances.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can I wait till about 430? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The sun will be over the yard arm.  It's five o'clock somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, it's an E71 here. I'm looking at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was going to say, the E71 is actually a great, it's a Nokia.  It's it's got a keyboard, looks a lot like a BlackBerry.  And it's I think it's probably one of the best smartphones.  I know Adam Curry loves it.  That's probably why it's the Mevio phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think we're the only two people that have that particular phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  at the company, but it's a company phone, which only Curry and I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, that's just if I mean, there's a they have a bunch of options.  And most people use BlackBerry's and other phones for whatever reason.  I mean, Adam is jacked up about this phone.  And so I got one.  And I have to say, it's what I like about just a really nice.  It's kind of a sexy phone for an old fashioned style with a big keyboard on it.  I love it. I do. I think it's a great.  And it has GPS that works.  And turn by turn on it.  You have to subscribe to it.  But they have it.  And then you also has like Wi-Fi that works very well.  And it has a lot of features that are pretty cool.  I was looking at something the other day.  And it just feels good in the hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who do I'm a Symbian fan? I really am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who does the GPS on the phone that you've got?  John, not sure.  I just did a piece of my last my last article for PC World was on three GPS.  As I tried it on three BlackBerry curves, I tried a Sprint, AT&T  and Verizon, and the AT&T was spectacular.  Turn by turn, you know, driving along and you can just talk into it and say,  listen, I want to go to local Starbucks and it finds it.  Wow. It's the route.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Very, very cool. I would love that.  That's nice to be able to talk to your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't have a smartphone.  I already have a crippling Internet addiction.  I can't be allowed to bring it out of the house.  What do you mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll help you with your mic.  What's wrong with my mic? It's coming off your ear.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He has preternaturally small ears.  No, I've never noticed that about you. Really?  You have who's got smart.  Martin Sargent has preternaturally small ears.  Don't look.  Preternaturally, everything coming up with my ears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have never heard that word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me look it up. Preternaturally.  Preternaturally.  That's some sort of code word, Leo.  It's got to be near your mouth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they're nice. It's a code word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Got a good lobe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good hang. OK. OK.  Get a room, kids.  So I like my lobe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a room upstairs in that place.  You guys can use that.  Yeah, with a clawfoot tub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So apparently this is interesting.  Newsweek had a very I thought a very good eight part series  in this current issue.  It's also online behind the scenes of the campaign.  One of the revelations was both McCain and Obama campaigns  were hacked by far.  They think this secret service.  I always want to call them the SS.  The Secret Service thinks by foreign nationals,  by foreign governments who were trying to figure out  what the next president might be up to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They think there was China, but I think that's dead off  because you know what's happening now.  I mean, there was a couple of reports recently about how that  there's so many bootleg machines, bootleg Microsoft machines  in China that all of them are rigged with Russian software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Unprotected. And if you're a hacker, you don't use your machine.  You hack into other machines and you then hack whoever.  Oh, that's what I was doing wrong.  You hear that knock at the door? Mr. Bass.  All Mr. Bass. Sure.  Well, and now and now revelations come out that the White House  was also under attack from these same Chinese machine.  We'll say Chinese machines because we don't know who was behind the attack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But they do think it well. I mean, they said it was China.  They don't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They said it was coming from China.  But they don't know the addresses here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They just got IPs, I think. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's complete.  In fact, it's almost certain that it didn't come from China.  Although, I mean, I'm constantly you know, I look at my server logs  constantly attacked by Chinese people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. But again, I don't think those are from China.  I think those, again, are spoofed.  They're going through.  Well, they're probably attacking for other reasons.  But, you know, it's just, you know, if you're if you're actually  the Chinese government doing this, they have enough smart guys in China  to cover that whole thing up.  So it would come in as just a, you know, a dry IP  or, you know, something from Sweden.  So if it looks like it's coming from China, then it's not coming from China.  Yeah, I would.  That's what hackers do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's very tricky.  But now, so who's behind it then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing.  Here's here's the theory.  This is what the Secret Service says.  By the way, Patrick and I spoke to the Secret Service.  They're intelligent.  They actually have good cyber crime people.  I presume that they know what we've just said.  But they say that they believe it's a foreign government  because it was apparent from the stuff they were downloading.  By the way, the Obama campaign, according to Newsweek,  the Obama campaign thought it was a phishing exploit  that somebody had opened or clicked a link  and they thought it was just a virus.  The Secret Service literally called them up, said,  it's much worse than you imagine.  They are downloading documents from you right now.  Apparently, just from what they downloaded, it's it's not  they're not trying to get they didn't, by the way, ever get to the database of donors.  That might have been a credible place they were trying to get to  for the credit card numbers.  What they did get, though, indicates to the Secret Service  anyway, that they were trying to figure out what the future president  of the United States might do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To this is a Russian success sounds more like the Russians to me than anyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rumor has it it was Ron Paul.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Ron Paul has the skills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the reason I should say the Russians is because if you watch,  there's a there's a Russian news show on in the Bay Area  and get called Russia Today.  And if you've been watching that recently, they're making a lot of  they're doing a lot of weird stories about how things are going to change  now that Obama's in and it's not going to be one guy calling all the shots.  We're going to be negotiating more.  But it's all it's kind of wacky.  And so it's almost as though there's there's any message.  I don't know to who, but it's a weird show to watch nowadays.  You should check it out if anyone's interested in following this.  It's a treat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, Leo, you know, I know who did it.  It was really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, go ahead.  I know who did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was the Decepticons, you know, because, you know, they went in  and they took some stuff and we think it's the Chinese.  We think it's the Russians.  I saw the movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was all your base are belong to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, you sound just enough like Patrick Norton to be kind of  to be to do some some pranks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Juana is our new Patrick Norton.  We're just going to think it sounds just a little bit like a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Juana, can you say, folks, let's take a step back real quick?  Let's take a step.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly. He sounds exactly like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do it again. Again, again, again, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's take a step back.  Yeah, I win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The ghost of Patrick Norton is with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, are you sure that's not Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do we really know that's not Patrick?  How do we know that Patrick didn't hack Obama?  You're not in Florida.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chinese servers or something going on.  What part of the country are you in, Juana?  I'm in Jacksonville, Florida right now.  Gators. Gators!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See what I'm saying?  Isn't Patrick in Florida right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Back to technology.  It's not who's hacking in.  It's the fact that somebody's hacking.  It just scares the dickens out of me that somebody has the skill  to bypass Secret Service, to bypass.  I think we need to put up.  I want to say a firewall.  We need to take.  I just fumbled for words.  We need to stop it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We need to get these people off the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not just Obama and McCain.  They hacked the White House.  Now, the according to the Secret Service.  But again, you know, are they going to admit it?  If it went farther than this, they said, oh, they only got into relatively  insecure public systems, they didn't get into the White House's secure files.  But are they going to admit it if they did?  The fact that these are happening, it's one thing.  You know, like I said, I'm getting hacked or attacked all the time  by Chinese IP addresses, but they are not getting in.  It's another thing entirely to say they got in.  Why are you a target of the Chinese?  Well, I've said a few things in the past that I'm not proud of.  I said I'm in Chinese.  I don't know what they mean, but apparently they weren't good.  Oh, no, that was my that was my major in college.  Right. No, no, it's I think, frankly,  if you look at the IP traffic, it's all coming out of China.  It's not Chinese people.  It's it's it's whoever is using these Chinese computers as their last stop  before they attack you. And the attacks are pretty primitive.  They're you know, they're just trying to brute force my

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  imagine like a group of guys and, you know, Beijing being like, ready?  I would be honored if they came after me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One, two, three.  Feel a little bit more important. Nobody's trying to hack me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Marty, that could be we could arrange that.  You keep wearing that silly hat.  You might you might get the coast guard after.  But I think you're right, Steve.  I mean, I think it's a look at this is going to be a large issue going forward.  Cyber warfare is a serious issue.  Now, Obama says he's going to appoint a CTO for the United States.  I love that. I heard I heard Steve Gibson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Regular startup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this guy going to be walking around the White House wearing shorts?  Yeah, it's like teavas with white socks on.  You know, a ponytail complain about how they didn't stock enough crackers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So as we slowly degenerate into the morning zoo, what's the next story?  I like it. I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a whole new look for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Dvorak, that wasn't you at Farley's the other day, was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I wasn't at Farley's.  What is you found a dog walking around San Francisco?  Yeah, I've heard about it.  Dvorak look like roaming around, but it's not me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Seemed like a very nice man.  All right. This is a story for for one and Norton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Nehalem is here.  This is Intel's I7, its newest CPU.  And we talked a little bit with Ryan Shroud of PC Perspective this week.  Benchmarks are really stunning.  This is going to be a very hot process or hot in more ways than one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they're saying that they're saying that's going to be  as powerful as quad dual quad Xeon right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, a lot of a lot of cash.  L1, L2 and L3, which is new.  Benchmarks are showing a very a lot of performance.  And it is it is quad core per chip.  Each one has four cores,  typical dual processor system and have eight cores in it.  Ton of cache memory.  And it does some interesting things when it notices, for instance,  that one of the cores isn't working too hard or working at all.  It'll kind of put more power in the core that's doing the work  and affect overclocking the processor  based on what you're up to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the other the other nice thing with all of those processes,  it'll also heat your office. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm waiting for the day where they take one of these dual core  a quad things in the end, they take them, they put the processors  on top of the computer and then you could put a coffee pot on top of that.  There you go. Now you could have warm coffee all night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think another notable thing is that they're finally dropping the  they're finally dropping the pinion pro architecture from way back there.  They're finally updating that.  So I think they can really compete with AMD now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's not the only thing that's going away in a bit.  We're going to play a dirge for one of our dearest,  most honored family members.  But first, I'm going to talk about Go to My PC, a fine sponsor of this program.  The folks at Citrix do a really excellent product.  Go to My PC is remote access done right.  You don't have to worry about configuring the firewall.  You don't. It's completely secure, 128 bit encrypted.  So, for instance, I use it instead of VPN when I'm at an internet cafe.  I don't have to worry about open access point.  I just log in to go to my pc.com with my secure username and password.  There's my office computer full screen.  Just like I'm there, send and receive email.  I could surf the net. I'm completely secure.  It is if you forget stuff.  I am the absent minded professor.  I always forget stuff.  You know, slides, data, text of my speeches.  I just log on to go to my pc.com and there it is.  These guys at, you know, PC World, you ever heard of them?  They gave it their world class award for best remote access software.  And I'm not surprised.  Setups automatic takes just a couple of minutes.  And now I want you to try it absolutely free.  I want you to go to go to my pc.com slash twit  and sign up for a 30 day unlimited use account.  30 days free.  You're going to find all sorts of great uses for it.  I'm a big fan of Go to My PC.  Use it all the time.  In fact, I use both Go to My PC and Go to My Meeting.  Go to Meeting all the time.  But these guys at Citrix know their stuff.  The great Ed Iacobucci, fan of the company, old friend.  And I am proud to say a sponsor of this show.  Go to my pc.com slash twit.  Give it a try today.  So Windows 3.X gone, but not forgotten.  Steve Bass, do you remember your first experience of Windows 3.0?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I do.  And I really rejected it because I was using QEMM.  Software Carousel.  Oh, and I was just it was working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I had.  Of us, aren't you?  You were using QEMM.  Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no, you didn't hear.  They're coming out with a 64 bit version of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you need more than four petabytes.  We can double.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  I can barely remember that crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, but you and I, in fact, you know, my memory of of of of  Windows 3.0 was we were doing Dvorak on computers.  We just had started it when Windows 3.0 came out.  That was 1990.  And I remember seeing 3.1 and saying, oh, because I, you know, I was I bought a Mac.  I was a PC user, of course, before then, but I bought a Mac and and they relief.  It felt to me like 3.1.  They caught up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you kind of went back and forth with the Mac PC all your entire career.  Now, I try to always try to figure out why.  And then it finally dawned on me that you never were a Mac fan,  but you were a Steve Jobs fan boy.  I'm in love with it.  It's actually when Steve Jobs comes back in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who isn't in love with Steve?  I mean, he's in.  He's felt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Didn't you play volleyball with him once?  I did.  And he I remember that.  Remember that?  You remember the details of the story.  Was it naked naked?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was intensely competitive.  He was so competitive.  This was up at at when it was shot.  It was kind of a weekend, a family weekend.  It was my family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Was it like that Monorio or the?  Yeah, it was up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was up there by not Monorio.  It was but it was like that.  It was up.  That's the Bohemian Club.  You're going to get up.  This is up by on the McLeod River up in the northern California.  And we played volleyball.  I was on his team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And are you really going to tell the story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was very.  Yeah, I'll tell the whole story.  He was he was not happy with me because he's very competitive.  The other thing is he immediately took off his shirt and it was it seemed to me it was an attempt  to demonstrate the fact that he had claw marks on his back.  Oh gosh.  Right.  From really?  Well, I can only imagine from a human.  I don't think it was from a human.  It could have been from a wildcat.  I don't know.  Oh gosh.  But he was very proud.  This is a great story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He was.  Oh wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My mind is going everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Steve Jobs, I still love you.  And oh, I still love him.  He's a little thinner than he was then.  The other and he wasn't wearing a black turtleneck.  He wasn't wearing anything.  And the other side of the story was I do remember talking with him about.  He was still at Pixar at the time.  He hadn't gone back to Apple about Windows 3.  One, he said that's when that's what Apple, which had it, you believe had a 10 year lead  on Microsoft, but didn't pursue it aggressively enough.  That's when Apple lost their lead.  It was all over for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Windows 3, it's still running in these Virgin.  People are still using it.  You know, the in-flight entertainment system, which is kind of a state of the art thing  on Virgin Air, it's running Windows 3X.  Not very.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, it's still it's it absolutely works.  I have an old HP Omni book.  Those are great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the one that the mouse pops out of the side.  That's it.  I love that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it was terrific.  And it runs three one perfectly.  It doesn't crash.  It's got Windows Word.  The hell was the early version?  Ninety seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, before that.  No word.  It was like Word one or word two.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the thing still works and it's a cool thing.  The only problem is I can't get any data off of it.  But you know, does it have a floppy?  No, it had remember PCMCA cards, those big heavy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And HP was pushing their high speed infrared like you could get data off right by the infrared port.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that was.  So, by the way, let me get this straight.  You use this machine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, every so listen, I'm unemployed, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sarah, isn't that revision three's laptop?  So is this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is OK.  Yeah, I.  This isn't like.  I'm sorry it said anything.  This is they are lending it to me because it is actually my only computer.  I got rid of my old laptop for a variety of reasons.  And now this is it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's we're going to do a little fundraiser.  I hope it's five to one hundred ninety five dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A nice new gateway gateway.  Oh, neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Or the AC that Acer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  I'm pretty you know, I'd love to get a new pro, but people are complaining about the keypad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I love the pro.  Kevin doesn't like the keypad, but I think that's just good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But apparently there's issues with them being kind of like a slight angle.  People are complaining bitterly.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree with her.  People are complaining bitterly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You just love saying bitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's better than Predator natural.  I like that.  But I don't want I wrote that down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't want to screw it up.  MacBook Pro.  They're going to come out with, you know, all the fixes in another couple of months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm glad you're not saying your blog too often, John, because it's actually turning out to be  difficult to sit on this ball after.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're sitting on a ball.  Check out the alcohol in that Geyserville's in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If this is the tweet where Leo falls off his ball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's low for theirs.  Advanced palette, Martin.  You know what we need to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We need to do is get the get the baguette and the cheese in here pretty soon.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can we?  Oh, you guys don't realize this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We've got this for quite a spread.  No, I'm not drinking old.  E.  Come on.  What am I?  Colleen, couldn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Colleen.  You couldn't find the pork rinds for Martin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, don't you understand why I want to work here?  I hear you.  That's work environment.  Let's get back on topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pork rinds.  Get on them, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the impression that I left you with.  I haven't seen you in years.  They're getting wasted at this place pretty soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're going to be having a food fight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are we doing here?  You know, sitting and drinking hot tea.  This is.  I'm sorry.  It's really don't get the feel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We shouldn't be, you know, Steve, you'll be.  Rubbing it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You'll be happy tomorrow that you weren't here.  Let's just.  I demand a hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Extra dark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can have a hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a story I have a sky thought was kind of funny, which was Microsoft is placing.  I'm a PC recording booth outside Apple stores.  Isn't that hysterical?  I think that's hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I didn't hear this.  Really?  Is that brilliant?  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's hilarious.  It's hilarious to me.  It's just so funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the idea is that you go to the Apple store, but wait a minute.  You see a video booth and so you jump in the video booth to say that you're using Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the ratio of what you might call prank recordings to actually throw Windows recordings  is going to be about 10 to one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The raw tape would be worth a fortune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess you're right.  I can think of the actual presence of the booth is the ad, not the what they're going  to get out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they've already started showing them on in the air, though, because I've seen some  low quality video on a PC ads on TV.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, did you hear?  Quality because they shot on a PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I actually want to do an ad promo campaign for Twitter.  You recorded the first bit of it, Sarah.  I did.  We had John Hodgman on last week on Twitter and I want to get and I'll get you to do this  to Marty.  I want everybody to say instead of on a PC, I'm a Twitter, you know, like I'm Martin  Sargent.  I'm out of work and I'm a Twitter.  Just say that I'm Martin Sargent.  You could be holding your 40.  It'd be kind of cool.  Anyway, well, as long as I'm holding a 40, I think it'd be a good promo anyway.  Well, do you have the other t-shirts made yet?  We're getting we're working on.  Yeah.  Isn't that the old story?  If you start a company, you start with the t-shirts.  Five signs.  President elect Obama is a geek.  This is from Geek Dad Wired magazine.  Of course, we mentioned the CTO.  He wants to create a CTO guy with guy in shorts and Tiva's keys wandering around the  White House.  He also is a big fan, apparently, of Star Trek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's a clearly.  Yeah, a couple of but not but not Battlestar Galactica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the if you really want to be a geek, you have to be a BSG.  Fan, not a Star Trek.  Star Trek's kind of old hat.  But he apparently at one point he walked up to Michelle Obama.  She was wearing an outfit with a big belt buckle and with jewels in it encrusted and  he pressed it and said, those dilithium crystals are correct.  And she gave him a sour look.  Sour not so.  When did you get that information?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You just made that up.  Right off the internet.  It's in the article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't see that.  They also said, wait, wait, don't tell me Leonard Nimoy was a guest in September.  He said he ran into one of the presidential candidates, wouldn't say who, but obviously

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's not John McCain, who gave him the Vulcan salute that's set in the bar pretty low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Vulcan salute.  Five sides of Obama's a geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He gave the Vulcan salute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Number one, he visited Google.  Remember he was talking to Google.  Eric Schmidt sits him down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's this I hear about the Obama iPhone app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is an iPhone app.  It's actually.  Do you have it?  Yeah.  What does it do?  Until I found out that it's probably phoning home with the names of phone numbers of all of my  contacts.  Well, at least we think that it was phoning home with who I've called.  Right.  It's kind of a call bank thing.  A year ago when he visited Google, he had a Q&A session with employees.  Eric Schmidt said, what's the most efficient way to sort 1,032,000,000 bit integers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he said, bubble sort.  I was so impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not the right answer.  No, he said the answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He said, I think the bubble sort would be the wrong way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wrong way to go.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But McCain had been posed the same question like a week before, so he was clearly prepped.  I mean, I'm not.  Yeah, he was prepped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So he was prepped.  At least he was prepped by the right people.  Right.  That was a good answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, he's got Larry Lessig helping him, or he was on the campaign.  And now I guess John Doar, who's a big contributor to the campaign, who wants to be an ambassador  or whatever, he's telling him to pick Bill Joy.  Pick Bill Joy.  So I didn't know that Bill Joy was such a nuisance over at the office there on Sandhill Road.  Get rid of Bill Joy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Didn't he move?  He moved to Montana or Idaho or somewhere.  Protect the soul of the great goo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that Bill Joy in charge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not sure I want Bill Joy in charge of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The nanomachines taking over the world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the goo.  Yeah, no, I don't think it would be.  Bill Joy is a pretty smart guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of a loose cannon, though, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't know.  Well, Joe Biden's a loose cannon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And who do you think should be the CTO?  That's an interesting question.  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Eric Schmidt has already said, I think incredibly ungraciously, has already said, I don't want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I told you before, Steve Gibson's got to take it.  Now, Buona, you're a McCain man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ah, no, actually.  Ron Paul?  Bill Barr?  I'm more independent than I am.  So, nah, I'm not a McCain man.  Do you have an opinion?  Not really.  Other than as far as the CTO, I don't really know.  This is kind of new to me.  I've never seen a CTO kind of role in office.  What are you supposed to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, let's try to figure out what a CTO would do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, one thing they said would be to make sure that policies like net neutrality were  forwarded in Congress.  I think that's a good thing.  I don't know if they said cabinet level, but doesn't that mean there has to be a department?  I hope there's not a tech department.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of scary at the same time as it is exciting, you know, because this is as much as  we want to understand them to understand tech, you know, I don't want them to take control over  too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, the way the government works, I'm pretty sure the person they'd end up with would be Kim  Commando.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a good choice.  Yeah, we could we could stream everybody live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you say Chris Perillo?  I missed it.  You guys have been drinking, haven't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Perillo would be a great CTO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stream everything live 24 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, you know, my vote would be for is Larry Lessig.  I don't know if Larry would do it, but I think Larry would be a perfect choice to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's not a CTO type.  He's more of an illegal legal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Eric Schmidt turned it down.  He wasn't even asked that he turned it down, which I think is kind of ungracious.  I do think that, I mean, they were to keep up the social networking tools.  You know, they've they've started a site called Change.gov.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly.  You know, they've given us hope that that's actually something that they could pull off.  I think a lot of people would be more interested in what's going on in politics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'd like to take this opportunity to throw my fez into the ring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, let's make Leo.  The CTO like to do it and I'll take over his operation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can take over.  I'll leave the ball, the but ball for you.  And now maybe I'll take that to the White House.  I think there should be somebody sitting on a rubber ball in the White House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Next to the trampoline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  Well, being flip, but on a serious on a more serious level, a CTO can also help  help us maybe eliminate spam.  Having somebody in the White House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Could the government do anything to eliminate spam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure, they can.  What?  Sure, they get rid of all of the computers in China.  Good luck to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I'm at our government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what's the next topic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, let's go to the next one.  Good job at killing topics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Get Marty support wine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How about white spaces?  I guess this is going to really get a lot of conversation going.  We'll see.  Federal Communications Commission voted Tuesday to approve the unlicensed use of white space.  That's empty airwaves between television channels for high speed internet access nationwide.  This is something that Tuesday last Tuesday.  This is it was a big vote on Tuesday.  Four to one.  Oh, yeah, there were a couple of votes.  I think.  Yeah, four to one.  It was another landslide.  People really wanted this bloggers, internet groups, the National Organization for Women.  I'm not sure what their interest was.  Who would be against this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's bringing high speed access to the hinterlands, which this can enable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, from what I read, a lot of people against it.  They feel that it'll interfere with emergency channels with.  Hams.  Policemen.  Yeah.  Hams are against it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hams basically are against anything.  That would interfere with their hamming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So the trouble with that, with criticizing the hams out there is that they're the only  ones that anyone could communicate during the Katrina mass.  That's exactly right.  Anytime you have any other when anything's really screwed up, if it wasn't for the hams,  we'd all be dead.  I mean, I have to I would have to give them a little more leeway in their complaining  than we normally do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no.  And in fact, hams did something very good.  They killed broadband over power line.  They didn't kill it completely.  Really?  Is somebody using it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it still keeps cropping up.  There's a whole new initiative coming out and they got it up to some gigabit or something.  They got a new speed and I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Same complaint, which was that the frequencies that would be used for BPL would be, you know,  BPL would in effect amplify them, killing emergency services and other broadcasts,  including ham broadcasts.  I seems to me the white space is if this is this is unused spectrum and the and I agree  with you, Marty, the most important thing out there right now is getting I believe internet  access is like this should be like the rural electrification products and projects of the  20s and 30s.  We should get universal internet access and that is something a CTO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Leo, that's that's what that's one of the one of the things that Obama's been talking  about with the WPA projects.  One will be getting broadband.  Excellent.  Put in across the country, a spectacular thing.  And when you become the CTO, I'm going to pick out a push for that.  Yeah, first right on top.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  America is something like 22nd in the world and in access to high speed and cost a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  better at costs of broadband costs are going up around the world.  AT&T has announced 150 gigabyte caps.  We thought the 250 gigabyte caps from Comcast were bad.  AT&T is going to is trying in Reno 150 and less in some cases, depending on your tier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But at the same time, wouldn't it be kind of neat to be able to pay very little for broadband  if I use it very less and just have it tiered, scaled?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  How about metering it?  There's an idea, Steve.  Sure.  Sure.  Let that idea in.  Are you being sarcastic?  I've been pushing for metering and all I hear is a bunch of grief from Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He loves metering.  It shouldn't be metered.  I think you could say tears.  Oh, here we go again.  I have no problem with tears, John.  Can you go with me on tears?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've got tears in my eyes.  Well, I'm CTO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got a tear in my beer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but the tears, one of the important things for tears that, geez, I remember satellite Hughes  used to do this.  They were the first one that had the cutoff.  If you use too much bandwidth.  And it happened quick.  And you'd never know how much that cap was.  Until you went over it.  Right.  That's why I'd love to see tears where we know exactly what the limits are, what the costs.  We could get Marty some more wine.  He's looking like he needs more wine.  Did you open up the hat?  Open the 40, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is danger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the real me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where the show went downhill.  What kind of cheese and crackers?  I can cut the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  Colleen's already opened hers and she's got it appropriately in a mouth.  I haven't had an OE in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Stop it.  You know what?  I actually kind of want to say I haven't had malt liquor since I was like eight.  Really nice.  While we take this break for a liquor, let's mention audible.com because we don't yet have

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Schlitz as our sponsor.  It's not bad.  It could happen if this keeps up.  Got to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Tastes pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Passing 40s on Twitter.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You did this to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

They've got, I think, 23 Michael Crichton books on audible.com.  What's your favorite Michael Crichton book?  Anybody?  Andromeda Strain?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Prey?  What was the first one?  Andromeda Strain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The first one I became aware of was Andromeda Strain.  That's a great book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's autobiography.  His memoir was pretty good.  Did he write a memoir?  Currence or something like that.  He was a physician, wasn't he?  He was.  He was studying to be a medical.  I don't know if he ever finished it, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's what made, I think, Andromeda Strain such a great book.  Is it just felt the authenticity was really there.  Michael Crichton would be a great time to read Airframe, or Rising Sun, or Sphere.  The Great Train Robbery, The Terminal Man.  These were all great movies too.  Congo Disclosure.  Jurassic Park.

A series of novellas about a soon to be United States that is kind of devolved into  a series of small city states.  Metatropolis, some of the best writers.  And I think Barack Obama enjoyed this, read by some of the actors from Battlestar Galactica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you watch that, Martin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't.  Everyone keeps telling me I got it.  You don't watch Battlestar?  You have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't either.  I don't either.  Oh, come on.  I know.  I know.  I watched the first season.  It's supposed to be great.  I have nothing to-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tim Goodman, who I respect a lot.  I love Tim Goodman.  He says it's fantastic.  It's a host of Home Improvement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love that show.  Stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's Tool Time Tim.  Taylor.  Tim Goodman.  Tim Goodman of The Chronicle.  He's always giving me very good reviews.  Tim, Alex and Goodman and Mick LaSalle listen to both of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  SFGate, they can read the same things that I read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right.  Okay.  Audible.com slash twit2, the number two.  We thank them so much for their support.  Of This Week in Tech.  You may now resume the bickering.  What did I say we were going to talk about when I took a break?  I can't even remember.  Panasonic bought Sanyo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whoa.  Really?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What does that do?  Big time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Huge.  Sanyo makes, I think, some pretty good cell phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Panasonic is ginormous over there.  Yeah.  So Panasonic's Matsushita, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sanyo makes almost all the digital cameras in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  They're the OEM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I have a Panasonic Lumix LX3.  That's their new high-end point and shoot, which I love.  Zeiss, no, Leica lenses.  They really make...  Supposedly.  Well, yeah.  I don't know what it means anymore to say Leica or Zeiss or any of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they're licensing the name, that's for sure.  The thing is that the Japanese own most of the patents for Zoom technology,  which is...  Somebody explained this to me at one of the photo shows once.  They said, you know, I said, what about the Chinese?  Well, the trouble with the Chinese is they don't have any patents for the Zoom lenses,  which are just basically completely owned by all the Japanese companies,  Canon being probably the holder of most of them.  And in fact, Canon makes lenses for a lot of Sony video cameras, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Since when do the Chinese care about patents, though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why do they care about quality?  So anyways, no, Sanyo is...  Actually, Shinon is the other one it makes, or they used to.  I think they're owned by somebody else now.  But most of the cameras are made by one or two of these companies,  and none of the brand names that you're seeing are actually making the cameras.  Maybe Nikon and Canon do, I'm not sure.  I'm sure Nikon and Canon do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're right, they may not make the electronics.  You know, that's not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the electronics also, I mean, like for example, in that Panasonic,  that's mostly, it's like Kodak's inside there, I think.  Oh really? You're kidding.  No, I'm talking about the sensors.  Oh, how interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sony makes the sensor that's used in the Nikons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the sensor that's used in the Olympic cameras is the same one that you have,  and half of the Panasonic cameras are because they're both using the 4 3rds thing,  and I don't know.  It's actually a confused mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, so I guess Panasonic buying Sanyo...  You know, Sanyo also makes the Xacti's though.  I really like those HD camcorders, the kind of the palm help, palm top camcorders.  Those are pretty nice.  I think it's interesting.  I don't, you know, I guess we don't know enough about these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, is that the Sanyo camcorder, that little one that has the, I think, I'm not sure.  Looks like a pistol grip.  The New York Times uses them.  They have a mic input.  Is that the one with the mic input?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they do.  Some of the Xacti's have 1080, I think there's a 1080p with the mic input.  You're not an XLR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, those are great little portable cameras.  What does the Times use it for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They use it for, you know, all those little videos that they put on their front page on the web now.  I mean, they shoot videos all over the place and they have them.  They just, you know, they're shooting.  They're having everybody shoot videos and shoot still pictures,  even though some of these slideshows they have are pretty crappy.  But, you know, they have all the reporters do this stuff, whether they like it or not.  If you're going to be a reporter in today's newspaper,  you're going to have to be able to do multimedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have to again say, Steve, I think print is in trouble.  It's a tough time for print.  And you probably...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is.  It is.  Print is second banana, as they've said at PC World.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, talking about 1080p cameras, you know, the Kodak for a while has...  In fact, one of my favorite cameras now is a little Kodak they use to film stuff with,  which is 720p 16x9.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's that new flip competitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, that's different.  That's actually just...  I'm talking about a regular still camera that does the same thing as that camera.  I'd like to take still pictures.  But anyway, they showed it.  If you can go around the net someplace, you'll find an ad for the Nikon,  latest Nikon digital SLR, which has live view and it will take a movie.  It's the first one that takes movies, right?  It's the D, whatever that is.  I remember seeing that.  I think they did...  They did.  The D90.  The D90, yeah.  They shot a movie with it in 1080p using just a Nikon handheld camera  through some of those great lenses and it makes your jaw will hit the floor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  John, you're confused.  That's the new Canon 5D Mark II.  No, the Nikon D90 does it as well.  Because the motion on the D90 is bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's 720, not 1080 on the D90.  The new Canon is 1080p.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Vincent LeFleure.  The D90 is 720.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Okay, well, I was looking into getting one and then I heard the video was really wonky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you want to get the new Mark II.  It's the one with the late night New York street scenes, right?  And the Calicoxer shot in New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, well, there was the...  It's the one that's 1080.  If it's the Canon that's got the 1080.  It's the Canon.  It's not out yet, but I can't wait.  This is the typical.  You know, Canon is just killing these guys.  Well, Nikon, you know, it's very...  That even ruins my anecdote.  I can't even get that far.  I mean, it's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nikon had a real world beater with the 3D and then the D90,  or the D3 and the D90 and the D700, but it's a seesaw battle and Canon came right back.  Now, by the way, that Mark II is now delayed, I think, till December,  but a lot of people are in line for that.  And the movie Vince made with that is stunning.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's unbelievable.  You look at this thing and you go, my God, this is like the definition and because of the...  You know, you can use those fancy lenses.  I mean, it's just like who's going to use a digital or a camcorder now?  I mean, what would be the point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, get ready because Mr. Oakley is also back in the game.  He's making a new camcorder that he says...  You know, remember he's making the RED camera, which is a 4K camera.  Has anyone ever seen this thing?  Oh, yeah.  In fact, I've seen footage from it.  Alex Lindsay, I think, has one.  A lot of people have them.  Oakley is making a camcorder.  He says it's going to change or a camera or something  that's going to completely change the business.  And now people kind of poo-pooed what he was going to do with the RED.  I was one of them.  It's pretty impressive.  It's pretty impressive.  And now he's going to do an HD camcorder or an HD camera.  I'm not sure exactly what it is, but there's a lot of talk about this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it'd probably be cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, now the RED is relatively cheap, but it's still expensive.  I think it's 20,000 or 30,000, which is cheap for a 1080p camera, you know, film camera.  Yikes.  But yeah, this camcorder thing is, I can't remember.  Is it the orange?  Is it the pink?  I can't remember exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The thing is, I wonder what, you know, if you can take with this Canon 1080p digital SLR,  if you can take movies of, I mean, if you can make a movie from that,  why would you spend the extra $25,000, you know, for one of these bigger units?  I'm just not getting the math is eluding me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I agree with you.  I'm very excited about this 5VLARC2.  And everybody I know is, especially people who have invested in Canon lenses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There are limitations, though.  I think once you're running the video, you know, the chip will get too hot.  So you've got to, I feel like you're going to use it exactly the way that you would use a camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but you could have five of them.  But you could have 10 of them and still be cheaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was really thinking of replacing all these cameras.  These cameras, these XL2s from Canon cost $4,000 when they were new.  That's twice as much as a Canon 5D Mark II.  They're $2,700 body.  We're in an interesting time.  I think nobody will deny that.  No, nobody.  Say again, Buona.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I said that is the truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  Thank you.  By far.  Amen, brother.  Hey, I'm curious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you hear my keyboard as I do now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's because both Sarah and Marty decided suddenly to write long letters to their friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's to the IRC chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you're chatting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  These are my peeps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who's in the IRC chat room?  Everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.  A lot of people.  652 people in the IRC.  Seven different Kevin Roses.  That's what I call a mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's too many people.  Chat rooms are ineffective after about 25 people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right.  It's hard to read.  25 people?  It's hard to read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're looking at what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  5,300 watching the video.  There'll be about 175,000 listening to this, though.  So let's not forget the people who will be listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are 40, almost 5,000 people in the chat.  And this thing keeps scrolling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Say 175,000.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I better start being entertaining.  Come on, Marty.  I'm trying to save your career here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We'll be entertaining immediately once we get back to tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think we've run through all the stories.  Is there anything else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's what we've been on for an hour.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can I break?  Let me break something up.  John, John, what kind of keyboard are you using right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not using it.  My keyboard is on, oh, let me take it, pick it up off the floor.  IBM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wouldn't let John type anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He was bitching and moaning to everybody that could listen that I was typing too much.  I'm using an IBM.  A Selectric?  An IBM keyboard on a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How many of you still have a Keytronic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You like those buckling key switches.  Northgate.  Yeah, the Northgate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have one of those old Northgate still in the closet signed by Stan Freberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  That's Stan Freberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Come on.  Stan Freberg, the comic?  Yep.  Why did he sign your keyboard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a special event where he was working for that guy who ran Northgate.  That's just bizarre.  He was at the event and he was signing keyboards and I have one with his signature on the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Sinbad signed my monitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's just weird.  Well, Northgate is long gone, obviously, and I've got something called an Avant Stellar,  which is just like the Northgate.  It's produced by someone who used to work for Northgate and you can hear it.  Listen.  Oh, yeah.  It's got the old, it feels so good.  The only downside is I can never type when I talk with an editor because  how you check email was...  You can tell you're typing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that's not...  When you're talking with an editor, I usually type away because if they think you're taking notes,  they feel real good about themselves.  That's a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I did wrong.  Jeez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Every once in a while I say, could you say that again?  I want to get that...  What's the spelling on that?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Meanwhile, you're in a chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A-V-A-N-T-S-T-E-L-L-A-R.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, my question is, I use mushy keyboards because it's too noisy and I don't want people  on the radio show to know that I'm Googling their answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want them to think I just knew that off the top of my head.  $189 for this keyboard.  Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's got built-in FM radio.  No.  It's got Wi-Fi.  Come on.  It's got four USB ports and a hard drive base.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You actually don't need a computer.  It's just, it does it all for you.  And it has copy paste too.  John and I used to talk about this a lot, actually, because you like those buckling  key switches, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like that.  You know, the all-time greatest keyboard ever made was the one that came with the IBM PC-AT.  It was a big, giant, heavy thing.  The thing weighed about 40 pounds.  It was extremely well built.  Of course, you could hurt yourself with it if you dropped it on your foot.  But it had really good feel and it had the right spacing and it had the keys in the right  places.  It was very, very effective.  I like that keyboard a lot.  I think the old timers will all remember it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Many people will remember that because, of course, that's IBM patent $4,118,611.  Wow.  The IBM buckling screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, buckling spring.  John, a bunch of people in the chat room are asking if you have anything to do.  You must get this all the time with the Dvorak keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of course not.  The Dvorak keyboard was invented over a decade or more before I was even born.  It was invented in the 30s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But he did write the Ninth Symphony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did the symphony.  Now they're confused.  They're easily confused or they wouldn't be in a chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I always thought Twitch stood for this week at Tech.  It clearly is this week in typing.  I didn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dvorak.org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, thank you, John.  Hey, Katrina.  I was getting thirsty.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  And one other keyboard.  And John, I have a question.  Do you have the control key where it really belongs or do you have it  where the wrong keyboards have the control key?  Where the caps lock key is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  I have it.  I unfortunately gave up on the good fight and I still have a caps lock key there.  I wrote an entire column for PC Computing one year, which got some  negative response from the editors.  But the readers like it was all about why the caps lock key should be discarded.  Why do we have that key where it's located?  It makes no sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's the nice thing about this, Yvonne.  Stella keyboard, you can disable it.  You remap the entire keyboard.  And wait a minute.  Do you remember Gateway had the Maxi Switch keyboard?  And wait a minute.  There's more.  Yeah, that's right.  Do you remember the Maxi Key Switchboard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I remember that.  I remember it.  I don't remember anything about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Totally preprogramable.  The entire keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there's software to do that with any keyboard, though, nowadays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but with Vista, the best keyboard remapping was Keytweak.  And it doesn't work with Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A lot of things don't work with Vista.  Yeah, it sounds like the old timers league.  It really is getting bad.  It does.  Yeah, and when I was a kid, we used the Keytronic.  We had a green screen and then we kicked it when it didn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why I'm still getting six and a half bucks an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For a student, it's like asking about the fries.  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  President-elect Obama is expected to name Washington, D.C. lawyer Henry Rivera  to head a transition team focused on the FCC.  He's going to have a lot of influence on what happens at the FCC.  Rivera used to be a partner in Wiley-Ryne, served at the FCC under Mark Fowler, 81 to 85.  Current FCC chairman Kevin Martin worked at Wiley-Ryne.  This guy is a quintessential insider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, everyone's blaming Obama.  I'm not an Obama fan, by the way, but everyone's blaming him for all you know.  He says change, change new, this, that, and the other thing, and he brings in all these kind of  old hacks.  I think it's probably what he should do.  He can get rid of the old hacks after he gets his feet wet, but he can't go in there like a  rube because they'll just walk all over him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a transition team.  These are the guys who know where the bodies are buried.  That's, I guess, the guy you want in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.  Carter is one of the guys who walked in and got submarineed, and then Clinton apparently  walked in naively and it took him a couple years to get.  Terrible transition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the difference is Obama's doing the transition team two or three days after he was elected.  I mean, the guy is sharp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's interesting.  I think it's not two or three days after he's elected.  It looks like more we learn that he's been doing this for months.  He's been preparing this transition for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm looking forward.  HBO is going to do a documentary.  They've been following it for two and a half years, and I can't wait to see it come out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One of the great documentaries on elections was The War Room, the Clinton election.  Right.  James Carville and just fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What movie was that?  The War Room?  No, that movie that had that crazy book that came out that had all the scandalous information.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Joe Klein's.  Joe Klein's book.  And apparently, you know, it kind of indicated that Carvel was a flasher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, he looks like he could be, but we wouldn't want to libel the man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I know it said that guy indicated in the book he should sue the book.  Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or John, you know, you can sue anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I don't think that's the kind of lawsuit you want to get involved with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm an LLC and I've got all of my assets sheltered in the Netherlands.  So don't, you know.  Probably not.  I'm sorry, nether regions.  Did I say Netherlands?  Yeah, now you gave it away.  Oh, boy.  Primary Colors, that's the name of the book.  Which was a thinly, thinly veiled romance.  It was hilarious.  It was.  And I think a lot of it was not intended to be.  He wrote it anonymously.  I think he was embarrassed by it.  It was fiction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was fiction.  Yeah, it was fiction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Anybody have any other stories they want to cover?  Any other big breaking news in the tech community?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got a quick story.  Like that poor kid who...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, do you want to tell that story?  That is the saddest story I've ever heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, let's tell it now that you broached the subject.  I suppose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You might as well finish it.  Have some more cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, he was...  Thank you.  It's very good.  Nobody else wants it.  I'm going to eat this whole bag by myself.  Canadian kid, 15 or so.  And his parents thought that he was playing too much Call of Duty 4.  Grades are going down.  Probably was.  He was doing a lot of that.  Not a lot of everything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My kid plays too much Call of Duty 4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And he ran away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They took his Xbox.  They took...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, so they made it so that at least at home he couldn't play it anymore.  Right.  He ran away and was camping.  I mean, it wasn't like he ran away to, you know,  throw himself across train tracks or anything necessarily.  No.  But he did not survive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they ran out.  I don't know whether he ran out of food or I don't know what happened.  He froze to death or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, but the thing is that I feel like this is probably more of a,  you know, parents, they don't understand me issue than I have to play Call of Duty 4.  Because obviously if that was really the case, he wouldn't necessarily have gone camping.  Well, you know, it's really sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Microsoft put in $25,000 reward for his, you know...  You're kidding.  Yeah.  People got very galvanized by this and to have this tragic end to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what's also really sad is you read the message board postings  at the end of that article, the forums.  People creepy or what?  Unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's a bunch of 15-year-olds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know that.  Well, I don't care if you're 15.  It is sad.  Well, you know, it's hard to do it.  15-year-olds don't have...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  15-year-olds don't have...  They are missing...  Not all of them.  Some of them.  A little bit of scruples.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And by the way, you know, this is one of the reasons, you know,  I remember when I first started blogging and we were really harsh with our moderating.  And people, oh, you're moderating.  You erased my thing.  You know, moderating is extremely important.  Those creepy posts that you see can easily be removed if people moderate more aggressively.  And you don't have to deal with it.  I don't think readers should be an encounter.  I mean, you're going to have a bunch of crackpots on any system.  But when it gets really nasty or creepy, it's got to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a tough decision.  You know, I've had to recently do some moderating.  But you're right.  You can get a chilling effect from some of these people.  And you really do need to make it safe for normal people.  For everybody else.  The problem is that on the Internet, you can be totally anonymous.  And I think a lot of them are kids.  I think that's part of the problem.  But I think also the anonymity allows people to do and say things that they wouldn't say in real life.  I always say, pretend you're sitting next to me.  Pretend you're actually here.  Now would you say that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It took me years to finally moderate comments on just my personal blog.  I don't know why I never did before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you do it with a heavy hand?  Do you mean you're out there doing it every day now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I think you have to.  If you're a woman in tech, especially.  Oh, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I'm really not going to delete something unless it's really bad.  If I think it's going to offend everybody else, then I really, you know,  if it's something that I don't like what you're wearing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You ever go after people like you find out who this person is?  Like you find out how to go to their home.  Shut them down.  I used to block my keys and try to figure out things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because they don't think that you're even going to read the thing, let alone respond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, no.  If you respond, it's like, oh my God.  Oh my God, sorry.  Talk to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  As soon as people know you're moderating, there's only a few nasty things I get now.  I mean, it used to be a lot worse.  But now they know that I'll read it and it won't be funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then, you know, there's also the guys who would like to come in with different names  and stuff.  But, you know, if you run, this one I had talked about blogging with some event recently.  And they said, you know, real blogging isn't these guys at the newspapers that have this  stuff go through editors.  When you run and own your blog, you go back there.  You can see what the IP addresses are.  You can ban the IP address so the guy can't even get on the blog anymore.  If you really had some fancy systems, you could have one of those things.  I think it's called a clown filter.  If you know what those are.  Bozo filter.  Bozo filter.  Those are great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the people who just type in one letter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No clowns here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Clown filter, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's a moral responsibility of someone running a blog to take care of all of the  comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think so too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You just do it.  You got to because there are people saying inappropriate things whether you're offended  or not.  They're inappropriate.  And they just cut them off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a lot of filtering mechanisms that actually can cut them off without you even  doing anything, which is useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is why I'm a fan of IRC.  I'm a big fan of IRC because it has great moderation tools.  If like 10 people come in and start just causing trouble in my chat room or anything,  I just moderate the chat and just have voice users talk or I can just ban the problematic  users.  That's why I like IRC.  I think it's a big...  The tools you use is a big component as to how effective you can moderate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We have, let me see, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten moderators  in our IRC.  We have, you know, when you have that many people going, we have a big, we wield a big  band stick, let me tell you.  And it works.  It does work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does.  Yeah, they warn me.  What's this I'm hearing in the chat room about you just having won an award?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  What award is this chat room?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The best hat.  Who, me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, not you, Leo.  Tweed, I think.  Marty.  Tweed won a podcast award.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We win those every year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What did we win?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Round of applause.  All right.  Jeez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A shiny, shiny...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'd love to win a podcast award.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A key fob.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, see, see all the awards in the shelf?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did they just do an award?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  We, we, no, I'm very grateful.  I appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who's we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What were you?  Oh, he has a mouse in his pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I do have to say that there are so many award shows, web award shows that  they all kind of sound the same to me after a while.  I know that this is the big one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the podcast awards that they do at the New Media Expo, I think.  Right?  This is the, this is the podcast awards.com.  What did we win?  Yeah, I'm thrilled about it.  I didn't even know we won.  They were announced today at 4 PM.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did I win?  You won Best Tech Podcast.  Best Tech?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's great.  Yeah.  Just won.  Best Tech.  Well, that's great.  This is, this is a great honor.  And I want to thank the Academy for making me, once again, the best tech podcast in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you have a, do you have a tuxedo in the closet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think they heard this particular episode is my only fear.  Hey, I got a tech question for you.  How many of you saw the hologram on CNN?  Oh, I saw both of them.  They're terrible.  Cool.  Very, very cool.  All right.  All right.  I hear a terrible and a cool.  Steve Bass, you start.  Very cool, Y and Y.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was cool.  It was, it was absolutely valueless.  I couldn't give a hoot that they was standing, you know, in front of each other.  They could have done the same thing in a tent behind a green screen.  But the technology to be able to see that and to hear that they used what?  48 different, I guess.  You know, there was some disagreement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The correspondent said 32.  I read 44.  I mean, I read 30.  It was a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know who was apparently behind it?  It was too many.  Jason O'Dell and David Borman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jason O'Dell and David Borman.  People don't know Jason.  Well, let me, good.  He was like an IT guy.  And Borman started the site, got the site launched.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So maybe we should ask Borman the question that I still haven't found an answer to.  Maybe one of you guys know, which is did the person, the wolf,  blitzer, whoever the heck it was looking at, will I am or the other person that came on,  did they actually see something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They were doing exactly what Soledad O'Brien was doing in 1996 when I appeared as a 3D graphic  on the site on MSNBC.  She was looking at a blue dot and I guarantee you,  we're looking at a blue dot.  He's not seeing a hologram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's the point?  It wasn't the Star Trek show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, to me, it was a little gimmicky.  And frankly, look, you guys work in TV.  It's not, they don't need 30 cameras to, not anymore.  Well, it was way too many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what it was?  It wasn't only-  Give me a week.  I'll be back.  It was okay.  You know, this person looks like they've been, you know, they've been hologrammed.  Well, they intentionally did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They had to make it look less lower quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They had to dumb it down.  Yeah.  They had to dumb it.  It was too many, it looked too real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, like the woman, her name is escaping me.  You know, she had to stand real still and she's kind of awkward looking.  I mean, the whole thing just seemed unnecessary to me.  I was hosting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The election coverage for current that night.  Were you?  I was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I didn't know that.  I was.  For Al Gore's channel?  For Al Gore's current.  And did they have the Twitter going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it was the whole Twitter.  It was Twitter slash current.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that thing still on the air?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Apparently, because they paid me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We, we did the same thing here.  I didn't know we could have, we could have connected.  I actually like current.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, don't you think it would have been cooler if they would have,  instead of dumbing it down, made it ultra high resolution,  put the person on the stage, had the interaction,  and then not said anything and let it leak out that it was actually a hologram  and the person wasn't there as part of their new technology.  I would have enjoyed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would have enjoyed it a lot more than telling us.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would have been terrific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was cool to watch.  I mean, I got, I got a Star Wars Goose pimple and then it went away and I was like,  okay, that was cool.  And then I read about how it was done.  I was like, all right, that's just, that's just ridiculous.  That's a giant waste.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They need to have everybody like lean over and do the thing  and then stand up and deliver their.  I think I can do something like that here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Yeah, you are.  This is so, wow.  There's the back of my head and there's the front of my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Leo, I like you, but that's the worst hologram I've ever seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do it again.  Do it again.  Do it again.  Do it again.  It's like a poor man's star wipe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What are you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The star wipe with a video toaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's time to cut them all off.  No more, no more wine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I had a small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought it was slash blog.  A small drink.  Take a drink.  No, that's mean.  So, okay.  So you thought Steve Bassett was a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I loved it.  I thought it was terrific, but I'm not a TV guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So John C thought it was gimmicky.  Exactly.  Juana, what'd you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought it was all right.  It was like I said, it was, it was one of those things where it was cool to look at  because I love Star Wars.  I thought I was looking at Princess Leia for a half a microsecond  and then it wore off and I quickly got over it real, real fast.  By the time they got to Will.i.am, it was just, it was at that point I was tired of it  because it looked too fake and I think they should have just bumped up the quality like  they were, they were originally intended to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It just was odd.  I can't understand who the audience was for this.  Are they trying to impress people with their technological savvy?  Or is it something, I mean, did they enhance in any way the information?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, they were doing a one-upmanship to MSNBC and Fox.  Exactly.  That's what I was going to say.  MSNBC had their silly ice rink.  MSNBC was the worst.  What was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was horrible.  3D data, 3D set that was just bizarre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They had columns.  Things came up and down.  It was a cheap looking set.  Looked like it was done with some old gear, like an old glow caster.  It was horrible.  It was pretty cheesy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I could do that.  Look, I got money.  Did you do some more of those effects?  Yeah, I got money coming out of my ear.  Yeah.  Look at that.  That's like a magic trick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They only took two cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I got balloons.  Yeah.  I can do that.  I don't need 44 cameras on Sarah Lane to make her appear fuzzy and low quality.  I can do that with this switch right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or just, you know, squint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Squint.  Jessica Yellen is the name of the course.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jessica Yellen.  Oh, Yellen.  She went in there yelling and screaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think if you're going to do it, do it with Will.I.Am.  Do it with a guest.  That's fun.  But when you know that it took 38 cameras and they had to have a special set and it  had to be specially lit and to do what?  To do anything any better than a double box?  I mean, is that really any better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you know, everybody tuned in to take a look.  So there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just caught it by accident.  I wasn't tuning in to take a look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A lot of people were though.  I can do that.  I'll put Sarah in the double box.  Let's see here.  I'll see it.  We'll put Sarah.  Siam median.  We can do everything they did.  Look, now Sarah's appearing live in our studio.  It's amazing.  I love you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The difference is she's actually there.  There's a thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, wait a minute, John.  You think I am.  Wait a minute, John.  He's still eating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sitting in my underwear in my apartment in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There was a show once on TV called Silicon Spin in which you would have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, this is unbelievable.  It's funny you're going to bring it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So for a lot of times you'd have a guest via satellite.  So they'd be in a double.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This was the creation of these guys who had to change the show.  We had a pretty decent little show that people liked.  And no, no, no, we got to make it more like the show that was Larry's favorite show,  which was Hardball.  So no, it should be more like Hardball.  And of course, the thing was Hardball was on the same time as my show.  And so he never watched our show.  He was always watching Hardball.  So apparently he told somebody, Peter Hammersley ended up bringing this idea in.  No, we got to make it look like just like a satellite.  And you're talking to somebody else somewhere.  So we'd have this guy.  And these guys thought we were idiots, by the way.  All of our guests.  I mean, I would come into a place and think you were idiots.  If you did this is the same studio across the room, put a separate camera on him, boxed  him in as though he was coming in from Cleveland when he's sitting right there.  Why does he do?  Why doesn't he just come over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He could sit in the chair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  Exactly.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was that a crock or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll never forget walking into the studio and I did a double take.  I'm looking at you on the set.  I'm looking at the screen.  There's a guy in a box.  And then I'm looking over here and he's sitting and not only that, did they prop him up?  Did they like put did they raise the chair?  Was he like on a platform?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He was on a tall chair.  I don't know what the point of that was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Very strange.  It was a very strange thing.  It was crazy.  We could do that, too.  Coming in now live from his basement apartment in Rochester, New York.  Martin Sargent is joining us on the show and it's great to see you, Martin.  Give us a little tour of the facility that you're in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Make sure there's a delay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is my library of computer books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Me always reading tech books.  Very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh oh.  Happy birthday to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Happy birthday, Vash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right.  We're just going to end this here because it's just gone on far too long.  I'm a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I ate half a large baguette or French bread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You look fabulous.  Somebody.  Well, I feel a little, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, I got sargeworld.com back up.  Did you?  All right.  I finally have the time to blog again.  Did my first post.  You go up to sargeworld.com and get my reaction about the whole revision three cancellation of internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, to me, the best thing is Sargeworld.  That picture of you at the bar, which is the header picture of that, that is one of my favorite.  Isn't it amazing?  And who is this guy?  He was just some guy.
