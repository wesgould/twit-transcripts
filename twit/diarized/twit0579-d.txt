What does that mean?  The 30-mile zone is there's a radius  within Hollywood where back in the  olden days you didn't have to get pay  union workers a per diem.

That, by the way, is Alex Wilhelm  from Mattermark. Great to have you.  Good to be back.  This is the Young Guy edition here.  And also joining us, Nathan Oliveras  Giles, who brought his Mac Pro.  He doesn't want to be separated from it.  Ever again. He's at the Wall Street.  In case his iPad Pro dies.  Love it so much.  He's a professional.  And the ugly ass case.  That is proof positive that Johnny Ive  has been on sabbatical for at least three years.  Also joining us via Skype  and I'm really glad to have him,  Philip Elmer DeWitt. He is the elder statesman  of the Mac journalistic community.  He has his new website,  PED30,  which is  a, congratulations, by the way,  a wonderful site,  all about Macintosh after he left Fortune.  This is his thing.  And you were at the Apple event, were you not?  I was. Guilty as charged.  The only amongst us.  Yesterday we had David Pogue on.  Really?  Yeah, on the new screen savers.  And he actually,  I think, did a fairly good job,  much better job than Phil Schiller,  of justifying the loss of the headphone port.  Courage was not the first thing that left to mind.  Here we are.  A nine out of ten.  Here we are. A nine out of eleven.  The last thing you want to say is,  oh, it's a courageous thing to remove the headphone jack.  When, you know, on this day, fifteen years ago,  some true courageous people really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Courage!  So, Philip,  I didn't want to...  I guess I led with the headphone jack,  but I guess for those of us going in,  we thought we knew everything about what Apple was going to announce.  There weren't any real surprises.  The headphone jack was the one thing, though,  that many of us thought,  they can't do that,  and then they did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What do you think?  It's so weird, because anybody who was following this,  not everybody,  but we knew about this,  so the first rumors of this surfaced  at the end of November last year.  So we had 10 months,  the people who follow Apple,  to kind of digest it.  And I went through my five stages of grief that first day.  So anger, denial,

Start time: 343.96
End time: 348.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  you finally got to acceptance?  Bargaining.  It was weird,

Start time: 349.76
End time: 412.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  because it surfaced in a Japanese blog  that I'd never heard of.  And by the second or third derivative story,  it wasn't just a rumor,  it had happened.  Apple had already eliminated the headphone jack.  And my piece said,  Apple would be crazy to do this,  and there was a lot of people who were crazy  to do this.  And they were just crazy enough to do it,  and sure enough, they did.  But what's odd is,  I was not surprised.  Was anybody here surprised  that there wasn't a headphone jack?  That was a done deal, right?  It made such business sense.  But my point is,  that then you turn on the nightly news,  and that's all anybody's talking about.  I mean, the general public found out  something really surprising.  They didn't know ahead of time.  Right.  And now, within a couple of days,  have you seen the college humor  parody?  Let me play a little bit of this.  It's pretty darn funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  to make their products better.  But at Apple,  we pride ourselves on thinking different.  That's why with the iPhone 7,  we've done something that's been done  for the last few years.  We've done something that at first  seems counterintuitive,  and then is.

Start time: 433.34
End time: 448.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then it gets worse.  We removed  the headphone jack.  And that's all. That's the new.  That's the newness right there.  It's just the lack of a thing that was there,  and now it's gone. It's not there anymore.  Ta-da!

Transcript:  Anyway,  it goes on, and there's some profanity  as Tim Cook realizes all the downsides.  Downside one, of course, you can't listen to music  and charge at the same time without a $40  Belkin dongle. Apple didn't even  deign to make a dongle.

Start time: 463.58
End time: 473.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm supposed to be able to say dongle out loud and not get in trouble.  But I think to Phil's point earlier about the mainstream  people being confused, it shows the gap between  our world and the rest of the world.  So we sit here and we talk about everything.

Start time: 473.58
End time: 475.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  We knew it was going to happen. We've been prepared for this for months.

Start time: 475.64
End time: 487.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've been on several Twits now about this one.  Headphone jack. Now post. But I mean,  everyone else was shocked. Reddit even lost its mind over this.  And I'm like, where were you guys two months ago?  We were on a private island. They were out in the real world.  And we were confused.

Start time: 488.04
End time: 503.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of the things that really surprised me was  how many people thought that  Apple just basically is no longer  going to include headphones with the phone  since they announced the Airpods too.  Well, you don't need one because you don't have a headphone jack.  But they're still including the headphones that now  plug into the Lightning port, right?

Start time: 504.04
End time: 570.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And then also the $9 dongle that will  do a conversion, which  I think what you should do is add to the  price of your iPhone $100 for dongles  and just buy 10 or 11 dongles, right?  And put them everywhere.  Put them in the house. Put them...  If you like headphones, I love  Atomodix headphones. They have this old-fashioned  thing called a headphone jack.  I'll just put a dongle on there  and then I can use it with the Lightning port.  But in the long run, Apple's real...  Well, first of all, let me say what David said,  which I think is somewhat legitimate, which is  every smartphone manufacturer  would love to remove the headphone jack.  He says that's a big  piece of real estate inside the phone.  And if you could get rid of it, that would  let you do a lot more things. In Apple's case,  it allowed them to do stereo speakers.  It allowed them to increase the battery by 14%.  It allowed them on the 7 Plus  to put a dual camera in there.  It allowed them to put  of dubious value a haptic  sensor for the home buttons.  They didn't have to have a physical home button.  They were able to do more  because they had a lot more real estate.  David said that you don't understand.  That thing takes up a lot of real estate.

Start time: 571.42
End time: 587.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the battery gains you get,  you're going to lose them  because you're using Bluetooth,  which is just a battery stock.  So you get 14% more battery life.  But I'm going to lose 20% of my battery life  because I'm using Bluetooth all the time.  So it's a net negative.

Start time: 587.46
End time: 601.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, I should also point out  that Apple's long-term intent  doesn't seem to be for you to use wired headphones at all.  I mean, they are going to make some...  Is it coincidental that Apple also  owns Beats, a headphone manufacturer?  I would go and say no.

Start time: 601.88
End time: 603.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No one sells more Bluetooth headphones than Beats.

Start time: 603.88
End time: 606.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is their business.  And they announced

Start time: 608.08
End time: 615.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the new Solo 3s.  I love that you know that though. That's awesome.  Of all the factors to have,  number one in Bluetooth headphones, boom, sold.

Start time: 615.88
End time: 631.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They also will be making Lightning Jack a headphone.  You have to wonder though if Apple's going to have  the courage to put a lightning port  on their laptops  and take away the headphone jack there too.  I guess not, right?  So they're going to have the dual platform solution?  I don't understand.

Start time: 632.34
End time: 633.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  USB-C, lightning, and nothing else?

Start time: 634.44
End time: 692.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Could that be where it's going to go?  It also creates this sort of divide between  your computers,  your iPhone's a computer,  and every other audio device on the planet.  Right.  Like everything else on the planet uses  mini jack or quarter inch or XLR.  And then there's your computers  that use something completely different.  So there's a divide between people who love music  or musicians and computer users.  Like I'm a musician,  so the idea that my next iPhone  won't have a mini jack  is ridiculous.  I'm not going to buy another iPhone.  Which sucks because I really like iOS 10.  I use Apple products, but I'm like you know what?  I guess I'm going over to Android because  I need to plug it into things.  I need to be able to charge, I need to be able to do stuff,  I need to be able to record things with it,  I need to be able to play music while we're practicing.  Like oh you know we got to figure out what this part is.  And I can't plug in a lightning jack  or have to walk around with an adapter  all the time to plug into our mixing board.  Phil Schiller was

Start time: 693.74
End time: 703.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Transcript:  are already using wireless headphones?

Start time: 716.27
End time: 725.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well I broke my  iPhone jack on my phone so I can't actually  use wired headphones.  So you've had the new phone for like six months.  Yeah and it's kind of annoying.

Start time: 725.84
End time: 774.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I went out and I bought the old Beats,  the Beats 2 because they were selling  at T-Mobile.  When I was returning my Note 7 I bought those.  Just to see, it's not a bad experience.  I'm not crazy about the Beats sound  particularly.  I don't have a sound design for hip hop.  They didn't drop.  You can move around.  Apple says it's going to be even better  with their new W1 chip.  Although it's still Bluetooth.  We've been able to verify, Jon Gruber and others  have verified that it will still be able to pair.  Any Bluetooth device  will be able to pair.  By the way Phil Schiller  is not the first person to use the word  a courage at Apple.  This is what I think Phil was  thinking about and referring to.  This is Steve Jobs at  the All Things D some years ago.

Transcript:  Apple is a company  that has  doesn't have the most resources of everybody  in the world.  And the way we've

Start time: 784.64
End time: 789.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  By the way, this is before Apple was the  largest, most successful company in history.  What year is this? 2011?

Start time: 790.76
End time: 931.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is by choosing what horses  to ride really carefully, technically.  We try to look for these technical vectors  that have a future.  And that are headed up.  And you know technology  different pieces of technology  kind of go in cycles.  They have their springs  and summers and autumns and then they  you know go to the graveyard  of technology.  And so we try to pick things  that are in their springs.  And if you choose wisely  you can save yourself an  enormous amount of work versus trying to  do everything.  And you can really put energy into  making those new emerging technologies  be great on your platform.  Rather than just  okay because you're spreading yourself  too thin. So we have a history  of doing that. As an example  we went from the 5 inch  floppy disk to the 3.5 inch  floppy disk with the Mac.  Before other people, right?  We were the first to do that. We made the 3.5  floppy disk popular.  Sony invented it and we put it in  the first products.  And there were some good reasons we did that.  We got rid of the floppy disk  all together in  1998 with the first iMac.  We also got rid of these things  called serial and parallel ports.  We were the first to adopt USB.  Even though Intel had invented it.  You first saw it  in mass on iMacs.  And so we have  gotten rid of things. We were one of the  first to get rid of optical drives with the  MacBook Air.  And I think things are moving in that direction as well.  And sometimes when we get rid  of things like the floppy disk drive  on the original iMac, people call us crazy.  Or at least premature maybe.  No, they call us crazy.  Oh, okay.  And  but  sometimes you just  have to pick the things  that look like they're going to be  the right horses to ride going forward.  What if people say  you know, the iPad  is crippled in this respect.  Well, you know, I'd say two things.  Number one,  things are packages of emphasis.  I should have cued this up to the courage.  Some things are emphasis. But we're going to take the heat  because we want to make the best product  in the world for customers.

Start time: 932.98
End time: 951.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Let me cue this up to the  It's a great clip.  Well, you see,  by the way, when you watch this, you see why Steve Jobs was so good  at what he does.  And Phil Schiller is, you know,  if Phil had explained it this way,  maybe we would be a little less  It was a use of the word courage.

Start time: 951.40
End time: 967.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, here's how Steve used it.  We're making the wrong choices. We listen to the market.  We're just people running this company.  We're trying to make great products for people.  And so we have  at least the courage of our convictions to say  we don't think this is part of what makes a great product.  We're going to leave it out.

Start time: 967.86
End time: 973.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's the courage of our convictions as opposed to  Phil Schiller's courage,  which isn't the same thing at all.

Start time: 973.86
End time: 983.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a different, you know,  it's a different concept. It's not the red badge of courage.  We have the courage of our convictions to move forward  and to remove these nearly antiquated tech products.  But let me ask you,

Start time: 983.86
End time: 986.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_11

Start time: 988.10
End time: 1008.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We're going to find out.  We're going to find out if other  manufacturers removed the headphone jack,  Apple will have been proved right.  And if nobody buys the iPhone 7  because it doesn't have a headphone jack,  they could be proved wrong.  Somebody tweeted at me,

Start time: 1008.58
End time: 1018.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  if Apple had sold the Fire Phone,  they would have sold 10 million of them.  I don't think  at this point, people will buy it  just because it's an iPhone. Go ahead, Philip.

Start time: 1026.98
End time: 1028.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The airpods are what Apple wants the future to hold.

Start time: 1029.35
End time: 1048.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, what's weird about  removing the headphone jack  on this phone is  they didn't have to do it. There was plenty of room.  The whole thing with the headphone jack  is you can't put a screen over it.  So there is that space  at the bottom of an iPhone right now  that isn't being used by the screen.  But I have to point at

Start time: 1048.78
End time: 1068.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  the maligned now Note 7  which is a smaller phone  than the iPhone 7 Plus  with a bigger screen  and a pen and a headphone jack  and they somehow managed to make it all work  and it's waterproof.  So it is, I'm not sure I completely  buy Apple's explanation that they had to do it  for anything else.

Start time: 1069.24
End time: 1181.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I don't buy it at all. Anyway,  I think the deal is that they were going to do it next year  with that  10th anniversary phone  and they didn't want  that phone to come out and all  that anybody did was talk about it  but they didn't have a headphone jack.  So they're getting that out of the way this year.  It's like classic Apple.  Remember how it took them several years  to get Apple pay  all the pieces of Apple pay  in place.  Stage by stage.  Anyway, so I did go to the demo room  and try out the AirPods  which I really want to call earbuds  but there you go.  What you have to know is that  I'm not going to be here tonight for demos.  They always go wrong.  Here's the scene.  There's a woman with a platter  of virgin AirPods  maybe 16 of them  on a platter.  When you came up for the demo, they'd take a fresh one out  and hand it to you  and then invite you to open up the little box  which looks like a dental floss box  with a magnetic opening  and then you kind of reach in  and pull out these AirPods  and then you put them in magnetically.  I actually had trouble getting my nail  underneath to pull them out.  Then you put them in your ear  and for me, it didn't work.  I couldn't hear a thing.  So they had to put that one back, get out a fresh  ear pod and put that in  and it didn't work either  and then they got a third one and it didn't work  and then I said maybe you got to  restart that iPhone  and he was afraid to do that  because God knows what was going on  inside the demo unit.  So I had to wait for them to get a whole new iPhone  and then a fourth ear pod  and finally it worked.  I'm not an audio expert.  They sounded great.  Do they sound better than the current wired AirPods?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would expect them to have better sound for that price.  But they are shaped exactly the same  and the actual audio components are essentially the same.  So it should sound the same.  So all the money goes into  and this is 40% lower bass

Start time: 1236.08
End time: 1277.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's smart enough to know  when you put them in  it knows you put them in your ear  and it automatically switches the sound  from whatever you are using to the AirPods.  And then if you want to talk to someone  you take one out  and it lowers the volume on the other one  and you can talk and then you put it back in  and it knows you have done it.  That's all pretty cool.  The downside, and I think this is actually a serious problem  is that there is no volume control.  And the way you control the volume  it's all done through Siri.  So you have to get Siri's attention  and say  make it louder.  Oh, you can't turn it up?  Not even with the phone?  With the phone you can.

Transcript:  I did read an article  and I wish I could remember who  because I can't give them credit  but I would like to  I kind of agree with  I've been saying for a while that  hearables are going to be the breakthrough  with wearables.  It's not going to be a watch, it's not going to be glasses.  But if you're already wearing ear buds  it's coming from both directions.  In terms of hearing aids, I have hearing aids  from Starkey that pair with my phone  that I can use to listen to music and books.  And if you have  Bragi's making these  if you have something in your ear  it could also not just measure steps  it could measure your heart rate  it could measure blood oxygen  it could probably even measure blood pressure  because there's such a thin membrane between your blood and in the ear  that these could be the future of wearables.  And that's the argument  for these ear pods  that there's a lot of technology in them  they're not just headphones  the ear pods have accelerometers  they have beam forming microphones  they have noise cancelling.

So to me Apple is saying hello world  we're all going to go here eventually  we're taking the first step back to your courage point  and we'll all get there eventually, hopefully us first  but I am willing to look ahead and say  that sounds super cool in 2000  what year is it? 16? 19.

It's about building this kind of wireless future  and they even talked about it  I think Johnny Ivan in his video said  for years we've been working on this future  with no wires for any of our products  and I mean if you look at the new MacBook  there's one USB-C port on it  but really they want you to be using wireless stuff  to transfer your files  they don't want you to be using  wired hard drives or any of this sort of thing  the iPad has one port for charging  and it's a wireless cable.  It has one port for charging because  how else are you going to charge it?  As soon as they can get you wireless charging  well they could now but  as soon as they start implementing wireless charging  They have all that extra room because they took the headphone jack out

Transcript:  don't we all have the same exact mixed feelings?  On the one hand we want to believe, we want it to be  the Apple that brought us the iPod  that brought us the iPad, that brought us the iPhone  which is probably the single biggest  technological revolution in my lifetime.  And at the same time  we look at this stuff and we wonder are we being  taken for a ride?  At what point is this innovation  at what point is it just fins on a Cadillac?  Is it just  innovation to get you to buy the next one?

Transcript:  I think part of what's at play here is  with PCs we are used to our software  not changing dramatically every year or every two years.  You obviously don't use Windows do you?  Yeah.  We held on to laptops and desktops for a long time.  Apple helped create this cycle  where every year there's something new.  And every two years you're buying a new device.  So now they're getting dinged  for not being able to keep up with this pace.  But they kind of originated this pace  and Samsung lives up to it now as well.  The whole mobile  market is judged  by how many phones  you can sell every year or two.  So to a certain extent  I think there is some of this.  We are actually building a great future.  There's going to be some cool stuff.  All this wireless stuff is going to make sense  five, ten years down the road.  But in the short term  they also have to have something new to stay on stage  every single year.

Start time: 1659.12
End time: 1676.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think there's a little bit of both at play here.  You're being a bit nice because that's why we had the S releases.  6S, 5S, 4S.  We give them a year off.  But again they created this two year cycle.  Oh no it's their fault but we shouldn't let them off the hook.  When they say iPhone 7  I expect that to be a full feature numbered release  as opposed to 8.5 which the S's usually are.

Transcript:  This is a fairly well evolved product.  You don't want to just change it for changes sake.  You want to improve it.  Philip, what's your feeling?  You've been watching this since 1984 for Crayon Pop.  This isn't the same Apple is it?  I mean after all.  Well it was pretty messed up in 1984.  They had to fire the co-founder.  I mean it was a pretty bad year.

I think you've said it.  The smartphone is on an S curve.  It's an immensely successful product.  It's an immensely successful product.  It's an immensely successful product.  Apple is making sustaining improvements every year.  Apple is making sustaining improvements every year.  This was a little disappointing  in terms of a sustaining improvement  because it was the same form factor  in terms of a sustaining improvement  because it was the same form factor  and all that kind of stuff.  Is there something I come out of this thing  saying, jeez, I've got to have that.  I really, really want to have that.  I've got to say I want to have those AirPods.  I don't care so much about the new phone.

Transcript:  I want to have my 2018 AirPods.  I feel like these are going to be a little bit of a struggle.  They're going to be a little challenging.  But I think they're moving in the right direction.  So that explains the loss of the headphone port.  We're going to go wireless.  It's going to be better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I have to point out that one of the things we've said is  the market will decide whether it will move.  And the market seems to quite like this new phone.  We were talking before the show.  It was darn hard to get one.  I don't know. I stayed up to midnight.  Philip, you would have had to stay up to 3 a.m. to get one.  I was trying to get a jet black.  They were gone instantly.  I wonder if they even had any.  I think they made those in a much smaller number.  Those are pushed off to October 4th.  And they're now November.  In fact, I think all of them are now November.  And Apple said we're not going to give you sales numbers  from the weekend because it's supply constraint,  not demand constraint.  We can't make any decision about demand  because we don't know what the supply is.  But, presuming that Apple did what it usually does,  which made millions of them ahead of time,  the market did weigh in.  They loved it.  Do you think they made less?

Start time: 1818.26
End time: 1830.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  iPhone sales have been slowly going down.  You know what? Let's be smart about this.  Let's not make too many iPhones.  Apple's been really smart about its inventory.  Anything that's sitting in a warehouse is losing money.  I'll tell you why I don't think so.

Start time: 1831.29
End time: 1863.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Because when they say before they go on sale,  we're not going to give you numbers  because it's supply constrained,  they're saying the demand will be higher  than whatever number we've made.  That's always been true.  No company wants it to be that way.  You'd like to sell an iPhone to every single person  who wants one on day one.  And make one more than that.  Plus one.  Maybe it's hard to make,  although I can't think it's that hard to make  because it's essentially the same exact phone as last year.  Maybe the jet black is hard to make.

There's a pecking order to the journalists  who come to these things.  I'm not one of the ones who got invited early  to see the things before the keynote.  Some people did, though.  Who was that?  Ben the Heron.  I assume Walt Disney.  I'm not sure.  I assume Walt Mossberg.  There was a scene.  Mark Gurman made his first appearance  at one of these things.  There was this power group of Mossberg,  Niley Patel.

I thought she was going to be a great  on-screen presence.  She was a female Steve Jobs.  We haven't seen her hide her hair.  I wrote several things in.  When are we going to see her on stage?  There she was in front of me.  I said, Angela, when are we going to see you on stage?  She touched my shoulder and said,  me, never.  That's her choice, it sounds like.  There's a little piece of news.  Do you think it's her choice?  I don't know what they had in mind for her.  I can see her being in a room with Schiller  and these old war horses.  These old war horses who have been playing  Apple politics from day one  and thinking, oh, geez.  I'll be honest.

First, he tells us about  the Mac Pro and says, innovate  my ass.  They just forgot about it for the last three years.  Lately, Courage  completely bungles  that. I think Schiller is the guy  not to put on stage. I bet you Angela  Arens. She's spoken to the  retail people. Apparently,  she does quite a good job. I think they  should bring her on stage. She has weekly

Transcript:  lots of diversity on stage.  Enough women so that you  didn't have to say, oh, they have a woman  anymore. I'm very much praised  for that. I have to point out  that their camera,  we were talking about this during the event,  there was an article a few months ago  about how it might be  the way Kodak film was made.  Film was made that  contributed to the racism in this country  because black skins  came out very much darker,  almost completely featurelessly  dark compared to white skins. The film  was made for Caucasians  and disadvantaged anybody else.  Apple showed  every time they showed samples  from the camera, they made sure they  had a person of color in those images and they  looked great. I think this is  Apple tacitly saying  we embrace diversity and we want to make sure  our products work for everyone. I have to praise  them for that.

Transcript:  I'll tell you exactly.  The problem, first of all,  analysts are talking to a different audience.  They're talking to an investor audience.  That's not what we're talking about.  We're talking about the value of the products,  the utility of the product,  whether a company is a good company.  That isn't necessarily the important news for an investor.  I'm not actually an analyst.

Start time: 2533.96
End time: 2557.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't really write for investors.  I'm not talking about you.  In general, I think you're totally correct.  That's why there's a disconnect between the Wall Street chatter  we hear, what we talk about here in tech  and what the public itself hears.  There's three different conversations  which is why we get confused when new things come out  and the stock market doesn't change its value  of the stock at all.  We go, why not?  Different conversation, different topics.

Start time: 2557.74
End time: 2585.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I say that as a cautionary tale to our audience.  The news is going to cover if an Apple stock goes down  after an announcement.  They're going to say, oh look, the market tanked.  But it isn't necessarily in reaction to the announcement.  You buy in the room and you sell in the news.  They're working on a different level  and a different plane than a normal user is.  I think that the utility of stock market information  of earnings and all of that  isn't really completely useful to what we do.  We do depend on it for unit volumes,

Non-GAAP is like Diet Coke or Decaf Coffee.  You don't trust it.  I totally understand that.  That's why I think it's good to have all three conversations.  What works for our parents, what works for us,

Start time: 2612.62
End time: 2672.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  what works for us.  I do the cautionary thing every time we do stock market stuff  What I care about, and I think our audience cares about,  is should I buy this phone?  Is Apple doing the right thing?  Is this a sensible plan?  Not what's their stock going to...  Although, and I mentioned this also,  the stock price does have some importance  to companies like Apple and Twitter, for instance,  because that's how they compensate employees.  It's an important tool for them  to be able to hire good engineers.  Speaking of which, Apple apparently  is backing down on the car.  They have laid off them.  I'm jumping way ahead.  We'll go back to the Watch in a second.  According to the New York Times,  Daisuke Wakabayashi, who does some great reporting  on Apple and Brian X. Chen,  say that Apple, according to their sources,  is rethinking the self-driving car.  Has laid off dozens of employees.  They've got three different people on this.  This doesn't surprise me at all.  I really didn't think this was a good direction  for Apple to be going in anyway.  It's super crowded.  And it's a good thing.

Start time: 2674.08
End time: 2702.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's super crowded.  I think everyone thought the automakers,  especially tech companies, thought the automakers  were just going to sit under laurels  and let the Googles and the Apples  and the Microsos make the self-driving car.  They're going to let them take the arrows.  As soon as they figure it out, GM is going to say thank you.  Mercedes is working on it. Audi is working on it.  GMs, everybody is working on it.  Ford is super hardcore into anything mobility,  including autonomous driving.  So the automakers are really stepping up.  They're really pushing super hard.

Start time: 2702.54
End time: 2720.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They sandbagged.  I think they pretended lack of interest.  I remember asking Ford every year,  so tell me about your autonomous car.  And What's-His-Name would always say,  oh no, people love to drive.  We're never doing an autonomous car.  And I said, come on, you've got Allen,  Allen Lally, you've got a guy in the back working on this.

Start time: 2720.60

Transcript:  I got into an argument with Ford a couple years ago  about putting in cell phone connectivity  into vehicles, which was four or five years ago.  And they said it's too expensive,  we don't have the margins for it, we can't do it,  no one wants it, and of course now.

Start time: 2752.94

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they've been working on it forever.  I think they're working on this.  I think you're also seeing the interest  and the focus for pretty much all the tech companies  that are involved moving towards alliances  and building software.  That's what we thought maybe Apple would want to do.

Transcript:  But Tesla's Elon Musk has always said  the key for us is to do it all.  You need the information you get from the cars  to improve the software.  You can't outsource.  In fact, they've even brought the cameras  and everything in-house.  Because Elon said no, no, we have to do it all  to get that information.  Data is very important.

Transcript:  Today's announcement about the Autopilot 8.0  that's coming out in the next two weeks,  they did all of it in-house.  They didn't use Mobileye.  Because they sort of broke up with Mobileye.  That's the camera company.  So now their next update to the Autopilot  or to the in-car infotainment system  is all in-house.  It's all Tesla.  They're doing everything they can to make it  all Tesla.  They're doing everything.

On 7.1, if you tap the Autopilot twice,  normally it turns on Autopilot four times,  and then you get a rock riff coming out of your radio  and a rainbow road stretching out ahead of you.  I'm sure it's a reference to something I don't know.  Rainbow from Super Mario Bros.  Or Super Mario Kart.  So you're driving Mario Kart.  Get in the car with me after the show.  Whoa, whoa, whoa!

I drove around with a $20,000 dress  in the back of my $500 Honda Civic.  But it looked great on you.  $20,000 dress.  It was black and slim.  It was great. It was really slimming.  I didn't have the shoes for it though.  I was still wearing the Converse.  The people who bought the $10,000 watch,  I would say the majority of them  were the people who didn't care.

Transcript:  I do wonder though,  and this is actually something I wish  we could have talked about when Philip was still on.  But in hiring Burberry's CEO  to come and run retail  that's a big luxury move.  Huge luxury ambitions.  That's saying Apple is a fashion brand.  Exactly. And redesigning stores like they did  with the Union Square one in San Francisco.  It's gorgeous.  Huge, right?  And with releasing a $10,000 gold Apple watch  that's high-end fashion stuff.  They brought those to Paris Runways.  Now I feel like  it seems like they're trying to scale things back a little bit.  Isn't that interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's not a lot of super thin watches out there.  This is a beautiful watch.  That's an Android wearable watch.  That's probably just as thick.  But it's way too thick.  Most of the luxury watches out there are thick.  That's why I don't wear any of them.  They're not thick, they're big.  Tell me the difference.  It's like you're wearing a sundial on your wrist.

End time: 3281.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Bigger in watches is always considered  I guess because it's a status symbol.  It shouts.  I'm wearing an expensive watch.  Apple's kind of acknowledged that the watch  is not all they had hoped it would be.  In fact, their sales are poor.  IDC said down 56%  Still the best selling smartwatch.

I think that what they say when they mean smartwatches  versus Android wear  if you talk about Fitbit  and Fitbit has some fitness watches  they were up by almost the same margin  that Apple was down.  They're easily number one.  So I think you're right.  Fitness is clearly the market space.  Not fashion.  They have to acknowledge, look, we understand.  It looks like you're wearing a smartwatch.  But think of all the things it's going to do.  But I asked a runner, we had Adam Engst  of Tidbits on during the event  and this guy's a runner.  I said, would you wear an Apple watch?  He said, no, I'm going to wear my Garmin.  The runner's watch.  All runners, they wear runner's watches  and the Apple watch is just not specific enough to that category.

It's like, hey, here's an extension of what you're already doing.  The Nike Plus app has been around for years.  It's very popular.  I think it's more for someone who is serious about running  but maybe not like an Iron Man triathlon person.  It's kind of like middle ground.  It's inspirational.  It's inspirational.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because I feel like the Apple Watch...  It's the perfect Pokemon Go tool.  It is kind of the perfect Pokemon.  It is. And the Apple Watch is by far  the best smartwatch you can buy.  That being said, it has no killer app.  It has no thing that you're just like,  man, I need that. I wish I had that.  I think you actually nailed that.

Start time: 3663.64
End time: 3684.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  For some people, Pokemon Go might be that thing.  That's exactly Apple's strategy.  We need the killer app, but we need it  to be able to run verticals.  So they're trying to find the killer app  in a dozen verticals.  And I think that that maybe is enough  if you're a Pokemon Go fanatic.  That might be enough to push you in.  If you're a runner or swimmer, maybe that

Start time: 3684.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  will push you in.  I mean that's what the phone is.  It's good for this, but it's also good for this.  I can play games on my phone.  The phone feels like more of a general-purpose thing  than the watch.  And I think they're trying to make the watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Turn-by-turn navigation used to be a paid feature  on hardware.  That was insane.  Mobile browsing, mobile internet, better phone quality.  The original iPhone, even sans third-party apps  was incredible.  And we forget that, but these are now launched  and there's no real purpose, no real impact,  except to add things to them, a glom on features  and feature sets, and that's less impressive to me.  To Leo's point about them not selling very well.

Start time: 3735.20
End time: 3747.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_11

Transcript:  I know you guys might totally slam me for this,  but they didn't change the look of the iPhone.  They changed the look of the iPhone.  They didn't change the look of the Apple watch  with a series two.  The bands still work?  The bands still work, all that stuff.  And with the iPhone 7, it's the same length, width  and thickness as the iPhone 6 and 6S.  And we basically slam all of these companies,  we being like Tech Press in general,  not just the people seated here,  for making thinner phones  and not increasing battery life  and not doing these things.  I think it's kind of nice to see a company  just keep a little bit of sameness  but add some things in the process.

Start time: 3816.70
End time: 3833.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think that's what you're going to see from now on.  We need to keep saying,  oh next year the 10th anniversary iPhone  Apple's got to start to slow that speculation down.  What could they do  that would make this 10th anniversary phone  be wow, what an improvement.  There's nothing more.  They could put a keyboard on it.

Start time: 3834.44

Transcript:  I think the idea of tech companies  to be able to have a phone  of tech companies  and hey, Wall Street would love this  but tech companies forcing us into buying  a new phone every year.  That's not a good idea for us.  And Apple to be praised not doing that.

Start time: 3881.52
End time: 3885.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Although Apple does have that deal  where you can pay monthly and get a new phone every year.

Start time: 3885.40
End time: 3897.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They do have that, but then they refurbish your phone  and they sell those again.  So I think keeping those things going  is better for the environment  and it's better for tech companies, it's better for us.  So I think in the long run this could all be really good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, it squirts the se...  I made an inappropriate joke on Twitter about it.  I'm shocked.  Everybody made an inappropriate joke on Twitter about it.  So the speaker squirts out the water.  You get out of the pool and it's all...

Start time: 3915.96
End time: 3919.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_11

Start time: 3928.34
End time: 3956.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's like you shake your ear.  You know you shake your ear after you go surfing or something?  So they said, as I remember,  they said, look here's the one problem  with waterproofing a watch is the speaker.  You can't have a working speaker  that doesn't let water in.  So we've solved this problem  by creating a speaker  that ejects the water  when you get out of the water.  So it knows when you get out of the water  and then the speaker must do a little...  It must make a sound.

Start time: 3957.23
End time: 3966.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sound effects are not important here.  I think that sound effects are...  Also, if you go back in history  to the original Zooms,  they had a feature that sent songs back and forth.

I think I completely crystallized  my point of view earlier in the show when I said  you want them to be the company  that they were for so many years.  You're a writer, changing the world.  And then it's hard as a journalist  to look at what they've done and decide  is that going to change the world  or is that just a profit-making machine  designed to squeeze money out of us?

Transcript:  Well, you know, there's always some...  Like most companies in the existence of the world  have maybe changed the world zero times.  That's true.  Or if you're lucky once.  No, they have an amazing track record.  I would argue that Apple kind of did that with the Mac.  Definitely did that with the iPod.  And it's done with the iPhone.  Maybe-ish the iPad, right?  So even if you take that away,  let's say, Jaded, Alex, how many times would you say  the iPhone and what else?

And you know what, next year,  and they're not talking about it,  by the way, I guess they're going to have another event  that's going to be anything but iPhones.

They can't do this every year.  And that's going to be huge.  Users are going to go, wow,  my data, I don't lose data anymore.  It's going to be big.

End time: 4209.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think to your point, the last thing I'll say is,  we shouldn't have to have a brand new,  complete new phone every year,  but if the price is going to persist at the exact same price point  or go up, like I guess it did this time,  then I do higher expectations.  I thought the SP went up by 20 or 40, am I wrong?  No, it's the same price.

So when you've got that Blue Apron box on your doorstep  and it's there, and you're going to make this amazing meal  in 40 minutes, you're going to be eating,  and everybody's going to say, this is incredible,  I've never had anything so good.  You're going to use ingredients that you've never used before,  like udon.  You're going to say, oh, no more ramen for me,  I got udon, baby.  And the next time, you'll know how to cook it.  So it's really, it's like a cooking class in the box.  I love Blue Apron.  And by the way, this will cost you less than shopping for yourself  because they don't have the brick and mortars.  They don't have the clicks.  It's 60% more expensive to buy at a grocery store  than to go to Blue Apron.  So it's a less lesser meal at a restaurant.  You've got to stop going in and out, guys.  You've got to get Blue Apron.  So let me recommend it and tell you how you can get three meals free  if you go to BlueApron.com slash twit.  Take a look at the menu.  You get to pick what you're going to have.  Korean, I love Korean pork tacos.  Love them.  See, when I look at the menus and I see what they've got,  I'm thinking, I've got to have that.  It's so good.  And it's fun to make it yourself in the household.  It's a lot of fun.  And it's fun to make it yourself and the house smells great.  Go to BlueApron.com slash twit.

It's by the way ironic  because Samsung was outsourcing the battery  with a Chinese company. Those were fine.  It's the one Samsung made themselves  apparently that have the problem.  But it's only a total  of 2.5 million divided by 42,000.  Anybody?  It's like a few hundred, right?  You've already had 35 incidents.  2.5 million divided by 41,000.  2.5 million divided by 41,000.

It's literally  It's literally  1 in 250,000  But I'd have one of those phones.  Knowing you're lucky, you wouldn't.  The other thing is I'm going on vacation next week  I'm getting in a cruise ship where I will have to charge that phone.  And if the cruise ship burnt to the ground  To the sea.  You'd feel bad.

I got it from T-Mobile.  Brought it to T-Mobile.  The guy looked at the back and said,  This one was made in China.  So the chances are it is not  one of the problem phones.  I said, are you recommending I not turn it in?  He said, no, you should turn it in.  And they just credited my credit card  to the full 850 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, you have a choice.  It depends on your carrier.  Turn it in and then when they get  new Note 7s, by the way,  the new Note 7s apparently have a sticker  with an S for safe on them.  So is it a sticker or are they going to actually

Start time: 4562.56
End time: 4575.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  engrave it?  Because it would be cool if it was engraved in the back.  This is such a safe.  Maybe they do because  you get on an airplane and you're like  why did you miss your phone?  I have the safe. It's safe.

Not a good one.  Or you can get your money back.  Samsung is offering a $25 credit  to anybody who does this.  So you get some compensation. I bought a cheap case  so that would be nice.  I have to give them credit.  They did the right thing.  They stepped up, right?  Eventually they even contacted the CPSC  and made an official recall.

Start time: 4611.48
End time: 4627.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did a very good job on the recall  and a very bad job leading up to that  by making the mistake.  So my real curiosity is will this cost their brand long term?  I think so.  Because the short term financial impact  we can just measure.  But I'm curious about the long term loss of brand equity

Start time: 4627.28

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you just know how batteries work in general...  It's dangerous.  If they're punctured, they can catch on fire.  Exactly.  All these things can catch on fire if you do it the right way.  So,  I think  the issue really comes down to  how quickly is Samsung going to bring out  these new phones that work  and repair it? Because it's taken a while.  I mean, it's...  They had their volunteer recall.  Then they talked to all the carriers.  Then the FAA came out and did their thing.  The Australian Airlines authority  banned the phones.  Now they're working with the CPSC on an official recall.  So, they kind of got out  a little bit ahead of it.  But at the same time, it's starting to drag out.  Now what we're hearing is  not just that it's been recalled,  but now that there's another authority,  another body that you should  be listening to that is also saying,  yeah, by the way, take that phone back if you haven't already.  Yeah, by the way,  don't want to take that on an airplane.  Don't charge it. Don't use it.  It's just kind of being compounded.

Start time: 4780.30
End time: 4801.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I mean, 68 phones in the whole world  had this problem.  I felt really confident that my Note 7 was fine.  It never got high.  I was sure I was fine.  But the minute the airline said,  they're literally telling people at the gate,  if you have a Note 7, you may not put it  in your checked luggage. You must carry it on.  You must not turn it on. You must not charge it.

Start time: 4802.48
End time: 4813.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if they would have known that  68 of them leaving the factory  weren't in good shape, when they all left  to be legit. They have quality checks  in place when they're building these devices.  That's probably such a small number, right?

Start time: 4814.32
End time: 4820.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They're going to have, they say,  an IMEI database where people will be able  to look up their phone. Exactly. But, if you're

Start time: 4820.44
End time: 4829.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the FAA, the question is,  oh, it's only 68, it's probably not going to happen.  It's like, if one of those things  goes off on an airplane. I don't want it to be me. I know.  Exactly. I know.

Start time: 4830.28
End time: 4834.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or take out an airplane, kill 300 people, and all of a sudden  Samsung's phone kills 300 people.

Start time: 4834.36
End time: 4848.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. So all it takes is one in the right place  to go off, and then it's a big problem.  I'm disappointed because I actually love the phone.  It's a really nice phone.  It's one of the best phones Samsung's ever made.  And I'm probably not going to get another one.  So I went ahead and pulled the math

Start time: 4848.28
End time: 4874.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and did the currency conversions to figure this out,  but 1.5, that's why I went for two minutes.  That's his job.  He's like, hold on everybody, I got math.  I haven't actually verified this yet, so don't get mad.  That's about 2% of their ready cash right now  is $1.5 billion. So the loss here from a gross cash  portfolio, yes they can,  but it's still enough money, it's going to screw up a lot of divisions,  operating profits, and it's going to look very bad.  So the short-term financial impact,  doable long-term brand, I leave to Robbie.  Well, it could sell or hold.

Starting Monday, September 12th,  TechCrunch Disrupt  kicks off in San Francisco, and I'll actually  be there with a crew, with Kara, of course,  and a few others chatting with some of the  startups and innovators who  are showing off their hard work at the  event. Also on the 12th, Google will  officially discontinue its Google  Plus Hangouts on Air service,  but have no fear. Creators can transition  over to YouTube Live  relatively easy and keep their  live streams going over there.  On Tuesday, September 13th,  Apple will unleash its updated  iOS 10 to salivating  fans the world over. On Thursday,  September 15th, Sony is launching  its newly announced PS4  Slim for $299,  which is nearly identical to its full-size  Brethren, along with an updated  DualShock 4 controller and  redesigned light bar. And on Friday,  September 16th, let the reign  of new Apple devices commence as  the big kahuna, the Apple  iPhone 7 series, begins  shipping to those who've pre-ordered  their own new favorite toy.  As well, Apple will be selling its  new Apple Watch Series 2 and  launching the updated Watch OS 3  for owners of the original model.  So many toys, so little  time. You know that Megan  Moroney and I will talk about all this stuff and a  whole lot more all week on Tech  News today, so don't miss it. That's a look  at the week ahead. Back to you, Leo.

Transcript:  give credit to whoever came up with that term.  It's really good. Our show today  brought to you by Audible.com.  If you like me, you like  reading. I tell you,  I didn't read as much as I would like  to once I, you know, you get out of college  and you start working for a living.  You don't have as much time. You get home. You want to  read. You're sleepy. You go to sleep. The book falls  on your nose. It hurts. You never do that again.  Then, how long came Audible?  And I had a lot of time in the car every day.  I was commuting. And Audible  Books meant that the two hours I spent  in the car every day, I was two hours of  reading and it changed my life.  I've been an Audible subscriber since  the year 2000.  And I've got hundreds of books on my virtual  Audible shelf. I invite you  to give Audible a try. It really is  a fantastic place  to get audio entertainment.  Fiction and non-fiction.  College courses, they have the great courses  which are phenomenal.  That really makes you feel like you're learning something. I love  that. They've got comedy performances.  They've got speeches. There's a lot  of audio content waiting for you at Audible.com.  You can buy it  a la carte, but the best way, the way I do it,  and the way I've done it ever since the year 2000, is  by subscription. You can get  a subscription. I have the two books a month subscription.  It's kind of nice because I don't often  don't get to two books a month, but I have kind of a  backlog. And then when I go on a trip, I've got  stuff to read.  I'm pretty excited about that. Somebody suggested  that I read Bougaudin before  I go to Russia. So I'm reading The Master  and The Margarita, which is a classic  Russian novel. It's quite good.  And because I'm listening to it on Audible, I'm also  getting the benefit of a really good reader  who's bringing the book to life.  And with Russian names, that's helpful.  Because that's sometimes a little confusing.  You may not know whether  you're ready for audiobooks. I think a lot of people think  well, I don't know, could I listen  to a book and really understand it and hear it?  So this is what we're going to do. We're going to give you two books  free. I'll give you a chance to  see what you think. Whether  you're reading a tech book like the Steve Jobs biography,  there are actually several on Audible.com  that I've read and are really, really  good. I think Becoming Steve Jobs is the one I'd  recommend. Or funny books,  John Hodgman and Amy  Poehler. I love those.  And often when it's a comic, the comics  will read those.  It's just like getting a performance  in your car. Here's the deal.  Go to Audible.com slash twit2.  You're going to be signing up for the Platinum  plan, that's my plan, which is two books a month.  But  the first month is free. So you can  get those two books and cancel  any time in the first 30 days, but you can keep them.  You'll also get the Daily Digest of the Wall Street Journal  or the New York Times.  If you drive, if you work out at the gym,  mostly for me now, it's  at the gym, or taking walks, I like  to listen to audiobooks,  Audible is awesome.

You might think, oh, they're not going to read because they're listening,  but it gets them excited about books.  So whenever  my kids had a reading assignment, we'd always  get the audiobook. Whenever we went on a family  trip, we'd always get an audiobook, and it's a great  way to be together, to listen,  to talk about fiction, nonfiction,  it's fun. Audible.com slash twit2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  ours, Technica was writing about it, it's actually kind of  scary.  Not only are they malicious, they're critical  bugs, but there are already apps in the app  store discovered  that take advantage of them.  Now, whenever Google discovers these, of course,  they remove from the app store, but the fact that  they got into the app store and they think, they  estimate as many as  two and a half million people have downloaded  malicious apps. Wow.  And even if, at this point,  even if you have a Nexus, you're not protected  because the patch for this comes out in the September  update, which is, I should check, but I've  been checking all day, it's not out yet.  So I have a 6P, if you have a 5X or  6P, even with a Google phone,  you're vulnerable to this bug,  which was discovered by Google.  It allows attackers to execute  malware or escalate local privileges  on vulnerable phones. By the way,  every Android device in existence  is currently vulnerable,  except for the ones inside Google  that got the September patch already.  It can be exploited in a large  variety of ways, including sending you a  JPEG, so  a bad guy could text you a JPEG.  Hey, here's a picture. Oh, okay.  Here's  Roberto Baldwin, as you've never seen  him before.  And you're going to click on that.  Yeah, and you open it and boom.  You're bad.  You could also embed it in an MP4 file.  There's all sorts of ways to  do this.  The exif data in the image can  contain the vulnerability.  It is a really, really bad one.  Now, I have to point out, Apple  had a similarly bad vulnerability last  month. Look, any operating system  is going to have bugs.  There's a lot of money to be made,  as we know now, that Israeli  group that made millions of dollars  selling in iOS.  Exploit merchants are living the dream.  So that means they're working hard to find the next half-million  dollar bug, right?

Transcript:  At this point, you're just hoping that nobody's going after you.  But here's an example.  One of the exploits is called  Call Jam.  And it was embedded into an app called  Gems Chest for Clash Royale.  Clash Royale is a best-selling game.

Transcript:  You should know better, but a hundred thousand  to half-a-million people fell for it.  Now, of course, immediately, as soon as  Google finds out about this, they remove them.  Google also has a scanner on your Android device  that scans for known exploits.  So I'm hoping that people didn't  get bit by this.  Dress code, which is another exploit,  was used probably  to generate fraudulent clicks on  ads, but it could be used  in a more malicious way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is super bad.  This does happen on every operating system  like you mentioned, but on the mobile side  at least, it happens on Android a lot more  than it happens on iOS.  And Google's really good about addressing things  quickly, but because there are  so many Android devices out there  and because so few get the software updates  from Google, it's just a  major problem.  The safest thing you can do as an Android  user is using a Nexus device,  is using a Google device.  Samsung and Blackberry have been keeping up  with some of their updates a little quicker.  Both Samsung and LG have supposedly

Start time: 5710.28
End time: 5743.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  committed, and this is what I think  you're going to look for, committed to taking  the monthly security updates.  So you're probably okay with  Samsung and LG.  Surprisingly, Motorola has not yet committed.  There are a lot of really nice, inexpensive  phones like the Axon 7, the  OnePlus 3, the new Honor 8 from  Huawei. None of those companies have  agreed to take  the updates. It doesn't mean they won't, it's just  they're not committing to. So at this  point, I think you go with, well it was  called Nexus, I guess it's going to be called Pixel, but you  go with a Google phone because at least you know they'll get  it before anybody else does.

Start time: 5776.30
End time: 5797.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  the OnePlus 3 is, but  arguably, certainly Samsung  has better hardware than anything Google's been putting on.  The new phones are apparently  being designed by HTC,  to Google's specifications.  I really hope Google  offers this as a flagship phone,  even if it's a flagship price.  I hope they don't try to hit to a  $350 or $400 price point.

I think that's a mistake.  Apple doesn't do it either,  but Samsung and everybody else offers SD cards.  So I would love  to see Google say, alright, we're going to make a $700  phone that is top of the line.  That's the pure Android phone,  and that's the one we hope people would buy.  If they did that, I would be very happy, but unfortunately...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think at the watch it's okay.  I think it's alright.  I think it's risky.  But there's also the concern, if you're a user  and you buy a Nexus phone or you buy any  Android phone, you go to the Google Play Store  and you're like, well, these are all going to be safe  because I hear about people in China who are using  third party stores and they're getting malware installed.  Google really needs to step up its policing  in the Google Play Store.  It got downloaded  two and a half million times.  That's amazing.  Two and a half million times people got this  before Google was like, oh, damn.  Well, they have a different...

Start time: 5902.28
End time: 5950.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google has a different process than Apple does  in terms of getting apps into their app store  and they're a little less stringent.  Basically, you can submit an app.  There are some computer  generated scans that are done.  But in most cases,  people aren't actually looking at the apps themselves.  And, you know, there's a lot of stuff  that software can do  to check an app to see whether it's safe or not.  But of course, when these sorts of exploits exist  and they're not known,  that's when that problem happens.  So I've actually done some reporting  on this in the past and Google says they're trying to step  these sorts of things up.  But they simply just let in  a lot more apps than Apple does  and they do so without  less human... with fewer  people looking at it.  And it's a tough time to keep up with.  It's a tough time to stem, though.

That's the best advice.  I like Snapchat.  Don't get Snapchat Junior.  That'll help you do... No, just don't get any of these  weird third party apps from  companies you've never heard of because  most of the time they're just sort of... they're fishing for ads.  They're janky, they're bad.

My point is  it should be expensive, difficult, and fraud  because that's how it is for everyone else in the world of media.  Facebook wants to abdicate its responsibility  here and say, well, we're not a media company.  They think, they say, we're not  a media company. They are a media company. They are absolutely the largest  media company in the world, hands down, and they  need to step up their responsibility and act  properly. It's going to be an investment, it's going to be a struggle,  they're going to make mistakes, but they can't keep  throwing their arms up the air going, duh.  No, no, no. We're not a media company.  When you're worth over $300 billion, you can afford  to invest in things and make your product work.  That is not punishing.  So Facebook needs to just grow up.

VR will be  supported on everything.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And in fact, we talked about this yesterday on the new  screensavers. No VR  company making VR  gaming or software is  making it for the high end. They always want to make it for the  lowest, the minimal  processor that people will be using.

But most won't. And those games need to  update it, right? Yeah, yeah. And then they're like, but, you know,  it's also going to be able to  support 4K. But not all games will be in 4K,  but most games will actually be in 1080p.  But it's also  going to do HDR, but not all...  Just tell me, what the hell is it going to do?

Would you just whisper  Scorpio? No, that was Robby.  That was Robby. Oh, wow. It's just like, you know...  I can do it for you. Scorpio.  Scorpio. It's like, why, why,  why would I buy the Pro?

They're now on Target, by the way.  They're on Target?  Yeah. Harry's is amazing.  They're kind of the apple of razor blades.  By which I mean they make improvements  but they don't raise the price.  They've made some significant improvements  to the Harry's razors.  They're half the price of the drugstore blades.  They've now added the nose trimmer blade there.  The softer flex hinge.  The lubricating strip.  Which I know everybody wants.  And the texture handle is so nice.  Harry's, $2 a blade.  So the deal is, of course, as with all of these,  you've got to start with the handle.  So go get a Harry's kit.  They get some great deals.  The Truman kit, normally $15,  includes the handle, three blades,  a full size, not a sample size,  but a full size of either  Harry's Foaming Shave Gel or the cream,  which I like,  because it gives me a nice smooth shave.  And the travel cover.  And all of that, $15.  If you go to harrys.com slash twit,  you'll get $5 off your first purchase.  So get started with $10.  Harry's was founded by two friends  to offer guys a great shave at a fair price.  They own the factory in Germany  where they make the blades.  That's how come they can get the price down.  They're selling direct, factory direct, to you.  And this limited time offer  of $5 off your first purchase  at harrys.com slash twit.  So don't go to tariff.com.  Harry's dot com slash twit.  So don't go to Target to get your Harry's,  at least not your first Harry's.  Get it online, harrys.com slash twit.  We're all big fans.  I'm always clean shaven, thanks to Harry.
