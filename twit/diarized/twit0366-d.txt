Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So the engineering staff went to the Washington Post  Right, the patents went to LinkedIn  That was kind of the surprise, we didn't realize that LinkedIn bought the patents  and then for, now by the way those were more significant  I think LinkedIn's paid over a million bucks for the patents  LinkedIn paid three and a half million, something like that?  Yeah  But what got all the attention was half a million dollars or something like that  from Beta News  Yeah, how mad were you with all the crappy coverage

Start time: 255.40
End time: 260.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that's saying like, sold for a half for $500,000  You probably have that on your couch right now

Start time: 260.22
End time: 267.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What did they even buy? They bought the name  Yeah, they bought the name and the traffic  So Dig still had around 15 million monthly unique visitors  They wanted to

Start time: 267.64
End time: 269.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's trying to be worth more than you would think

Start time: 269.46
End time: 298.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the funny thing, we had offers for a little, right around a million and a half to sell the product off  but the investors were really cool  They wanted essentially the product to go to someone that would take care of it  and do right by the name  and so there was an option to sell it off to someone that essentially was going to turn into kind of a link farm  and they were like, no, we'd rather make sure it lands, has a good soft landing  So John at BetaWork stepped up and said, you know, we have Bitly, we have Chartbeat  We build cool products, you know, does this sound like a good match?  And we were all for it

Start time: 298.22
End time: 302.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, I love Bitly, I love Chartwork, Chartbeat, we use that

Start time: 303.14
End time: 309.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you think of anyone that understands like the real-time web and the nature of being able to detect trends as early as possible, it's those guys

Start time: 309.26
End time: 325.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Now they said they rewrote the code from scratch  Yeah, from scratch  It is a very different looking site, but it's much more modern, it kind of looks like Pinterest or The Verge  Yeah, I like the design  You know, this is the new look, this is how everybody looks nowadays  They're kind of a magazine form, but same idea, right?  In fact, I still have my account, you can see I'm still Leo Laporte on Dig

Start time: 327.16
End time: 356.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a lot of stuff they have to add back, like there's none of your history there  If you go down to the bottom, you can see like more trending articles, you can see the little graphs there  I love the graphs, that's nice  It's going to be pretty cool  So you're happy with what they did with it?  Yeah, absolutely, I mean these guys, they basically came in with nothing and said we're going to completely rebuild this in six weeks  They went for it and this is what they launched, which is a great kind of V1 of the product  It's actually pretty impressive  I'm glad they got rid of a lot of the stuff, they killed a lot of the features and just stripped it down to its essentials

Start time: 356.26
End time: 370.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I should have worn my Dig 4 was my idea shirt, I still have that shirt  What killed Dig, now that you're well away?  Now that you're going to grill it  Show it, it's going to be nice on the show, and here we are doing a new system

Start time: 370.22
End time: 374.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like I should take a bullet for Kevin  That's a reasonable question, just criticize him

Start time: 374.30
End time: 458.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is all fair game, I'm totally down to answer this kind of stuff, especially now that it was really hard for me to announce it  Now you can talk about it  Talk about any of this stuff when I was on the board, when I was still involved, when we were trying to sell the company, it was difficult  But I think that in hindsight when I look back on Dig, I feel that there was, even when we had Dig V3, before we even launched Dig V4  We started to see a slow decline in traffic  We knew that things were starting to go down  Twitter was breaking news stories faster than anyone else  If you remember on Facebook, a lot of the stuff that was being shared initially was kind of like relationship status and photos and things of that nature  Then all of a sudden news stories started being propagated throughout Facebook  These other social sites just came up around us and started eating a lot of our traffic  So I think that Dig V4 was a reaction to a lot of that  Like how can we get things back on track?  The thing that's difficult is when you have a company that's 50, 75 employees  And you're focused so much on month over month growth  It's really hard to not try new crazy big things to keep up with that burn that you have going on  You have a huge staff of people that are pulling decent salaries  I think our monthly burn at one point was $800,000 a month when you have that many people on board  Dig was built on a bunch of our own purchased servers  We were created before Amazon, S3 and all these other services

Start time: 458.48
End time: 462.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I remember you were so excited when you bought that rag  There was a lot of hardware costs that went into hosting Dig

Start time: 462.22
End time: 506.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We had 500 plus servers sitting on racks  All co-loaded  And with that goes a lot of high-end network administrators  There's a lot of costs involved there  So for us, I think that we should have kept it extremely small  Looking back, we should have kept it 10 people max  It would have been a very profitable, awesome little site at 10 people  And we would have been a little bit slower when it came to new features  But I think that would have been okay  If you take a look at what Reddit and some of these other sites have done  They've kept it extremely small from a burn standpoint  And they've been able to keep true to who they are  And I think that's the first time we got in a lot of trouble  Is when we decided to not build features for our core audience  But instead build them for what we thought was going to bring in  A different audience and more traffic

Start time: 506.40
End time: 524.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  This is why you're valuable at Google Ventures now  Because having had this experience, you can talk to startup founders  And say, hey, dude, slow down  I definitely tried to have them avoid a lot of the mistakes that I made  And you have some credibility because you've been there  And so you're not just saying this like some abstract academic thing  This is something you know about  Yeah, no doubt

Start time: 525.22
End time: 559.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What a journey though  I remember hearing about you explained to me what you were up to with Dig  I don't know if you even remember this  The first time we met was when David Prager brought me out to teach you how to blow fire  Right  Or I guess I don't know if it was a tech or a screen saver  Yeah, and then we got out there and the folks at G4 were all like  I don't see the tech angle  And they canceled it  So I did two segments for Unscrewed instead  Man, but it has been amazing to watch the transformation  The entire and a privilege to take part in my small bit with Revision 3  And kind of watching everything go through  It's been a crazy eight years

Start time: 559.22
End time: 564.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, can you believe it's been that long?  Like I think we've known each other for over five years now  Six years  Yeah, no, no, no

Start time: 565.26
End time: 569.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I want to say it was like 2005 maybe  Yeah, it was pretty early actually  Yeah

Start time: 570.70
End time: 584.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So then you started Milk  And I have to say everybody  I was very surprised when I heard that you had sold Milk  Daniel, you, Daniel, a bunch of people from Milk went to Google  Yeah  Because I thought, well, this is  I thought he wanted to be an entrepreneur

Start time: 584.46
End time: 599.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, we launched our first app Oink and it had some decent traction  I liked Oink a lot  We won a bunch of Apple Design Awards  Beautiful  We had about 275,000 users download it  But Google came in and gave us an offer that we couldn't say no to  I mean, we all made money  The investors all made money

Start time: 600.38
End time: 604.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But from you personally, was this something  Did you have to say, hmm, is this what I want to do?  Well, here's the deal

Start time: 606.36
End time: 618.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oink was at a point where we were getting ready to launch our second version of it  We were happy with the traction, but we weren't blown away by it  It wasn't like dig type crazy viral growth  And so, you know, am I going to sit there and beat on Oink for the next four or five years?

Start time: 618.34
End time: 621.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But you said that from the day one at Milk, we will fail fast and we'll move quickly

Start time: 622.50
End time: 647.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we would shut down and gone on to the next thing  And we had a couple ideas of things that we wanted to build  But really nothing that I was overly excited about  So what did Google say that turned your  Well, we sat down with Bradley Horowitz who  Buff Brad  Yeah, he's an amazing dude  He's over at Google Plus and he's like, you know, we really need some help from a design and product standpoint  Like, would you be interested in talking to us?

Start time: 648.24
End time: 651.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  He was right, by the way  Did you have anything to do with the Google Plus, iOS and Android apps?

Start time: 651.42
End time: 653.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I came at the very tail end of that

Start time: 653.22
End time: 657.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Because they looked a lot like Oink and I thought, boy, that looks like maybe Daniel or Kevin had something to do with that

Start time: 657.30
End time: 665.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was, we saw it for about, gosh, three weeks before it launched  It was too quick, there was no way you could have influenced it  No, it was already kind of baked at that point

Start time: 666.62
End time: 678.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But when we first talked, you said, I can't tell you what I'm doing at Google  I'll let you know  And the rumors were product guy, Google Plus guy  Did they say to you Google Ventures from day one or was that something that came later?

Start time: 678.42
End time: 686.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, basically they were pretty cool in that they said come in, kind of get your feet wet  Float around and see where you want to land

Start time: 686.26
End time: 689.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  They're actually known for doing this, aren't they? They hire people without a job

Start time: 689.60
End time: 709.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it was nice that they kind of let us pick where we wanted to end up  And so I think they would have liked us to stay on Google Plus  But Ventures was something I had already done, worked with the Ventures guys in the past  I had raised money with them through Milk  And so angel investing is something that's been a hobby of mine for several years now  And it just made sense

Start time: 709.58
End time: 720.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I've several times on this show gone through your list of advancements, which are very, very impressive  Thank you  Well, Zynga, OMG Pop, Twitter, Fab, some really good investments  Thanks

Start time: 721.40
End time: 750.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been lucky to be involved with some great companies, so it's been awesome  And it's been fun at Ventures?  Yeah, Ventures has been really cool  I mean, it's basically Google gives us $200 million a year to invest  And they essentially say go out there and invest it in all the crazy, cool new ideas and products that you enjoy  And for us, we're not really a strategic fund to Google in any way  So we can invest in competitive things  We're essentially a separate company altogether

Start time: 750.26
End time: 754.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You don't have to ask permission from Larry, hey, you know, this is competitive, do you mind if we invest in this?

Start time: 754.26
End time: 760.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, that's not going to anything, so it's great  And so there's seven of us doing investments, eight of us now

Start time: 760.90
End time: 780.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You get to be like a judicious Santa Claus sitting on your throne being like, like you, like you  But there's freedom in that though  I mean, I would imagine it's obviously empowering to you  But it's also, it solidifies the importance of you retaining that user perspective

Start time: 783.04
End time: 826.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that when I sit down with the entrepreneurs, the thing that I kind of help bring to the table  Or I try to bring to the table is product advice  So I sit down and we go through their idea  Oftentimes it's kind of wireframe stage  It's getting ready to launch something in a few weeks  And so hopefully I can help out there  I probably give an average of five to ten suggestions  And they maybe go away and implement one of them into their product  Which is kind of cool because it still feels like I'm staying involved as an entrepreneur  But really I'm just kind of giving advice  So a lot of coffee shop meetings, a lot of working out of San Francisco, meeting all the new startups  And it's fun to see stuff before it's launched  I mean, you know how it is  At Tech TV, I'm sure you still get it here  You get people that come in and have a product that they're about to launch  And you get to see it before anyone else  They've got that wild-eyed look where it's like they can, yeah  They're fired up and you get some of that energy from them  It's a lot of fun

Start time: 828.10
End time: 842.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and it's like one of the, you see the passion coming from the person who created it  But then also you have to put the reality filter on on the other side of it  Because no matter how excited they are, if it's something that's not right for the marketplace  If it's something that a user doesn't want, then obviously Google doesn't want to put their money towards it

Start time: 842.94
End time: 853.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly, and I think Google's, our whole investment strategy is if it's good for the internet  And for all things tech, then it's ultimately good for Google  Which I think is the right way to approach things

Start time: 854.49
End time: 858.22

Transcript:  I guess because there's an article about it in the doc  But is there anything at Google that you're more excited about than the self-driving cars?  I am so sick of driving, I'm sick of other people driving

Start time: 873.70
End time: 883.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So that's one of our stories, 300,000 miles without an accident  In fact, the only accident that happened with self-driving cars was when the human was driving  I can't wait, I see them all the time on campus

Transcript:  So I had a pilot on the radio show today, I didn't ask him what airline  But I said, he flies a 777, I said, you let the plane land itself?  He said all the time, you have to, FAA regulations say you have to every certain amount of time  You have to let the plane land it to test the autopilot

Start time: 910.22
End time: 925.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I landed in a plane that turned that thing on, they didn't warn us  And the plane took a two-bounce hit  So it doesn't do that good of a job? I didn't ask him that part  No, I think it does most of the time, but this took a two-bounce and the pilot had to come on and apologize  It was a rough landing  This is the perfect situation for pilots

Start time: 927.22
End time: 932.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They could take credit for all the nice landings and they could blame the computer for the ones that sucked  If this flight had gone smoothly, it's...

Transcript:  Did you see the crash landing that happened with the GoPro?  No  It was a plane that went down with a GoPro camera, the guy had a GoPro on his head  Holy cow  It is insane  Who's the guy? Who?  Some guy  The pilot?  GoPro plane crash?  We can watch it  Prager had it, he sent it around

Start time: 951.30
End time: 956.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I'll tell you what, man, it's what I think of with the Google cars, self-driving cars

Start time: 956.40
End time: 962.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You know what, if you search for GoPro and crash, there's quite a few  Yeah  Is it the one who was flying a Piper Cub?

Start time: 963.30
End time: 967.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it was like a small little plane, it crashed in the trees, it was insane

Start time: 967.52
End time: 1006.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So before we take a look at this, something that the author Andrew Main, the guy who wrote...  Ready Player One  No, no, no, Public Enemy Zero  Public Enemy Zero, I always confuse the two  I do too, right? But Andrew Main once told me, because I get bent out of shape about legal issues  But he said, don't worry, Brian, technology outpaces legislation  And I was like, what does he mean by that? And I realized that the Google cars, self-driving cars, is exactly that  Because what does it mean to drive drunk when the computer's doing the driving?  What does it mean to drive when you're old and blind and you can't get around?  It's like the technology will fundamentally alter and all of a sudden, so much legislation becomes completely irrelevant  All of a sudden, magic occurs  What are you guys looking at?

Start time: 1006.30

Start time: 1590.82

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That's good, I like that, that's a good start  Anyway, I thought an interesting story and obviously a success in many, many ways  Let's talk about Google's new search  which Danny Sullivan, I think, said, how did he put it?  The copyright police win  Google has announced that they will begin taking into account  the number of copyright removal notices they receive for a given site  If a site receives enough copyright removal notices, they will penalize it in the search results

Start time: 1794.26
End time: 1814.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good, good for them  Really?  I think that's great, yeah  What about times that Google should use it to leverage itself?  These guys, oh, you know, you're putting copyrighted stuff on the site  and, you know, the Belgian idiots that you can't even look at our sites  Although you put it in robot.txt, you could put a robot thing in it  Yeah, they'll ignore it

Start time: 1814.22
End time: 1818.90

Start time: 1819.82
End time: 1840.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, here it is, Google's out here, let me set the scenario  I go on Google, oh, let me see  Brian Brushwood, I want to find his book  Yeah  And then all of a sudden your book crops up  Yep  Or a site, a link into your site  A torrent link, yeah  Well, maybe it's a torrent, maybe it's not, maybe it's your website  Yeah  Okay, so I go to your website and then I order a book  Okay, now what's the problem?

Start time: 1841.38
End time: 1847.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the problem is that a takedown request is not an actual indictment  I guess it is, it's an accusation is all it is

Start time: 1847.28
End time: 1855.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Google says, and this, I don't know how this changes it, they say a valid takedown request  But I don't know what valid means, is that

Start time: 1855.22
End time: 1857.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, especially when you run the risk of there being mass hysteria

Start time: 1858.24
End time: 1880.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I'll tell you why this makes me nervous for two reasons  One is we get takedown requests for every show  In fact, we'll get a takedown request for showing that clip from NBC of Jesse Eisenberg  Now, Google sometimes takes the shows down  Sometimes they just give us a notice saying, hey, we're not going to penalize you  But we get them all the time  Now, the second thing that bothers me is Google is specifically exempting YouTube, their own site  Okay

Start time: 1881.70
End time: 1884.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ah, well that would be annoying  There is a follow-up

Start time: 1885.61
End time: 1988.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We can do it  There's a follow-up article where Google, what Google said was that they are treating YouTube just like any other site  There are other factors beyond the number of takedown requests  And I assume that has something to do with the number of takedown requests relative to the total traffic that they see on that particular site  So I'm less worried about that, but what I'm more worried about is this LendInk story  Did you guys see this?  So there's a website called LendInk  Lend  L-E-N-D-I-N-K  And somebody essentially stirred the pot  It's gone now  You won't be able to find it  It's reduced to ashes  It's been destroyed  Because basically...  It was intimidated out of business  Well, the idea behind it was it's created by a disabled veteran who wanted to create a site for people who had lendable copies of print books to find other people to lend them to  You wanted to connect them to  Correct, and link them together and like lend them...  Which is totally legal  Exactly, exactly  Someone got a bug up their butt and decided to start twittering all of the different authors saying, hey man, your stuff's on this pirate site, your stuff's on this pirate site  They built it into a witch hunt  They exploded all over the place  They started calling for actions  They submitted takedown requests  And the site was reduced to total ashes  He was only allowed to get his...  I don't know if it was the domain or some other aspect of it  Only able to get it back if he promised to individually  This is one guy, one disabled vet with a website that essentially ran itself  And they're saying the only way it can come back is if you personally review every single takedown request  He's like, I don't even know if it's worth it at that point  So here's the problem  This guy's website under this rule would be completely buried because he's had so many takedown requests  Even though they're completely unjustified and completely felonious

Start time: 1988.62
End time: 1996.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_12

Transcript:  BFF's headline is Google's opaque new policy lets right holders dictate search results  Now I agree with you, John, if Google is saying, hey, this is a pirate site  And by the way, most of the sites, they gave a list of the sites that would be affected immediately  And it's almost all torrent sites  And I guess that's not unreasonable  My concern is that the takedown process itself is kind of flawed  We get takedowns all the time  You know, the Mars Rover video

Start time: 2028.32
End time: 2031.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, half the stuff you're getting takedowns is for is fair use

Start time: 2033.42
End time: 2121.20

Transcript:  All of this stuff is sometimes though it's not even from a rights holder  So that's another... this is a YouTube flaw  I don't know if it's a... and by the way, they say this is not the same  We're not going to use the same mechanism that YouTube's using  This is a different mechanism  In fact, they're very clear if you go to Google  These are takedowns from search results  So if you go to Google and you say I want to have a takedown  They say now if this is for YouTube, go somewhere else  This is a different link  This is for search results only  So they're very clear about making that distinction  But the Mars Rover landing  Video NASA posted of JPL and people cheering was pulled down by the Scripps-Howard News Service  It was actually blocked for a day or two  Because Scripps-Howard has local television news broadcasts that featured these clips  Uncopyrighted clips from NASA in their local news  The content ID system said oh yeah, I recognize that from the local news  Issued a takedown  The takedown...  Automated  I presume it was automated  And now what that means though is that NASA had to notice it, had to appeal it  And of course Google immediately responded to put it back up  It's not completely brain dead  But that's problematic  And for our content, we get taken down frequently  We make the fair use argument  It's not the fair use argument  It usually gets put back  But for news content, that a day or two later could be worthless  So I just think the process is flawed  It's not the same process  That's the YouTube process  But that's why I worry about this

Transcript:  Well, I'm going to flip back now  I'm going to take John's side again and say  I don't even know what my side is  That as flawed as the mechanics are on this  They're working out the bugs on it  They're figuring out  I would a million times over, much, much rather  See Google tinker with the system to reduce the visibility of pirate sites  Than I would to see some heavy-handed legislation come in and just smash everything  So it's like I applaud the legislation  But this particular implementation  There will be growing pains  There'll be bumps along the road  But I would much rather see private industry take it on than involve the government

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, and EFF says that  They say, look, they're not seizing domain names as the government does  Right  But they say in particular  This is the Electronic Frontier Foundation  We worry about the false positives problem that I was just talking about  We've seen the government, for instance, wrongly target sites  That actually have a right to post the infringing material  Or otherwise legally display content  Without details on how the process works  We have no reason to believe that Google won't make similar over-inclusive mistakes  Dropping lawful, relevant speech lower in its search results  Without recourse for speakers

Start time: 2185.22
End time: 2194.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, okay, well, you say without recourse  But shows like this are a recourse  And Google will respond far faster than any government will  To make corrections because they have a profit motive for it

Transcript:  But take, and again, I'm quoting the EFF  Take down requests are nothing more than accusations  And this is a point you made earlier, Brian, of copyright  Accusations of copyright infringement  No court or other umpire confirms that the accusations are valid  Demoting search results  Telling the searcher these are not the websites you're looking for based on accusations alone  And I agree that the problem is it's a pendulum  And it's been swinging way in the favor of copyright holders  Sure  You know, I'm a copyright holder, we create content  I'm not

Transcript:  I think what's tricky here though is that you can have anyone with a large audience  Like let's say right now you said, you know what, I really don't like any company  Throw it out there  Yeah, take them down  Take them down, I want you all to go out there and independently create 500, 1000, 10,000 of these notices  Send them in, it's going to damage them, right?  Like they're just going to take down the site and knock it out of those search results  Hopefully they have other secret sauce behind the scenes  Like they say that they're going to be taking into account here before they do something like that  But I would just be worried that, you know, someone with a big audience can exploit this  I think that's always the problem with email blackholing

Start time: 2297.30
End time: 2326.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And here's what I like about DocuSign is the best advancements in technology take some little thing  Something that seems insignificant on the surface  And figures out a way to massively improve the efficiency and the pleasantness of doing it  As a stage performer, that means every time I do a stage show I have to sign a contract  And every institution has their own rules about how they want it  So fax this or sign that  It is  And you're faxing it, that's the problem is all the time  Anytime you buy a house, you're faxing this stuff

Oh sure, sure, I've had a number of contracts that had to be done  And that was the weird part  Indonesia sent me two documents  The RCTI is the big television station over there  They sent me the contract and I had to DocuSign it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because any time, and this is part of the reason  Ah, yes  What is a signature?  I've wondered myself  And what I mean by this is contract law, like by the letter of the law  The moment that I agree to this price and you agree to this event  We have a contract  We have an oral agreement, right?  All I have to do is shake your hand, sir  Sure, or even just talk over the phone, right?  But essentially, everything beyond that is just more proof  If it ever gets ugly between us, that we can hash out in a court of law  So if DocuSign is able to say, no, we have it verified  We're able to, it came from this IP address  It was signed by this person  It was verified by this email address  Exactly  Yeah, there's a handful of things they use  And so if the standard of evidence for DocuSign is as good as a forensic analysis of a handwriting  Then at that point, it's just as good as that signature  Right

Because a lot of people like me have a big investment in 30-pin docks  30-pin radios, 30-pin cars  We'll have to use an adapter  We don't have an adapter, but that's never as good  And it's always like $25, and you're like, why is this $25?

Transcript:  So I just finished a book by Matt Ridley called  The Rational Optimist, have you read this?  It is utterly fantastic  And it totally made me  Have so much faith in humanity  And our ability to survive and thrive  One of the things he does  Is he basically makes a case for  Hey man, things are just going to get better, technology is awesome  Free trade encourages  This marketplace of ideas causes people to compete  To come up with more efficient solutions  And that's why humanity by all measures  Is getting better and better year after year  And one of the things he says that kind of blew my mind  Is he says stop measuring wealth  By dollars or  Or pesos or any other  Currency, because what does that mean? Instead measure  Wealth by what you can get  For what the average person  Has to invest in time, right?  So in ancient Babylon it would take six hours  Of effort in order to  Make enough money for the average person  To buy enough oil for an hours  Worth of reading light, six hours of labor  For an hours worth of reading light in the middle of the night  Then you jump forward to the middle ages  Now all of a sudden it's, well say two hours  I'm sure all these numbers are wrong, but two hours  Of effort to get a single tallow candle  By the time you get to the 1800s, takes around  15 minutes of effort to get enough kerosene  To light your lamp, and nowadays with our  Compact fluorescent bulbs, with our LED  Lights, the average salary  In the United States of America, it takes a  Half second of labor to get  An hours worth of lighting, and so he also  Makes an interesting case. That's a really good way to measure it I think  He also talks about like Louis XIV  Of course one of the most extravagant  Kings of France  He talks about what he had as far as  Available. He would apparently have ten different  Meals prepared for him every single night  And so tremendously wasteful they would  Create, they would have to slaughter all these pigs  And he would just go and be like, I want that  Nowadays we get that for  I walk out my front door, I've got fifteen

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  and I think this is reasonable  and you can read the FAQ  but the default is not to backup those super large files  you can manually enable  you can say no, no, I want to backup that folder  and the reason is I think people  it's using your upstream bandwidth  so people  forget that  if you have terabytes of data  unimpressed video, whatever it may be  it's going to take a really long time  because there's lots of people out there who have 128k up  do the math  it's going to take you four years to backup that five terabytes  so I think reasonably  they turn off the super large files  by default, so if you're just using the automatic settings  but you can always go in there
