End time: 182.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  15 years? What was CNET doing in 1999?  CNET was...  It was a TV network.

Start time: 182.14
End time: 185.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, actually CNET launched as a TV network. It was originally a cable...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was a third employee. John and I were on their first pilot. Remember that, John?  Oh, yeah.  And the web designer was like Michael Douglas. It was like lacquered.

Start time: 194.20
End time: 209.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So in 1999...  You also had a different voice. It was interesting.  I did. I talked like this.  In 1999, the website had happened and had been going for a few years and it had sort of taken off.  And the website was originally launched as kind of a pet project of the show.  It was like, hey, there's this web thing.

Start time: 209.16
End time: 220.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Halsey Minor was very smart because I think he realized that the TV wasn't the be all and end all,  but it was a great vehicle for promoting a website.  And by 1999, it was apparent that you could make money on the web.

Start time: 220.00
End time: 224.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and the website just took off. And it was growing. When I started, it was growing really very quickly.

Start time: 225.14
End time: 229.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And in fact, the big moneymaker, and I think it's probably still the case, has always been reviews, right?

Start time: 229.22
End time: 239.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, reviews are very important.  I mean, everybody knows from an advertising perspective that it's important to be there,  whether the review is positive or not.  Right on.  It's better to be there than to not be there.

Start time: 240.22
End time: 268.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's so good to have you. Thank you for joining us.  Also, a newbie on Twitter. Well, not also because Lindsay was here once before.  It's so great to have you. Not a newbie on the network, but a newbie on the show.  Alan Malventano, we have been a huge fan of Alan for a long time. I quote you all the time.  Thank you.  He is the SSD expert and a reviewer now full time at PC Perspective. Former Navy chief. That's how we met. Submariner.  Yes.  How much time under the ocean have you spent?

Transcript:  A lot of people get claustrophobia. You have to be tested. You have to be checked out to be a sub guy.  Did you pass the exam?  Yeah.

Start time: 305.00
End time: 310.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What did they ask you though?  I had to pass all the submersion stuff.  Have you ever seen a guy naked in a locker room? They ask you stuff like that?

Start time: 311.10
End time: 314.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 319.18
End time: 331.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to end this line of questioning and move on. Mark Millian is also here from Bling Bling. We love Mark. He was one of the youngest reporters ever at the Los Angeles Times.  I don't know if that's true.  Wow. Come on. How old were you when you started?

Start time: 332.12
End time: 335.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I started as an intern out of college. Junior year of college.  Pretty young.  Yes, pretty young.

Start time: 336.00
End time: 403.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pretty young. And a superstar. Because you were young in the Times said, boy, what's this internet thing? What's going on here? We need a youngster to explain it.  Then CNN and Bloomberg Businessweek had one of those terminal cards for a long time now.  That's true. Yeah.  For two years.  Boy, there are a lot of stories today we could kick off with. I don't know exactly what I should begin with.  I'm going to bring up two stories that I feel like they're not true.  And I'm just curious. The way the internet treated it was like, first, Facebook went down this week for 20 minutes.  And a sergeant in the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department tweeted, yeah, Facebook's down. This is not an emergency. Please stop calling 911 to complain.  And everybody loves this story. Who doesn't love that story? There's the tweet from Sergeant Brian Brink.  Facebook is not a law enforcement issue. Please don't call us about it being down. We don't know it. We'll be back up.  Now, as it turns out, he wasn't there. He had the day off. He was off duty when he tweeted this. And in fact, it looks like he might have been joking.

Start time: 404.76
End time: 409.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I believe it probably did happen. There's enough documentation for people making crazy 911 calls.

Start time: 410.00
End time: 444.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sure. The LA Sheriff's Department said it didn't happen. They're investigating Sergeant Brink. They said he made it up.  Maybe he was drunk.  He made it up. But you don't see a lot of that. Fortune interviewed him. And he said, yes, we've received several calls from dissatisfied Facebook users.  He says, we get calls all the time, whether it be Facebook going down, people getting wrong orders at fast food restaurants, or their cable TV went out.  The Sheriff's Department understandably irritated because I think they feel like people are making fun of them too.  And they want great pains to say this hadn't happened.

Start time: 444.00
End time: 452.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think even if it didn't actually happen, I think his point is that it could easily happen. People call for all kinds of ridiculous reasons.

Start time: 453.38
End time: 457.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I'm sure he's heard all sorts of calls. He's heard them all, right?  When Comcast is down, call the cops.

Start time: 460.02
End time: 478.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Then the other one, maybe more... Anyway, I guess my point is, look how the press treated it.  You didn't see any articles or you saw a few articles saying that the LA Sheriff's Department is not happy about this. They're investigating.  Most of the articles were like with joy saying, see how stupid everybody is. They call 911.  That's a... Yeah. People love it.

Start time: 480.04
End time: 483.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a link bait.  Yeah, link bait. Never heard of such a thing.

Start time: 485.50
End time: 488.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, we're getting to you, John. We're getting to you.

Start time: 489.00
End time: 491.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What are you going to talk about?  You know what I'm going to talk about.  No, I have no idea.

Start time: 492.14
End time: 515.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The JavaScript engine that can write your prose.  Yeah, what about it?  It did a good job.  Uh-huh.  Okay, well, okay. You'll have a chance to rebut that because I'm going to read three paragraphs and ask our incredibly intelligent audience which one is real.  Because only one of the three is real. The other two were computer generated.  I don't know why Philip Elmer DeWitt picked you. Do you have a little thing going on with him?

Start time: 516.78
End time: 519.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what? He did something interesting about two and a half years ago.

Start time: 520.02
End time: 523.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh-huh. This is revenge coming in here. Okay, go ahead.

Start time: 524.74
End time: 536.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He reproduced the phony quote that was going around the net about how I said that the mouse would fail.  That was phony? I thought that was real.  And anyway...  It's not real?

Start time: 537.00
End time: 538.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's not real.

Start time: 538.02
End time: 549.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I always believed it.  Yeah, I know you didn't. And so I sent him the article with the exact wordage and then he apologized and then took it out of something he wrote for one of the magazines.  And I never heard from him again.

Start time: 550.14
End time: 556.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Except that I hear... I see that tweet all the time. People tweet it to me.  Yeah.  They say, you know, John didn't believe the mouse would happen.

Start time: 557.64
End time: 559.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I believe the mouse will eventually still fail.

Start time: 560.38
End time: 566.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that time is on my side.  You're wrong. Your team was just a matter of timing.  Just the other way.  You were absolutely right.

Start time: 566.77
End time: 569.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can wait it out.  Okay, you've got it on video.

Start time: 570.41
End time: 584.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll wait it out.  So I'll get to...  You know, keep it alive for years.  I'm going to do your straces. We've talked about Philip Elmer DeWitt.  Then I'll talk about the amazing, physics-defying rocket engine.  Another story that everybody picked up but I think is phony.

Start time: 585.16
End time: 586.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I get the sense it's phony too.

Start time: 587.20
End time: 606.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We'll talk about that. But I want you to rebut this. It does feel a little bit like a hit piece. This is again his fortune.  Philip Elmer DeWitt, he's been back columnist. He's been around for even longer than you.  He's really bored if he's writing about me.  Output from a clickbait generator is nearly indistinguishable from what passes for tech journalism.

Start time: 607.22
End time: 615.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a shot right at you.  Yeah, well, he'll get it back eventually.  Can you tell which of these paragraphs was written?  And I have more longevity.  I think you're right. I think he's in trouble.

Start time: 616.12
End time: 639.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, not tomorrow.  I would never write this.  Can you tell which of these paragraphs was written by a veteran PC magazine columnist John C. Dvorak and which by a robot?  So I'm going to read you three. I won't tell you the answer.  They all sound like you.  Number one.  I question whether robot is a robot.  Actually, John, you should read these because it should be in your voice.  Give me the URL or something.  Yeah, yeah. Here, here, here. Here's the computer. You read them.  I'll read them in my voice.

Start time: 640.48
End time: 646.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In your voice. And that way they'll really sound like you wrote them.  Except two will be sarcastic.  Two won't be real.

Start time: 646.22
End time: 650.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The House of Jobs was once a mighty innovator reshaping industries.  This is nothing. I would even come closer.

Start time: 651.79
End time: 680.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, well, see, he knows. Don't prejudice.  Oh, OK.  The House of Jobs was once a mighty innovator reshaping industries so often it seemed like it would never stop.  But stop it has.  While people like John Gruber want to say this isn't a big deal for Apple because it's still going to collect $650 each.  iPhone, another retailer. So we disagree.  OK, but that that was that, John, or I'll be before I begin doing my Jerry Purnell.

Start time: 681.08
End time: 742.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're doing his jury.  Let me let me start by saying that everything I say is out of love for Apple.  It sounds like you. Yeah, it does. Sure.  I've long admired the company.  That's me. And I'm eager to cheer it on again.  Apple's board chock full of environmental activists like Al Gore and Tim Cook rarely miss a chance to polish their premium brands image with the faithful climate with the faithful climate change cabal.  That sounds like a line of yours. Faithful climate change.  I would never say that it's well-written. It's not well-written. It's idiotic.  Third paragraph.  One of these is real.  Now, I've said before that Apple that this Apple product won't get much further than any other computer watch, smartwatch or anything else.  I first wrote about this in 2012, an article worth rereading.  You can also reread my second, my most recent screed about why Apple should not do a watch.  But in less than a month, I've changed my mind, kind of.  OK, it's a couple of things wrong with that paragraph. A, you never change your mind.

Start time: 743.30
End time: 748.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  B, you wouldn't plug previous columns.  Two.  Twice in one paragraph.

Start time: 749.79
End time: 752.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got a double, double plug.  That's the real, that is the real.  That's the giveaway.

Start time: 753.00
End time: 765.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. In fact, that's what Elmer DeWitt says. Can I call him Elmer?  Yeah, you can call him Elmer.  That's what Elmer said, which is that, well, this is a giveaway because he plugged his own column twice.  Twice.

Start time: 766.29
End time: 767.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's get that straight.

Start time: 767.08
End time: 775.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Those are well-written.  But he also says that he took those sentences from writers like you.  So we don't know if it's actually you or writers like you.

Start time: 777.53
End time: 778.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't believe this is true.

Start time: 779.22
End time: 780.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you could have written those kind of.

Start time: 781.00
End time: 789.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I would have never written any of this stuff. I don't go out of my way to talk about my love for Apple.  I've never heard you say that phrase.  I don't have a love for Microsoft either, by the way.

Start time: 789.34
End time: 801.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That paragraph was taken from David Pogue. I don't think that was taken from you.  That does sound like David Pogue.  Give me my laptop.  I love Apple.  Actually, there's no story here. This is a hit piece on John C. Dvorak.  What did you do to get this guy's G's?

Start time: 802.36
End time: 814.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think he just has a grudge because I corrected him years ago.  But that's okay. It doesn't bother me. It's publicity.  And I got two more plugs in for that column, those old columns.  You just doubled your plugs.

Start time: 815.57
End time: 816.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. The guy who wrote the. . .

Start time: 817.00
End time: 843.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Doubled my plugs.  The Apple clickbait generator is Kirk Lennon, and he was influenced by the Mackalope,  who's been on this show several times.  Most of the sentences are called verbatim from real clickbait articles.  Some sentences I adapted.  So if you want to try this out at home, you can go to the clickbait generator on kirklennon.com.  I can go through that. It might come in handy.

Start time: 845.22
End time: 849.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Although I think I can do better clickbait naturally.  It is the case that. . .

Start time: 850.12
End time: 864.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I need a computer to help me.  The best clickbait is human crafted.  Yes. Handcrafted clickbait.  Handcrafted by professionals.  We played before the show began yesterday's daily show segment on clickbait.

Start time: 866.41
End time: 869.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you see that?  Did my name come up in the conversation?  No.

Start time: 870.06
End time: 893.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, man.  It was kind of sad. The correspondent took a. . .  Was it Lansing, Michigan?  The last newspaper in Lansing, Michigan, which happens to be the student-run newspaper,  they're all journalism students, he went to them and said,  So what makes news? And they said, well, you know, it's got to be useful.  He said, no, you're all wrong.  And he then went to a former editor at Gawker and got a little help in helping them make their articles more juicy.  Punchy. Punchy.

Start time: 894.32
End time: 918.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you want to learn how to do punchy stuff, go to the bottom of almost every web page nowadays.  And there's all this crap. What's the name of the company doing?  Outbrain.  Outbrain.  And you go to the bottom, you got these great headlines.  They got a picture of some hottie or something.  I hate myself.  See, the best butt in the world.  I'll take it and check it out.  I click it every time.  I don't. I resist those.  I don't care who's got the best butt in the world because they never show it anyway.

Start time: 920.08
End time: 930.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Shouldn't every headline be bait, though?  I mean, it is bait. That's what a headline is.  Traditionally, it is.  A really well-written headline.  Well, you're thinking of like the New York Post, famous headlines in the New York Post.

Start time: 932.04
End time: 935.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Because there's a tabloid and you're walking by.  But the daily news does those things, too.

Start time: 936.00
End time: 938.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  They all do.  No, you're right.

Start time: 939.00
End time: 972.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's two schools of thought there.  There's a bunch of tech blogs that go sort of information-heavy on their headlines so  that they're very tweetable in many cases.  They're very SEO-able.  Right.  Very SEO-able.  There's a Twitter account, Saved You a Click, that's got like 130,000 followers, and it  basically takes all these clickbait headlines and answers it for you without putting the  link in.  In one word, usually.  That's funny.  Yeah.  Saved You a Click writes, Toby Keith.  Saved You a Click.  This actually is a funny, although I just read an article saying this isn't so nice

Start time: 982.50
End time: 988.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  for various reasons.  Buzzfeed wrote the article, of course, because they don't want to save you a click.

Start time: 989.00
End time: 990.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they were arguing against it.

Start time: 991.00
End time: 1005.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're spoiling our surprises.  Anyway, I feel like there is something to be said about the fact that the design ... I  agree with you, Lindsay, the headlines are about driving traffic, but there is a point  where it goes so far that really it's all about driving the traffic.

Start time: 1006.00
End time: 1017.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  No, it should be good.  It should be solid.  It should be well crafted.  It should be truthful.  It should be accurate.  Accurate and heady, maybe, but it really should make you want to read the article.  Right.  Yeah, that's fine.

Start time: 1019.22

No, and I don't want to get this into just a bitchfest about how bad web journalism is,  but it seems to pollute the waters a little bit.  It pollutes the waters.  So let's talk about this ...  There is no journalism left.  Let's talk about this amazing physics-defying rocket engine.  Oh, dear.  Well, you know what?  I'm glad I have smart people here, because everybody, every tech blog, without exception,  including Wired, which is normally very smart, kind of jumped on this because of the word N-A-S-A,  because NASA was in it, right?  The idea was that this had originally been created in 2001 by a guy who, I don't know,  it was a little bit like use water to power your car by a guy.  That's not good.  Who, in fact, raised something like 45,000 pounds for the British government to devise a device.  It was essentially a specially designed tin can.  If you feed thousands of watts of microwave power into it, and they bounce around in the can,  somehow miraculously, the can propels itself.  A small amount of power, it comes out of the can.  So it's kind of a miracle because it defies the conservation of momentum.  You don't ... it's like ... well, John Byers has actually a really good post on this.  He's an actual quantum physicist on Google+, in which he says it's kind of like having the driver in the car  push the wheel and making the car go forward.  We know it's just not possible.  He says, he believes that this is completely bogus, and even that the NASA experiment,  and that gives it some credibility, is bogus.  The amount of power it's creating is so small that it could easily simply be a measurement error.  Ah.

The bar that's holding up the hoverboard.  But people believe this stuff.  And really, what it is is an argument for critical thinking.  Or better critical thinking.  Yeah, well, it's a fail.  So, Baez, who is an actual quantum scientist, says that the NASA scientists say,  The best results indicate that the RF resonant cavity thruster design,  which is unique as an electric propulsion device,  is producing a force that's not attributable to any classical electromagnetic phenomenon,  is therefore potentially demonstrating an interaction with a quantum vacuum virtual plasma.  And everybody picked up that line.  It must be the quantum vacuum virtual plasma.  Baez says, that's bullsh-tish.  If you'll forgive.  But he says, but it's grad school bullsh-tish.  Quantum vacuum virtual plasma is something you'd say  if you failed a course in quantum field theory and then smoked too much weed.  There is no such thing as virtual plasma.  If you want to report experimental results that seem to violate the known laws of physics, fine.  But it doesn't help your credibility to make up goofy pseudo-explanations.  In any event, this is another example of maybe these guys don't have the ...  I mean, the scientific knowledge to write the article.  And so they're just kind of, well, it's NASA. It must be true.  But I just ... this story made the rounds too, completely uncritically.  Everybody believes it.  It's not true. I don't think it's true.  I think it's just BS.  There's a sucker born every minute.

Transcript:  I have a feeling something bad is about to happen.  While I let John fiddle with my phone, let's talk about Jira.  You know the original name for Godzilla in Japanese is Gojira.  I think Atlassian knew that.  Jira is one of the world's most powerful and customizable issue and project management systems  used by big companies. NASA uses it.  As Chad has told us before, Mojang uses it for Minecraft.  In fact, if you ever file a Minecraft bug report, you're filing it through Jira.  It captures and organizes your workflow so you can prioritize and take action on  what's important while staying up to date with the activity going on with you.  It's simple enough for a small team. It's powerful enough for 100,000-person enterprise.  That's why 25,000 companies use Jira.  70% of the Fortune 100, NASA uses Jira.  Jira is incredibly flexible and extendable.  Of course, there are literally hundreds of add-ons for Jira.  Test management, time tracking, project management.  If your issues involve code, they tie everything together from an initial planning doc,  the files, the change sets in your code repository right through to deployment.  Git, of course, completely integrated.  They've got REST APIs, so if there's not a module for what you want to do into a plug-in,  you can easily build yourself, build one.  Flexible and simple. It is amazing.  I want you to try it right now for 30 days free.  Go to Atlassian, A-T-L-A-S-S-I-A-N.com slash twit for more information.  You've heard of Jira. I'm sure you have.  If you're on a team, if you're a programmer, if you've shipped products, you've heard of Jira.  Now you can try it free for 30 days.  Monthly plans start at $10 a month for up to 10 users, so it's very affordable.  Atlassian.com slash twit. Consider it.  Jira!  This is a story that bothered me in some ways, and I don't know what...  Again, what I do every week is I put together stories that bother me, and I give you...  And I come to you and I say, explain to me.  A Houston man is being charged for child pornography in his email.  The police say they know about it because Google tipped them off.  Now, I am not in favor of child pornography.  I'm glad they got the guy if that's what he was doing.  But is it at all troubling that Google apparently, according to the police who told this to KHAU TV in Houston,  Google spotted three allegedly pornographic images of children in his Gmail  and tipped off the National Center for Missing and Exploiting Kids.  I wonder how that worked.  Yeah. Google's scanning everything he's doing.  Chris Matizic?  Matizic.  Matizic?  Yeah.  Doesn't look like Matizic to me. Matizic. Okay. I'll take your word for it.  People never get that guy's name right.  No, I think he likes it though.  I've been saying it wrong for 20 years.  I'm pretty sure he enjoys that.  Matizic.  Yeah.  I've changed it.

It's not a coincidence.  This is what bothers me. We know Google scans your email.  Yeah.  But mechanically, looking for keywords.  That sounds like a human might have looked at it.  No, they probably kicked it out.

Start time: 1774.14

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, this is... so this is from... yeah, that center that says since 2008,  we've had a hashing technology to tag known child sexual abuse images and identify them.  So maybe they gave that to Google?

Start time: 1839.02
End time: 1846.00

End time: 1856.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what the hashing would do.  This is a known image. It's circulated.  And as soon as they get a child porn image, they create a hash,  and then they give it to Google, and Google's matching images against that.  Well, Google does have Image Search.

Yeah. But I'm just saying, I understand that,  but that still would be troubling because you'd have to also...  Sure.  So what you're saying is it was a known image that they had a hash for.

Start time: 2048.02
End time: 2093.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I want you to be brutally honest.  I think it was last week that you were talking about a different story.  There was a different NSA story you talked about last week.  There's an NSA story every week since last June.  Well, pretty much every week.  But they were going into like that these analysts could just go through anything  and they made it sound like there were no rules, there were no laws,  and people can just do whatever.  I know there are rules and laws.  Exactly. That's my biggest counter to that is that there are rules and laws.  And we were like just trained endlessly as analysts.  Hey, if you see this...  This is what the rules are.  If it's a US person, nope, sorry, uh-uh.  You're not keeping that.  You're not supposed to write any reports on that.  Nothing. If it happens to be in a database, it was just by accident basically.  Right.  So...  Right.  Like we don't just...  No, no.  There's not enough time.  I never questioned that.

Start time: 2094.00
End time: 2132.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't even think Edward Snowden questioned that.  Although we know a few things.  First of all, we know that the intelligence community basically has lied  for quite some time to Congress.  And in fact, the latest story is that the CIA was monitoring the committee,  the congressional committee, investigating it and hacking into its computers.  And admitted it after lying about it for some time.  So we know the intelligence community lies to Congress.  So that's the oversight portion of this, right?  So yes, it's good to say there's a rule, and I understand there's a rule,  and it's good that they train you.  That's really great.  Oh, yeah.  But if at the very top...  That's at the very top?  There is a culture of defying the congressional oversight.  That's not encouraging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's... along those lines, like what I kind of had the big issue was...  You wouldn't deal with that, of course.  No, no. I was nowhere near at that level.  But where I had the big issue was that there was an IT person, Snowden, right?  Right.  He was... that's what he did.  He was in IT.  Those guys should not have any kind of access to those databases,  because then there is no oversight for them.  Like, if I did some kind of search on somebody,  somebody else has oversight over me to do like a kind of a check and balance,  like an audit and surveillance sort of thing.  Any query I did, somebody else above me would see that come across.

I might have gotten a little bit lazy on how they were maintaining their IT infrastructure.  I think that's what happened.  I mean, I understand humans.  It's human nature.

Well, it's people like John who wants to make sure that people like John don't all of a  sudden get up in arms and say, oh, Google's really crossed the line now.  I don't say stuff like that.  Really for...  Well, that machine did maybe, the JavaScript John General.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  No, you know what I'm saying.  You've got to be careful because the press and more importantly, the general public might  come to the conclusion that Google has finally become creepy.  But Google Now...  I don't think they're creepy yet.  Google Now is kind of creepy.

It sees it in my Gmail and I got a Google Now alert that says leave now for your movie.  That's great.  I had already left.  So it wasn't that great.  But if I had it on a watch, that would be much handier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't...  The problem with the watch is a very small screen.  So you get a little bit of the now.  It has to talk to you.  But it does very much.  That's exactly the use case.  And that's what I mean by it has to get more creepy.  It has to get more predictive about what you're doing.  It has to be more aware of what you might be doing and then has to tell you stuff that's  going to be useful before you knew it.  And that's even what Eric Schmidt said all along, is that really for us to succeed, we  can't be reactive.  We have to be proactive.  We have to come up with what you want before you know you want it.  But that's going to be creepy.  Or not.  Or wonderful.  I don't find that creepy.  Or creepily wonderful.  You know, I think this is okay.  I would propose this, Lindsay.  It's okay because it's useful.

Transcript:  The problem is when we announce we're going to do stuff, people see that first and they  decide it's creepy.  When you experience the value of it first before we announce it, then you don't get  that creepy reaction.  Because you've seen the value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think this is the problem.  They've used it and so they get the value of it.  This is exactly what he was articulating.  And the problem is until you've used it, it seems creepy.  So I agree with you.  They are not very good at expressing it because it is creepy until you've used it.

They should have had a maker shop in the maker space in the back, a hacker space.  They should have reached out to the geek community and embraced it and said, no, they haven't.  They should be advertising.  They should hire you to give them advice.  I started selling remote control vehicles, speakers and cell phones.

Instead of saying, let's embrace the geeks, we want to be more general.  We want to reach a broader audience.  So they put manga on and they put cops on and stuff.  And it didn't, it failed because it didn't appeal to anybody.  In a world where you've got Amazon and all these online retailers, the only way you're  going to beat them is by providing something they don't offer, which is service, which  is a human being, a human face.

Has any of you read The Martian?  Yes.  You read it.  See, I knew I liked you.  It's Robinson Crusoe on Mars, right?  It's pretty interesting.  He gets left behind on Mars and has to survive like a year and a half with what he's got  on hand.  It would be a wonderful graduate college course.  Here's the stuff you have on Mars.  Can you live a year and a half?  What would you do to solve it?  It's an education, listening to it, but it's also human.  It's beautiful.  You cry at the end.  I won't tell you why you cry.  It could be good.  It could be bad.  No spoilers here, but you will want to read this.  And Andy, we will be our guest.  I'm really thrilled.  An hour to talk to him a week from Monday.  So maybe this would be a good time to download and listen to The Martian.  I'll tell you what, I can get you two books for free.  So I highly recommend The Martian.  You know, we've interviewed Daniel Suarez on triangulation.  His books are always great.  What do you listen to?  I know John loved the Confessions of an Economic Hitman.  You still recommend that?  No.  You still stand by that?  Everyone should read that.  It's an outstanding product.  Another great audible book by John Perkins.  The true story of the highly paid professionals who go out to countries that are in economic  dire straits with bags of money, trillions of dollars, get them to do things that maybe  aren't in their best interest, but are in the best interest of major multinational  conglomerates.

That's exactly what I do.  It's awesome.  We interviewed a really great guy on triangulation, Mark Majadovnik.  He's very well known in Great Britain as a science guy.  He's got a book called Stuff Matters, Exploring the Marvelous Materials that Shape Our Man-Made World.  Why is glass see-through?  Do you ever think about that?  What makes elastic stretchy?  Why can you bend a paperclip?  These are things that I wonder all the time.  I can imagine.  Why can I bend that?  Well, Mark explains it.  He's funny.  He's just great.  I love Mark.  And so the point being, there are books in every genre.  And this is a bookshelf just waiting for you.  I want you to go to audible.com slash twit two.  And what we're going to do is we're going to give you a month free of the platinum account.  Now that's the two book a month account.  Two credits a month.  Most books are one credit.  Like 95% are one credit.  You'll also get the Daily Digest of the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal as part of your subscription.  You got it for 30 days.  You pay nothing.  If you cancel the first 30 days, that's it.  You'll get to keep the books.  You owe them nothing.  I think you're going to stick around.  Audible is a really fabulous resource.  Even if you still like reading paper books, having Audible when you're in the car, when you're in the gym, when you're walking the dog is awesome.  Audible.com slash twit two.  Two free books waiting for you.  Twitter had a pretty good quarter.  Although maybe it shouldn't have.  Hmm.  Hmm.  So Wall Street was very happy to hear that not only were Twitter's first quarter books, but also the first quarter books.  They were Twitter's profits good.  And I think Twitter kind of controls that.  You know, they can make as much money as they want or don't want by just putting more ads in the stream.  They blew away expectations.  But the most important thing, I think, from the point of view of Wall Street is users were up.  They had been going down for a few quarters.  And people were a little concerned that Twitter might be over.  Some of the increase maybe had to do with the World Cup.  That was probably the most tweeted event of all time.  Dick Costello and his analyst call said he thinks new users are coming to Twitter because their onboarding process is better.  That's where they welcome you.  They give you a little lay around your neck.  I didn't notice this.  Champagne.  Champagne.  Welcome to Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I always say that I think Twitter's problem is social anxiety.  A lot of people sign up for Twitter and they do one of two things.  They either just follow a bunch of people and then they lurk or they try to participate.  And because it's hard to build up followers, they are anxious, right?  They throw things out into the universe and nobody answers and then they feel dumb and then they kind of stop.  So I think what Twitter's trying to do is build up sort of a stronger lurker culture,  which is really probably what they need to be successful, right?  People use Twitter more as something that they absorb rather than something they participate in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nothing happens.  It's just dead silence.  I get no respect.  So here's the trouble in paradise, and I think this is fair.  Wall Street Journal pointed this out.  I don't know if you've ever seen a Twitter app that's not  actually active.  But it's not.  It's not.  And the fact that they're gaining new users, most people  never go to the website or use the Twitter app.  That's right.  That's wrong.  Most people do.  But about 40 million active users don't.  Use the Twitter app.  They don't see Twitter ads at all.  Now, that's only 14% of the total.  So it isn't anywhere near the majority.  But that number may be going up.  And that's something Twitter needs to watch out.  That's why they killed the third party apps or tried to.  And I know I don't see any ads.  Are they going to have to put it in the stream to really monetize?

Start time: 4770.92
End time: 4786.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they're probably exploring this really actively right now.  And just like, and this is kind of, I guess I've been saying this the whole show.  Just like nature abhors the vacuum, the advertising industry abhors the missed opportunity.  Right.  And so somehow this will, I mean, you got to bet that Twitter is having back end conversations with all of these third party apps.

Start time: 4787.00
End time: 4806.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't there attention between the advertising industry, who would like to put ads every freaking where they can,  and the businesses and the users who say, well, hey, come on, knock it off.  We don't want to see ads everywhere.  Twitter has to balance those interests.  They can't just say, hey, advertisers, let's put this in the stream.  That could really chase.  And they are trying.

Start time: 4806.88
End time: 4835.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They are trying.  They have what's it called?  Twitter has an ad product, an ad product where they basically work with publishers to share the revenue from a single ad.  So they're kind of a twofer.  So, you know, let's say two publishers are in one ad, a broadcaster has a tweet lined up that includes an ad and they share that revenue with Twitter.  Oh, that's called Twitter.  Amplify. That's what it's called.  Twitter.

Start time: 4846.23
End time: 4849.18

Transcript:  And why would the networks go along?  Why would they share their revenue?

Start time: 4849.94
End time: 4858.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, probably because advertisers, I mean, the people paying for the ads are very interested in social exposure, but they want to do it in partnership with people who they think will get attention on social.

Start time: 4858.76
End time: 4867.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I understand. No, I understand the advertisers.  But why would the Wall Street Journal share revenue with Twitter?  Well, because why should I give you?  Because it wants a new revenue stream.

Start time: 4868.00

Qualcomm is under the same pressures right now in China.  China also appears to be tilting their smartphone market in favor of local companies.  So Lenovo and Xiaomi are benefiting from...  What a surprise.  Some moves that are hurting Apple and Samsung.  For example, the carriers, the Chinese government told the carriers to stop subsidizing so much  of the phone's cost.  So that would essentially make...  Here you go to the Verizon store, you get an iPhone for $200, but it actually costs $650  to the carrier.  They subsidize the cost to lower the price for you.  China's telling their state-owned cellular carriers not to do so much of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  So this site, you want to site the people when you're doing the show.  People can rush to that site, flood it.  Hundreds and thousands of people can visit it.  And the last thing you'd want is that it goes down.  It can't.  Because?  It's Squarespace.  You think we're making this up.  But no, this is true.  We have tried and tried and tried.  You've got to give a piece of the action on these ads.  Everybody go to No Agenda.  Right now, nonagendasshow.com.  Everybody go there.  Everybody go there.  And I guarantee you, I can bring any site down except a Squarespace site.  I cannot bring it down.  And we've tried.  And that's because Squarespace really is committed to not only great uptime, but great response.  So Squarespace pages pop up.  That's because the hosting at Squarespace is tightly integrated with the software.  They do stuff behind the scenes.  They explained it to me once.  It went over my head.  But it's very sophisticated, involving virtual servers and Java.  It's amazing.  You don't need to know.  That's the beauty of it.  All Squarespace templates are modern, mobile, responsive design.  You get the benefit of the latest, greatest state of the art web technologies.  But you don't have to be in HTML or JavaScript or something like that.  But you don't have to be an HTML or JavaScript or CSS guru.  You can just point and click your way to a beautiful website that matches your aesthetic, your sensibilities.  Whether you're a photographer or an artist.  Whether you're selling online.  Whether you're just a blogger.  You just want a great site.  Visit squarespace.com.  Now you can take a look at Squarespace.  Even try it for two weeks.  Use all the features.  Absolutely free.  All you have to do is name a site.  Give them an email address and a password.  And you're in.  You can import all the content from your existing site.  Change the templates at will.  They do have a developer's platform.  If you're a JavaScript guru, you can do anything with Squarespace.  But you don't have to be.  And that's beautiful.  Their newly redesigned customer help site will help you there, by the way.

So you can get really good at this if you want to spend the time.  $8 a month, the basic plan.  That includes a free domain name when you sign up for a year.  They have mobile apps that are beautiful.  In fact, if you're a photographer, they have a portfolio app that will pull the photos from your website  and display them on an iPad or an iPhone for your client.  This is really actually pretty awesome.  I could just go on and on.  Why don't you go to squarespace.com, click the Get Started button, try it.  All I ask is when you decide to buy, use the offer code TWIT,  because you're going to get 10% off.  And that way they'll know you heard about it on This Week in Tech.  And if they had a code for no agenda show, I would give it to you.  But they don't.  Why don't you?  Oh, you don't do ads.  We don't do ads.  You only accept this is their pure.  As the driven snow.  As the driven snow.  Squarespace.com, use the offer code TWIT.  So we will find out more.  I think it's a black hat that they're going to give a presentation on.  Bad USB.

Start time: 5718.66
End time: 5722.37

Start time: 5723.43
End time: 5744.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's locked down by obscurity.  Historically.  Historically.  Right.  Because like you usually plug a USB drive in, you'd need a special tool.  And we know how well that works.  Well, you would need some kind of special tool to be able to rewrite that firmware, just like any other firmware programming software.  Right.  So if you can, if you have access to that firmware, you can write other code, you can make it appear as other devices, you can make it appear as a keyboard.

Start time: 5745.17
End time: 5749.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It just can't do it through the regular USB port.  It has to have like an EEPROM or something.  You need some electronics that pokes at it.

Start time: 5749.66
End time: 5759.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

End time: 5796.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's done through the port.  You just have like...  If the device could be reprogrammed that way...  Does it make that noise?  Yeah.  It doesn't at all.  I don't know if it's the case with this, but it would be theoretically possible to code a firmware, reprogram it.  That you would put on the hard drive of the computer?  That you could have running on the host operating system and could then reprogram.  I don't know if it's the case with this one, but...

Start time: 5797.22
End time: 5821.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's what some of the things we're going to learn at the Black Hat presentation, but I think part of the question is, okay, obviously this has always been the case.  This would be nothing new that a manufacturer of a thumb drive could put malware on a thumb drive.  That's actually been done.  Of course.  Anybody who's making hardware can put malware on their hardware, and we've seen that happen.  And we've seen that by accident even, where there's not...

Start time: 5821.76
End time: 5829.15

Start time: 5847.55
End time: 5885.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He knew how to reverse engineer that malware, that's for sure.  But Stuxnet and Flame and these other very sophisticated malware attacks, I think most people agree, probably governmental.  And in this case, I think this was actually a brilliant idea.  Iran was enriching uranium to make atomic bombs.  Stuxnet attacked the centrifuges and brought them down.  And the theory being if we can break the centrifuges and have them overspin, this could cripple their ability to enrich the uranium.  That sounds like the kind of warfare I like.  That's good, right? Nobody gets hurt?  That's the future of warfare.

You hand that off to somebody else who then takes it and weaponizes it,  who then hands it off to somebody else who gets it into Iran,  so it's all compartmentalized.  Nobody knows who's doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's what we're going to find out.  I mean, we haven't really seen the details because he's going to present it.  They're going to show it, yeah.  But it sounds as if a significant number of USB sticks have reprogrammable firmware.  That's bad.  The answer would be to only buy USB sticks that had ROM if such a thing exists.

Start time: 5990.92
End time: 6016.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a feeling that a lot of them are reprogrammable.  Why is that?  Well, I mean, what's funny is the first thing that comes to mind for me is that  what you would think is the most secure is probably the most reprogrammable.  That's Iron Key.  What?  That's supposed to be secure.  They release firmwares. Well, no, they release firmwares.  I don't know what the level of like...  If they're doing some kind of check or something.

Start time: 6016.66

End time: 6031.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is what's scary.  I'm reading over your shoulder, but the quote from this R story,  there's no way to get the firmware without the help of the firmware.  And if you ask the infected firmware, it will just lie to you.

Start time: 6031.90
End time: 6036.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 6037.78
End time: 6056.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I'm not hacked. I'm good.  Actually, that's very similar.  There are rules.  No, no. That's along the lines of how people used to hack DirecTV.  DirecTV would try to figure out if you had hacked your card.  They'd push a signal back.  They'd hack your card in such a way that it reported back to the box.  Oh, no, I'm not hacked.

Start time: 6056.66
End time: 6062.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 6063.76
End time: 6081.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then they toast the card.  They fried it, yeah. It was all over.  I remember I had DirecTV, I think it was DirecTV,  and they were going to go to new cards.  So they sent you another card, and they said,  you got to put this card in within the next week.  But before you do, type in some...  You had to send something to it, and then it would toast the card that was in there.

Start time: 6081.66
End time: 6084.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 6087.72
End time: 6115.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So here's what they say they're going to do at Black Hat next week.  They're going to take a brand name, USB stick,  and they're going to transform it into a computer keyboard.  So you plug in the stick, it opens a command window on the computer,  and enters command that causes it to download and install malicious software malware.  Yep.  So you plug it in, all of a sudden a command line opens up.  That will get around user access control.

Start time: 6115.97
End time: 6120.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's using your credentials.  You were logged in when you plugged it in.  That's why you should be a limited user.

Start time: 6122.00
End time: 6169.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Then they will transform a brand name USB stick into a network card.  Once active, the network card causes the computer to use a domain name system server that is malicious.  So when you enter in Yahoo.com, you get badyahoo.com.  That's a well-known malware attack.  Easy to do.  Then they'll program a brand name USB stick to surreptitiously inject a payload into a legitimate Ubuntu installation file.  The file is loaded onto the drive when attached to one computer.  The tampering only happens after it's plugged into a different computer that has no operating system on it.  So you could use a trusted computer, verify that this is no,  the MD5 hash says that's a legitimate Ubuntu install.  Right.  Unplug it because it's been verified and now install it and in fact it's not.

Start time: 6169.68

I'm sure Steve Gibson will talk about it after the Black Hat because I think you want to hear the presentation before you say anything.  Apparently, it says according to Ars Technica, the vast, this is Dan Gooden, Dan Gooden writing,  the vast majority of USB devices will accept any firmware update they're offered.  There's no check.

Because one of the problems with wearables is that you have to recharge them every night  or every couple of nights, and that's just annoying when you talk about something that  you want to wear on your body.  So I think it's huge.

Transcript:  Of course, USA Today not, no, doing the deep research, they found a 92-year-old professor  of material science at the University of Texas named Goodenough who said,  well, it might be expensive.  It's always expensive, of course.  Actually, John Goodenough, he's not just anybody.  He invented lithium anode.  Well, there you go.

What is the technology that you would do now that will be the next big thing?  And I said, you know, it's pretty hard.  If you thought 15 years ago, you know, if you'd asked me 15 years ago and I were smart,  I might have said, well, you should write a chat app because you could make $6 billion  when you sell it to Facebook.  What would you say 15 years from now?  Is it battery technology?  Solar charging?  Is it renewable energy in general?  Renewable energy, sure.

T-double-E-S-P-R-I-N-G.  We do these T-shirts for 30 days only because we want to create some sort of perceived value,  some sort of crazy demand that wouldn't exist otherwise.  I think that's wise.  It's a psychological trick.  I admit it.  I'm the first to admit it.  Huh.  But it's also true that in 30 days, you will never be able to get this T-shirt again.  Yeah.

We probably should have.  The judge who says Microsoft has to give up information  on an Irish server, the US judge.  That has a huge global impact too.

And you catch Alan on the PC Perspective podcast,  but also writing every day for PCPer.com.  And I really wish...  I guess you...  I heard you talking about it on the podcast,  but your SSD directory is so useful.  What are you going to do with that?  I don't know.  I know you've...  I recommend it all the time.  I need to update that thing.

Start time: 6817.68
End time: 6822.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It turned into just an octopus.  It was insane trying to update that thing.

Start time: 6822.70
End time: 6832.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because you were the first, one of the early guys to do  review and rate different SSDs.  And you came up with the fact that there are really  some significant differences in the quality.

Start time: 6832.76
End time: 6858.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There were differences.  And the issue...  Part of the reason that I haven't updated  what used to be the SSD decoder.  Right.  That started...  It was just my own personal spreadsheet.  Trying to keep track.  Just to try to keep track.  Because there were so many manufacturers,  and they all had different controllers,  and you didn't know what controller was in which drive.  And a given controller would perform similar,  depending on just across whichever brand it was for that model.  So that's what the SSD decoder thing was.  vcper.com slash SSD.

Start time: 6860.86

Start time: 6864.28
End time: 6884.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, everything is dated in there, unfortunately, now.  And the number of controllers,  the number of manufacturers is not so unwieldy anymore.  It used to be that there was...  Sandforce was in like...  I know. It was crazy.  Sandforce was in like 15 different brand.  There was kind of like a little race.  Everybody wanted to have...  Everybody wanted to make an SSD.  Every company wanted to make an SSD.

Start time: 6888.06
End time: 6906.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sure it does. There's still differences.  But the number of controllers is now...  What's the absolute best one to buy right now?  Yeah, what's the best?  Period.  Intel?  Wirecutter SSD.  There has to be at least two answers there.  Because there's one that's the best cost per gig.  Which I believe is the crucial...  Either the MX100 or the M550.

Start time: 6908.68

Start time: 6924.66
End time: 6941.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the second half of the answer?  So the second half of the answer, I would say,  is like the most nimble performer.  Which right now is Samsung.  Like the 850 Pro.  Which actually uses 3D NAND.  3D NAND?  The flash memory is made on the same die.  It's made 32 layers high.

Start time: 6955.68
End time: 6964.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  $699 for a terabyte?  That's not bad.  So that just launched and the pricing is still kind of premium.  But really that is a very, very good performer.  How about those EVOs from Samsung?

Start time: 6965.66
End time: 6980.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the previous generation.  And I have a suspicion they're going to make a 850 EVO as well.  Using that same 3D flash.  And once that happens, I think their cost per gig is going to start dropping in the 40s as well.  Like 40 cents per gig.  So it's just a matter of time.  That's the one I wait for.  Yeah, they just need to do it.

And these new PCI Express ones that Apple's been using and others now.  Really fast.  Because you've got that fast bus behind it.  Thank you, Alan.  I'm glad we could talk about that a little bit.  And I want to thank you, Lindsay Turrentine, for being here from CNET, the reviews editor there.  You're welcome.  Anything you want to plug?  Besides your regular Monday appearance on TNT.

Transcript:  I think so, too.  And I think it's taken the whole industry a while to sort of sort out what the best way for a media app to work is.  We finally decided to create a situation where you can toggle between the programming that we do.  So we say these are the five or six or seven or eight or nine, ten stories you have to see right now.  Or you can just go to latest.
