Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hudson Valley it's so pretty so pretty up there and it's good to have this particular panel here  because we are talking about big tech in a lot of different ways but so much to talk about we will  talk about you were running Windows 11 that's gonna be announced later this week we will talk  about that but I want to talk about what happened last week which is Congress introduced not one not  two not three not four but five regulating bills regulating big technology a little less than a  week ago Alex of course this is right up your alley the bills are mostly antitrust you actually  break them all down which is nice bill one the American Innovation and Choice Online Act which  is the AI ACOA I echo ah it doesn't not have sorts of fun acronyms for these usually they  have good acronyms that one's not so good the ending platform monopolies these were all  introduced in the House of Representatives that's bill two three is augmenting compatibility and  competition by enabling service switching act this is the only one that I kind of really think is a  good idea it's the interoperability act essentially saying that data should be portable the merger  filing fee modernization act of 2021 this is the one that everybody says will probably become law  the Senate even will probably pass this all it is is another tax if you file for a merger there's  a the new higher fees will pay for regulation that's I think Elizabeth Warren's bill yeah and

Start time: 395.68
End time: 399.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the Senate has already passed already that's right they passed it yeah but the rest of them

Start time: 402.18
End time: 422.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  probably not bill five platform competition and opportunity act so Alex did a great job all five  of them in one spot if you want to if you want to read them but what is your take on these besides  the the additional fee for mergers does any of them have a chance well I've a long said that

Start time: 423.28
End time: 511.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there's very little chance that big tech is gonna actually be reined in yeah and that they'll they  won't be broken up they won't face serious legislation Congress doesn't know what it's  doing the regulators are weak I am starting to change my tune a little bit I'm not saying  these will necessarily be passed but I'm saying there is a better chance of these things being  passed into law and signed by Joe Biden then I think we should have we could have anticipated  in the past the fact that Lena Khan is running the FTC which I know we're about to get to  and the fact that these bills have bipartisan support some of the exact same bills have been  introduced in the house passed in the Senate have bipartisan support in the house and the the wild  card is Rupert Murdoch who is no friend to big tech is pushing Republican lawmakers to support  these bills and you've seen Tucker Carlson go after those who haven't and so they're that way  you can have anti big tech Democrats coming together with Republicans who already don't like  tech because of the censorship claims and then you have Rupert Murdoch who doesn't like them  because of the business realities everybody comes together at one big happy family and actually  can cause some damage here so the smart money would say that there's not a great chance that  four of the five outside of the merger money will be will be passed but the I would say if you had  like to bet on it there's a much better chance that this stuff will go through now than there  was you know a couple years ago when senators were asking Mark Zuckerberg how to send email

Start time: 511.64

Transcript:  through whatsapp right and of course the right has one reason they want to regulate big tech  primarily stemming from Facebook and Twitter's banning of the president Trump the left has  another reason it's more antitrust is because traditionally Republicans are pro big business

Start time: 526.80
End time: 560.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right right yeah and this really doesn't touch on the censorship issue that the right is so  concerned about three out of the five bills here I admit when I first read them it gave me the the  can spam act vibe where okay it sounds good but they're not gonna really enforce this it's gonna  be impossible to actually do anything with it but the fact that they've they've picked on to to head  up that office and you could essentially take three out of the five bills from her paper the  one that she published on platforms and commerce that she did for the Columbia Law Review.

Transcript:  Nina Kahn is the new chairman of the FTC youngest ever 32 years old and is very well known for her

Start time: 568.10
End time: 583.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  anti big tech right and this is not a coincidence they're essentially giving her the ammunition she  needs to go after them so if she had just taken over it would have been an uphill battle if the  bills were standalone it would have been an uphill battle but you have a commissioner who now has laws

Start time: 583.52
End time: 627.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  all kind of lining up there you go you Alex you you'd call one of them a dumb rocket not a well  guided missile and in particular one of the five bills you don't like is is the bill that would  prevent which actually on the face of it seems reasonable prevent companies from acquiring  potential competitors like Facebook did with Instagram and whatsapp to to eliminate competitors  in the marketplace but you say that and I think you make a good point here that's gonna hurt  innovation because one of the reasons people start companies is so that they'll be acquired  by a big tech company like Google Facebook Amazon or Apple well it's not so much at the end goal is

Start time: 627.42
End time: 688.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to get acquired by big tech I think anyone who starts a company really hopes that they'll IPO  and become the next one of these companies but most startups don't succeed and so you want to  have a safety net there just in case you don't reach IPO level you don't want to end up capitulating  and getting bought by a small company for a low amount of money or having to fold your operation  and these five big tech companies have made some big acquisitions for companies that aren't ready  to go public but do create some real value and so it's not as much as like what's gonna happen if  they stop the acquisitions today it's how does that change the incentives for startup founders  because I think startup founders are pretty smart they think about where they're going before  they get there and if they see that their predecessors aren't able to have impressive  exits if they can't IPO they might change their calculation about whether they want to start the  company in the first place and if we do have less companies starting in the country we're gonna end  up having as you mentioned less innovation and so I think that's a really big deal you also make

Start time: 688.66
End time: 734.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it an excellent point and we have a very good example of that if companies are prohibited from  acquiring other companies Facebook did get Instagram and whatsapp but they wanted Snapchat  and Snapchat said no then what they'll do is one of two things they'll either create a competitive  clone which is what Facebook did to Snapchat and try to put it out of the business that way that  might you might argue well that's good because they'll be competition now or they acquire they  acqua hire the people from that company they hire away all the good talent and then in effect hollow  the company out from the inside neither neither of which outcome really is is is ideal I think  it's probably better for Facebook to clone Snapchat than it is for them to buy it though so I think

Start time: 734.98
End time: 794.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  there's a good lens here is to look at it through the eyes of Lena Kahn because her thing and the  way she's looking at monopolies and antitrust is not just oh you're big therefore you're a monopoly  she's looking specifically at platforming so if you use your platform to then decrease competition  even if it keeps prices down she believes that's still anti-competitive so what she's she's opening  the door for is you can be the platform but you have to be a common carrier you can have acquisitions  but you can't have acquisitions if you also run the platform I think that's actually a good balance  because I agree I think that it can stop innovation if people don't know if they're going to be able  to recoup their initial investment because they can't get all the way through with the startup but  you can have that without allowing the company to be bought by the dominant platform by the Amazon  the Microsoft the Apple I'd like to give this a try well don't we have just to push back on this

Start time: 794.12
End time: 863.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a little bit don't we have regulatory agencies for a reason I mean we put Lena Kahn in charge of the  agency that evaluates these mergers and acquisitions and now we're gonna write a law that says the  companies that she's focused on can't acquire at all like I thought we had faith in this person to  actually run an agency in a competent way which it hasn't been up until this point that's not the  resources or the staffing or the ambition now we have Lena Kahn in there and we're gonna write a  law that's gonna take away the agency's ability to evaluate these good point mergers do it one by  one do it on a case-by-case basis you never know what's gonna happen if you write what I you know I  called it a dumb rocket because it's so broad that there could be a ton of collateral damage and  ultimately you know it's Congress saying we want to you know prevent everything we're gonna have  these companies around for a long time we're gonna have companies that meet these definitions that  the kind that Congress put forward in the paper for a long time and so I just find it a little bit  I mean it's just that's not how a market works it's I thought these things are supposed to promote  competition and at the end of the day I think this really inhibits it no Alex I want to ask

Start time: 863.70
End time: 878.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  about that because my understanding was this is these are more soft touch so the FTC would still  be doing that evaluation right I mean they would be the ones who could look at a potential deal and  say no this runs a foul of that law or it doesn't or does this completely take it away from the

Start time: 878.28
End time: 962.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  FTC I didn't I didn't read that part not look it doesn't take it away completely but when you  look at the law the prohibition on acquisitions is so broad that it would be really difficult  for these companies to make the case that they should be able to acquire I mean basically it  says you know you can't acquire something that's gonna enhance your service or potentially compete  with you what's left I really don't know especially look at the companies the size that they are and  the amount of different things that they that they do so honestly just I mean we have a an FTC to  approve these things for a reason so it's just gonna lead to all these downstream bad effects  and and I mean just last thing about the law it starts not with the exceptions but with the broad  prohibition you can't make acquisitions unless right as opposed to these are the potentially the  type of acquisitions you can't make leaving the rest open so it's so broad and you know I don't  know look I think that we have a package of five bills as Leo mentioned at the top some are gonna  have some really good ideas I think some have great ideas I think funding the regulators is  extremely smart I've been calling for it for a while in big technology some of the others other  ideas talked about are also pretty good but you're also gonna have some you know pretty dumb and bad  ideas and I happen to think this is one I'm welcome disagreement but I just don't see the need to do  what Congress is outlining in this one that's fair that's fair also the nature of this is that

Start time: 962.44
End time: 982.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  even if the house passes all five well all four because the fifth one if the house passes it's  done but there's something in the way it has to not only get through the Senate but also get through  reconciliation presumably the Senate's gonna have some other opinions about this this is how the  sausage is made you you propose something you you negotiate and maybe you come to a better law down

Start time: 982.24
End time: 988.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the end of the line. I see the Senate suddenly wanting to insert language along with these bills to address the

Start time: 988.86
End time: 1006.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  censorship item. I think at some point though also Republicans have to stand up for what they've said  all along which is we believe in business and we believe in less regulation this is not less  regulation this is more regulation this is contrary to what Republicans have said for you know since

Start time: 1007.36
End time: 1078.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  1920. It is sorry it is remarkable how Republicans and Democrats are so in sync on this I mean you  look at these for different reasons yes in sync yeah I think 26 the 2016 election turned them all  against big tech right the Democrats said you did Trump and then they evolved that into your  anti-competitive and the Republicans said you're censoring conservative voices and they said what  authority do we have to take on these companies and they involve that into competition and then  you have a hearing where you have Amy Klobuchar and Josh Hawley who would never agree with each  other on anything giving each other time and riffing off of each other's points that scares the hell out of me.  This is why yeah so I say 2017 2018 it didn't seem like anything was gonna happen but you know  the government works in really interesting ways and once you get something written down on paper  which we have right now you never know where it's gonna go and so I have given up the never never  gonna happen right perspective could happen it is and if you watch the way these folks talk and even  Joe Biden is on board with a lot of this well he appointed Tim Wu to his yeah I mean yeah it clearly

Transcript:  You know our politics has become so much about public punishing your enemies as opposed to  supporting your causes and Leo when you talk about the Republicans support for free markets  that's all I thought about was like you know they're mad enough that maybe this is where they end up  going yeah so Bezos I mean I think this past week I did a tweet talking about how you know once  he heard Lena Conn was gonna be the FTC commissioner he said okay space doesn't really sound so bad

Transcript:  so is Richard Branson well if all goes well anyway who is gonna be the person who stands up and says  yeah they banned Trump but you know what what would this pandemic have been like without big tech making  it possible for us to go to school for many of us to stay working this pandemic would have been a lot  worse without big tech and let's not forget the the technology mRNA that's given us the vaccine it's  so easy to make an enemy out of tech but I think there's also I want to defend it a little bit  because there's a consequence to this we get a lot of benefits out of this you know one of the debates  we've been talking about over the last few weeks is Amazon's sidewalk which you know if it did if  it came from anybody but Amazon people might not have been so negative about it it is I think  Amazon's attempt to do something for the public good but because it came out of Amazon and because  they left they had it on by default I think people are gonna it's not it's gonna be a non-starter  have you talked at all Nicholas about about sidewalk and with your Consumer Reports audience

Start time: 1215.58
End time: 1309.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and what is your recommendation to them we have not or I have not written about sidewalk but I will  want to sort of tag on to what you just said and I sort of personally agree I've been covering  I mean technology for 15 years now I grew up reading like Sound and Vision magazine and things  like that all this stuff was like always fun and exciting and interesting to me so I do understand  people's concerns with but like big tech like I honestly didn't even recognize it that's like oh  that's like big tobacco until like a couple months ago it is and I'm like people really hate these  companies that in you know they've really improved our lives and I get the concerns and I understand  you know especially with the antitrust and I trust stuff and and consumers having choice in the  marketplace but you know personally I don't know I like I like I like Amazon I use it all the time  a lot of these companies have immeasurably improved my life and and you know I speak to readers all  the time and they're you know they agree I remember a couple years ago I was doing a big Facebook  story and and talking to folks like how to use Facebook and and to a person they were like oh I  use it to share you know baby photos and to you know like grandma's you know funny posts and it's  like I maybe people are naive maybe people don't see the harm but like for the average person which  is my audience and the kind of you know the headspace that I kind of live in most of the time  nowadays this stuff seems maybe not academic but like a very different a very different vibe I think

Start time: 1310.24
End time: 1359.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to what sort of the average person feels it's maybe I'm wrong I don't know it's the world we  live in where you can get people riled up they banned the president on Facebook at the same time  as they go but I'm going to use it to say happy father's day I love it exactly and I think people  do actually love Google Facebook Amazon Apple they do love it and they use it tomorrow is  prime day per tomorrow and Tuesday are prime days they're going to have huge amounts of traffic  huge amounts of people using Amazon at the same time as people saying but I don't which that's  part of the sidewalk argument that gets me because the people who are turning off sidewalk the only  way you could turn off sidewalk is if you have Amazon echoes in your house or ring doorbells  you're already giving Amazon images and sound and everything else and you're worried about

Start time: 1359.56
End time: 1385.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  sidewalk I mean I don't it doesn't make sense to me I was with my parents in Las Vegas and they  live in a semi-retirement community it's very schizophrenic they were with groups of friends  and they all started talking about how much they hated Amazon and they would never buy anything  from Amazon but they've got ring video doorbells they do pill pill packs they've got the Amazon  echoes in the house so they don't quite understand exactly how much that kind maybe that's part of

Start time: 1386.14
End time: 1417.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the problem is that big tech is so pervasive now you cannot escape it we've seen articles years  ago even from the the New York Times was it Kevin Roos who said or Taylor Lawrence somebody's so I'm  not going to use any of the big five and she basically couldn't use anything as cash hill cash  shield yeah you know without Google Amazon every site is hosted by Amazon or Google  we live in big tech we're immersed in it it's hard to imagine surgery that's going to leave the patient

Start time: 1418.34
End time: 1552.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  alive and well are aren't we getting to the issue here which is that these companies I think many  of us agree are a net positive to society yes but and I'm going to steal this from Scott Galloway  he said this before the keyword is net right so there's also a ton of things that they do  that are a little bit you know past the line and so I don't think even though that they're you know  I appreciate all five of these companies I'm an Amazon Prime member I'm a Facebook you know daily  or weekly active user I use the rest but we should still not give up on the fact that some of the  stuff that they're doing you know is potentially anti-competitive and might need to be reined in  and if you look specifically at I've already talked about my my opposition to this prohibition  of acquisitions but if you look specifically at David Cicilline's bill I don't like the whole thing  but the fact that it says if you're a company like Amazon or Google you cannot take data from  third parties that are using your services and then use that to enhance your services  I think that's pretty good because what you end up having is a number of small and medium-sized  businesses whether they're software providers or whether they're merchants that are selling on  Amazon they end up losing out on potential market opportunity because they're forced to go through  Amazon or Google to reach the people that are going to end up using their products or buying  their services and they have this reality where Amazon and Google are taking their business secrets  the way that they get by nature of the fact that they have to work on their platforms and using it  to make their products great and and crowd out the competitors and I think if you want to have a true  competitive market economy you can't have that happen because online you really only want to  have one search engine you really only want to have one e-commerce platform because you know once  once they've become better than all the rest why use anything else so that's why I think we're  seeing a moment where you know from if you take it in the good faith position that's why I think  you're seeing a moment where we're trying to rein these companies in a little bit because  their excesses are you know leading to the fact that others can't grow so it's not that they're  all bad you know there are some people who are out there is like these companies can't do anything  good but we should make sure that when we think about the net we try to decrease as much negative

Transcript:  as possible and unlock as much good. Cicillini's strategy he told Axios this a few months ago is  to introduce so many bills that big tech can't fight it. I wouldn't bet on that they've got a  lot of lawyers and a lot of lobbyists he said if we're one bill it'd be easy for them to band  together and fight it. Which bill is Cicillini's Alex? That's the first one the one that prohibits

Transcript:  self-dealing. Self-dealing. You know when most people talk about their objections to big tech  what they're really talking about is an objection to vertical integration massive vertical  integration and the commoditization of data of consumer data. We talked about that before  big tech was the enemy it was data privacy. The issue hasn't really changed we've just changed  the wrapper. It's still about what those companies are doing with the data that they're receiving  especially since they tend to own everything from shelf to consumer. That's I mean Alex has alluded  to this that's really tricky to regulate because how do you get rid of those ill effects without

So Cicillini's is a really good example because that's very much what  the EU went against. They were fighting Google shopping remember over the fact that they would  self-deal that they would promote and it was very it's actually very hard to demonstrate  that Google's doing that.

Google says what we're look all search is supposed to do  is give people the results they expect they want and it just turns out if the best result is a  YouTube result we're going to show that. Right. It's kind of hard to demonstrate that they're  doing that in their own interest as opposed to in the interests of the users. I'd hate to see.  I don't want to have to use Bing. I like Bing.

Transcript:  All right well we'll just I guess we'll watch these as they make their way through  Congress. It does seem to me that the climate has very much changed and there is this urge  to regulate and I have to say it chills me a little bit because I do enjoy the benefits.  Like you Nicholas I'm a fan. I understand we want privacy etc. My fear always has been with the  the really hardcore privacy advocates is that they're not going to merely ensure privacy for  themselves. They're going to ensure that I who don't care am not going to be able to buy these  things that they don't want. In other words they're going to end up ruining it for us all. So I think  you should have the right to be private. I think you should have the right to but I fear that the  end result will be we'll lose a lot of things that are really interesting and valuable out

Transcript:  of technology including things like Amazon Echo. To me the shift is incredible. Like it was  everyone the iPhone was announced in 2007 like who cared about technology back like nerds did.  Go even further back. I was reminiscing earlier today I went to J&R which was a big  New York City. I was there for the first HD broadcast. I believe it was in 1998. It was  like a New York Jets game. Nobody cared about tech then. And it was really the 2016 election  and obviously that happened. But to me as someone who's been monitoring this industry as a fan  since a kid and professionally for 15 years the complete shift from like who cares about tech to  public enemy number one is just incredible to me really. By the way J&R is gone. They are.

They  can use the tech. They don't understand how the tech works. They don't understand how to build  the tech. They don't understand what goes into the tech. Well neither does Congress so they're a good  company. But we need that's actually that's a good point. We want real geeks. People who actually  know what what goes into the tech.

Transcript:  I see I feel like we're looking at people and they're frothing at the mouth. They're angry for  various reasons but I don't think that that leads to a reasoned outcome. No. And I admit there's  room for a reasoned outcome. We definitely want more privacy data. Portability is a great idea  and really when we need these companies have gotten very powerful. But I think to some degree  it's also just because they're very successful and they're too rich. Jeff Bezos is too rich. We  don't like that. And then some of it's political. They have an unproven conservative bias  and that kind of thing. And I think it's so much frothing at the mouth that it's not going to lead  to something. It's not going to be a scalpel. It's going to be a bludgeon. And I don't think  that that's a good thing in the long run. And I think all you have to do is again look at the  pandemic without technology we'd be in the middle ages. I remember I was at TechCrunch from 2007

So that's like where I'm coming from.  I was very much like writing about privacy like all the time. Nobody was reading these articles.  That was not a thing that like the not even the TechCrunch audience cared about. But now you know  it is very salient and very important. Obviously you know it's I think people get it now more.

This is all about  his business interests. The journal the Wall Street Journal hates Google. But he doesn't  pretend to act in anyone's interest but his own. Well I know we all know what his motivations are.  There's a mythos of but when he comes marching in with his money and his lobbyists and says yeah  Congress we ought to pass that that should scare people. That's not a good thing. That's not that  doesn't it's not going to lead to reasoned legislation. The cool thing about democracy

Transcript:  though is that we have the bills that have been introduced and now we get to have a discussion  about them. I agree. And then everything is going to come out. This isn't going to be a five week or  a six week process. It's going to be a months long probably years long process until we get somewhere.  If we ever get somewhere. Let me ask you. Go ahead. Go ahead. I'll just say one last thing.  Yeah I want to tell a quick story. So back in the day a long time ago I was an intern for a member  of Congress who's since went to jail Anthony Weiner. But I did get a chance to go down to DC  for a week to see what it was like in the office and they had members of Congress address  the interns and just give like their perspective of what was going on in the in politics at the  time. And I happened to be there for the week where Mitch McConnell spoke and McConnell I think he  was citing a previous politician but talked about how you know tea kettle was like a good lead into  this. The house is like a boiling hot cup of tea. Oh yeah. And the center is the sauce of the  cools the cup. Right. Yeah. So what we just saw. Yes exactly. We saw all that frothy tea come out  of the house. Now we go to the process where the liquid spills out of the cup. It goes into the  saucer and then we see what we end up with. So I don't think this is going to be you know I don't  think we're going to end up seeing that the bills that were introduced introduced passed into law  with the language that they were written in because at the end of the day I think you guys  are spot on. We're talking about a very productive industry. We're talking about five companies that  are the engine in some ways of the American economy. And I don't think ever before in history  have you had a government come out come after a productive industry like this with a set of laws  that have been introduced that would rein them in you know so dramatically. So I do think eventually  we're going to end up getting to a place where these laws make sense. I think that's the history

Transcript:  makes me very nervous mostly because I don't think it's being lobbied. The people who are  in favor of this in many cases are in favor of the wrong reasons. It's not really what they're  talking about. And then and then and this was the question I was going to ask you Alex because you  have a newsletter. Companies like Apple jumping on this privacy bandwagon. In fact Google's jumping  on it too to some degree which is kind of interesting because it's good for business not  because they really care about people's privacy. And you know I think what Google and Apple and  you watch this because Facebook's going to eventually come along and realize it's good  publicity to say you're pro privacy. All three companies have first party data that is second  to none. So they're not sacrificing anything from their own point of view. But Apple for instance  introduced now in Apple mail the ability to turn off hidden pixels for trackers which is going to  affect you I think in your newsletter. They also you know and I feel like turning off the ID for  advertisers they didn't turn off but surfacing that. Yeah it's I think it's pandering a little  bit to people saying knowing that people are kind of without thinking as a well I don't want any  advertising tracking me without really thinking about the consequences of this is pandering to  people who say I want everything for free and I'm not a willing in any way to support an ecosystem  that pays for it is not really good business in the long run. It's good for Apple but it's not  good business in the long run. So I bothers me a lot that companies like Apple are making hay on  this because it's good for their business. It's window dressing. I think it's window dressing. I  really do. Alex you've said that you're not too worried I know Casey Newton quoted you in his  platformer newsletter. You're not too worried about what losing those tracking pixels going to do to

Start time: 2262.90
End time: 2306.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  your newsletter. Correct and by the way I just want to lead in by saying I agree with you 100%.  Like you notice when Apple started to use privacy as like a core part of its marketing  it's when people started to buy iPhones less often because it used to be that you want to  upgrade every year or two or you know the iPhone was so much better than any Android so you would  stick with and what you'd stick with the iPhone then when that started to dissipate a little bit  and they started to you know face some real competition and they had you know they had a  slower upgrade cycle now all of a sudden they're using privacy as a marketing tool to try to make  sure that you stay within their ecosystem you don't switch and you buy new phones. Yeah and I  think that's a little bit ridiculous although it's up to it's their prerogative I think but

And they make how many billions a year from Google on the default search  maybe six eight billion I don't know exactly the number but clearly they don't have you know that  mentioned reservations against Google otherwise they wouldn't make this deal so but in terms of  my newsletter and the pixel blocking I'm totally okay with it first of all I don't I'm not 100%  sure how many people actually are opening the newsletter on Apple mail I mean I don't have that  data but generally like I don't know I I have an iPhone but I use Gmail app on my phone so.

Transcript:  numbers come on guys it's funny no tracking on Apple but it just so happens to be that all the  tracking says Apple is the leader yeah anyway that's the story for another time but I will say that  like if you are a newsletter that sends on volume you don't really know your your readers they won't  answer user survey then you're in trouble if you're a newsletter that that is focused on building  a relationship with an audience they'll answer user surveys like I know your audience does Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well look we do we do show them what the opens are yeah so you're gonna lose that you're not  gonna know actually so I have I have a few things to say about that so first of all I think the list  size mentioned matters a lot more the number of subscribers a total number of opens I mean if you're  you're not going to be like you know you don't say I'm looking for a newsletter that has you know

Start time: 2476.24
End time: 2494.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  6 000 opens maybe that should be the way your advertisers like you Alex that's the difference  and they say oh well he's got he's got 10 000 subscribers placement but I tell you what our  advertisers say to me all the time is well how do you know they listened because we know how many  people download but how do you know they listened right so here's the other that yeah so here's the

Start time: 2494.52
End time: 2529.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  other thing I think is interesting so oftentimes we'll have the majority of the views of the  newsletter come via web because the people who subscribe to the newsletters they're the evangelists  of the newsletter they're the people who are in this tight-knit community that we have  called big technology right and so they'll open every week and then what happens is they'll share  it and it will end up on you know news aggregator websites like hacker news or tech meme or wherever  it may be and so oftentimes we'll have a view count that doubles or higher yeah does more yeah  than the actual number of subscribers because we have that dedicated of a subscriber list but

Start time: 2529.62

Start time: 2536.34
End time: 2562.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean so I don't think that it's going to be what I'm trying to say is I don't think it's going to  be the end of metrics I don't think that there are people that are coming to the newsletter because  they want to hit a large untargeted group of people they know they're going to end up hitting  a premium audience with big technology they know they're going to end up hitting a good number of  people and that's what does it for them yeah I mean that's probably why our advertisers stay with

Start time: 2562.76
End time: 2583.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  us but when we build them we build them on the number of impressions I mean that's how much  that's what the cost of an ad on on most media is based on the number of people who see it  and there's rare that you'll have an advertiser that says I don't care how many people see the  ad I just want to support you there's also there's um there are proxies that you can use also in

Start time: 2583.66
End time: 2636.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  terms of the way that people engage with the ad now we're not we don't go out pitching big technology  as a performance newsletter like we don't do any cta deals but we definitely include like some sort  of uh url where we can see yeah we do that too but with the advertisers that's direct response yeah  look is it gonna is it gonna hurt me more or is it gonna hurt her like a junk email that goes to  you know I don't know a couple million people whose whose emails they bought from some list  I think those are the people that might get slammed by this but if you're collateral damage  I'm not going to be happy about it well I think it will likely drive advertisers to say what were  we doing in the first place and what are the environments where we can get next to good  context as opposed to volume and that's where I think we'll end up but yeah I saw the update and  I didn't try to you know sell the business immediately I think no and I think you're

Start time: 2637.48
End time: 2642.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right not to but I think advertisers are crack addicts and the crack they're addicted to is

Start time: 2642.22
End time: 2677.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  met as they love metrics audience information okay and maybe this pushes you know this is sort  of what I said in Casey's newsletter I do agree that there's been an unfortunate addiction to  performance metrics in the advertising industry and it's impossible it's it's important to report  some of you know how you how you perform but ultimately advertising is best when it's done  in context with a good message next to a good brand I agree that's the stuff that actually works  and so maybe this does drive them toward doing more of that in which case Leo I think your  business is in even better shape and I hope mine is too we're moving more toward

Transcript:  the consumer reports model than we are towards the advertising based model because that's why  we started Club Twitter I wish you know when we first started Twitter I was consumer reports was  my model they don't take advertising and they buy all the products they review and I would have loved  to have done that it just didn't turn out to be you've got most of the products I try to buy  everything but you know other other hosts need to get loaners and frankly we tried to do it without  advertising there wasn't enough support I'm hoping Club Twitter which is you know our way  of trying to monetize and offer people ad free content which incidentally as a result is tracker  free succeeds I but I think honestly people don't want ads and they don't want to pay for it they  basically want everything for free and and this is in a way pandering to an audience that says  look I want 100% people like you Robert I want 100% privacy I'm going to fuzz everything  nobody's going to know everything about anything about me and I want it all for free except see I

Transcript:  there is a debate whether advertisers benefit from all that ad tech whether it actually helps them  reach the audience they want whether it makes the ads more successful and I've seen a lot of  evidence that it doesn't but doesn't matter trying to say yeah you know I agree with you  I agree with I think you're right but the question isn't whether we're right the question is whether  advertisers buy it and they I don't think they do and I think that what's going to happen in my  business is that Spotify is going to completely dominate and because they have first party info  and if with a you know that's why they can give Joe Rogan 100 million dollars is because Joe  Rogan will be exclusive on Spotify which means you'll have to listen on the app and they will  be able to tell advertisers not just when you listen and how much you listen but who you are  and what your credit card number is and where you live and all that stuff so first first party  information the kind of information Facebook and Google and Apple and Spotify have is is now going  to be completely dominant in the industry and I think that that's very bad at least in journalism  it's very bad because you're not going to get diverse the diversity of voices that you used to  have so I think ad tech is the baleful influence it ruined blogging it's about to ruin podcasting  that's just my opinion but I feel like that's a bad trend and I understand where it's coming  from is people's desire not to be tracked and you know I use I use all the ad blocking ad tracking  technologies too so I'm just as guilty as anybody the brave browser everything is blocked out yeah

Transcript:  probably everybody who's listening said oh i know finally microsoft's gonna start over redesign  windows make it robust reliable secure mit technology no actually was it was uh steve  gibson our security guy said there's one reason for the ransomware crisis one reason alone windows  it's so freaking insecure now i'm not sure i think there's other reasons but uh i understand his  point i thought here's an opportunity that's the only reason you should update windows 10 is because  you're gonna start over they're not starting over they're not changing anything except how it looks  and so i'm asking paul and mary joe our windows hosts why then do this and they came up with the  only cogent reason i could think of last year the pc industry had a banner year because everybody  had to go out and buy a computer for the kid who's got to do zoom classes and and now i'm  working at home so i need a better computer so the computer sales were the best they've been  in a decade this year of course it's gonna tank right because everybody bought a computer it's  gonna die the pc industry is gonna be dead also because no one can get components yeah can't  exactly you can't even get one if you wanted one so what microsoft paul and mary joe's think that  the reason microsoft's doing windows 11 is because historically that's what sells computers in the  windows world people don't buy the next version of windows they buy a new computer to run the next  version of windows and they continue to use that version of windows until they buy another computer  so microsoft's basically artificially supporting the pc industry because there's no way anybody's  going to buy a new computer unless there's some reason to and this reason is going to be windows

Transcript:  this stuff didn't work it was because of the asymptomatic nature in the beginning of the  disease so if you um you're not going to test positive right away you're not going to have any  symptoms so once that happens the whole idea of contact tracing is kind of off the table because  think about how many people are going to come in contact with every day when you have no idea so  you have five days in your life you don't know you have covid you test positive for covid how many  contacts you know if you're a somewhat busy person it could be dozens you know uh or maybe even above  a hundred people that you've come in contact with let's say when grocery shopping right so now are  all those people going to have to quarantine like it just became a point because the nature of this  disease that if you are going to actually put contact tracing into place you might as well just  shut down you know all society for a couple of weeks and then resume after that yeah because  this never got to the place where we're going to do that so if you're going to like it's totalitarian

mesa like much of the  country is going through a drought we're going to serious drought here in california  uh some of the city council is saying hold on there 1.25 million gallons of water  and it doesn't benefit mesa particularly there are 1800 data centers all over the country  many of them using a huge amount of water virginia tech estimates one fifth of data centers draw  water from moderate to highly stressed watersheds mostly out here in the west  there's a cost there's a cost to that google search to that iCloud storage  that it goes beyond the couple of bucks a month you're paying for it  spending a global data center infrastructure will reach 200 billion dollars a year according to  gartner that's up six percent and then should go up three to four percent annually over the next  three years at the same time as drought goes crazy the typical data center actually uses three  to five million gallons of water that's the same amount a day same amount of water as a city

Transcript:  locating them underwater or putting them in areas of the world where natural cooling can be taken  advantage of but if you drop a data center in the middle of arizona there ain't no cool place  and the evaporative coolers use up a ton of water where does the water go in the air it goes in the  air because you've got these huge towers that are running like cascading waterfalls of water and as  it evaporates it cools and you can pipe it back into the data center you could do traditional  closed loop cooling but that's on an order of 10x to 20x more expensive because it's way more  energy intensive it's cheaper for them just to let the water evaporate this is depressing yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you're right so bitcoin is easy to identify and attack because it's something that a lot of people  don't use and so therefore it's the bad guy right and yes it is super inefficient it uses up a lot  of energy then the energy is essentially the capital that you're putting into the system  but for you to have always on access to everything that you want requires all these data centers to  be spun up at all times of the day requires all the massive amounts of infrastructure to be  connected to each other so you're participating everyone's participating in these hyper scale
