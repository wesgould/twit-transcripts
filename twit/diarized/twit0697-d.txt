Transcript:  She can borrow my bike if she wants.  You see my e-bike?  Do you like that?  The Super 73 came.  How is it?  It's not a bike.  It's got pedals.  But what it really is is an electric moped that's disguised as a bicycle.  You can't see it because of where it is, but Harry can see it.  It's really fun.  Also with us, got to welcome him back.  We haven't seen Michael in a while.  Michael Nunez, Deputy Tech Editor at Mashable in the Mashable offices in beautiful Manhattan.  Hello, Michael.  Hey, thanks for having me.  Good to see you.  And we want to welcome a new member of the panel, but I'm thrilled to have her because  her name has come up many times in the last months on Twitter.  She's a staff writer at Wired, Paris Martino.  Remember that Lashify story we were talking about, the Instagram influencers?  That's Paris.  She's done great work.  If you just look at her stuff on Wired, it's great to have you.  Thank you for joining us.  I don't know.  I almost don't know where to begin.  There's so many boring stories.  And I could start with the crazy story of Elon Musk.  Oh, let's do it.  That's a Wired story.  This is not yours, I should say.  Charles Duhigg, who also does a great job.  Dr. Elon and Mr. Musk, life inside Tesla's production hell.  I'm a fan of Tesla.  I drive a Model X. But now after reading this, I'm really second guessing whether I should  buy another Tesla.  He sounds worse than Steve Jobs, if that's possible.

Start time: 247.92

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He sounds the same in person as he is on Twitter.  Which isn't always true of everybody.

Start time: 252.16
End time: 352.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  The crazy Elon on Twitter, he's like that.  Duhigg's talking about the Gigafactory and problems of the Gigafactory.  And about 10 o'clock on a Saturday evening, an angry Musk was examining one of the production  line's mechanized modules, trying to figure out what was wrong, when the young, excited  engineer that he talks about earlier in the article was brought over to assist him.  The guy was really excited.  I'm going to meet Elon.  I'm here.  I'm working at the Gigafactory.  He'd been living out of a suitcase, putting in 13 hour days, seven days a week over the  last year was his first real job.  And now a colleague had tracked him down to say, Elon Musk wanted his help.  So he came running over.  Musk shouts at him, hey buddy.  He doesn't even know his name.  This doesn't work.  Musk shouted at the engineer, according to someone who had heard the conversation.  Did you do this?  The engineer was taken aback.  He'd never met Musk before.  Musk didn't even know the engineer's name.  The young man wasn't certain what exactly Musk was asking him or why he sounded so angry.  You mean program the robot, the engineer said, or design that tool?  Did you effing do this?  Musk asked him again.  I'm not sure what you're referring to, the engineer replied apologetic.  You're an effing idiot.  Musk shouted back.  Get the eff out and don't come back.  And he was fired.  Gone.  The entire conversation had lasted less than a minute.  And on and on and on.  And it really makes you wonder, holy cow, how can this company survive this guy?

Start time: 357.84
End time: 396.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What really stuck out to me is, yeah, how can this company survive this guy?  Where would Tesla be if it was a place that was not a living nightmare like this?  I feel like we often have this, or the tech community at large kind of idealize these  eccentric genius CEO personalities, whether it's Elon Musk or Steve Jobs.  But it seems like Tesla engineers or just as a workplace in general, it would be much  better and perhaps more productive.  These people didn't have to feel like they were walking on eggshells every single minute  working with this, I guess, eccentric madman.

Start time: 399.78
End time: 406.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want to honor him.  I think you're going to do that, Michael, so I'll let you.  But I mean, Tesla might not even exist without Elon Musk, too, right?

Start time: 406.88
End time: 432.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I think it's great.  Like Elon Musk.  But one part said about this article is that a lot of people praised Elon Musk for being  a great boss for a visionary.  Yeah, the things that he brought to Tesla and the things that he did with Tesla cannot  be understated.  But like, where would Tesla be if his team felt support or even less than support just  the fact that they weren't going to be fired if they happened to have a conversation with  their CEO?

Start time: 434.13
End time: 434.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead, Michael.  Right.

Start time: 435.58
End time: 522.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think Tesla absolutely wouldn't exist without Elon.  I think he often gets a little bit more credit than he deserves because I think Tesla realistically  doesn't have a very big edge in any of the technologies that they're producing.  So a lot of people can make electric engines.  Tesla does batteries really well.  That's their big bet.  So if Tesla can make batteries better than anyone in the world, that company will continue  to exist.  If they can't, then then they'll lose their edge.  And so it's a lot of people getting really excited about battery technology, which is  kind of funny to me.  But I think ultimately, Tesla is a company that's kind of a cult of personality.  You know, people go there to work for Elon Musk.  The people that I've talked to that have been that have worked closely with Elon have  said that it's extremely difficult, that that he tends to choose favorites and he quickly  tires of those favorites and and finds ways to excise them from the company or from his  inner circle.  And it's really, you know, it's an anxiety ridden company.  I think it's it sounds very exhausting.  But also, you know, the thing that I've learned over the course of my career is that companies  can operate this way.  And so actually, this is just this is just bad leadership or it's a type of leadership.  And some people tend to rule things based on fear and based on, you know, whether people  are drinking the Kool-Aid, whether people really buy into into the leader's idea.  So Steve Jobs would be a prime example of that.  I've certainly worked at places that are run like that.

Start time: 523.92

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I think Cashmore that kind of crazy.

Start time: 527.59
End time: 556.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, he cashmore is the sweetest guy I've ever met.  Yeah, he is extremely nice.  But but but there are other places definitely in media that are that are run by these types  of personalities.  And I'm sure like even in the you know, maybe an easier way to say this is during the during  the golden era of magazines, I think you saw even bigger personalities that were that were  running a lot of a lot of big a lot of big, you know, the big magazines.  But but yeah, my point is that Thomas Edison somebody the chairman saying, do you think

Start time: 556.76
End time: 561.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thomas Edison was it was as hard to work for as Steve Jobs or Elon Musk?

Start time: 562.50
End time: 563.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On a bad day, I would imagine so.

Start time: 564.56
End time: 593.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But, you know, I wonder if there's a toxic culture that is unique to Silicon Valley,  because I mean, so one one response from Tesla's general counsel to this Wired story,  there are a lot of people outside Tesla who will sort of sugarcoat what they actually  think of your performance or of an issue because they don't want to have that hard  conversation.  Elon Musk is someone who puts a lot of effort into forcing himself to be fully honest.  This is what Reed Hastings is kind of dinged for sometimes at Netflix for radical honesty.

Start time: 594.26
End time: 636.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's such a thing as being radically honest, but there's also such a thing as  pointlessly treating people terribly.  I think it seems like Tesla did not really deny the substance of anything in the story.  They just said that the context wasn't always there.  That's how we run it.  I mean, more and more. I've been reading all these stories about CBS, which seemed to have  a culture.  Less Moonves.  I'm thinking that even several levels below Moonves, the theory was that if you were  talented, it was OK if you treated your colleagues horribly.  More and more, I think there is no excuse for cultures that allow anybody, including  the CEO, to treat other people horribly.  And that is a distinct thing from making hard decisions or holding people to a high  standard of competence.

Start time: 637.86
End time: 675.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and I also don't I wouldn't conflate radical transparency with with exactly what  Harry just said.  Treating people poorly.  So I've worked at Gawker Media, Embrace Radical Transparency, Bridgewater Capital of  Hedge Fund is famously run by a guy named Ray Dalio, who embraces radical transparency.  Both of those places are difficult to work at.  And you might be confronted with with with some of your weaknesses regularly.  But I don't think that's the same type of thing as like throwing a tantrum.  It sounds like Elon Musk is motivated by.  He I think he lets his emotions get the best of him more frequently than he'd probably  like to admit.

Start time: 676.00
End time: 680.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, if Elon was a guy on the assembly line, he would not be allowed to treat people  as badly as he's allowed.

Start time: 680.76
End time: 689.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But we have heard stories about racism and other problems on the assembly line as well.  There's you know, it starts at the top.  But I'm not saying Elon's a racist, but there are problems in the.

Start time: 689.94
End time: 696.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which is one reason why you don't want people at the top to behave like jackasses,  because it becomes part of your culture.  Yeah.

Start time: 696.92
End time: 730.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, especially because it kind of strengthens this culture where there is no  transparency, where perhaps an employee, any employee who I guess is an Elon could  not bring up an issue that they see or be able to, let's say Tesla hires some really  smart people.  And if any of them had perhaps an idea that conflicted with a direct order, I guess  from Elon or someone above them, this sort of culture negates any opportunity for them  to bring up what they think could, I guess, be one of the next best Tesla features.

Start time: 735.26
End time: 750.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The 60 Minutes piece on Sunday was pretty negative.  Right. I mean, that's kind of that's kind of and even Musk himself pointed out that,  you know, 10 years ago, they did a piece.  I mean, I was the Messiah.  What happened?  Well, he's a much greater antagonist.

Start time: 750.58
End time: 755.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And he made more provocative comments in this interview purposely, I think.

Start time: 756.12
End time: 800.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, he said, I talked to him for five hours.  They put the most provocative 15 minutes on.  I see.  That's TV.  You got to be careful what you say.  Elon says he's been misunderstood and mistreated by journalists.  And maybe he has.  And I bought a Tesla.  I don't know if there would be an electric car industry if he hadn't paved the way.  And of course, now governments trying to eliminate emissions are trying to move towards electric.  So its timing was good.  You can't say it's entirely him.  But I think he is a visionary and I think he did have a vision and I think he wanted to do good things.  And this reminds me a lot of Steve Jobs, who had both bad and good.  Right. We're old enough to live through that.

Start time: 801.16
End time: 805.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was certainly accused of very similar behavior at his worst.

Start time: 805.54
End time: 807.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, very similar.

Start time: 807.70
End time: 815.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, he also had days where he held people to an impossibly high standard and it was a great thing.  And he probably did it in a way that was not terrible, just hard.  Yeah.

Start time: 817.21
End time: 844.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I don't really mean to pick on Elon.  I'm more interested in if there's this sense in Silicon Valley that you have to have a toxic culture to get things done.  I mean, people felt like people flocked around Steve Jobs and put up with the difficulty of working at Apple because they thought they were changing the world.  I imagine it's the same at SpaceX and Tesla.  You're there because you're making a big difference and you're going to put up with the tough conditions because that's maybe what it takes to make something insanely great.

Start time: 847.39
End time: 917.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I tend to disagree with that.  I mean, look at it's just like try to imagine Tim Cook doing what we've just read about Elon Musk in that Wired feature story.  Or think about Sundar Pichai doing acting in the same way.  I think you can run a competitive business and be a reasonable human being.  And there's so many examples of balanced tech leaders.  Bill Gates, I think, is not running through manufacturing facilities and yelling at people.  I'm sure there were periods at Microsoft that were very difficult and had high demands on a lot of the employees.  But I think at the end of the day, Elon seems a little bit more self-absorbed than these guys.  And I think he wants it to be a cult of personality.  He wants to be seen as someone that has a lot of money and a lot of brilliant ideas.  And those two things may be true, but I think he's also become annoyed that he's being held accountable for his actions.  I mean, to say that in the 60 Minutes interview, for example, to say, I do not respect the SEC after you've been investigated by them.

Start time: 920.46
End time: 923.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You may not respect them, but they have the power to fine you $20 million for a tweet.

Start time: 925.00
End time: 932.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's harder to get away with this stuff if you're not a founder or a pseudo-founder as Elon is with Tesla.

Start time: 932.42
End time: 934.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He didn't actually found Tesla, but he made it work.

Start time: 935.62
End time: 947.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are tons of stories about Tim Cook not being warm and fuzzy and being hard-nosed and incredibly demanding.  But I haven't heard any about the bleed-in to him being unpleasant for the sake of being unpleasant.

Start time: 948.26
End time: 992.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Duhigg also has an article in The Atlantic this month about American rage and the un-stole story of how anger became the dominant emotion in our politics and personal lives.  And we were talking before the show began, and I think we've lost Paris.  We're going to try to get her back.  We lost her. We're trying to get her back.  We're getting her back, just as I said.  We lost her. We're trying to get her back.  And we were talking before the show.  Poor Paris has to, the nature of her work at Wired is to visit Twitter regularly, even 4chan and all the other pockets of rage on the internet.  It really does feel like we're more angry these days.  And I also feel like it's somewhat because we've been given tools.  Anger has been weaponized by places like Twitter.  You like Twitter, though. You're not a...

Start time: 993.16
End time: 1001.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I acknowledge all of Twitter's problems and have written about a lot of them.  My own little bubble within Twitter is a pleasant place to be, and it's not something I do grudgingly.

Start time: 1002.02
End time: 1004.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. You like it, but you're in a bubble, you admit.

Start time: 1004.38
End time: 1022.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, yes. I totally acknowledge it.  The fact that I like Twitter does not mean that everybody likes Twitter or even can like Twitter.  It's like any other medium.  It's very complex, and it depends on how you intersect with it and who you're talking to and the topics you talk about and who you are and who people perceive you to be.

Start time: 1023.66
End time: 1040.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Paris, when you were gone, I'm glad we got you back.  We were talking about Duhigg's other article in this month in Atlantic about the real roots of American rage and how angry everybody is.  And I mentioned that you have to live in the cesspools of anger on the internet as part of...

Start time: 1040.12
End time: 1065.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, every day.  On Twitter, Reddit, VOTE, GAB, 4chan, it's...  You're handing out on GAB too?  You got to. I mean, I try to hang out there.  I have a couple of tools that monitor GAB for a couple of key words, but I think a large part about writing about online extremism is just keeping tabs in a variety of different parts of the internet and generally the worst parts of the internet.

Start time: 1065.94
End time: 1071.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it your sense that it's worse today than it's been?  Or is this...  I think that it's...

Start time: 1073.18
End time: 1107.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a hard question.  And I think it's because when we say worse, we can see worse things more easily.  But I think that these bad things have always been there or these awful conversations and this hate has always existed.  It's just now that because of the proliferation of social media and the ease of access we have to all these different mediums, these sort of groups and the hateful rhetoric that they spouse, they are much more high profile and you can access them by just searching.

Start time: 1108.84
End time: 1128.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think if you go back to news groups in the 80s or 90s, you will find parallels, but a tiny percentage of the people in the world were in news groups.  They weren't the least bit mainstream.  Yeah, exactly.  And therefore people weren't aware of it and it did not become national news stories and the president of the United States wasn't diving in to it in the way that happens today.

Start time: 1130.38
End time: 1168.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I didn't even consider the president element, but I think, yeah, without a doubt, it's easier to broadcast these ideas.  I think it's easier to recruit vulnerable members of society to some of these causes.  I think there are more, you know, it's spilling over into the real world now.  So people are acting on these conspiracies such as Pizzagate or, you know, there are probably other better examples.  But to me, it seems...  QAnon?  Yeah, QAnon.  I think that, I think, you know, without a doubt, the hate is rising in America.  I think that it's more accepted than it's been, at least in my lifetime.  Here's my theory.

Start time: 1168.80
End time: 1246.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want to try this out on you all.  You know, when you go, there's signs on bridges in some bridges in this country that when troops are marched across bridges to break step,  not to march in lockstep, because their step will resonate and actually cause the bridge to get more and more resonate and break it.  Whereas if they don't march in lockstep, there's no resonance created.  My theory is that anger, and Duhigg talks about this in his Atlantic article.  Anger is self-reinforcing.  It's not something that...  There are things you can do that get it out of your system and then it goes away.  But anger and revenge create a vicious circle that they amplify themselves.  And that's always been the case.  But what my theory is that there's a resonating frequency that Twitter and Facebook,  and to a lesser degree, because they're lesser used gab and places like that, are acting as a resonating agent.  They're getting it to amplify to the breaking point.  And so it's not that the anger hasn't always existed.  It's that there are now in our society things that are amplifying it to the point where it's actually becoming a more and more rapid cycle of anger.

Start time: 1246.36
End time: 1264.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right? Isn't that what you see on Twitter?  I mean, social media amplifies everything.  Actually, social media often amplifies things in a positive way.  I think people just don't pay quite as much attention to it because there's nothing to worry about.  And arguably, it can amplify lies and hate more powerfully than it amplifies things.

Start time: 1264.58
End time: 1282.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The problem is we're attracted to this.  Right?  And so systems like Facebook that are engineered to reinforce that behavior, to increase engagement,  are automatically reinforcing it because that's what engages you.

Start time: 1282.84
End time: 1290.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People stay on longer if they think that they are among a group of people that think just like them.  And that's been one thing that I have.

Start time: 1290.60
End time: 1298.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why doesn't somebody do a happy news site or a happy news newspaper?  Because no one will read it.  Because no one would read it.  Because that's not what...

Start time: 1298.40
End time: 1398.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People love to be outraged.  People love to be furious.  People, I think, stems because they like feeling like they're part of this kind of in-group.  That's one thing that I've noticed when I've been studying, I guess, online conspiracies and online extremism  is that the ones that stay around for the longest seem to share the same note that their adherents have this sense of community.  It's them against the world or some other group.  Yes.  I guess in the case of QAnon, why I think that it has existed for almost a year now,  or I guess over a year now, is that the base factor of it is that, OK, everybody out in the world is foolish.  They don't understand.  It's the deep state.  We are the only ones that are knowledgeable and we are the smart ones.  And by putting yourself...  Yeah.  Yeah. And that's why they continue to stay around.  That's why also when it comes to these sort of hate groups, it's an in-group, out-group thing.  And these social media platforms reward that primal part in our brain that wants to constantly be engaged in a war for all eternity,  you know, a war between us and others.  It's way more exciting than real life if you are existing in this fake fantasy world that's constantly got you amped up,  where you're constantly fighting against deep, shadowy, deep state forces or against some other race that you think is inferior  and trying to take away your rights in the case of, I guess, white supremacist groups, things like that.  These platforms are built to pry into our deepest urges.

Start time: 1398.84
End time: 1409.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So is there something we should do about this?  I mean, I don't think we should shut down Twitter and Facebook.  Should Facebook take a response?  See, Facebook's not going to put good news in the news feed because that's not their business.

Start time: 1409.76
End time: 1421.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they sort of have moved a tiny bit in that direction because they said they're going to put less news in your news feed.  More local.  And give you more stuff from your friends and family, which could be awful, but at least there's a decent chance.

Start time: 1421.92
End time: 1448.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you know what the side effect of that was is in that announcement, I think Mark Zuckerberg or whoever it was that wrote the press release,  when they said they're going to de-emphasize local news, they said instead we're going to promote,  yeah, like you said, posts from your family, friends, but also things in groups.  And do you know what? Since January when they made this announcement has become one of the hottest places for disinformation and extremism, Facebook groups.  That's where the guillégeon protests in France.

Start time: 1449.30
End time: 1459.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We talked about this last week. This is a perfect example.  I know French people are always angry, right?  I mean, there's a multi-hundred, multi-century history of barricades and riots.

Transcript:  And there are some genuine points to the guillégeon protests, but there's also a large part of it that has arisen just from unbridled rage,  conspiracy theories that has come out of these Facebook groups with hundreds of thousands.  One of them even has over a million members.

Transcript:  Yeah, and they're local because they're all by départment.  But the thing I find interesting is this is always so this is actually France is probably a really good test tube for this because they've always had protests,  though at Grand Boulevard or Paris were designed so they couldn't be barricaded.  That's why there's boulevards.  That's why Halsman built the boulevards is so that they could easily unbarricade them and troops could march in and break up the protests.  But I mean, if you've ever seen Les Miserables, you know, I mean, this is this is a longstanding history.  But what's unique about the Yellow Jacket protests is that if you ask somebody, they can't really pinpoint the reason for their anger.  It's like a lot. It's like it's a generalized upset.

Transcript:  Yeah, it's an amorphous kind of ball of rage.  It ostensibly began because it was tied to the gas tax hike that was supposed to come in January.  But then Macron said, OK, we're doing with that or at least going to suspend it for six months.  And then two days later, France had the biggest protest it's had ever related to these the guillégeon yellow vests.  And it has continued to spiral.

Transcript:  I wonder I just if there I don't know how you would fix this because it is a human tendency.  And social networks and the Internet in general reflect humans. Good and bad.  We know that. I don't know if you I don't.  Does it need a fix? Does it need a cure?  Maybe I always thought when Harry and I are of the era where we were very optimistic in the 90s about the Internet,  the Internet was going to change the world for the good because it was friction free commerce.  People would be able to express themselves. No more gatekeepers.  It was a democratizing medium.  And one of the things I said is sunlight is the best disinfectant that yes, there are hate groups and they're hidden and they're under rocks.  And so the Internet is going to give these kids draw these people out in the open and then sunlight would disinfect that we would all reckon.  Maybe that's what's going on. Maybe now. Right.  Maybe we've all as a society, maybe we're just seeing the snakes and vipers under the rocks and saying, oh, that's horrible.  And maybe now over the next decade or two, things will get better.

Transcript:  OK, I mean, sunlight disinfects.  Yes. And there are a lot of cases where, yes, you want to expose these sort of ills, but also sunlight amplifies and giving a spotlight to something exposes it to more people.  And while this is one thing I've been thinking about a bit as this year is finished, we've gotten so much better as society, as journalists, as platforms at identifying disinformation or extremism.  And but we haven't figured out yet how to identify it and deal with it in a way that doesn't unduly amplify it or unduly show it to other people.  Because, you know, there's a large trend, I think, in the industry of tech journalism or Internet journalism, whatever you want to call it, of people going through 4chan or some awful part of the Internet and finding a bunch of, I don't know,  let's say, Nazis doing terrible Nazi things or crazy conspiracy theorists and screenshotting it, tweeting it out or writing a story about it.  And while readers or viewers will be like, wow, that's crazy or laugh at it, there's also a large sect of other people who see it and go, hmm, what is this QAnon thing?  Let me Google it and then end up falling into the rabbit hole themselves.  Or same with other extremist beliefs.  We have to find the middle line somewhere between disinfecting and overexposing.

Transcript:  So I guess I think about this in slightly different terms.  I guess for me, it's all about the click based economy and how Twitter and Facebook basically encouraged a lot of different companies to grow over the course of five to ten years.  So I think that that right now the issue is that if you see a post on the Facebook newsfeed from the New York Times and then you see another one from something called the Denver Guardian,  which was a domain that was once registered by Russian operatives, then the layman person or the average person cannot tell the difference between the New York Times article and that Denver Guardian article.  They don't understand why one is more credible than the other.  There's inherent literacy problems in the US and frankly, just education problems.  And so I think people because Facebook treats those links equally, people are reading this type of information and thinking that it looks the same as something that's legitimate and therefore there must be some truth to it.  And a lot of people have a hard time discerning what's fake from what's real, obviously.

Start time: 1773.44

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We don't want to go back to gatekeepers and say, well, the only real news is from the media centers of the country, L.A. and New York and everything else is fake news.  Denver, what could possibly could come out of Denver or your blog or Mashable?  Yeah.  Or, right?  So we don't want to go back to those days where there were a handful of media or do we?

Start time: 1795.78
End time: 1838.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that the invisible hand will solve this problem and that ultimately you're going to have to pay money for good information.  And these these websites that that, you know, this is maybe a little bit weird for someone that's working at Mashable to say, but a lot of these new media companies that deliver free information will likely be less trusted over the course of time.  There are definitely some exceptions to the rule.  I think the larger publishers that that have a history of breaking news and having good information may continue to live on.  But there are dozens and dozens of websites that have millions of followers on Facebook that that that exists through clicks right now.  And I think that that will matter less in the future.  I think that the people I vote with my dollars.

Start time: 1838.44
End time: 1856.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I pay for a subscription to Wired, to Ars Technica, to The New York Times, The Washington Post, to the information.  So it can not in the sense of a traditional gatekeeper, but I reward the ones that I think are quality quality because I know it costs money to make good journalism.  Maybe that's what we need to do.

Start time: 1856.82
End time: 1953.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah. And the people that really care about news typically subscribe to, you know, to to at least one or or multiple publishers.  So I think and that's been the case for a very long time in history.  I think that will, you know, freak free news is going away from from what I can tell.  I don't think that the click based economy will continue to exist.  And I think the news feed will change to reflect that ultimately.  But right now, the issue is that Facebook is is presenting this information in the same exact way.  A New York Times article looks the exact same as something that is written on on some random blog that has been quickly created by a Russian operative.  And so that allowed for misinformation to spread.  It continues to this day.  And I think ultimately people will realize, as used to be the case, you know, when I was when I was in the press,  when I was growing up in the 90s on AOL, you can't trust everything on the Internet.  And so people will that will become the presiding mantra of the newsfeed.  You can't trust everything on Facebook.  And so ultimately, the people that want good information are going to pay for subscriptions to the Times or the Washington Post or Journal or the Information or Wired Magazine.  Or or I think a lot of these digitally native new media publishers will also slowly move behind a paywall and ask for, you know,  there will be a premium version of these services that that give people more insight or or or more information.  So so ultimately, if you want good info, you're going to have to pay for it.  And I think that's basically the case right now.  You know, I think if you talk to people that are making decisions based on the news, like some of the works at a hedge fund or on Wall Street,  they pay for their information. Yeah, they absolutely.

They're already pretty savvy consumers of information by definition and a tiny minority in a tiny minority.  And I'm a little scared that the masses will have even less access to good information.  If everything goes behind a paywall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a very good point.  We the only reason are we're free.  It was Mike Elgin who catalyzed this for me is for democratic reasons.  I want everybody to get the information that we offer.  So we do advertise. I've always done advertising, supported media.  I don't know what the future for advertising, supported media is,  because the problem I'll tell you why it's hard for advertising, supported media.  Google and Facebook is if if you are an advertiser and you can get the kind of  granular information Facebook and Google offers about your ad buy, and it's very efficient,  it just makes it much less interesting to buy media.  And I think that we're already seeing a flight of dollars from media into Google and Facebook,  and they're eating it all up.  And this is something really I mean, this is inside baseball, but I'll say it anyway.  This is a cause for concern because what that means is is are the economics of it  are incentivizing privacy invasion, surveillance capitalism, if you will,  and and de incentivizing reporting information services.

End time: 2123.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Paris, I think you worry about this, too.  I worry about these big companies deciding what's good and what's not good, what's  wholesome and what's not wholesome, which people should hear and what they shouldn't  hear. We can probably all agree that not all, but many of us can agree Infowars is  not a good source.  But I don't know if I want Google to decide what what news I should get.

Start time: 2124.68
End time: 2184.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You think? Yeah, I think it stems from the fact that when we're talking with the  Facebook's and Google's of the world, we view them not as companies with their own  judgment and rules and editorial control baked into their terms of service since  their beginning, but as essential kind of interfaces of the Internet, essential  components of and parts of how we see the world and view and experience  information. And when it gets to a size, something of that size, all of the  questions and answers become much more difficult to even sort out because, OK, yes,  it is. I think it's good that places like Facebook or YouTube have deplatform someone  like Alex Jones or we can all agree to spread that we can agree on that.  But it's also like when you give agree that these companies should have that power,  what stops them from deplatforming someone else or doing something in error or creating  new rules about what sort of content they think is acceptable or not?

Transcript:  And people who love Alex Jones feel totally disenfranchised by that.  Of course, Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, was called on the carpet in Washington,  D.C. this week, spoke to Congress.  Zoe Lofgren, who is his I think his member of Congress, said, well, she's using she was  using this as a faux example.  Why is it that when people search for idiot pictures of Donald Trump show up and Pichai  said, well, but that's us not editorializing.  If you wanted us to stop that, we would have to editorialize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think just before I we hopped on this call, I was looking at the conspiracy theory subreddit  on Reddit just as one does for work.  And the big topic of the day there was the fact that if you Googled it, if you entered in  Google Hillary Clinton, E.M., like as of as you're supposed to type like emails,  no results related to Hillary Clinton emails will pop up in the suggested search bar.  But if you enter the same into all the other search engines, then email related things  will happen. But then somebody in the comments pointed out, if you do the same with  Donald Trump, are you nothing related to Russia pops up in the suggestions?  And it's because Google is trying to walk this line between showing the content that  people are actually searching for and the things that are actually happening.

Start time: 2265.24
End time: 2277.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's troubling because if Google were just doing search results unedited, I  think Hillary Clinton E.M.  should turn up more than emoji and employment, which is all I get.

Start time: 2277.32
End time: 2282.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 2302.52
End time: 2336.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so they made it impossible to search for gorillas or black people.  That I understand.  But this is the problem is if you're a search engine, in theory, you without bias  reflect the state of the Internet, which is biased, which is biased.  That's why you get idiot.  But on the other hand, do we want Google to decide what's true and what's not?  They wield a huge amount of power.  If it's if it's already is Google from in most cases, at least people use Google.

Start time: 2337.26
End time: 2478.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that the idea that there is now becoming some editorializing or that  there is some editorial procedure from places like Google and Facebook is just a  little bit silly because they've always been editorializing.  I think in my you know, the thing that I've sort of advocated for is algorithmic  transparency. I think people deserve to understand why they're seeing things in  the newsfeed, why they're seeing things in Google search.  And that would that would that would, I guess, resolve some of the anxiety around  this. But but you know, but the reality is that even before deplatforming, even  before a lot of this stuff, Facebook was already algorithmically demoting and  prioritizing certain bits of information.  And so, you know, in the case of some of the reporting I did in 2016, we found  that they were giving preferential treatment to 10 publishers, 10 national  news publishers. So the example that I often use is is in the case of the La quan McDonald shooting, there was a famous shooting in Chicago, it became  national news. If the Chicago Tribune or if WGN or if the Chicago Sun Times, all  award winning publishers, if any of those publishers covered that shooting and  broke news on that scandal, it wasn't allowed to show up in the trendy news  feed because it hadn't it hadn't been covered by one of 10 of these national  publishers, which included the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, CNN, and  a lot of East Coast, East Coast entities.  And so the reason why I was interested in that was because I grew up in Chicago, I  expected to work at the Chicago Tribune my entire life.  And I I saw this as part of the reason why local publishers were dying places  like the Baltimore Sun, the Denver Post, the Chicago Tribune.  There's so many good city newspapers across the country that have had  advertising dollars taken from them and because because of Facebook's machine,  because of the way that Facebook runs its business.  And and so in my opinion, it sort of led to the death of a lot of these newspapers  and publishers because they were never allowed to be featured in this in this  trendy news feed. And and and so and so Facebook was giving preferential treatment  to these publishers. I think the the the the bigger you know, I don't think it's  wrong for Facebook to have made that decision, but they didn't disclose it.  Right. They weren't up front with the fact that unless things reached one of  these 10 publishers, it would not be allowed to trend.  And so that's one example.

Transcript:  Are constant. They're being made all the time.  They can't be transparent because they're algorithmic.  We see all the time people saying, look at artificial intelligence as being  mistrained. You can't identify people of color because it's all trained on white  people. And so it's got a huge false positive rate among black people.  I mean, you go you could it's an endless story.  This is the nature of the world we live in.  Is it just, though, that it's always been the nature of the world we live in and we  just now can see it? Or that's my that's the fundamental question for this whole  segment, which we're going to wrap soon, is.  Is this unusual? Is this something new or is this just we know about it now because

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of better? I think there's this idea that there's this some sort of neutral  platform that we're supposed to return back to.  It doesn't exist. There was never did.  I think it's because these social media companies and tech companies from Silicon  Valley, especially kind of pride themselves in the early days on the free and open  Internet and being pro free speech, whatever that meant, but being kind of a  technological digital version of the public square when in reality they're as far  from that as possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's still a weird model where people like Jeff Bezos buys The Washington Post or  Benioff buys Time magazine.  It's the patronage model.  We're going back to Venice in the 16th century where the rich people decided what media  outlets exist purely because they're willing to lose money on them.  I don't know if that's a good model either.  I don't know what. It's hard to say.  There's somebody in the chat room.  I presume Native Geek is a Native American.  He or she writes the protests in North Dakota over the Keystone pipeline went on for  months before anybody paid attention.  Facebook was pivotal in getting Native Americans from across the country to protest  that pipeline. So that's I mean, you can for every negative, there's also a positive  counter example for all of this.  So it's very difficult to say what the right thing to do is.  All I think we ever do here.  It's a little frustrating to me is observe.  And we never we've not yet come up with a solution.  Try as we might.  Let's take a little bit of a break.  Michael Nunez is here from Mashable.  It's great to have you, Deputy Tech Editor.  We're going to talk some tech.  Actually, I'm going to let you get prepared because we're going to talk about that super  micro story. There's new news.  Also, Paris Martino.  She's at Wired. Staff writer there does.  If you get a chance to just search your byline on Wired.  Great story after great story.  You're really doing a fantastic job.  And speaking of great stories, he's the original technologizer, Harry McCracken,  technology editor at Fast Company.  Our show today brought to you by Avnet.  You may not know the name.  I bet you do actually. AVNET.  They make great electronic components, but they want to tell this is I'm really happy  to do this for the holiday season.  And I want to thank Avnet for doing this.  A happy story to make you feel better about the world.  How does a groundbreaking technology incubator debut its latest idea for solving  life's absurdities by leveraging an end to end ecosystem that turns ideas into  marketable products?  There's a company called Not Impossible Labs.  I love the name. Not Impossible Labs.  They had an idea for a technology that could change live music.  They wanted to bring the experience of a concert to a group of people who  traditionally couldn't enjoy it.  The deaf community.  I mean, we love live music and we take it for granted.  It's an amazing experience.  It touches, and this is important, all the senses.  So the challenge lies in making concerts and live music more inclusive for the deaf.  So with Avnet as their guide, Not Impossible Labs, their idea evolved to one of the most  sophisticated wearables on the market, helping bring a shared live concert experience to  some great people.  And you can see this if you go to the website AVNET.  AVNET.com slash music one.  That's music in the number one.  It's called music, not impossible.  The product allows deaf and hearing concert goers alike to literally feel live music  through advanced vibration technology and then experience it together for the first  time. And dance, baby.  These wearables are truly wearables.  It's a vest, components that send vibrations through the ankles, wrists and chest.  The hearing able to receive music vibrations through the ears, but attendees who are deaf  and wearing these wearables got the same vibrations throughout other parts of the body,  allowing many of them to respond to live music alongside everybody else for many people.  This is so cool.  It was a first for them, an innovation that literally opened a whole new world of music  exploration for those who don't hear it in a traditional sense.  Avnet and Not Impossible Labs revealed music not impossible at the Life is Beautiful music  festival in Las Vegas.  It was a big hit.  This kind of innovation was brought to the finish line because of Avnet.  And instead of on this holiday season, instead of Avnet touting their wares and they do  great stuff, they thought it'd be great if you could just share this story.  Feel the rhythm at Avnet.com slash music one AVNET.com slash music in the number one.  It's a great holiday story.  We thank Avnet for their support and for I think this is really cool.  I don't think we've ever had an advertiser do this.  And I thank you Avnet.  Instead of flogging their wares, which I would be happy to flog because they're good  wares, they decided to talk about some good that has happened in the world.  See, does that make us feel better now?  Super Micro.  We go back a few months to the Bloomberg story, which was a conundrum to everybody.  And actually, I defended Bloomberg because I think Bloomberg is a great journalistic  organization.  I know people who know the two authors of the Super Micro story, the editor in chief,  who supervised that story over a long period of time, has great credentials, came from  the economist, really knows his stuff.  I couldn't think of any way that 17, wasn't it 17 anonymous sources that Bloomberg  Businessweek could have gotten this wrong.  The big hack cover story on Bloomberg, how China used a tiny chip to infiltrate US  companies.  Well, we always thought, well, if this is true, there'll be evidence somehow  we'll find out.  Well, Super Micro went out and asked for an audit.  They went to a company that specializes in going through this kind of stuff, Nardello  and company.  Nardello specifically tested samples of the motherboards supplied to as in the Bloomberg  story, Apple and Amazon.  It remembers Amazon's elemental Apple servers that supposedly had this rice sized chip  that was phoning home, phoning the Chinese government.  Nardello tested older motherboards alongside current versions and according to Super Micro  found no evidence of spy chips on any of them.  The company also checked design files and software to see if there was evidence of  tampering with either but found nothing there either.  Now, you remember that the US intelligence community, Apple, Amazon strongly denied the  story. Tim Cook asked for a retraction.  Bloomberg has stood by this story all this time.  Super Micro now says they're reviewing their legal options.  What do you make of this one?  This is the other shoe.  Now I'm going to have to step back and say, how did this happen?  How could Bloomberg get this so wrong?  Harry?

Transcript:  And Bloomberg hasn't had all that much to say about its story other than it stands by  it. And I've seen little evidence that anybody else who's looked at this has concluded  that Bloomberg is probably right.  So I think it's a challenge for people like us to form opinions on this just because at  least I'm not an expert on this stuff and I want to be careful about being positive.  I know who's right here.  Yeah.

Transcript:  All the presidents.  Man, I saw that.  Remember, in the during Watergate, all the presidents then men and Woodward and Bernstein,  they had to.  First of all, their editor in chief said, look, you're going to have to have two stories  for every two sources for everything.  They vetted everything.  You got to be sure this kid let me see your notebooks.  Seventeen sources in this story.  And presumably Bloomberg was doing exactly the same thing.

Start time: 3070.05

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  And when you were reporting on something so explosive, the bar goes up even higher.  And Bloomberg is not a like some newfangled funky blog.  Right.  It's extremely old school.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So we so this is why it's a puzzle.  Here's my theory.  Paris and I'll let you and Michael jump in anytime you want.  But my theory is that Bloomberg got makes up Bloomberg business.  We got played.  That's that somebody in the there has been and we'll talk about some of the other  stories to a concerted drumbeat against China.  And I would, if you want to interpret this as a blow to the supply chain, as a blow to  the security of the supply chain that that originates most of it in China.  And we know the, the U S government, particularly the administration is not a fan of  trade with China.  You can almost put together a scenario where 17 intelligence officials in a concerted  fashion.  Now, of course, Bloomberg said there were also people from Amazon and Apple involved  in this, but anyway, in concerted fashion lied to Bloomberg Businessweek, tricked them  into publishing this story because it served their political agenda.  Is that possible?

Start time: 3146.54
End time: 3225.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll go first here because I, you know, people have have said similar things about  stories that I've written.  I think that when you have 17 people confirming a lot of this, the same information, I  don't know that all 17 confirmed that this, this bug was implanted, but certainly there  was an issue around this.  Right.  I think that seems to me, it seems pretty, pretty, I'm pretty certain of that.  I think, you know, what I'm sort of watching before I think Harry makes a great point,  you know, it's hard to say anything definitively.  I think that if there's a lawsuit brought against Bloomberg, that will bring the truth  out. And if there isn't, I think that also suggests that Bloomberg got the story right.  So for me, I'm kind of using the legal case as as like the litmus test for the validity  of this article, because if they absolutely if they misreported the facts, if they got  everything wrong, then there should be a pretty easy case to make legally against Bloomberg  from from all of the companies mentioned in that story.  However, if Bloomberg is even somewhat true, the reporting is somewhat true, then I think  that that a lot of these companies will have a hard time making a case against Bloomberg.  And so if no lawsuit comes of this, then I think it suggests that there is a lot of truth  in the reporting that from that story.  So so for me, that's kind of the barometer, I guess.  So there's a third shoe.

Start time: 3225.92
End time: 3231.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know why, but there's a third shoe that's going to have to drop and it's a  lawsuit. Paris, what do you think?  Yeah, I totally agree.

Start time: 3231.48
End time: 3310.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I think that I've been following this as well and been kind of perplexed as well  silent in a bit, because generally from an outlet like Bloomberg and the two great  reporters that co-bylined this 17 sources, a story of this magnitude, especially one  that was in print, it doesn't seem likely that all the different layers of fact checking  and legal editorial work that went into this would have ended up misrepresenting the truth  in an egregious fashion.  But also all these companies have been so defiant about this have.  But I think the like Michael said, the one thing that we will have to see is whether or  not a legal case is brought, because, OK, if what Apple and Supermicro and whatnot are  saying is true, if the Bloomberg story has no merit, then it's a pretty easy lawsuit  because the only defense is that it's true.  So if they can prove that it's not in some way, I don't see why they wouldn't have  already brought a lawsuit or why they had just called for a retraction rather than  something stronger.  Is Bloomberg...  I don't think we have enough facts to judge it as outsiders.

Start time: 3311.10
End time: 3352.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is Bloomberg Businessweek hampered in their defense, though, in a lawsuit because these  17 sources are anonymous?  And by the way, you're all reporters, you know, oftentimes anonymous sources, just as  at Watergate, are critical to a story.  Anonymity alone does not impeach them.  Not at all.  But that's partly because of a strong editorial process that backs it up.  But it's appropriate for reporters to keep those sources anonymous.  You can understand why in a national defense story that would be not surprising.  But does it hamper their legal case?  Is it hard for them to go defend themselves in court if they can say, well, we can't  tell you who said this?

Start time: 3353.36
End time: 3443.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it shouldn't matter.  So I've used anonymous sources and have been accused of similar things, of being  tricked into telling a story that wasn't true, which is wrong.  I think that the source doesn't matter.  It's the material that they present to you.  So as long as Bloomberg has enough material to show that the claims made in the story  are true, so it could be emails, it could be internal documents, could be photos of  the server, any of those things, then it ultimately doesn't matter who delivered that  information. But I would add one small caveat to this, which is I think that, you know,  this culture of non-disclosures has really caused a lot more anonymous sourcing than  I would prefer, really, especially in the case of like technology news.  So all of these big companies, these employees have to sign non-disclosure agreements when  they walk into the building.  And so they're often not able to talk about their experience, even if they want to on  the record. So in many cases, when you see an anonymous source in a story, they're often  legally hampered from from revealing their name.  And so at least in my experience, there have been people that that have said, like, I  would love to come forward. I just don't want to be sued or have any legal retribution  pursued from a company like Facebook or or something like that.  So I think what irritates me is that these non-disclosure seem antithetical to the First  Amendment. You know, it seems like almost unconstitutional.  There you're you're muzzling citizens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, yeah, I think in many cases, I wouldn't trust it.  I'll say that if I was if I was a whistleblower, I would not trust those protections, because I  think there are plenty of examples where whistleblowers are ostracized and challenged and  and legally challenged.

Transcript:  Then you can be blackballed by the industry.  I think a lot of times I will talk to people and they're like, OK, I can probably speak with  you about this legally.  My non-disclosure doesn't apply to this, but I don't want my name associated with an article on  this topic because future employers will just happen to see my name when they Google it in an  article about this and decide I'm not trustworthy or that I will leak to the press in the future.  And it kind of creates this culture of silence, especially in the tech world.

Transcript:  It may be the case that there were it wasn't a widespread hack, that there were a handful of  boards, which would actually make sense.  You're going to target if you're the Chinese government, you're doing industrial espionage or  military espionage because some of these boards, by the way, the Amazon elemental boards were used  by the Department of Defense for during drone strikes, things like that.  So if you're going to do that, you're going to target them.  You're going to say this board's going to the Department of Defense.  Let's put it on that one.  So it doesn't to me, it doesn't disqualify the story because we haven't been able to produce a  board that has that problem.  It might be there's six of them.  And also, the underlying truth of the story is a given by everybody who knows anything about the  supply chain. We do it to them.  They do it to us.  There's all kinds of stuff going on.  Even the Snowden revelations had some hardware hacks that the NSA had perpetrated on other  countries. So we know this goes on.  So really, I think there's a much tougher question underlying it, which is what the hell do we do if  we can't trust stuff made in China?

Now, by the way, U.S., Australia, England, the five I's say we're not going to use Huawei  gear in our Canada in our 5G networks.  Germany says no, we're going to use Huawei gear.  I can't the Germany's technology watchdog says it can't find any evidence that Huawei  is a security risk.  The Arne Schoenbaum, who's the head of Germany, Germany's Federal Office for Information  Security told Der Spiegel for such serious decisions like a ban, you need proof.  We can't find any evidence.  We examined all of Huawei's products in our lab.  All three of Germany's major telcos use Huawei equipment.  John Ledger of T-Mobile says we're going to be able to get regulatory approval for the  T-Mobile Sprint merger because we promise not to use Huawei gear.  Is this politics?  Is this tech?  Is this what's going on?

Earlier this year, you might be talking about this, the US intelligence community,  including the heads of the FBI, CIA, and the NSA said don't use Huawei phones.  Chris Ray, the FBI director at the time said the government was deeply concerned about the risks  of allowing any company or entity that is beholden to foreign governments that don't share  our values to gain positions of power inside our telecommunications network.

I think if the situation was reversed  and that these companies or groups went ahead with Huawei technology and then a couple of years down  the road, we find out that some of it maybe even if it was just a small part of it was compromised  in some way, we all would be up in arms over the fact that they ever let any of it in.  And that in these sort of cases, we should allow intelligence organizations or entities,  whether they're governments or specific mergers and companies to decide what sort of channels

I feel like I read this earlier, like a couple  of months ago that Russian intelligence had infiltrated like energy companies or something  like that. Like, wasn't it? Isn't it true that basically my point here is that maybe there are  greater risks than Huawei that are already there already be the vulnerabilities that are already  being used and and and and exposed, I guess.

I mean, prudence would dictate we shouldn't buy anything  made in China, right? As just average citizens? Yeah, or the government or  telcos or I mean, I understand the threat you could not only have espionage, industrial and  surveillance. In fact, we're going to talk about that story in a second, because apparently there's  evidence Chinese have had a long standing program to do that. But there's also the threat of cyber  warfare, they shut your networks down. So I understand the threat. I'm not saying that

Start time: 4187.64
End time: 4246.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  where they want to minimize risks. And as Mr. Giff, or is it Mr. Giff,  points out in our chat room, it's exactly what other countries go through when buying American  gear. Yeah. Right. I would hate I think look, I'm a liberal, and I mean, in the traditional sense of  liberty free, I think the world is a better place when there's free trade, where borders go down,  where people trust one another. And I would hate to see an illiberal world which we're moving  towards, where every country has a big barrier up against every other country, doesn't trust any  other country, because to me, that leads to World War. And I don't think we can afford another  World War. So that's my point of view. Maybe that's, that's a highly impractical point of view. But  that's my point of view. I worry that this is the wrong direction to be going. I mean, I generally

Start time: 4246.24
End time: 4409.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  agree with that. I think that, and I bet most people on the panel agree that, you know, open  borders and open free trade is, is generally regarded better. But obviously, like, there are  no simple answers to this. I think that one of the things that I tell my friends who didn't go to  college who are often tricked by misinformation is that, that there are very rarely, and this is also  part of adulthood, I think there are rarely simple answers to these very complicated questions. And,  and so, you know, although it would be great to just buy and sell from whoever you want across  the world, there's, there's, there are more social dynamics going on that, that, well, frankly,  we probably don't, don't, don't even fully understand. And so, so I think it makes sense to  me to be as open as possible. But if you're a government contractor or a government agency,  I think that it makes sense to source from a place like South Korea, which is a strong ally,  has one of the largest US army bases in the world, etc, etc. And has a strong history of  supporting US priorities, I guess, versus some versus, you know, commissioning work from,  from, from a foreign agent, whether it be China or Russia, or, you know, anywhere else in the world,  I think it's, you know, it's generally just safer to work with, with allies, right, and with people  that have historically supported US customs and US, you know, I guess, international strategy,  or whatever you want to call it. So, so to me, I feel it feels like, like, I guess, maybe I'm  defending something that I typically wouldn't defend, but it seems to me like there are plenty  of reasonable alternatives. And it's not I'm not saying we should, you know, we should completely  shut down trade with China, that's not my stance, but it seems okay to forbid government agencies  from purchasing from this one supplier, so long as there are viable alternatives that allies can  provide. And my rough understanding is that South Korea does have a lot of manufacturing facilities  that can do a lot of the things that Chinese suppliers can do, it's sometimes a little bit  more costly. But, but you know, things like OLED screens and, and, and something conductor,  manufacturing, you know, that that stuff does take place in, in countries that have long supported  US political procedure, US political strategy, geopolitical strategy. So, so to me, if that's a,  if that's a viable option, then we should absolutely choose that over, over an unknown,  I think it's just the most rational, to me, it's the most rational decision, you know, you have,  it's like the double you know, versus the the devil you don't, I guess, or whatever that

I mean, sure, maybe we  should build up our manufacturing capacity. But for right now, a more pragmatic thing to do would  be buy it and audit it. And if it if it's clean, use it.

Transcript:  the ultimate Trojan horses present something that looks to be entirely safe. You have the open source  software and whatnot, but you have somehow found a backdoor in that is hiding within that once it  is deployed within the highest levels of US government and the agencies of all of your entities  of your enemies, then you exploit it. And I mean, I assume that these I'm generally very skeptical of  all government agencies, but I assume that making a decision like this that is going to affect their  bottom line, they have to have some sort of reasoning behind it. And especially given the  reports that we've gone over earlier and that we've seen over the past couple of years concerning  Huawei and similar companies that there's probably they're probably not just doing this for no  apparent reason, because for a lot of these companies or agencies purchasing technology from  China, from one of the best manufacturers of 5G technology, as well as other different venues,  seems like the natural choice and would benefit them in numerous ways.  Let's take a break when we come back. More evidence of Chinese hacking in the United States and a long

Also, some good news in California, it looks like they're not going to tax your SMS messages.  We'll talk about that lots more. Oh, and another Facebook exploit. Yeah. Our show is called  Well, I can't decide panko crested chicken and maple dipping sauce with roasted brussels sprouts  and sweet potatoes. Or maybe you look to me like more like a creamy saffron risotto with  Sicilian style roasted cauliflower. I do. Well, I'll tell you what we made the other day that  was amazing seared steaks and loaded mashed potatoes with roasted broccoli and guajillo  honey sauce. Now that's a Harry McCracken. Sounds great. We're talking about Blue Apron.  Blue Apron makes cooking fun and easy. It is awesome. Every Wednesday we get our Blue Apron  box and we just look forward to it every week. What we do is we go, and I'm talking we, me and  Lisa, we go online. We look at the Blue Apron menus, lovely, lovely choices, a variety of diets,  many vegetarian options, kid friendly meals too. That's why we did the seared steaks. Michael loves  steak. With the holidays fast approaching meal prep is the last thing you want to worry about.  Shopping, planning. What if it was just like you go home and there's everything you made to do it,  make it, everything you need to make a delicious wholesome meal. That's what Blue Apron does.  Create meals that are so beautiful you'll share them on social media. You can choose meals that  are quick, 20 minutes, choose meals that take a little bit longer. I actually like to cook.  I love it. Since they've done all the work for me, I always just pick by flavor, frankly.  There are lots of videos and time saving tips on the website. Blue Apron takes a chore out of  meal prep. The website and mobile app make it easy to plan your meals every week. You don't have to  ever worry about forgotten ingredients. I don't have to run to the store because, oh no, I need  some sage. In fact, what's great is there's no waste either. You always get exactly what you need  to make the dish, but no more. If you need one carrot, you get one carrot. Oh, and man,  you're going to learn. To me, it's been a cooking school in a box. New techniques,  new recipes, even new ingredients. I had no idea what guajillo honey sauce was or how it tasted  until I made it. Let me tell you, it tastes delicious. Blue Apron, it's time. I know you've  heard me talk about it before. I know your mouth is watering right now. Perhaps I could  interest you in some Korean style popcorn chicken with jasmine rice and roasted broccoli. Yes.  I want you to try it out. Get your first three meals free. Check out this week's menu  at blueapron.com slash twit. Blue Apron. Oh man, I'm so hungry now. Blueapron.com slash  twit. Blue Apron's a better way to cook. We actually often do Blue Apron Sunday nights  because I work late and what's nice to have a meal ready for me when I get home and just whip it up.  So good. A new Facebook bug. Well, they just never end. Facebook is the gift that just keeps  on giving. This one, it's another related bug to this whole API. Facebook made the announcement  after hosting a pop-up privacy experience in New York's Bryant Park. Oh man, how'd I miss that?  They said, oh, by the way, several third party apps had quote, access to a broader set of photos  than usual for 12 days in September. 6.8 million users, many photos which they had not posted  that were private. There's the pop-up, the privacy, Facebook privacy experience.  It's probably gone by now. When someone gives permission for an app to access their photos on  Facebook, we usually only grant the app access to photos people share on their timeline. In this case,  a bug potentially gave developers access to other photos. A few apps, 1,500 apps.  Oh man. It also let those apps access photos posted in Stories and Marketplace and on the user's  timeline. Even photos you uploaded but didn't post. It'll be working with affected developers  to help them delete the photos from impacted users. Oh, you go volt. I just tell you this as  a warning. I'm not angry about it because I don't use Facebook anymore. I think one big lesson is

Transcript:  look and see what apps have access to your Facebook. When I checked, I had 300, most of  which I couldn't remember ever having given them permission and some of which didn't exist anymore.  You should grind it down to the ones where you know them, you know you want them to have access

Start time: 4956.78
End time: 4966.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and delete everything else. Yeah, I think that's great advice. I have kind of just given up on the  idea of privacy at this point. I feel like as long as I have- That's the other option.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  sharing a lot less but I guess as long as I have the Facebook app on my phone and as long as I'm  sort of participating even as infrequently as I do, I just assume that everything could go public  at any moment. Anything that I do on my phone, any browsing history, there's so much attached to  my Facebook account that I've just kind of given up on the idea of privacy.  The other thing I'll add to this is that, you know, so I joined Facebook before photos were  even a thing. This was in college and I remember photos arriving while I was in my freshman year

Start time: 5006.66
End time: 5010.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  of college. Wait a minute, you joined Facebook back when it was like just universities only?

Start time: 5011.00
End time: 5015.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, exactly. Was it the Facebook at the time? That's how I accessed the website, yeah, the

Start time: 5015.78
End time: 5131.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Facebook. Oh my God, you're an old timer. It was awesome. I mean, again, you described this earlier.  People were really optimistic about these democratizing tools and it was this really  exciting thing. And truthfully, I really liked Facebook for a very long time, I guess. And now  my relationship has changed quite a bit but this was something that I obsessed over and a lot of  people did. And when photos arrived to Facebook, this was a huge freaking deal on college campuses  because suddenly you could upload photo albums with your friends from all these parties around  campus or activities, I guess, and share them with people. And you could also see who was  going to, who was likely to show up at certain parties and who you might meet and that sort of  thing. And it's amazing because there was so much excitement around uploading photo albums and giving  each photo a caption and tagging your friends at a certain point. And now I feel like people  so infrequently publish albums on Facebook. It's come, you know, it's done a complete 180. So now  I rarely see people posting photo albums and it's just really hard to justify at this point. I think  more people, I see more people, at least of my age group, that are heading to the cloud and basically  using software like Google Photos or using iCloud and using that as an archive for all of their  photos and then sort of disseminating the photos one by one via text or via messaging platforms as  they wish. So for example, I was out with a friend this weekend and we were hanging out with his two  twin daughters and we took a bunch of photos and we were at a diner and all this stuff.  At the end of the day, we just shared a couple of photos via text. In the past, we would have  posted those things on Facebook and that would have been our way of sharing them with each other.  I think personal sharing has really taken off. Yeah, the social dynamic has changed

Start time: 5131.96
End time: 5136.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  a lot for me personally. I hadn't thought about that. I've seen that in people around me. How

Start time: 5136.56
End time: 5174.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  about you, Paris? Yeah, I mean, I think it's the same. I took a trip up the other weekend with some  friends to a cabin and at the end of it, we all created a shared Apple photos, an iPhotos album,  and then added in comments there. I think it's also representative of this shift from public,  open platforms to kind of more semi-private, controlled spaces because we're all realizing  that a totally open public internet or social network experience is a modern hellscape  and we'd rather be around the people that we choose to be around.

Start time: 5174.84
End time: 5190.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I bet you some people are using Facebook Messenger though to do that somewhat more private sharing.  Yeah, which means Facebook still got access to all the info.  Yeah, but yeah, I mean, there are things that default public like Facebook  and things that default private like Google Photos and Apple Photos.

Start time: 5192.52
End time: 5215.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and I'll add that if I would have posted some of those photos on Facebook,  I think it would have been a little bit offensive. So there's this new, I think-  Offensive to the people whose pictures they were. Like, why are you sharing our private stuff to the  public? Yeah, and like, oh, I look like garbage in that photo or, you know, they would phrase it in  a way that like they were uncomfortable with the way that they look. There's a button in Facebook

Start time: 5215.20
End time: 5224.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  to do that. I was so shocked. My wife sent me that. She said, take that picture down. I find it  offensive. Oh, really? That's hilarious. Yeah. There's a button on Facebook for that. Yeah,

Start time: 5224.54
End time: 5233.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you can untag it. You can make it so it doesn't show up in your profile. I use that all the time.  Oh, see? There you go. Yeah. So I find it so weird when- Sorry, continue.

Start time: 5234.74
End time: 5290.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you're exactly right. I mean, it's a faux pas. It is a social faux pas. It's a faux pas to  post photos of your friends without asking first, I think. And it's because the value of privacy is  much greater than it was in 2001 or, you know, 2005 when I was in college. So yeah, so that to  me is really interesting, this shift in the value of privacy and how and what moments we decide to  share and what moments we decide to even share privately. And just like the dissemination of  this, you could call it data, I guess, but the dissemination of these photos, I think, is it  represents the changing dynamic that people have, the changing relationship that people have with  Facebook. Because Facebook used to be all about photos. That was the whole purpose of Facebook,  really. When I was in college, it was about taking funny photos on your point and shoot.  Well, that's what we have Instagram for though, right? Is an Instagram a replacement?

Start time: 5292.08
End time: 5296.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is, in many ways. Instagram is Facebook. Paris, do you have a public Instagram or a

Start time: 5297.16
End time: 5327.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  private Instagram? So I've always been the biggest advocate for public Instagrams because I thought  private ones were dumb. But then over the past week, I wrote a story about the in-cell community  and some other people and started getting some harassing messages. So I had to take mine private  for the first time, which has actually been kind of fantastic. I realized because now I looked  through the people who were following me. I deleted all the ones I didn't know. And now when I post a  story, it's just to your friends, just to my friends. Great. I love it. I'm not going back.

I don't know how you know, but I guess I don't know.  Cause I don't ever see him. I should point out. I know people watch the shows regularly know this,  but I, I in August killed Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, completely. I deactivate all  the accounts. I have never been happier. I don't, I, I, yeah. Well, so what's interesting is I used  to know everything that was going on in, in, you know, like I knew everything going on with you,  Harry, you post about my Instagram. Yeah. You and Marie would post these great antique  technology pictures and stuff like that. So I liked that and I miss it, but I also realize  that it's kind of a false intimacy to think that you know about people because you're following  their social feeds and that really the only real intimacy is when I'm here and you're talking,  we're talking to each other or even on Skype. I mean, I think that's real, but I, but I think  that there's this, this phony sense that, you know, you are keeping up with your friends because you  see them on Facebook and Instagram. I don't miss. I really don't miss. And I really didn't like the  FOMO stuff. Yeah. You know, you see these and you've written some brilliant stuff Paris on the  Facebook influencers and you know, the whole culture, I'm sorry, Instagram, the whole culture  on Instagram has become a little weird and creepy and show-offy and I don't like it.  Yeah. Nothing is really real and it's, but yet people kind of judge it as if what they're seeing

Start time: 5472.58
End time: 5526.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is real. I don't know. One, I think this is perhaps a story in the New York Times a couple of months  ago where it was this one penthouse apartment in Manhattan that was rented out by influencers  by the hour or day or week where they could go and take beautiful photos and like a luxurious  living room or apartment or bathroom and then add that as if it's their own home where they're  taking photos in. And I thought that that kind of crystallized it in the fact that nothing  about Instagram or any of these sort of platforms that we look at is real. And even, I mean, I wrote,  I've written pretty extensively about influencers, but I think even when you're talking about your  friends, there's this artifice that's inherent in every action that you have online.

And he says that Jackson Hole Wyoming does this no hashtags, because one of the problems with  Instagram is these beautiful places or even just the front of the Wired building are becoming  uninhabitable because of all these people Instagramming their experience.  Hashtags are the worst in general.  So Jackson Hole Wyoming has like the hashtag no hashtags, please, or don't say where you took  this picture because it's just don't tag it. Yeah, don't tag it. And I have to say going to a concert  has been ruined for me because not so much. I mean, it was bad enough people raising,  taking pictures the whole time or worse with an iPad blocking your view.  But the last few concerts I've been to, there are people, the person, they're in the front row.  Sometimes there's a person singing his heart out. Somebody turns around, turns their back to the  singer and takes a selfie of themselves with a singer behind them. I'll give you one more on that.

He like incorporated  it into the show. That's incredible. Crazy. And it was kind of disruptive to his singing because  he's like doing this the whole time. But I saw Spring Scene on Broadway last week, closed on  Saturday, closed yesterday. We got in there at the last minute and they're very clear.  You may not take out your phone but they understand the culture so they say,  at the end of the show, we will turn up the house lights. Bruce will be taking his bows. You may  then take a picture. And they were, boy, if somebody I saw, it was a little disruptive,  ushers with flashlights. If anybody took their phone out of their pocket, they were going,  uh.

See, an Instamatic would be fine. Take all the pictures  you want. It doesn't have a big bright screen. Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage  from Quicken Loans introducing something really cool. We've talked before about Rocket Mortgage  because people like us, I'm kind of an introvert. I don't want to go to a bank and fill out an  application and have to dress up and pretend I don't need a loan to get a home loan. I actually  don't even want to put pants on. I just want to do it on my couch. And that's what Rocket Mortgage,  believe it or not, Quicken Loans knows. That's what I love about Quicken Loans. They're kind of  techie. They understand this. They are the number one mortgage lender in the country. According to  customer satisfaction results, nine years in a row, JD Power says, number one, nine years in a  row of customer satisfaction. That's for mortgage origination, the approval process. Number one in  customer satisfaction and mortgage servicing, five years in a row. So they've been really  dominant. They're also number one lender in the country as of last year. So that's really great.  Congratulations, Quicken Loans. And it's things like Rocket Mortgage, I think that make the  difference. A thinking about the customer experience. So Rocket Mortgage, it's entirely  online. You go to rocketmortgage.com slash twit two. I know you're probably not getting a home  loan right now. You're busy. Some people are, but you wouldn't hurt to go sign up for it.  rocketmortgage.com slash twit two. That speeds up the process because let's say you're then in an  open house, maybe you're driving around looking at Christmas lights and suddenly you say,  I see a for sale sign. You go look at the house. You say, we need a loan. Now you're ready. The  three step power buying process begins and you won't believe how easy it is. First, you go to  the website rocketmortgage.com slash twit two, answer a few simple questions. They will then  come back and say, look, based on your credit, you can get a loan. These are the rates you can get.  These are the terms you can get. These are the down payment, et cetera. You choose the perfect  loan for you and you now get pre-qualified approval. That was in most cases less than  10 minutes and involved no research on your part. You didn't have to look up your dog's social  security number or get pay stubs or anything. Just basic stuff. Name, address, pay date of birth,  social, that kind of thing. Then step two happens kind of automatically. Quicken Loans verifies your  income assets and credit and within 24 hours in most cases, they're going to give you what they  call verified approval. You now get a letter. You give your realtor, you give the seller that says,  they're good for it. They got the loan. They're qualified. You have the strength of a cash  buyer and that makes a huge difference when you're buying a house. Once you're verified,  you also qualify for something that I think is very timely. Rates are going up. You notice perhaps  that gives you a little anxiety, a little spook as you're searching around for a house. You go, oh  God, we got to buy a house quick. The rates going to go up. It's going to cost us a lot more and  maybe you buy a house. It's not perfect. I want you to buy the perfect house. So does Quicken Loans.  That's why rate shield approval. Once you get the verified approval, they lock your rate for up to  90 days while you shop. You got three months. Even if rates go up, yours will not. If rates go down,  yours will go down. So you win either way, but your rate cannot go up. This is exactly what you  expect from America's largest mortgage lender and best. And the one that really thinks about you,  go to rocketmortgage.com slash twit two and get started. And then when you find that house,  you can get the process underway. Rate shield approval is only valid on certain 30 year purchase  transactions. Additional conditions or exclusions may apply based on Quicken Loans data in  comparison to Public Data Records, Equal Housing Lender, licensed in all 50 states,  and MLS consumer access.org number 3030. All you have to remember is this rocketmortgage.com  slash twit two. We thank them so much. They've been such a great supporter all year long and we  wish them the best in this holiday season. I didn't mention this, but Facebook has some  splaining to do. Actually, I should do. Facebook have got some splaining to do. The Irish Data  Protection Commission, which oversees Facebook's compliance with the European regulations, probably  GDPR, said yesterday or Friday that it had launched a statutory inquiry into Facebook after receiving  multiple reports of data breaches affecting the company. So the fine on this could be billions,  could be huge, 4% of their annual worldwide revenue, not profit, revenue. So there's that.  I got that going for me. I also have a portal. I have two of them. If anybody wants to buy them,  I cannot get them returned. Facebook said you could have 30 days to return them.  I sent them an email to support saying, I want to return them. They said, why? I said, I don't want  them. And that's the last I heard. They said, send us your invoice, your order number. I did all that,  nothing. And the 30 days runs out in four days. What do I do? I got to keep them.

But he  had the perfect, well, he said, my 85 year old mother has a hard time with Skype and FaceTime is  too complicated. But she's got relatives in China, us, what should we do? I said, get a Facebook  portal. Because all your faces are on this. First of all, it's a really nice picture frame  with your Facebook photo albums that you don't upload anymore. And it has all the people that  you can call. You could choose like five people or whatever that you call. And she just pushes  the button and you appear. Plus you can play words with friends with her. Facebook's, I guess,  portal is such a success. It came, I didn't know this, should have. It came out of their,  their building eight, which is their advanced technology stuff, right? ATAP.  And they've now renamed it. I guess it was such a success that the building eight is now called

We have some writers on  the West coast and we've used like a Microsoft, one of the large Microsoft service, like whiteboard  style devices. Yeah. And we've tried all sorts of things. Google Meet, by far and away, the most  popular teleconferencing tool was the Facebook portal because they had the best filters. So like  people could, it was just more fun. It was a very, very fun conversation. The camera actually  tracks people in the room. So like based on who's speaking, it'll find the face that the audio is  coming from. And yeah, it was actually really fun. I think my advice to people that are considering  getting this device would be to just quarantine it. Put it in a space that-  There you go.  In an office. I mean, I know that not everyone has a dedicated office room, but if you can find  a room that isn't too revealing, that isn't very high traffic, I think it's a really cool  tool to have in your arsenal, you know, in terms of just like reaching people across the country  or across the world. But I wouldn't-  Just put a hood on it like a Falcon.

We basically just use it to teleconference.  Yeah, if you're just talking. It's more for collaborating and stuff like that.  Yeah. And so, yeah, generally speaking, we don't present in those types of ways, I guess.  But I think it could work for some offices. Yeah, definitely.

At least in the case of our office, Google Meet works really well.  There used to be Google Hangouts. I don't know. I think that most offices, from my perspective,  would be better off with a very large HDTV connected to Google Meet. There's little  hubs that you can put behind the television set. But you don't need the touch screen.  Most people don't need those touch screen capabilities and they don't need that pen  either. I think that's just kind of extraneous for most businesses.

So I just got it in the fall. I haven't had a chance to ride it too much  in the winter, but I'm really expecting to get around most places in the spring and summer using  that bike.

And what is under reported, but Arizona Central has  a story, police have responded to dozens of calls regarding people threatening and harassing the  Waymo self-driving vans. They start the story, a Waymo self-driving van cruised through a Chandler  neighborhood August 1st when a test driver, Michael Palos, saw something startling as he sat behind  the wheel, a bearded man in shorts aiming a handgun at him as he passed the driveway. 21 interactions  documented by Chandler police over the last two years where people have harassed the autonomous  vehicles and their human test drivers.

Oh yeah, it was only two weeks  ago. Half a billion records, people who use the Starwood Group reservation system, including in  some cases passports. People like me. And me. Who didn't? I'm like Starwood Gold. Yeah, me too.  Half a billion people. That's got a lot of people. Turns out according to the New York Times,  which is quoting of course our intelligence agencies, that the hack came from China.  And actually the larger story, it was part of a large four-year intelligence gathering effort.  You remember when the Office of Personnel Management, the U.S. government's OPM, was hacked?  That was part of it. Apparently the Chinese, even though they deny this by the way, I should,  I should give them fair, fair reporting here. China firmly opposes all forms of cyber attack  and cracks down on it in accordance with the law. If offered evidence, the relevant Chinese  departments will carry out investigations according to the law. Apparently, according to the anonymous  sources in this article, the Chinese started doing this in 2014 because they wanted to gather  information about spies. It wasn't about you and me, but they wanted to know about Chinese nationals  in the United States, where they traveled. They wanted to know about other people. They were  kind of keeping American, remember the Anthem hack? American health insurance company Anthem also  part of that. They wanted social security numbers and patients' medical histories.  It's another story that I guess I credit, I don't know.

Transcript:  The data in this case, while it is not, I guess, social security numbers or something that  in and of itself you think of as a large security risk, any number of identifying information can  be used to identify you in other means or find out more about a particular person or their habits  online if you're also combining that with other information from data brokers or perhaps like  anonymized information, the sort of information that an entity could collect from a hack of,  yeah, Marriott. While it could seem innocuous in certain lights when combined with other  pools of information or data, it can reveal people's identities.

On the other hand, General Clapper, James Clapper, the former head of the Defense  Intelligence Agency said, hey, well, if we could do it, we'd do it to them.  I'm sorry.  So maybe it's just tit for tat, as they say. Chinese were also interested in getting information  about American security officials. Anything you can get is going to be useful. So there is that.  I'll throw that into the mix.

Start time: 7165.54
End time: 7195.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Those companies are also supposed to do things like that. Marriott did none of them. They had  the worst security practices ever. And so that's the other thing I think we need to do, which is  hold these companies feet to the fire. That's what GDPR does. But I think we should have something in  the United States too, that if a company breaches its responsibility to protect our data in a really  gross way, like Marriott did, that they should pay a severe fine. That should be a penalty.  Equifax not only got off scot-free, they made money on it.

Every year, the biggest celebration of the top stuff on YouTube that year,  the biggest creators, the best videos, the memes, everything. At least we thought. A lot of people  have been asking me about this. You may have noticed about a week ago, YouTube rewind 2018  was uploaded. And it's not exactly doing too hot. In fact, it's currently in just a few days,  the second most disliked video ever uploaded.  Of all time. First place being Justin Bieber's baby. And it's on pace to pass that probably  pretty soon. So the most outwardly hated video ever uploaded to this site.

But Slack is not free. Slack has a free tier, but really. Pretty good free tier.  We use a free tier. We don't use a paid version. But Microsoft Teams is really free and apparently

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's just the most robust right now. And I think some of these tools will be democratized. Or I  think that Slack doesn't really do anything that unique. It's just instant messaging with emojis,  basically. And also their embeds are really nice, like the inline chat embed. So if I see a YouTube  clip and I drop that in the chat, it will embed that video so that someone doesn't have to click  out to YouTube. We can just watch the video within the chat. It's fantastic for a newsroom that it's  like really, especially a digitally native newsroom that is super important for tweets, for YouTube,  for basically any of this content that we're digesting throughout the day. But I also just  don't think that that's that unique. At the end of the day, Facebook and Microsoft and all these  companies that employ hundreds of engineers can just as easily create an instant messaging platform  within embeds. And my expectation is that that's going to become a very competitive  marketplace. Because from what I read, Slack was talking about potentially going public next year.  And if that's the case, I think it's similar to Uber in that the technology aspect isn't all that  unique. What's really good about their business right now is that they've scaled really well.  They have a lot of people that have bought into that system. But it will be easy for competitors  to create copycat versions of those businesses. And so I think that there's inherently a lot of  risk with something like Slack or Uber, I guess, from a business standpoint. I don't think that  they do anything that unique. It's not impossible for Facebook or Microsoft to create something

Start time: 7761.38
End time: 7789.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  similar, in my opinion. Slack did a good job of giving it a lot of polish, which is harder than  it looks. It is elegant. Yes, nice. HipChat was an arch rival for a while. It's ugly. But Slack was  a lot more polished and pleasant to use. And I am glad to see that Microsoft is doing okay just  because I think it's healthy for Slack to have at least one major arch rival. Facebook has Facebook  at work, which they're certainly still... Does anybody use that? They certainly do, some big users.

Live Leaks.  TMZ presents Live Leaks. Do we have a... No promo this week. Oh, God. You were gonna get me out of  this. That's all, folks. Hey, actually, I want to say a good thing about face recognition.  I had no idea. Do you know that Taylor Swift has lots of stalkers? I don't even want to say a number.  But actually, I guess I'm not surprised. Hundreds. Hundreds. So they've used... Security  for Taylor Swift at California's Rose Bowl last May used face recognition  to spot the stalkers. Hundreds of images of known Taylor Swift stalkers.  The kiosk was set up to show highlights of the singers' rehearsals.  Seekly recorded the faces of onlookers, which were sent to a command post across the country in Nashville.  Everybody who went by would stop and stare at the software would start working, according to Chief  Security Officer of Live Entertainment Security Company, Oakview Group, who personally attended  the event. It's unknown if any of the footage were kept or even if identified any real stalkers or  what happened if it did. But you know, this is actually confirming something we've been hearing  for some time, which is that stadiums routinely use face recognition to recognize rowdy fans,  fans that have been kicked out in the past. Man, if I were Taylor Swift, you bet I'd use it.

Start time: 7906.97
End time: 7965.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I think this is actually a pretty common practice at this point. I remember earlier this  year, China, in China, the Chinese police used facial recognition to identify...  Jaywalkers.  No, no, no. It was at a concert. It was a sea of 60,000 people and they were able to find this man  that was accused of economic crimes or something like that. So I just remember the headline being  what this person was found in a sea of 60,000 people at a concert. And also, I believe,  Ticketmaster announced that they were going to be embracing more facial recognition or surveillance  technology at concerts in the US. So I think basically my view on this is if you're going to  a concert, you're probably being surveilled to an extreme degree at this point. I think it's  actually becoming fairly common. And I guess I'm okay with that.

Transcript:  I'm interested to see how this works from an advertising perspective though, because when it  comes to concerts, I've always been a bit wary or kind of interested in the overlap of security,  technology and advertising ever since. I went to a concert earlier this year, I think the Arctic  Monkeys, and the only way that I could use my ticket that I purchased was to download an app  by the company AXIS. And of course, I also had forgotten to, I don't know, bring headphones in  the subway over. So I decided to read the privacy policy for the app on my way over. And I realized  that essentially it was taking a log of everything the phone was doing, everywhere you went,  where you moved within once you were using your ticket. And I assume that if these stadiums are  deploying facial recognition technology, then... And so they were taking that information and  selling it to advertisers. So I assume that facial recognition technology will go there too.  They'll know that, oh, you looked at Coca-Cola possibly getting like a  freezy for three minutes and then decided not to.

Transcript:  I've been saying this for some time though, because I've seen a lot of apps. Like  Product Hunt released an app. It was kind of a goofy app called Sip. You remember this?  It's still out. It would give you one headline a day because you can't drink the news river,  so sip from the news straw. One little... But I don't think that was the point of that app.  I increasingly think people will do anything to get an app on your phone because the data they  get is so valuable that they're just going to do anything. Make up apps. It's very sad.  We've been keeping you guys so long and I appreciate it. We do have one big story.  I want to do this and then we'll end with that big story. Setback in the outback as  Signal calls it. But first a word from the fresh air filling this studio right now.  Smells good, doesn't it, Marie? Smells good in here. Yeah, yeah. You know I cooked bacon in here  just an hour before the show and you can't tell, can you? Because we've got a molecule.  Molecule is the world's first molecular air purifier that reduces symptoms for allergy  and asthma sufferers. We got a molecule first at home because Lisa used to wake up with headaches  because we live in the country and there's pollen and dust and stuff. And all of a sudden after we  moved she started getting headaches. So we got the molecule. Headaches went away. And I know it was  a molecule because when we stay overnight somewhere headaches come back. This is an  amazing technology. It replaces 50 years of antiquated air purification technology.  That HEPA filter that's in most of these things, that's been used to clean your air since 1940.  There haven't really been major innovations since. It's just trapping stuff.  Molecule destroys it. It's called PECO technology, photo electrochemical oxidation.  It was created and funded by the EPA, tested by real people, verified by third parties in  university labs like the University of South Florida's Center for Biological Defense,  the University of Minnesota's Particle Calibration Lab. It goes so much farther than a HEPA filter.  First of all, it doesn't just trap allergens. It eliminates them. It destroys them. Not just  allergens, mold, bacteria, even tiny viruses and airborne chemicals, VOCs, formaldehyde from the  carpet, paint fumes, all of that captured, trapped, destroyed. Pollutants a thousand times smaller  than those a HEPA filter can catch. We liked it so much we got one for our son and we have two of  them. I tell you, when we had the fires up here and all that smoke, that molecule saved our lives.  We got one in the studio too. I have them everywhere. I love the molecule. It's beautiful,  clean, sleek design. They kind of say the Apple of air purifiers. It's got a solid aluminum shell.  You can also get a filter subscription service so you just get filters automatically.  We have it connected to our Wi-Fi network so I can control it from my phone  and it will automatically order new filters that way which is awesome when it needs them.  But you don't have to do that. It's got a button on top that completely controls it. It is really  awesome. Just gets everything out of the air. It smells great and even if it's a giant room like  our studio, the molecule works great. Seventy-five dollars off your first order. They have a silent  mode and then if you do make bacon, you turn on the boost mode and it cleans the air out so fast.  Seventy-five dollars off your first order but don't delay because these are selling out fast.  Molecule is m-o-l-e-k-u-l-e dot com and use the promo code twit75 to get 75 bucks off.  Molecule, m-o-l-e-k-u-l-e dot com. Offer code twit75. Australia this week passed. It was a  last minute bill passed by the Australian parliament before they recessed the assistance  and access bill which is given people fits. This is from Signal but I've seen blog posts  from One Password now and many other companies because the bill requires that a company that  has encryption can offer the encrypted data and clear text upon the request of law enforcement  in Australia. A back door. Signal says, well, we can't do that because we can't read your message.  We don't have any access to your message but the Australian law would require them  to put a back door in Signal so that they could give them this and their severe penalties if they  don't. This data. Ironically, according to Signal, the prime minister of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull,  uses Signal. Members of government everywhere use Signal because it's private.  One of the ways, according to Signal, that the assistance and access bill is particularly terrible  lies in its potential to isolate Australians from the services they depend on and use every day.  Like Signal, maybe like your password vault, over time users may find a growing number of  apps no longer behave as expected. New apps might never launch in Australia at all.  It doesn't seem like smart politics. So it isn't yet in effect and I think there's perhaps some  hope that the courts in Australia will overturn it or maybe the parliament will get its mind back.  I use an Australian mail provider, Fastmail, which I love but as soon as I read this I looked at means  to change my mail away from Fastmail. What do you think, Harry?

This last little bit of dark pixel matter and their giant HD panopticon  is not critical to them doing their job, I don't think, and it makes us all less safe. Proton mail,  same thing. What's wrong with the assistance and access law? The Australian government is really  a leader in encryption back doors so this is basically breaks encryption permanently. It goes  farther than even Russia which bans encryption, Turkey bans encryption, China bans encryption.  This says, oh you're gonna have encryption as long as we can see what you're doing. So it's not  worse than banning it. At least when you ban it you don't know, you know, you don't,  and the problem is it doesn't just impact us, it impacts if Apple says, oh well we want to sell  phones in Australia, we guess we got to put a back door on the iPhone. That in fact impacts every

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean I think it seems to be just another example of the people who are making the laws  do not understand the effects that these sort of rulings are going to have at the community at  large. While it may seem like on one level a way to help law enforcement, I'm not sure of the  makeup of Australia's parliament or if they're experiencing similar issues, but I know that in  the US this is the common refrain whenever there's another social media filtering hearing is that the  people who are asking the questions or have the power to make these decisions from a governmental  standpoint do not understand the technology that they wield this power over.

The FCC speaking of bad for America has decided to change the rules governing text messaging,  making text messaging services not a telecommunications service but a publishing  service which gives telecoms the right to censor text messages. In 2007 Verizon blocked texts  from NARAL, an abortion rights group. That sounds pretty political. We've seen other situations  where this has happened. The telcos are not notorious for their civil rights focus. Giving  them this power to block text messages they disagree with is very dangerous. Again, another one
