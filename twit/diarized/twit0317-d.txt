A very manly panel starting. Unfortunately, I wish you were  in person with us, Jeff, because we're drinking some fine Italian wine, Jeff  Jarvis, who could not be on This Week in Google with us this week. So we thought,  well, let's get him on Twitter. Hi, Jeff.

Transcript:  Look at what I'm doing. Jeff, it's great to have you. Thank you for being here.  To Jeff's right, somebody who has, I don't think you've ever been on Twitter.  No, it's my first time. But an old friend, Cedric Ingram, he is the host of  Planet Crenn, which is a very popular show about technology in France on TF1.  It's actually on LCI, which is the news channel. I'm sorry, LCI.

Transcript:  You brought wine and I think that's a good start. Italian wine.  I brought wine and a Minitel. And a Minitel. Italian.  Well, there's a story. There's a long story. Great Italian wine that's  actually owned by a US CEO. Look at this behind me.  I don't know if you can see this, but there's a Minitel.  I want one. That's a working Minitel. You're getting one, Jeff.

Transcript:  You're getting one. I couldn't bring two through airport security in Paris.  Bringing one was fun enough. I mean, the guy looking at the x-ray was going,  what's that big thing in the middle? I said, that's a CRT.  You haven't seen too many of those recently.  But it's also actually pretty interesting because  Minitel services are just now shutting down.  Well, that's what happened. We talked about that on Twitter.  I haven't used one in maybe 12 years, but there's still people who have this at home  and use it for directory assistance, getting train tickets and the like.  They have just shut down the weather service this very weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the idea was that French Telecom gave everybody in France a Minitel terminal,  so they didn't have to give you phone books anymore.  Absolutely.  This was in the age of Prodigy and Genie and CompuService.  This was the early days of computing.  And you paid by the minute.

Start time: 286.56
End time: 308.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a video tech service. Oh, you paid for it.  You paid services by the minute with different tiered prices.  Usually it was actually newspapers that were actually operating these adult services.  You needed to be a real media to operate services, not directory assistance.  So the media was running the hookers.  Absurdly positive.  Yeah, well, that's France.

Transcript:  No, they're right on the floor.  On the floor.  I'll show you when we're done.  Also, and I'm really pleased to get Mike Elgin in here.  I've been following Mike for a long time.  Computer world, of course.  But his newsletter, which was kind of off and on and got very serious,  has just been, for years, a great resource for me on not only great tech stories,  but kind of the oddball stuff.  You've been just great at that.  And you have discovered and used Google+.  There's a handful of people who are really using Google+, effectively.  Trey Ratcliffe, Mike Elgin.  If you're not following Mike on Google+, you're missing out.  So it's great to have you, Mike.  It's so nice to see you.  Glad to be here.  Thank you for finally making it to Twitter.  And it's my fault, not yours.  I should have invited you long ago.  So a great panel to discuss a bunch of big stories.  There's Mike saying.  A bunch of big stories in the news.  And I don't know where to start.  I think we'll start.  I'm going to talk to San Francisco police in a bit.  The scandal.

Start time: 396.08
End time: 416.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a great story.  Should we start with?  No, I want to start with T-Mobile and AT&T, because really, that is the real tech story  of the week.  The Department of Justice earlier this week announcing that they were going to sue to  halt the $39 billion acquisition of T-Mobile by AT&T.  Were you shocked, Jeff Jarvis, to hear this?

Start time: 418.16
End time: 436.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was surprised.  You know, I think we've seen a lot of merger activity going on lately.  And why this would particularly get stopped, I'm not sure.  Yeah, there's less competition.  That's absolutely true.  But we take two sucky phone services and put them together.  Do we have one less sucky phone service?  I don't know.

Start time: 437.44
End time: 448.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am shocked because I just didn't think the DOJ did any trust anymore.  There hasn't been much action since George Bush entered the White House.  And yet, I think if you're going to pick one, this is the one.  Mike, you agree?

Start time: 449.64
End time: 464.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, first of all, I don't think the government's case is going to hold.  Really?  Yeah, I think it'll end up being...  I think this Judge Huvel is going to just say it's going to go sailing through.  However, it kind of smacks of election year, election season politics.

Start time: 464.28
End time: 470.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You think they're out taking you, so Obama's just gouging?  He's just trying to win an election.  Come on, let's get some money in.  Come on, you guys donate a little bit?

Start time: 470.36
End time: 474.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you mean he thinks that if he does this, he'll get some money out of AT&T?  Yeah.  No, no, no.

Start time: 476.12
End time: 487.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's happening is they went over the list of where they're vulnerable, and they said,  well, we haven't opposed anything.  We haven't stood up to our contributors.  AT&T is the biggest contributor to political organizations.  Oh, that's interesting.

Start time: 488.02
End time: 489.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you're just confirming my belief.

Start time: 490.24
End time: 494.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, they look tough, and they probably know they don't have a case anyway.

Start time: 495.66
End time: 553.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The U.S. District Judge Ellen Huvel of D.C. is known for not necessarily going with the  government in these antitrust cases.  Most recently, in 2001, she approved a merger between Comdisco and SunGuard that the government  had attempted to shut down, saying, in fact, there's no barrier to entry in the computer  security business.  And that's a good reason, frankly, to say, no, let this go through.  There's a huge barrier to entry in cell phone companies.  We have four, but that's a weak four.  If you have AT&T-T Mobile merging, that's the only GSM cell phone company in the States,  that's a monopoly.  It makes Sprint incredibly weak compared to AT&T and Verizon, probably a candidate for  being gobbled up.  And then you have two.  And I think that we have enough problems with lack of competition in the cell industry,  as is.  I love seeing this, and I hope that they block it.  Do you think Huvel will say yes to this?  I mean, say no to it?  She'll allow the merger?

Start time: 554.06
End time: 592.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I never said that.  God, I think that's terrible.  But as far as I'm concerned, and I've written about this in MarketWatch, PCMag, because  I hate AT&T, because they're basically a crummy company that does not serve the public well.  But aren't they all crummy companies?  These guys are particularly bad.  Yeah, they all are.  And so we don't need a consolidation anymore, because once this happens, it's going to be  further consolidated until eventually AT&T will own the whole place again.  They're back, baby.  They're back.  They just name AT&T, which they reacquired, because it's not really AT&T, but it's kind  of.  And they got the AT&T theory.  This should be stopped.

Start time: 593.01
End time: 597.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know who wants to stop?  You know who else wants to stop this?  T-Mobile.  They make a lot of money.  They make $3 billion.

Start time: 598.52
End time: 611.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  $3 billion plus spectrum plus the kill fee on this is huge.  That was $6.  Well, in effect, it's $6 because of the value of the spectrum.  It adds up to $6 or $7.  But yeah, $3 in cash.

Start time: 611.26
End time: 617.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They get big discounts on incoming calls to AT&T.  So they're praying that this will not.  That's a question.

Start time: 618.06
End time: 623.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why would AT&T agree to a kill fee that big?  I mean, they must have thought this is a no-brainer.  It was a slam dunk.

Start time: 624.23
End time: 647.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apparently.  But Leo, I think that one thing that we could get out of this is if Obama had the imagination  and the people had the imagination is to negotiate mobile net neutrality to make the deal go  putting Verizon and the Google deal, the devil's deal, into a difficult position there then.  But they won't do that.  But that's what I wish would happen is at least we'd get something out of this deal.

Start time: 647.66
End time: 708.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not unusual for this exact thing, scenario to occur.  The DOJ sues to block and then everybody sits down at the table and it's like a plea bargain.  A deal is made.  The government gets something that it wants.  These companies get the merger.  So what do you most want?  I think that we need competition.  I think that I use T-Mobile on a Google phone.  Losing T-Mobile would I think be a tragedy for users because already these companies  are rapacious.  They act like monopolies with their early termination fees.  You know, Verizon starts it by giving you 20 seconds of crap to leave a message.  Press 1 if you want to leave a fax.  A what?  And they go on and on and this is a blatant attempt to rack up the minutes.  Verizon does it and everybody goes hey that's a good idea.  So AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint do it.  These companies are monopolies.  They collude on prices.  If it weren't for the fact that T-Mobile and Sprint are also rands I don't think we'd see  competitive pricing from them.  Thank God we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to say the whole telephone industry in your country seems to be in a pretty sorry  state when you're a consumer.  So in France you have Orange?  We have Orange and NERF and Free and they're actually free which is a DSL computer.  How many companies are there?  I would say a dozen and four major.  That's what we need.  Four major meaning if we were in France right now you'd get a choice of getting DSL from  these dozen providers because they can each use each other's networks.  And it works the same.  I mean I come from the beautiful land of $50 all you can eat triple play with included phone  service for free and blah blah blah.  And fiber costs pretty much the same.

Start time: 774.22
End time: 781.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But in the wire, so it sounds like there's a little confusion among wireless companies  and phone companies and internet service providers.  They're all the same players?

Start time: 781.94
End time: 798.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pretty much.  Even Free who was just a DSL provider is now going to be a mobile operator and apparently  wants to come out with...  Who owns the Spectrum in France?  How does that work?  Do they share Spectrum?  Pretty much the same as here.  I mean the Spectrum is always a national treasure that you...  That is leased to these companies.

Start time: 798.78
End time: 802.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they're not sharing Spectrum?  They're all in their...  I mean how does that work?

Start time: 802.24
End time: 824.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good question.  They're all GSM.  There's no CDMA in France.  That's one advantage you have.  The chat room will correct me but I don't think there's even CDMA anywhere in Europe.  Maybe no, it's in Canada, some Asia...  Korea is all CDMA.  So everyone works on the same standards with the same phones which is real important.  I mean the whole debate about, oh there's no CDMA iPhone blah blah blah is not something  that's really important.

Start time: 824.54
End time: 826.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Phones are by law unlocked, right?

Start time: 826.69
End time: 839.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no.  They are locked when you buy them because you do get...  I mean the company sponsors the price of the phone when you buy it.  But they unlock in two years.  By law.  They have to unlock it if you ask within six months.  Six months.

Start time: 839.50
End time: 841.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have to offer it, right?  I mean is that...

Start time: 841.50
End time: 849.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They don't have to offer it but if you call them they'll just give you a code.  By law.  Six months.  And you can migrate your phone number to another company in less than a week.  They unlock phones here.

Start time: 850.55
End time: 868.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who unlocks phones here?  All of them.  Who?  I've had AT&T unlock a phone for me.  What?  You could call them up and say unlock this phone?  Yeah, once you pass your two-year contract.  Really?  Yeah.  And they give you this long code and they say, look, if you screw it up, you're going  to get screwed up three times, the phone is bricked.  So you have to be really careful.  It makes you freaked out.

Start time: 868.36
End time: 920.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's interesting.  I didn't know that you could do that.  I've taken it to independent cell phone sellers.  They sell for all of them and they have a little box and they'll do it.  But that's interesting.  Yeah.  Huh.  So if you beg them...  You just have to ask.  Nobody asks.  Fascinating.  So anything else to say about this?  I think the government finally did the right thing.  I hope that this isn't a cynical move on their part to win votes or perhaps make a deal.  I hope they hold their own and Judge Huvel sees the merit of this.  I can't think of a better example of a monopoly than these wireless carriers.  In fact, I wish Congress would grow some cojones and start doing something.  They keep making noise about doing something about ETFs.  They do nothing.  And these companies are among the worst.  Aren't they?  Am I wrong?  I think we concluded that already.  Doesn't everybody hate their wireless company?  All right.  Who likes it?

Start time: 921.21
End time: 923.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is Sama?  And worse is the chat room hates them too.

Start time: 924.68
End time: 962.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The biggest problem as far as I'm concerned is the fact that there's no solid ground in  terms of pricing.  You go there and they say, well, we subsidize your phone and you get two years service.  What's the value of two years of wireless service?  Nobody has any idea.  Thousands is what it cares.  So you go and you get a $500 phone for $200 subsidized and they end up charging you $1,000  for it because the rest of it is all buried inside that contract.  And this is why everything is going towards this subsidized model because with uncertainty  about pricing, they can charge anything they want.  And they all do it.  And there's really nobody's doing anything about it.  There's no transparency.  It's a big problem.

Start time: 962.46
End time: 1008.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd like the government to answer your question, Jeff, to both with internet service providers  or if the phone company and the cable companies and with these wireless providers, the same  thing which is foster competition by forcing these companies to allow other companies to  use their networks, provide affordable ways for MVNOs to use their networks to create  a virtual competition.  The cable companies right now are not required to allow other companies to ride on their  infrastructure.  The phone companies are.  I think we should make cable companies do that.  We need more internet service providers.  We need more wireless companies.  That's how you get competition.  That's how you get prices down.  That's in effect how you create net neutrality, not by regulation, but by competition, don't  you think?

Start time: 1009.68
End time: 1035.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, isn't that the white space's argument?  That's the argument that Google's made is that by taking the white space spectrum and  making it Wi-Fi on steroids that we would get competition that way.  And that's what I wish we would have, but we don't.  And Obama's going to give his job speech this week.  I've been thinking about this.  I really want instead of a works progress administration, kind of a works broadband administration.  We ought to be thinking of that as the growth of the country.

Start time: 1035.74
End time: 1049.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to get a little political just briefly.  So people who hate politics.  Stand back.  I will hear about this every single time because they say, no, talk tech.  You shouldn't talk politics.  But I want to, because when John's here, I like to talk about politics with John because  we're such natural adversaries.

Start time: 1050.90
End time: 1055.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not true at all.  We're actually on lockstep agreement with 99% of the...  That's probably true actually.

Start time: 1056.12
End time: 1070.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A friend of mine said Obama's out, easily out.  It's Rick Perry in...  Well, I'm asking you in 2012.  You picked, I think you did pretty well in the last election, picking a horse race.

Start time: 1070.98
End time: 1077.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you want my quick take?  You knew McCain would run.  Oh yeah.  And I also picked Sarah Palin way before anyone mentioned her.

Start time: 1077.62
End time: 1100.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm curious what your take is on 2012.  And here's why it's germane.  I think you're right.  I think this is politics, this T-Mobile lawsuit.  And I think we're going to see more of this.  And I think it does affect us.  And I don't think we're seeing much impressive movement from the government on net neutrality,  on deregulation, regulation rather, of the wireless industry.  So what do you think, John?

Start time: 1101.50
End time: 1113.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think both parties are trying to lose the election.  They're doing their best.  No, seriously.  I'm not kidding.  Because the Republicans want to run Rick Perry who can't win.  And the Democrats keep saying, no, no, no, run Romney, run Romney who can possibly win.

Start time: 1113.70
End time: 1116.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 1116.46
End time: 1129.46

And I think that's why the Republicans think they can run somebody as difficult to elect  as Rick Perry because it's going to be a very difficult election for President Obama.  Rick Perry's background is until 1988.

There's a big difference.  When we come back, I want to talk about the San Francisco Police Department and perhaps  the most appalling story in the history of technology.  But first...  You think that'll keep them listening?  I got to be careful with the teases.  If I tease too well, they'll sip right through the ad.  They'll say, well, I got to hear that story and they'll skip the ad.  I think...  Well, yeah, that could happen.  Actually, the ad...  Stay tuned for the most exciting ad we've ever done on This Week in Tech.  I want to talk about GoToMyPC briefly.  GoToMyPC is the remote access product we've talked about for so long from Citrix.  I've got a 30-day trial for you.  I'll tell you how to do that in a second.  I think one of the cool things about GoToMyPC is that you don't have to...  Look at this guy, Mike Elgin.  He is now the second person in a row on Twitter to not be using a laptop but to be using an  iPad with a keyboard.  He's bringing along...  More and more people are doing this.  And what's interesting, I think, is that he can use GoToMyPC on that iPad to access a  Windows or Mac computer at the office.  So now you've got the missing link that turns your iPad into a full-blown computer.  You could do anything you want to do, send and receive email, run any Windows or Mac  program right from your iPad, access any network resource.  You get the best of both worlds, that absolute lightweight freedom and all the power you  need.  Sets up in minutes.  No IT support is required.  Now you can access all your documents and applications on your home or office computer  anywhere you go.  Don't you love that?  Try it free for 30 days.  Visit GoToMyPC.com.  Click the Try It Free button.  The offer code is...  By the way, the app for the iPad free.  A lot of companies will charge you for the service and then charge you more for the iPad  app.  That drives me crazy.  This is free.  You get the iPad app.  In fact, you could actually sign up from the iPad app.  Probably the easiest way to do this is if you've got an iPad, download the iPad app  and then go into it and get the free trial.  Just make sure you use the offer code TWIT when you do.  GoToMyPC.com.  All right.  I'm going to see if I can get the chronology of this story right because it's so dang complicated.  CNET reported this, I think it was on Thursday.  They said, whoa, a guy walks into a bar, an Apple employee walks into a bar, a tequila  bar in San Francisco, leaves minus one thing, the next iPhone.  We'll call it for one of a better name.  Coincidentally.  The iPhone 5.  They say, CNET says that San Francisco police are investigating, along with Apple, this  missing iPhone.  It's SF Weekly, which is a tabloid, free tabloid in San Francisco, but they're kind of muck  rakers.  They're kind of, you know...  They have a good recall.  Their product is quite good.  Now that we have no actual newspapers in San Francisco, it's nice to have the Weekly,  right?  You've seen what happened to your old paper, The Examiner, right, Jeff?  It's sad.

Start time: 1405.82
End time: 1476.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's true.  We still have the Chronicle or the Comical, as some call it.  But anyway, SF Weekly calls.  They do the one thing that CNET, I guess, forgot to do.  They call the San Francisco Police Department.  They say, we don't know what the hell you're talking about.  We're not doing any investigation.  So they publish that story.  Then it gets weird.  Then it gets weird.  San Francisco Police Department says, oh, next day.  Oh, wait a minute.  Yes, we did.  So long story short, it looks like what happened, according to the SFPD, is that three or four  SFPD officers accompanied two Apple private security officials...  Posing as police.  Apparently posing as police to a man's home.  Of course, they tracked the iPhone using GPS, they thought, to this home in San Francisco.  Sergio Calderon, he's 22 years old.  The SFPD says, we dispatched some plainclothes officers to accompany the Apple investigators  to the person's home.  They didn't go in.  Apparently, according to Calderon, the Apple investigators, whether explicitly or by omission,  inferred that they were SFPD, showed badges.

He says they threaten him.  They're saying, is everybody here legal?  You could be in deep trouble.  That's the worst of it.  Assuming that Calderon's not making this up.  Because this is all his story.  He says, I never possessed it.  They found no iPhone.  They found no trace of an iPhone.  However, you've got to wonder, first of all, if these Apple...  They left a phone number.  This actually confirms the story a little bit.  Because they left him a phone number.  The guy said, and my name is Tony.  If you find anything, please call me.  Calderon gives the San Francisco Weekly Tony's card.  It turns out Tony is in fact an Apple employee.  Anthony Colon, he is a former police officer who works at Apple.  He knows how to fake it.  Yeah.  He looks just like a cop.  Big beef, he's got a donut.  I'm going to be in so much trouble the next time I go to San Francisco.

I thought they were SFPD.  That's why I left them in.  I would not have permitted the search if I had known these weren't police officers.  So here's the question.  SFPD denies it at first and says, yeah, okay, maybe that happened.  Let me just ask you.  If John C. DeVora came to the SFPD and said, hey, somebody got my laptop, would you come with me to the guy's house?  Would they accompany you to the guy's house?

But a judge in a case that Darlene found where a woman was using an allegedly stolen laptop to do sex chat and the sex chat was shared then with the authorities, that was viewed to be a violation of her privacy.  Even though it was a stolen laptop.  And Apple, you know, what amazes me about this story.

End time: 1661.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're suing, by the way, in that case.  The couple that was chatting sex.  Well, it's a longer story than that because she didn't know it was stolen.  She bought it in the parking lot.  She bought a laptop for 60 bucks.  It was a school laptop.  The school was monitoring the laptop with LoJack.  Now they're suing the LoJack folks because LoJack operatives were watching these guys have this sex chat.

But he would, you know, there's a lot of blame about Apple on this and there's some blame to go around.  But this is really about police misconduct.  Absolutely.  You know, to request participation in an illegal search is constitutionally protected.

The guy was an Apple guy, so he must have had the phone and turned it off.  And of course you can't, what are you going to do? Tear the guy's place apart to find the phone?

No, no, no, Jeff. This wasn't SFPD.  It was the Dusseldorf Regional Court.

Boy, did he get a scoop.  MG Siegler TechCrunch says the Amazon Kindle tablet is very real.  I've seen it. I've played with it.  Now, that's a hell of a scoop.  He says it'll be called the Amazon Kindle. It's 7-inch capacitive touchscreen.  It runs Android, but no Android you've ever seen before because Amazon has completely redesigned the user interface.  There are no buttons.  There are no buttons.  Because there's no Google Apps. There's no Google Marketplace. There's no Google anywhere.  Apparently, Google isn't involved in this at all. They just took the open source Android and mucked with it.  He says it looks a little bit like a BlackBerry Playbook in terms of form factor, which actually is what that Samsung looks like as well.  7-inch tablets seem to be all kind of similar.

I'm a Prime member and I think Amazon Prime is the best marketing thing I've ever heard of in my life.  Yeah, I love the free shipping.  Yeah, because it's 89... you pay them for the privilege of having two-day shipping for free.  And it means that you just buy everything from Amazon. From now on.  So here's a prediction.

Because Moore's Law is going to bring the costs down. And this is a spectacularly subsidizable device.  Its entire function is to get you to spend money on Amazon.  It's a doorway to Amazon.  Exactly. It's free shipping for electronic media.

The book reader is a Kindle app. The music player is Amazon's cloud player.  The movie player is Amazon's instant video player. The app store is Amazon's app store.

Now that it's so easy to order digital instead of actual all the time,  you're reducing the shipping costs and the inventory costs and all this huge cost structure for Amazon.  It's brilliant. The more they can get us to do this, the better.  And again, even if you don't get this, you'll still do the same things on your iPad.

I want to talk a little bit about squarespace.com, the secret behind exceptional websites.  We use Squarespace for our Inside Twit blog, and I'm so impressed.  That thing never goes down.  All of you go to inside.twit.tv.  You cannot bring that site down.  And that just speaks to their hosting.  But Squarespace is more than just the best web hosting in the world.  It's also the best content management software running on top of that.  And why do you want to do that?  Well, they keep it up to date.  Automatic updates, automatic security fixes.  It's the best content management software out there.  It's really spectacular.  And it has all the features you're looking for.  You can import from the major APIs.  Major APIs, movable type, WordPress, type pad, and blogger.  But you're not just importing the post.  You're getting all the links, all the images, all the comments.  Your SEO is preserved.  The links are actually not even changed.  And you can export it back out so you're never trapped.  Their iPhone and iPad app is spectacular.  What a great way to not only post, but moderate comments.  Even look at your statistics.  And boy, do they have a stats package.  You can tell exactly what people are doing when they visit your site.  All the links.  The SEO is fantastic.  They have site maps.  All the stuff that you need to get the best possible Google rankings.  And this is all automatic.  If you want to include your social content, like your Twitter, or your Flickr, or your Facebook,  it's all easy to do, just like the rest of the design tools.  They're point and click, drag and drop.  Couldn't be easier.  Twitter, look at that.  In fact, even just any arbitrary RSS.  But I'm just giving you, I'm just scratching the surface.  The best thing to do is to go to squarespace.com right now.  And you see that green button?  You can try it free.  You don't need a credit card.  You don't need an offer code.  You just press that button.  You need three things.  A name for your site.  A password and your email address.  And for the next two weeks, you get a full, complete trial of Squarespace.  Nothing is inhibited or no watermarks.  You get the full site.  And this is the best way to see if this is right for you.  This is what I want you to do.  Now, if you decide to buy, I do encourage you to use our Twitter offer code,  which is twit9, T-W-I-T-9, because they'll take 10% off for the first six months  of your site.  So that's worthwhile.  Sites start as little as $12 a month.  That's hosting and the best software out there.  Squarespace, these are great guys.  They do a great product.  It's a secret behind exceptional websites.  And I just looked at the numbers.  They are our number one advertiser now on Twitter.  So we're very happy to have them along.  They keep this show on the road.  Thank you, Squarespace.  And if you want to support Twit, I'd really appreciate it if you'd visit squarespace.com  and give it a try today.

These guys get great scoops.  Mike Arrington is a character.  Mike Arrington is a character.  He's really adept at writing posts that just ... For me, my head turns red and steam comes out of my ears.  Or you go, wow, I can't believe he said that.  When AOL bought him, I thought this is a mismatch.  Were you talking about the screw you, Mike Arrington?  That one.  The guy I said screw you to.  I like Mike.  We've talked since then.  I think Mike's great.  He's funny.  I saw him at food camp.  He says, I don't know.  Should I shake your hand?  I don't know.  Are you going to hit me?

Transcript:  That's what's interesting.  Normally this is what happens.  Jeff, you acquire a company and then there's a deal that says you have to work for us for  three years or some period.  Reasonably because TechCrunch is Mike Arrington.  And a non-compete.  And a non-compete.  I think from day one Mike Arrington did everything he could to get fired.  What does he do?  He says to him, he says the number one property at AOL is Engadget.

Transcript:  They had an AOL company memo that was circulated.  It said, don't whatever you do.  This is our new AOL, some AOL chat service.  And immediately he publishes it.  He's just like, of course I'm going to publish this.  I'm TechCrunch to prove his independence.  But I think also he's trying to get out of there.  So finally, then he announces, I'm going to invest in the company's recovery.

Start time: 3508.14
End time: 3520.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's been in trouble.  He has an earn out clause in his contract and the sale of TechCrunch.  So there's a lot of money to be lost for him if he doesn't go up to the end of whatever the contract says.  Of course.

Start time: 3521.10
End time: 3524.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 3524.10

Start time: 3544.82
End time: 3575.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, even that, it's still confused, I think, as to whether or not he's fired or not from Huffington Post at AOL.  But he does have a fund.  And full disclosure is he called me today and I talked to him, but just kind of he calls me on journalistic stuff.  And I didn't learn anything specific about this.  But, you know, here's a fund here that AOL has invested in along with a lot of top VC firms.  They're like half, they put half the money in.  They've got like 20 million in there.  That's not your kiss-off.  You know, that ain't your kiss-off.  It's put money into investing the guy.

Start time: 3576.81
End time: 3591.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the fund is Crunch Fund.  It's a 20 million dollar investment fund in...  Yeah, I hope it does better than the tablet, the juju.  And, by the way, this is exactly what you're not supposed to do.  He's investing in the companies he covers.  He says, well, I won't write about him.

Transcript:  He's got some...  It's corrupt.  He's saying, you know what, his first response to this a couple of months ago was, eh, all journalists are corrupt.  At least you know I'm corrupt.  Or at least...  You know what he said?  He basically, he said everybody has a reason.  You know, they're sleeping with somebody or, you know, everybody has conflict of interest.  With me, you know.  Now, of course, by the way, when he said they're married to,  it was a direct prod of Kara Swisher who is, at all things digital,  is in fact married to a high level Google executive.  But Kara discloses.  But it was clearly aimed at her.

Start time: 3629.53
End time: 3659.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's Mike.  The thing about TechCrunch is, let's not forget where it started.  I mean, you know, Arrington's Arrington, and Arrington can be difficult even more than John C. Dvorak.  But he started by being a venture investor who happened to write a blog about the firms for a reason.  And though it became more of a media property and though it shifted,  and though it works for Ariana and she wants to be journalistic and all that,  in terms of where Arrington started, where he is now is no different.  But now he's investing.

Transcript:  Jeff wrote a brilliant post on Google Plus about what is journalism.  And everybody's got to read this.  It's one of the most interesting things I've read there for a long time.  But I'm going to disagree with something, and I think I'm really in the minority on this,  which is that I don't think blogging is journalism.  I think there should be a much greater effort to separate journalism from blogging.  I think blogging is water-cooler conversation.  As an analogy, if you go back to a time when we all understood journalism better,  in 1960 or something like that, you'd read the paper, you'd have experiences,  you'd go to work and you'd chit-chat about what you read and what you did.  And that's really what blogging should be.  The problem is that the public is confused about it.  The public thinks that blogs are journalism.  I think blogs are journalism.  But they shouldn't be.  I don't think that's true.  There's a spectrum of what's actually published on blogs.  Everything from something that's a lot like journalism or even better than journalism,  the majority of it is just people just spouting off on random things.  Why can't you call it journalism?  Like this?  Because what we're doing right now.  Exactly.  This is journalism?  This is a blog.  We're talking about journalism, which is one of the things that blogs are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But if we were saying something about, let's say, AT&T and I were a major...  I had millions of dollars invested in AT&T, it would behoove me to disclose that, yes.  And Mike does that.  And then I guess what you're saying is trust the audience to say,  oh, well, we have to take this with a grain of salt.

Start time: 3768.83
End time: 3780.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what Mike says.  In response to my post on Google+, a guy named, I think, Sass,  wrote a good post saying that you shouldn't trust anyone,  journalists or anyone else.  That's Mike's position.

Transcript:  Anyway, so if I read a newspaper like the New York Times,  I have certain expectations about how they source the information.  They make mistakes like everybody else.  But they're trying to live up to an ideal, which you mentioned, Jeff, in your piece,  of journalism and journalistic integrity and so on.  If they find somebody who's crossed the line, they go after them and all that kind of stuff.  I expect that when I read the New York Times.  When I go to a blog, I shouldn't expect that.  Some people expect...  I do both.  I do journalism and I also do blogging.  And I really switch hats there.  When I'm doing journalism, I'm like...  There's a long list of things that I do because this is journalism.  When I go blog, I'm just spouting off about stuff.  And the people reading my blog shouldn't be...

Transcript:  You know, entering an age used to be, back in...  before my time, by the way, in the 1800s, the papers used to be very partisan.  There used to be the...  Yellow journalism.  No, before that was the Santa Rosa Democrat.  It was the such-and-such...  The paper was a Democrat paper in town.  It was a Republican paper.  No, they were broadsheets.  They were polemic.  They would go after each other.  Yeah.  Now, then they came up with the Columbia...  So, Jeff, you're the professor of journalism.

Start time: 3976.49

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When did we...  How did this happen that we got this notion of the journalist as the...  you know, independent reporter of facts?  Is that a rel...  Is that pretty recent?

Start time: 3987.10
End time: 4069.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it is very recent.  It's the last half century or so.  And it came when TV killed the second, third, the Democrat, Republican papers.  You end up with one paper.  That paper had to serve all.  It was a market decision to serve everybody.  Meanwhile, TV, of course, isn't really news.  Right.  It's its own separate thing.  So you got this tapioca versus in the UK where you have the Guardian on the left  and the Telegraph on the right, and you can triangulate,  and everyone knows their perspective,  and you can hold them to the intellectual honesty of what they do.  Here, I think we...  Objectivity is a lie.  It doesn't exist.  It never did.  It's part of the priesthood we have.  And part of my story, part of my point of the potion I wrote,  and thank you very much, Mike, for saying nice things,  is that if you look at the combination of Arrington  and then Jay Rosen went after Henry Blodgett for using anonymous sources.  Henry came back and said, it's how I get the truth.  You look at Irene coverage on cable, which,  forget the overhype question, it was underreported.  You look at what's happening with WikiLeaks right now.  What I'm going to commit to coming to is I think that we in journalism  get so much with our knickers and knots about what is journalism,  whereas the world says, what's information?  What do I need to know today?  And Mike Arrington delivers information.  Henry Blodgett delivers information.  Whether they do it under the canons of journalism,  well, that's really a separate question.

Transcript:  Just as newspapers responded to the threat of television  and the fact there was a single journalist,  a newspaper in town with this kind of objectivity,  I think that now we're seeing a response to the fact that facts are devalued.  They're available widely.  The Internet makes facts available to anyone who seeks them out.

Transcript:  I think it means that the fact is everywhere.  So analysis and context is more important than fact.  Oh, I see.  You see what I'm saying?  So the factual matter, which is what supposedly the objective reporter gives you,  is here's the facts you decide.  That's gone because we can all get the facts.  Now it's really a matter of how do we understand this?  What does it mean?  What's the context?  And that's why shows like this, which really are,  we do no reporting on this show.  It's all analysis.  But that's valuable, isn't it?

It's a wonderful platform that enables people in a Nigerian election  or in a Washington blizzard or in Haiti to use a map  and put up points of data about what's happening.  It's crowd-sourced information.  It really is.  And I consider that journalism.  I consider that the future of journalism,  creating a platform where the community can share its own information.  Now, others say, no, it's not, because it doesn't have a story.  It doesn't have the analysis.  It doesn't have this, it doesn't have that.  I think of the opposite.  I think this is how journalism has to think, is in creating platforms.  And we in technology and entrepreneurship, that's where the world goes.  It's not about control anymore.  It's about enablement.

Transcript:  Well, and Tim O'Reilly would say platform is everything.  Government should be a platform.  It's all a platform for us to use then in a kind of democratic fashion.  The one thing that's missing from all of that,  if reportage is just the ability to sift through facts  and come up with a series of facts through something like Google algorithmically,  who does investigative reporting?  Who digs?  Who presses?  Is there no one to do that anymore?  Is that gone?

When I questioned the future of journalism,  one of our former students came into my blog post and got mad at me  and said, well, what does your journalism school stand for then?  Well, it should stand for asking questions.  It should stand for breaking the old assumptions, I think.

Transcript:  When I worked on the midnight shift, the struggle trip,  there was a guy named Billy Garrett who worked the desk.  Immusible, not ineffable.  The phone would ring and somebody would say,  Billy would get on the phone and they'd say,  we're having a debate in the bar.  I'll bet.  What's this?  And Garrett's rule was always give them an answer,  preferably the wrong one.  Because he imagined that as soon as the phone hung up,  the next morning they had a huge bar brawl and he caused it and he giggled at it.  How did you find out facts in the old days?

Transcript:  And you know the great thing about Wikipedia is not to interrupt him.  Nobody agrees with each other.  He's just trying to be contrarian.  Me?  So the thing that gets me about the book of knowledge is that you go to Wikipedia and you look something...  You'll find like if some guy just got shot and you look him up...  Yeah, it's there.  It's there because there are certain people that have decided to dog the topic.  And in fact, one thing people don't realize is that if you go to some people's page and they have a topic dog,  and you go and change a bunch of things, the guy gets an RSS feed immediately saying,  this has been changed on your page, and the guy goes back and switches it back.

Transcript:  I love them.  Stay tuned.  That's coming up next.  But first, a word from audible.com.  Yes, we do have a sponsor for this segment and it's the best darn bookstore on the internet.  Owned by Amazon.  You know, one of the things they've done with the Kindle, and I'm sure the new Kindle will  do this too, is when you go to your Kindle books on the Kindle, it also shows all your  audible books.  Now I've been an audible member for more than 10 years, so I have 500 plus great audio books  in my audible list in the library.  Now the nice thing about this is any book you've ever bought from audible is available  to you forever.  So it's like a real bookshelf where you can go back and say, oh man, that I haven't read  that book in ages.  Let's read it again.  Seventy five thousand titles, fiction, nonfiction, history.  If you like science fiction, they've done such a great job.  They've got a whole audible frontiers program to record.  They've nine studios in the audible headquarters now to record audio books of classics in science  fiction that nobody ever recorded because there was no money to be made.  Great Robert Heinlein books and Isaac Asimov books.  Of course, if you're into the Game of Thrones, they've got that.  In fact, I highly recommend it before next season.  You've got to read Clash of Kings because you've got to read these before they go on TV, in  my opinion.  If you're a true blood fan, they've got the Sookie Stackhouse novels.  It's all there.  I just was at the Dexter set on Friday.  That was so much fun.  And of course, Dexter is based on a classic book.  You can get the All the Dexter Stories by Jeff Lindsay on audible.com.  So if you're a fan of the Dexter TV show, read the books.  You'll love them.  I think Darkly Dreaming Dexter, the first one, was the one they based the series on.  Audible is just a great resource.  And here's the deal.  Maybe, you know, life is busy nowadays in the 21st century where, you know, it's hard to find time to read.  But we all spend time when we would read if we could in the gym, in the car, on our commute, washing dishes, cleaning.  There's lots of stuff where if you had it, you could listen to it.  And that's where this is so great for me.  I get reading done hours a day that I wouldn't get otherwise.  It plays in all your portable devices, all the iDevices, the Kindle, even many GPS devices.  If you've seen the movie The Help, the book is even better.  You got it.  You got to get it.  Audible.com.  Now, here's the deal.  If you go to audible.com slash twit two, you're going to get two, not one, but two books to listen to.  So go to audible.com, browse around all these amazing books.  I'm reading right now.  I'm a big David McCullough fan.  And I am reading his latest, which is a really fantastic book about Americans who went to Paris in the 1830s and 40s.  There was an exodus because Paris was the seat of culture when America was still an upstart nation.  And this is such a wonderful book, The Greater Journey, Americans in Paris.  If you love Paris, I'm going back to Paris for the web in December.  So I love reading about Paris, especially Paris in the 1830s.  You know, the Louvre was already a museum by the 1830s.  You don't say.  You heard of this.  I guess they threw the king out of the palace.  They had to do something.  Hey, we'll put some...  Well, I didn't know this, but Louis Philippe was a collector of great paintings.  He bought the Mona Lisa and many other paintings and brought them to the Louvre.  Even then, they talk about the great painting that was painted of the Louvre by the American painter.  And his name has gone out of my head now.  But it's just a wonderful story.  I'm not a Thang of Hawthorne, not Alva Wendell Holmes.  James Fenimore Cooper was there.  Ralph Waldo Emerson.  Just really amazing book.  But take your pick.  You get two of them, audible.com slash twit2.  You'll sign up for the platinum account.  That's two books a month.  You can cancel it any time.  And the books will be yours to keep forever and ever.

Transcript:  I love it. I went on something that I called the Google Plus diet.  And the reason was self-preservation.  I was on so many social networks, and I had a blog and a newsletter and all these different things.  And I wrote a column saying, oh, Google Plus is so flexible, you can do everything on Google Plus.  And then after I wrote the column, I thought, well, if it's so great, why aren't I doing it?  So you ate your own dog food?  I ate my own dog food, and now everything comes out of my Google Plus account.  My newsletter is actually automatically produced.  Really?  Really. I'm using MailChimp and RSS, and it just goes out by itself.  I don't touch anything.  That's very cool.  Weekly and a daily version, I could do an hourly version.

And I used to have my content spread out all over, and everybody thought I was just one part of the elephant.  Now I'm putting the whole elephant in one place, and it's like, wow, this is a lot of stuff.  So it's really working for me, and I think it's going to be around for a long time.

Transcript:  I do too. I really like it.  I see some people like Mike, like Trey Ratcliffe, using it so effectively that I really think that there is something going on here.  That this is more than just a blogging platform or a social platform.  When you get engagement on Google Plus, it completely dwarfs everything else.  You've been doing this on other platforms.  I'm sure you agree that you're getting much more engagement there than anywhere else.

Transcript:  It's going to be like the Google Wave. What was that other thing?  No, no, no. The great strength of Google Plus is that, for example, even if I'm inside Gmail or a Google Doc,

Start time: 5338.52
End time: 5361.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I still get notifications. I can look at what people have just posted.  I can even reply or add a friend whilst never leaving my Google Doc or the email I was typing.  This is so immensely powerful.  And the fact that you can link to a post, that these posts are going to go way up into search results.  I mean, we've only seen the beginning of it. It's not even public yet. Not everyone can really sign up.

Start time: 5362.76

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, in fact, lots of different groups are banned from Google Plus right now.  Brands.  Brands, people between 13 and 18, I think it is.  People with strange names.  Pseudonymous people.  Exactly. Well, even people whose real names are a little odd.  Do they end up getting blocked?  Well, right now, the high profile people...

Start time: 5382.20
End time: 5385.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. And there are people with very strange names who are not famous, and they're just out of luck.  They're just out of luck. That just violates...  There's a really interesting Australian podcast where both the podcaster and his guest have real names that violate their policies.  And neither of them are on Google Plus.

Transcript:  How is that a good thing?  I'll tell you why it's a good thing. It's not a good thing for them. It's a terrible thing for them.  Well, then how is that a good thing?  Because it does mean that the people who are on Google...  Now, this is a conversation we've had on Twig a lot, Jeff, so chime in.  But it does mean that the people who are on Google Plus are real people.  It raises the level of discourse. Well, I guess you could lie.

Transcript:  I guarantee you right now I could go on there with the name John Davis and set up an account, do a lot of chatting, and do whatever I want, and I'm not a real person.

Start time: 5429.52
End time: 5459.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The solution to this is really simple and easy, actually. And Google pretends like this solution doesn't exist.  The solution is that you give Google your real name with a credit card, some verified process...  Oh, it's like a porn site.  But then you get to use a pseudonym. And you inform other people that it's a pseudonym.  So when I go to follow somebody, it's like, oh, here's John whatever, and it's a pseudonym.  So I can choose, okay, I don't want any pseudonym people, so I'm not going to follow... or maybe I don't care.

Start time: 5460.14
End time: 5469.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  I'm finding that the quality of discourse on Google+, I compared a post I put on both my blog and Google+,  and I got to say it's not always the case.  The post I did today had good discourse, but Google+, generally, has better discourse.  You know, part of the disadvantage of Google+, is it's not lasting. It's very fleeting. It goes away.  You can't really search it, which is ironic. So I don't know why...

Start time: 5500.16
End time: 5503.08

End time: 5523.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. They will, yeah.  Unfortunately.  Why? Well, you don't like the idea.  Well, I think, again, I think that should be a matter of choice, but one of the...  I forgot who it is that is really driving this idea, but one of the...  You know, you need to be able to forget stuff eventually.  I mean, you know, this thing about keeping on to everything you say for 20 years...  I kind of agree with you. It is evanescent, really.

Transcript:  I just don't think it has all the elements of it.  What did you think about Twitter when you first saw it?  I liked Twitter. I got onto it really early.  Did you?  Well, I mean, the first time I saw it, it was another piece of...  You mocked it.  I always mock you, so what?  You mocked everything.  So I don't think it's a social...  It doesn't function as a social network with all the kind of crazy elements of unfriending and creating an actual social structure.  It's just basically like you said.  That's why we like it.  Yeah, that's why you like it because you don't want to get involved in anything that's actually social.  Because you don't even answer your email, for God's sake.  So I think it doesn't work as a social network.  I think it works for what these guys are using it for, sure.  And it's like Twitter, you know, has a certain value, but it's not a social network in the sense that Facebook is.  Facebook is an actual force of nature.  Do you use Facebook a lot?  I don't use Facebook at all.

Women are more social than men.  In general, I grant you that.  According to Social Statistics...  Somebody says it's funny.  According to socialstatistics.com, the ratio is 86% men...  There you go.  ...to 12% women to 1% other.  And here you go.  I think the other is giant cocks and furries.  You said it.  God, I'm going to have to edit this show.

I think it's very interesting, and I think it's encouraging that Google,  who has had a series of bad failures like Wave and Buzz,  actually could learn something from those  and do something that at least works for now.  Well, I'm going to talk to Mike after the show

Start time: 5738.84
End time: 5764.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's still like the pulse of the Internet.  It's so fast to go through.  It is live.  It is time-based.  You see things in a chronological order,  which is not the case on Google Plus,  where you see stuff depending on the number of comments or likes, etc., etc.  So, I mean, for following things live, Twitter is still the best.  Twitter is where people knew that you were on YouPorn.  I'm not sure people on Google Plus realized that.

Start time: 5764.56
End time: 5781.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But here's what people need to realize.  Which is a good thing.  There's no reason to use Twitter,  because if you use Google Plus and then hook in Twitter to Google Plus,  then everything you post on Google Plus instantly shows up on Twitter.  I think Twitter is going to become an empty shell  where everything is just automatically dumped into it,  kind of like Buzz was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I say something extremely controversial?  I think Twitter has become a little bit more urban.  It is no longer the geeks.  If you look at...  These are the trending topics US-wide right now on Twitter.  Except the promoted one, which is a geek story.  Team Bieber is a beast.  Happy birthday, Beyonce.  Daddy's little girls.  Dirty Bieber secrets.  I really hate when and stop bragging about...  It has become...  It's all about celebrity culture.  These look like...  It's trash.  This has become the TMZ of social media.

End time: 5845.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

But during Irene, I found that no one was discussing it on Google Plus,  and you can't gather around a hashtag,  you can't gather around a search topic.  Whereas to discuss an ongoing news story like that as it was occurring,  or the East Coast earthquake, which we really overdid,  but Twitter was the place for that.

Start time: 5896.64
End time: 5914.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For that kind of news and for earthquakes, things like that,  Twitter is just like you get it instantly.  It's awesome for that.  But I think that the minority of information out there is natural disasters  and things like that are really real-time breaking stories.  I just think that it's, John mentioned crowdsourcing, Google Plus.  I post something on Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no. I was there. He didn't say that.  He was talking to Mark Benioff at Dreamforce.  They had sort of a fireside chat.  And someone at Bloomberg thought he heard Eric Schmidt say,  I stayed on the Apple Board until I couldn't stand the board anymore.  Wow.  No, what he really said was until I couldn't stay on the board anymore,  meaning when Google launched Android, et cetera, et cetera.  But he...  It felt weird because Schmidt just said that he thought that Steve Jobs  had done the best jobs as a CEO of any CEO in the last 50 to 100 years.  So it was a misunderstanding.

Transcript:  So, here's how it works.  A guy, well, Leah Gibbs from South Wales, which is in the UK.  She's 23 years old.  She met a guy named Adam Minton on Facebook and said,  Let's go out on a date.  She hoped they would spend their first date watching a DVD at Minton's house.  When Gibbs arrived, Minton told her he needed to see a friend  and asked whether she might drive him to see, said friend.  Apparently, there was no friend, and instead she drove him to an off-track betting shop  where he threatened the staff with a kitchen knife and took off with the cash,  leaping back into her car, telling her, go, go, go.
