Actually, you started at O&JJ Stone O Doctor because you came to town.

Start time: 172.00
End time: 212.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am to blame and I appreciate the blame being put upon me.  When the doctor comes to town, it's a party.  Look at this.  There's like 9,000 people on the other side of these cameras.  They'll never know.  What do you call that thing on your head?  So do you know, so I'm wearing a jersey that is not my own.  And what happens is people know that I'm a Philly guy.  That's an NFL jersey, Howie Long.  Howie Long, representing Oakland right now.  Yeah, I like it.  So this is the fanatic, the Philly fanatic.  Is it?  Not gritty.  No, no, not gritty, just a fanatic.  This represents my Philly hood so they know that I'm out here representing both sides.  So that's what you do for the eyes.  Would you call that a do rag or just a do band?  I think they call it a fanatic band.  Because of the eyes, like when I bought it.

Start time: 213.80

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pull it down over your eyes just for a minute, just so we can see what it would...  Yeah, it's perfect.  You could be a Mexican wrestler.

Start time: 221.00
End time: 231.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If I could pull my mask on and just rob someone right now, like is your studio in the studio?  Because I will burglarize it.  Yeah, take my studio, please.  That's a good look.

Start time: 232.05
End time: 259.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good time.  Oh well.  Also with us sitting, this is so awesome, I'm so in love with this, sitting in the studio.  Also, Ian Thompson from theregister.com.  We brought in all our favorites today.  Let's have fun, right?  Good to see you, Ian.  Oh, it was a pleasure.  Watch.  Oh, I could touch him.  He's a person.  He's a person, he's not an avatar, he's not imaginary.  Loved having you, it's great to see you.  And from SixColors.com, a guy who's probably pretty busy right now, Jason Snell.

Start time: 260.16

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I barely fit at this table, there's so many people at it.  It's huge.  I know.  I once hosted an episode of either Twitter, MacBreak Weekly, where I was the only human  being in here and it was all boxes.  Welcome to my life for the last two years.  It's terrible, it's very disconcerting to not have humans around you.  Much harder.

Start time: 275.20
End time: 287.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People don't understand.  I mean, because the sound quality is good and if you're only listening, and even with  the avatars, you almost feel like somebody's there as you're watching at home, but what  you're missing is there's no interpersonal communication, there's no body language.

Start time: 288.50
End time: 302.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't just toss ideas backwards and forwards.  I found this in the office environment as well.  I think one of the things the pandemic has really shown up is the real failings of video  and IM as a way of keeping team casiveness together.

Start time: 302.50
End time: 308.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If there's any reason people might want to come back to work, it's that.  No more of this.  No more zooming.  Who's zooming whom?

Start time: 308.98
End time: 356.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At the same time, as men who are older, imagine if this would have happened in 1980, what  would you have done?  Who are you going to call?  You'd be sitting on the phone.  So as bad as it was, not great.  At least we have the technology now to deal with things.  Yes, it is great to see you, but technically we've never met before in person, but I know  you.  You know each other.  So it's such a weird thing because, yes, back into the world, enjoy the world, but  thank goodness we had what we had, even in the failings, to be able to use those tools.  Yin and yang on that, but great to be back in person and still drinks from the fridge.  Someone at Twitter, if you're missing two of the lemonade, blueberry things, it was Leo.  That's for you.

Start time: 356.50
End time: 396.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, in fact, if you want alcoholic beverages, adult beverages, you're more than welcome.  We could do that.  I have some nice cognac.  I have some Reposado Mezcal.  You do have good things.  We have booze.  In fact, I hate to say it, our entire marketing team is in-house.  Michael O'Donnell, at photos on the Twitter is here.  He's a pro photo.  Whenever we can have people in the studio, we get him so we have real pictures for the  website.  Anthony Nielsen is here wielding the Steadicam for I don't know what, some sort of back of  the scene.  He's doing good work over there.  He's good.  But he's also a great mixologist.  So if you have an urge for something.

Start time: 397.06
End time: 402.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Find me the most expensive thing and make it to go.  I'll take a slurpee cup.

Start time: 404.59
End time: 409.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ashley is also here in our marketing department.  So obviously this is a red-letter day for something.

Start time: 410.03
End time: 417.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're back in person, baby.  I'm going to put a little effort over here.  Get it while it's getting as good until they shut us back down again.

Start time: 417.92
End time: 437.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I kind of feel like this could be just another brief interregnum.  Let's do what we can, at the very least.  Well, anyway, we're so glad.  I don't have to tell you to turn original audio on or anything.  This is great.  This is great!  Mac Studio came on Friday for some of us.  You got your Mac Studio?

Start time: 438.70
End time: 441.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I got a review unit so I've had it a week before.

Start time: 442.14
End time: 456.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So actually, good.  This is good because I noticed that the embargoes were lifted Thursday, the day before they arrived  for real people.  6 a.m.  So all the YouTubers, I was amazed how many YouTubers got Mac Studios from Apple.  Like, dozens.  People I never heard of.

Start time: 456.64
End time: 473.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're kind of the target audience, though.  Apple really tries to get people's hands on them who are going to be able to appreciate them.  And the studio has enough power.  I think they figure that people who work in video every day are people who are going to  be able to put it through its paces and raise the speed of a Final Cut Pro or whatever.

Start time: 473.50
End time: 480.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The unkind interpretation would be, give it to people who have no journalistic ethics  who will say, hey, look what Apple sent me.  Isn't this great?

Start time: 481.03
End time: 501.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there was a fair share of that, too.  Yeah, sure.  I think both of those things are true.  But I think sending it to somebody who works in video who's going to be like, oh my God,  look at this export, is going to be a good story for Apple to tell about that.  And the usual suspects like me got them, too.  Although I didn't get the Ultra, they only sent me the Macs.  So Gruber got the Ultra.

Start time: 501.08
End time: 505.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just want to say, you should feel bad.  I do feel bad.  Now you know where you are in the pecking order.

Start time: 506.42
End time: 531.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They think of me as a writer, and they're like, well, you don't need all that power.  And I'm like, guys, have you seen how much processor, isotope, audio plugins use?  I use those all the time.  It's brutal.  And that's why I bought an iMac Pro, which I was using for a lot of time.  But I did buy one of these.  The funny thing about this Apple Silicon world we're in now is, what I've learned so far,  is if it's got the same chip in it, it's the same.  It's the same.

Start time: 531.50
End time: 544.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Same clock speed.  Yeah.  For sync, and if you look at benchmarks, now Tom's hardware has done them.  oursTechnica, Andrew Cunningham, did a whole bunch of good benchmarks.  If you look at the single core performance, it's identical across the board.

Start time: 545.18
End time: 564.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the multi-core between, yeah, the same core, right?  The M1s are all one core.  And then if you look at multi-core, we finally have another Mac to compare to the MacBook Pro.  So if you get a same configuration, like a 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M1 Max,  and you compare it to the Mac Studio, it's the same computer.  So Max equals Max.  Yeah.

Start time: 565.50
End time: 650.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If it's an M1 Max, it's the same.  Even though the power can be different, because now you're plugging it in.  I'll tell you one thing that's very impressive with the Max Studio,  the cooling subsystem in that is great.  The fan, I'm sorry, what do they call them?  The turbo-snot?  They've got a name.  The thrusters.  They've got a brand.  The thrusters come on right away.  And stay on, and don't go up or down.  So I ran Alex Lindsay's world-famous Macbuster.  The photogrammetry program.  It's actually a Russian company.  I had to turn off my blocking on my ubiquity so I could download this.  It is a program that takes a bunch of photos and then mashes them together  and builds a 3D model out of it.  MegaShape, it's called.  And the nice thing is it runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux,  so I can do some benchmarking crosshand.  This is a shot as it was just wrapping up.  Look at the cores.  It's on my desktop.  I know, it may be confusing.  It looks like I've got a Mac.  On the right, all that green, that's 100%.  Every single core, efficiency cores, performance cores.  And still, and it did that for 20 hours.  At no point did the fan get louder or did the machine feel hot.  Or even the air coming out of the back, it might have gone up a degree or two.  The cooling subsystem on that, and this was the Macs, the Ultra rather,  so does the copper, is incredible.

Start time: 650.93
End time: 698.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Incredible.  So that's what I'm excited for, right?  Because this is the Macs Pro, and this is now a Frisbee disc to me.  I bought the M1.  No, no, but that's Jason's point.  It should be a Frisbee.  So here's why it is.  One, I got the Mac Mini M1, and I was like, all right, this is cool.  It kind of does what I want, because I'm shooting stuff in 8K,  so I'm throwing hard stuff at it, and it worked.  Like, oh, cool.  In 4.2.2, it worked.  When I got this, I said, oh, the game has changed.  This thing is...  Yeah, not as much as you would hope.  This thing, though, is eating through it,  and it's making everything that I want to do easier.  So I thought to myself, one, this is a brick.  I know the 16 is better than the 14, that's why I got it,  but I got my Ultra sitting at home waiting for me,  so when I get home next week, I'm selling this thing,  because I don't need it.

Start time: 698.50
End time: 728.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because Ultra is... it's literally twice of what the Macs is.  So if you buy the base model, you know, and all of those in there of the studio,  you're getting, especially since the 16-inch MacBook Pro  has a little bit better cooling system in it, it's identical.  You know, there may be a little throttling occasionally on the 14,  but on the 16, the M1 Max chip, it's the same performance.  It's just... it's literally the same computer in a different box.  But when you get the Ultra, then you're getting double that,  double that performance.  And I'm excited for that.

Start time: 729.52
End time: 761.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like, I have trashed Apple for three or four years,  because I have a Threadripper, I got 128 gigs of RAM.  Like, I'm just like, dude, what are you talking about?  I got 3070, like, I'm destroying everything I want to do for the most part.  This is faster than that now in a laptop form.  And I got to say, Apple got me back on that.  Now, all they're doing is taking my money.  My child's education is in danger.  She choked me out when she saw me ordering it.  She's like, what are you doing?  I said, I need it.  She's like, you don't need it, but I do.  So I might have to replace my kid with the Ultra,  because I'm so excited to get home.

Start time: 762.16
End time: 808.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Vadim on the Max Tech channel actually took his apart.  And the first thing I felt bad for Vadim,  here he is comparing, by the way, an AMD Ryzen to the Ultra.  Let me pause that briefly.  The Ultra is, this is where the thermal paste was over that Apple.  So that's the actual outline of the CPU.  The rest is system on a chip.  So that's where the RAM is and the AI processor and the video playback and all that stuff.  This is the Ryzen CPU.  And you can see it's a little bigger.  The die itself is huge.  And I was very impressed at how well put together it was.  I felt bad for Vadim, because he had to put it back together again.  It didn't look like that was going to be much fun.

Start time: 808.50
End time: 815.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is not a system design.  That's what the Mac Pro is for, right?  A system designed for you to break it open.  This is not a system for regular people to break it open.

Start time: 815.76
End time: 842.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And yeah, unlike the old Mac Mini, you don't need a spudger or a paint chipper or anything.  I mean, there are, if you take the rubber ring off on the bottom, there's screws, four screws.  Take those off. More screws, more screws.  He did discover a couple of interesting things.  I was not as surprised as he was.  There's two of these memory, sockets for storage.  Now, Apple said these are not upgradable.  And in fact, these are the same SSD chips as on the other side where there's an SSD.  So it's clear this is for various builds.

Start time: 842.98
End time: 870.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the build to order configuration, because they don't want to build different versions.  Why would they have different motherboards?  And the question is, so could I add later?  The problem is that the storage controller is on the system on a chip.  And they do a security thing where it's paired to the system on the chip.  So I think the truth is you might be able, down the road,  to go into an Apple Store or an authorized repair center and get new storage put in and repaired.

Start time: 870.50
End time: 882.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Apple has to make this storage, first of all, because it's a non-standard proprietary shape.  And you're going to have to do that stuff.  So I could see maybe Apple offering it as an upgrade.  But this does not mean you have an upgradable system.

Start time: 882.50
End time: 928.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a trend for them, too.  First off, I think if you pay attention to what iFixit has been noticing lately,  Apple stuff seems to be more repairable in general lately.  This looks totally repairable.  They seem to have heard the pain of everybody trying to fix things.  And it costs Apple, too, when they do AppleCare.  They have to take these things apart that are not meant to be taken apart.  So that's part of it.  I don't know.  The other thing is, if you look at the display, which we haven't mentioned, the studio display.  We're going to get there.  That also has a non-replaceable part, which is it's got three different stand options.  Same story.  My understanding is that authorized repair centers or Apple repair will be able to switch those stands out for a fee.  So it's not that they're well-divided.  So you could get the Visa amount if you wanted to.

Start time: 929.27
End time: 933.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you said, oh, I like the Pivot $400 extra.  I read your review and I was like, $400? That's outrageous.

Start time: 936.50
End time: 946.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there's so much there.  But anyway, we should talk about that at some point.  But my point is there are a bunch of things that are not upgradable that might actually be upgradable, but only through the official path.

Start time: 948.15
End time: 994.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the motherboard, the logic board.  It is not very big.  It's really a thin little piece of baloney in a giant sandwich.  The bottom part is the 370 watt power supply, which is built into the thick Mac studio.  The top part, about half of it, is those fans, those thrusters, the blowers.  Somebody told me, don't call them fans. They're blowers.  I don't know what's the difference. It's a fan.  It takes air, pushes it out the back in an L shape, sucks it up, pushes it out.  If you look at the engineering on that, very impressive, given what this thing does.  And it shows you where Apple Silicon is really kind of lapping everybody else.  This is all a system on a chip that does most of what you want to do.  It's close to something perfect that I've seen in a really long time.  It's really beautiful.

Start time: 994.54
End time: 1044.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And again, the whole embargo life of YouTube just turns me off because I know, yes, it's for people to get excited about things.  I really appreciate balance in things.  So when I have to fanboy out and geek out like I have over these last Apple products, it makes me sick a little bit.  But this is the first time they've had magic in a long time.  They don't even use that terminology anymore.  But this is magic.  This is a gateway and path that other companies cannot follow.  It's very good for Apple.  The one thing that they have that is against them, but for them, is their walled garden.  And everyone else has to work together.  And now they're going to have to have a superhero team to try and defeat the evil empire of Apple when the empire is working in a unison form.  And they are putting out power.  This is impressive.

Start time: 1044.98
End time: 1052.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can bet Intel, AMD, Nvidia, all trying to duplicate this, but they don't control the stack the way the Apple controls everything.

Start time: 1052.82
End time: 1085.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unless you're, again, joining forces and coming up and saying, hey, at least let us combine our powers to make this.  You can't compete right now with this.  And the only thing that's keeping regular people out is one, they can't afford it.  Two, the system isn't in place for them to switch over.  So a lot of people are like, look, there's things that won't run on Mac.  I can't switch to Mac.  I don't care how much power it is.  I'm used to using X, Y, and Z.  If you're a gamer, you're not even looking at this with jealousy.  Because it doesn't compete.  Exactly.  But it is impressive, annoyingly enough to say repeatedly.  So impressive.

Start time: 1086.46
End time: 1146.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is, I should come back around to this mega shape.  We'll talk more about this with Alex on Tuesday on Mac Break Weekly.  But just to give you some idea, I thought, oh, my God, this thing is slow.  It took a total of 20 hours, close to it, 18 hours to do the entire photogrammetry.  So I said, Alex, 18 hours, that's a long time.  He had given it to iJustine when the Mac Pro came out.  I don't know what the Mac Pro numbers are.  I'll find out.  But he said, no, no, on my 16-inch i9 MacBook Pro, it went for three days, then crashed.  So at least it's finished.  And it did it in less than 72 hours.  It did it in about, let's see, 3 and 1 half to do the alignment of the photos, 13 and 1 half to do the build cloud, the build meshes, a half an hour.  It didn't finish building textures before I had to come in here.  But I think it had another half hour to go.  So I'll say 18 hours, maybe.  It's fast.  That's pretty fast.  That's pretty good.  But here's the most important thing, the bottom line.  If you're doing photogrammetry, yeah, you should get an Ultra.  Sure.

Start time: 1147.94
End time: 1171.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, that is the question of what is an Ultra for versus an M1 Mac.  And I think the answer is they are increasingly narrowing the slice of the market that needs the hardware.  You know if you need it.  The Mac is so powerful already that with those iZotope plugins and all of that, I'm like, this is probably more than I need,  but it's going to last me for a few years and that's fine.  Did you notice your processing was faster?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I was coming from, it was only an 8-core Xeon, but an 8-core Xeon from a few years ago.  And it's not even close.  Plus, you know, the storage is twice as fast as it was on my old iMac Pro.  But the Ultra then is double that.  And there's a Mac Pro waiting out there, which at least the rumor is will also come in a 2-ultra configuration with 40 cores.  Maybe a quad, a quad, yeah.  I think what's really funny though, I mean, I do think the competition is going to get there.  I think that you're going to see a lot of people following what Apple has done and realizing they need to change their game a little bit and up their game.  I think what's funny about this story is what we were talking about a year or two ago that we're not talking about anymore,  which was there wasn't any doubt that Apple was going to be able to make something like this laptop here, which is an M1 MacBook Air.  There wasn't really any doubt of like, take an iPhone chip or really an iPad chip, stick it in a MacBook Air.  Sure, sure, you could do that.  That'll be fine.  But what about Pro systems?  That was the big question.  What about Pro systems?  Surely a phone chip can't scale up.  And that's been the funny thing about this week is like it does.  These are the first generation Pro chips from Apple.  These are not even iPhone 13s.

Start time: 1240.62
End time: 1240.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These are 12s.

Start time: 1242.61
End time: 1266.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, these are based on the A14.  So they're the last previous year's chip cores.  So that's the funny thing is that this is their first generation and they are supplying Pro power.  Who knows how it's going to go and what pitfalls there might be.  Nobody knows what is in that Mac Pro.  Are they ever going to support external GPUs or is it only going to be Apple GPUs?  There's still a lot of questions about the very high end.  But you're talking about the tiniest slice of the market that there are questions about.

Transcript:  For most people, the single core M1 performance is enough for browsing, for email, anything you're doing.  And that's going to be exactly the same on a MacBook Air as it is going to be on a Mac Studio Ultra, right?  Yeah, if you're just doing the basic work.  But yeah.

Start time: 1285.80
End time: 1325.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the M1 is like, what is it, six performance cores and two efficiency cores or something like that?  And they power manage.  And I think that's the truth.  In fact, one of the problems with covering something like a Mac Studio is you're already slicing the market real thin.  Because this is a Pro problem.  Almost anything that anybody who would use a Mac would want to do outside of the Pros can be handled by a 24-inch iMac or an M1 Mac Mini or an M1 Air.  Like the M1, as basic as it is and it doesn't offer a lot of Pro features, it's more than capable for the vast majority of people who use computers.  But then there's the Studio and the MacBook Pro for the higher end.  And you know there's going to be people like us who are maybe not...

Transcript:  I have an evil thought in my head that when my Macs comes, it looks exactly the same.  Swap it out.  Swap it out.  I might just sneak in in the middle of the night, sync the two, take the Ultra back and give her the Macs.  And she probably would never know.  I'm going to tell you one thing.  If you don't do it, I'm going to buy one and I'll do it myself.

Transcript:  I had also ordered for her because I thought it should be...  She has a 49-inch curved display and she was using that with an iMac.  We replaced the 2014 iMac.  So I got her...  I thought at first, well, I'm just going to get a separate monitor.  And then I got her this studio display thinking.  And as soon as I saw, boy, the reviews from Neelai Patel on The Verge, from Daring Fireballs' John Gruber,  from Joanna Stern at The Wall Street Journal and on and on and on, this camera is awful.  Even Micah Sargent, who has the studio display, he said, my family, I used it to make a FaceTime call.  They said, is your camera smudged?  Can you clean the camera?  It was brand new out of the box.  I canceled the display for $1,500.  And you even, Jason, helped because you tweeted a picture of your display crashing.

Start time: 1439.89
End time: 1495.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. Yes.  Well, it didn't crash.  It restarted after an error.  That's a crash!  In Apple world, we don't call that a crash.  Yeah, that display is hilarious.  It is running iOS.  It's an iPhone 11.  Running iOS 15.4.  Yeah.  The screen, like my issues with it are the $400 adjustable stand because I think fundamentally,  displays should be adjustable ergonomically.  I think it's kind of outrageous.  I ordered that for her as well.  That's how I feel about that 24-inch iMac, too.  It's like you get this beautiful iMac in a cute color and then you put a dictionary under it.  Not great.  You should probably have it be adjustable.  The webcam is weird because I didn't see the problems other people were seeing with it,  which is why I think it is probably, I think it's a bunch of things going on here.  I think that a cropped, widescreen, 12-megapixel camera in different lighting can...

Start time: 1495.52
End time: 1497.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's cropped so it can do center stage.  Yeah, it can be weird.

Start time: 1499.02
End time: 1572.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think there are also some image processing things happening that depending on your lighting conditions...  Apple says we're going to update this.  Are really bad.  It'll be better.  Because I did a 90-minute, actually talking about the embargo, a 90-minute live video on YouTube  after the embargo dropped with Dan Morin.  We did it for Six Colors.  And I spent the entire show on the webcam.  Nobody noticed.  And it looks good.  Nobody said, oh, actually, there are...  It looks good.  So I don't know what's going on there.  And I've got to think that there are software problems, which keep in mind will require  an iOS update, apparently, in order to fix them.  But there are some software problems that are making it in certain lighting conditions.  I don't think it's a hardware problem.  It's possible I just got a good one.  But my guess is that something really bad happened in their image processing pipeline.  And it made it all look bad.  Why didn't they notice that before they shipped it?  I don't know.  I wonder if it was a different version that was on the displays that they were shipping.  It is one of the weirdest things that's happened to me in 25 years of writing about technology.  Because I got a heads up from one of my fellow embargo reviewers that there was a problem  with the webcam.  And so I got to spend time trying to duplicate it.  And I couldn't do it.  Maybe there's too much light coming into my office.  I have a well-lit office.  I don't know what's going on.  Negru even had a problem with center stage.

Start time: 1574.60
End time: 1584.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Off center stage.  I did duplicate that.  That's a problem where center stage just sort of hangs around and you're not in the center.  And eventually you're in the center.  That's the feature.  It's in the iPads.

Transcript:  A portal does this and does it better.  No, the Facebook portal does it.  Yes.  And it does it very well.  As much as I just said they're magical.  They can't care about webcams because they keep putting these things in all these websites.  They don't care.  So this laptop has a very thin screen.

Start time: 1615.50
End time: 1660.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you have an inch and a half.  Plenty of room in the studio display to put a good camera in there.  Here's by the way the crash message.  I don't want to see a crash on my monitor.  Plus it's thick and square and it's got a big fan on it.  When they said there I13 Bionics in it I scratched my head.  Mark Gurman was on MacBreak Weekly on Tuesday.  He said these displays were designed two years ago.  That's why they're kind of they don't have HDR.  They're not great displays.  They're LG panels probably but only 600 nits.  He says that's why it's the A13.  That was the generation of iPhone two years ago.  And my conjecture and he kind of agreed is they had extra chips.

Start time: 1660.91

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why not?  There is so much going on with Apple's products right now that is recycling.  You can see it like they are one of the ways they make it up in volume.  One of the ways it works is they keep using the same stuff.  So the camera in this and this is the argument I think about the studio display that's interesting is  did they get carried away because they like center stage so much and they're like  well we'll just use the exact same hardware in every single device that has center stage.  So it's the same camera.  And spatial audio.  Right.  And hey, slow mo.  Right.  All of the microphone stuff sounds very much like what's in JJ's MacBook Pro.  The speakers, they say that they're better but they're very much the same engineering.  They're reusing so many of the parts because I mean the truth is they are only one company  and how do you handle it if you are going your own and building all your own stuff is you got to reuse it.  Right.

Start time: 1713.50
End time: 1735.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I canceled it.  I had an LG HDR 120 hertz display.  No, I guess it's only 60 hertz.  So it wasn't that bad.  But it's just for Lisa's spreadsheets.  She doesn't need 120 hertz spreadsheets that I'd already bought.  I brought a Brio camera because I didn't know Apple was going to do this.  I canceled the display and I said, well, just use what we already have.  It's fine.  The only thing she doesn't have is those nice speakers.  And they sound good, right?  No.

Start time: 1736.50
End time: 1754.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  No, that was actually all these people complaining about the webcam and I'm like, guys, I had no problem with the webcam.  The speakers are OK for speakers that are embedded in a little display.  But that's it.  That's there.  They're interesting.  You don't want to listen to music on them.

Transcript:  Well, I think they're as good as you can get in that space in the monitor.  But they're not a...  Then they oversell it and they say, oh, this is all studio quality.  And I think that's the problem.  However, I will say Mac users have wanted an Apple external display for years.  And this thing is going to sell.  It's really well because there are so many people with MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs who their only real option at Apple's Retina resolution has been the LG Ultra Fine.  And this is the same panel, more or less, just a little bit brighter.

So the first thing I don't understand in general why I'm probably just going to get one just so I can see is they show you the display with you have sections.  You have your gaming and you see your webcam and it's arced in front of you.  Right.  But I'm like, how is my webcam deadpan center shooting when I'm looking at this monitor?  How is there?  How is that possible?  It's not possible.  But that's why you spend money and buy things because the marketing looks good.  And I feel like I should have it.  They got us.

I wonder if there are still people inside Apple who are like, no, no, the next port  is no port.  We'll just do MagSafe for everything.  We'd heard that rumor.  Maybe they'd have Pogo pins on the back and there'd be an adapter.  It would be nice if Lightning went away.

Now it's USB-C and Lightning and that's really it on every device.  So it's over.  So they might as well switch it over.  And there better always be a port on this phone or TikTokers will lose their mind.  How am I going to get my pro audio with Bluetooth and sync up my voice if you don't keep a plug  in this bad boy?

We're going to have a magnetic smart connector for people who need it and everything else  will be wireless.  And this is the same story that they've told about all sorts of other things.  And losing the headphone jack, we all got through that.  But losing a wired access to a device is a bad place to go.  It's a bad place to go for lots of reasons, including the high quality audio or if it  bricks.  I mean, there's so many reasons to keep some port on the device.  And just power.

And the good news is people are, employers are learning.  We've just started doing four day work week.  Employees love that, right?  Listening to your employees, making them feel valued, ask them questions,  questions, letting them have input, focusing on the company culture.  Some companies' cultures are not so good, especially in the gaming industry.  So we're going to make it better, right?  More learning opportunities.  Our staff loves that, that they will pay for schooling.  More flexibility in schedules.  More empathy.  If you do need to add more employees to your team, you're making a great place for them.

They're getting bigger and bigger and going to a lot of sites now.  You cannot read any content.  Used to be you could ignore it.  You can't even ignore it now.

So even just the fact that I've got to sometimes pinch in to get to an X.  If I wanted to X it out, I can't even because I've got chunky fingers.  I can't even get to it.

Transcript:  The real problem is whether you recognize it quickly in your mind or in your eyesight.  We're at the level now.  Two more years, you won't know the difference.  There's so many things where people send me something and I'm like, that's Photoshopped  and they're like, no, it's not.  And you run it through something that you could tell because at this point telling me  something's Photoshopped or not, unless you put a shark on my head and it looks ridiculous,  it's really hard to know.  The skill level is so advanced and now we've gotten to this level where now even the audio.  So imagine you don't even need to see that this even the setup of that makes you question  the legitimacy of it.  The background raw kind of stuff instantly makes you like, oh no.  But imagine just being on an open broadcast radio and hearing a message go out over the  radio in Barack Obama's voice.  I don't care.  And you're in the middle of a closet in the dark with no sun.  You hear that voice.  You know exactly what it is.  So to hear a certain message come out.  And it's very easy to do audio deep fake now.  In two years, it's really going to be problematic.

Transcript:  Avatar.  If I want to be optimistic, what I'll say is that I hope that our media literacy means  that there is a limited window where this stuff will work.  And if we work really hard, we can make that window as small as possible.  It's a bit of a race though.  It is a race and the people who are going to do bad deeds are going to be the ones who  can find a way to slide in there before our defenses go up.  But I do think people are learning about things that are fake.  And the deep fake is a great example where a couple of years ago, everybody would have  been like, oh my God.  And now they're like, oh yeah, I saw that thing with Tom Cruise deep faked.  And they start to get it.  And we start to have to build in another level where everything like I've been noticing that  a lot of organizations like Bellingcat are doing verification of videos in Ukraine of  attacks on video or reports or anything like that.  And that becomes like an important part of journalism is the validation of what we see.  Did that really happen?  And that's great.  Like I know that it's terrible that this is going on and that there are going to be places  where people get misled.  But if I have any optimism about it, it's that it looks like we're trying to build up  some structures to teach people that they can't just trust it when they see it.  But it's so hard because it's human nature to just trust that voice or that face that  you know so well.

Start time: 3029.40

Transcript:  There's also a tech fix here to be had because there's been a lot of interesting work using  AI systems to spot these kind of things and to build up fingerprints of them and just  make it a lot easier.  You know, if you see a video just to have a little button by the side of it saying,  we believe this is fake, would solve an awful lot of the issues.

Yeah, they kept saying here is what Russia is doing.  Here's what they're going to do.  They are going to invade.  Yeah.  No, we're not going to invade.  And then they invade and they're like, well, here's what they're going to do.  They are now starting to claim that there are chemical weapons depots.  That's because they're planning chemical attacks.  And that is a isn't that smart?  A new use of intelligence to where they're trying to be basically transparent and say,  we're going to just say everything we think is going to happen because it makes it harder  for the other side to play the game.

We we have a historic distrust of our intelligence.  But the more they do this and are proven right, which they have been, the better.

This is an article from Mitchell Clock.  Pavel Dorov was the CEO and founder of Telegram.  OK, so Brazil says we sent a takedown request to Telegram saying, you know, if you don't  take this down, we're going to ban you.  We're going to suspend the app in Brazil.  By the way, it seems like the Brazilian Supreme Court has a thing about doing this.  Remember, they tried to do with WhatsApp and there was practically a revolution.  Well, WhatsApp is the backbone.  Everybody uses it in Brazil.  I think they can get away with it with Telegram because it's not quite so popular.  It's not.  So Dorov put out a statement saying, it seems we had an issue with emails going between  our Telegram corporate addresses in the Brazilian Supreme Court.  From now on, we're going to have a dedicated email address for takedowns.  The court sent it to an old general purpose email address and we never saw it.  And sorry, guys.

If you wanted to be elegant and if you wanted to eat at an Italian restaurant  instead of McDonald's, YouTube is McDonald's.  There's one every corner.  It's out there.  Vimeo is like, I'm a professional.  I have a reel.  I want a clean player.  I don't want you clicking into some kid getting hit over the back of the head  with a waffle bat or anything crazy.  I just want to display my work.  Do you have any Vimeo videos?  I do, but it's for client work.  So it's private.  And that's how they want it to be.  Yes.  But again, even if I say I'm semi-popular and I wanted to have a reel,  let's say I'm an actor and I'm sending my reel out to places and it happens to get  out or some sketch that I have and it happens to get popular.  Great for me, bad for me because hey, look, I'm still just this indie guy trying to  put something out there and it caught a wave, which is great.  But now I get this bill and guess what?  It didn't get picked up by a studio guys.  Like I don't have this money to do it.  So it's a weird balance.  But again, Vimeo has a very clean, beautiful player and it doesn't bring you  outside of the house.  Yeah.  So those bills are just rough for some people that are using the service  but can't foot the bill.

Transcript:  And again, for a working professional that that, you know, for a smaller business or  something like that, that's a pretty hefty bill for something that you're using.  That is could be the backbone of what you're trying to put out and produce.  A lot of restaurants and stuff use it for things like that.  So again, the volume versus what you might get on a holiday season is it's just weird.  But they backtrack.  They fix it up.  Yeah, we're good now.

That's nice about Vimeo.  Like, I'm not getting spammed by soccer ads and other things.  I'm just there to consume your use.  Quality content.  It's the right place for certain things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 3706.34
End time: 3732.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, first of all, when it gets to be a half an hour, it's no longer a TikTok.  It's a podcast.  Yeah, I know.  Once they hit 10 minutes, it wasn't it wasn't TikTok anymore.  Because in general, you know, as a rantier myself,  it's hard to consume any more than, you know, two minutes at a time  with someone blabbing about swipe up, swipe up.  But you get 10 minutes in there, you get half an hour in there.  And I could do a half of a power hour.  I could have a video gaming session.  You know, we can do all kinds of fun stuff in 30 minutes on the TikTok.

That's very interesting.  Yeah. And you could DJ and you could take calls.  That's kind of interesting.  We did it on Wednesday.  I did a pre show for this week in Google.  I got a whole listener.  It was so exciting.

Start time: 3754.50
End time: 3865.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so that was going to be my statement to why I haven't really tried it,  because everything if you if I mentioned anything of Amazon product to someone,  they look at me like I'm trying to beat them and rob them.  Hey, have you watched such and such?  Oh, where's that on Amazon Prime?  Now they have Amazon. They have Amazon Prime.  Everybody has it. But they don't want to.  They refuse to go to it.  Like this show is amazing. OK, no.  Yeah. My daughter said I asked my daughter, she was we have Apple Music  and we have Spotify.  And I'm like, we don't need all that.  I was like, can you talk your mom into paying for Spotify?  Yeah. And so I can just have Apple.  You got both.  And so she says to me, she's like, no, because mom uses Amazon Music.  And we both looked at each other like, oh, I know better.  And I still did it.  And I'm like, your mom's using that.  You know, Amazon is free and is what she pays for.  It's high res.  But again, I in my mind, I'm like Amazon Music.  And I forgot I have it. It's free to me.  I've never turned it on as a prime member.  I never thought of pressing the button.  So it's kind of interesting.  It's very interesting the way that the Amazon a bad brand name is it not  the Amazon, they're the the yin and yang of the universe.  Everyone hates them, but they need them.  It's like saying Walmart.  And they're yeah, nobody wanted Walmart music and their products.  Like I said, like I watch a lot of their premium content on shows,  but it took me a minute to get into it.  And now that I'm into it, I pop it on like once a month, find something new.  Great. Cool. It's not Netflix yet.  But when you tell another person, even though they have it,  general people don't want to touch their insulin.  Yeah. Where do I put my photos?  Hey, you have a prime account, right?  Just move it there.  Everyone's so upset about Google saying they're going to charge.  I said, well, you got prime prime.  I'm not giving Amazon my photos.  I'm not I'm not doing that.  But you did it for Google.  Like you trust Google.  Yeah. But you don't.  I think it's free to you.  I'm trying to give you the free option because that's what you want.  But that's the mindset from I feel from general public  about Amazon products besides Amazon.

Russians have blocked Instagram, Twitter, Facebook.  Tick tock was suspended suspended services in Russia  because of the quote fake news law.  Telegram says we're not going to give any user data over.  So it's widely used.  And apparently nobody knew about Clubhouse.  So Clubhouse is now a great place for Russians to go to share their  dislike of the war.  So I think it's kind of interesting.  I don't know. I haven't used Clubhouse in a long time.

Transcript:  Well, so this is what's I think interesting about Clubhouse.  It continues on even though it's not, you know, the flavor of the month anymore.  But it is a great place for an affinity group to go.  Yeah. And so Russians have discovered this is a way  that they can freely talk about the war.  And they in fact, there are apparently hundreds and hundreds of channels now  of anti-war sentiment in Clubhouse.

Transcript:  It's good they can find community and have messaging  because that's the one thing, again, thankfully for us being in America.  We haven't had wars on our shore.  But when people don't understand is that even on any side of conflict,  there are people inside that conflict that do not agree  with what the leaders are doing.  So for them to have some kind of outlet and community is great,  because at the end of the day, when you sit there and say, oh, well,  we want the Russians to overthrow what.  OK, it's hard to do that when they shut down everything on you.  So I'm glad that they're finding an outlet, which most things happen in the world.  Human beings find a way to find each other.  And so that's good.

It's over there.  I'm an adult. It's over there.  You go find something, pay these bills, go explore while I pay the bills.  Our sponsor today, this segment is New Relic.  Love New Relic.  And if you're a software engineer, assist admin, a dev op,  you're going to love New Relic, too, because you know, the worst thing in the world.  Middle of the night,  phone rings, beeper goes off, text messages start pouring in.  Something's broken.  The servers down, the database is chugging.  Your queries aren't going through.  And you're going, oh, no.  And here's the problem for more than half of the companies out there in the world.  And this is from a study from New Relic.  They don't have network observability implemented.  Only half of all organizations have implemented observability for networks and systems.  And if you don't have it and something goes wrong, you're in the dark.  You don't know. But it won't happen.  If you get New Relic, New Relic can tell you instantly what's wrong  so you can fix it and go back to bed.  New Relic combines now 60, keep expanding, but they have up to 16 different monitoring programs,  things you might buy separately or try to use separately.  But, you know, that's hard, too, if you've got 20 different programs  and you're going from this one to that one and your team's trying this.  This is all unified.  One place, one stack, one UI.  You get application monitoring, APM,  so you can see exactly what's going in your apps and your microservices.  If you're using Kubernetes, you'll love Pixi.  Great observability, distributed tracing.  Let's you see all your traces without management headaches  so you can find and fix issues fast.  Network performance monitoring.  No more data silos.  You get a system wide correlated view.  So you can immediately pinpoint the problem and fix it.  And that's just four of the 16 monitoring apps.  So many people have discovered New Relic.  And once you do, you'll never go back.  You can even pinpoint issues down to the line of code  so you know exactly what went wrong and how to fix it.  Dev and ops teams at DoorDash love New Relic.  GitHub uses it. Epic Games.  More than 14000 companies use New Relic to debug  and improve their software to keep the network running.  Whether you run a cloud native startup or a Fortune 500 company,  it just takes five minutes to set up New Relic in your environment.  And here's the really good news.  It's free.  It's the whole New Relic platform and 100 gigabytes of data per month  free forever.  You don't even have to give them a credit card  because they know if you love it, you're going to want it  and you're going to want more.  The next 9 p.m. call just waiting to happen.

Transcript:  But classic MGM already sold off back in the day, the Ted Turner era,  most of its catalogs.  So what MGM is as a holding company is a very weird collection of catalog stuff  and franchises.  That's why it's not considered a must have.  But it was something.  And I really keep wondering where the musical chairs game is going to stop  because there's still some stuff out there.  I read a piece this week about how now that CBS and Viacom have merged together  and become paramount, the next order of business is for them to see  if they can find somebody to unload CBS television to  because once they get rid of their broadcast network,  they can sell the rest of the company to Comcast or...  Which already owns a lot of it.  ...to WarnerMedia, to one of the other companies.

Start time: 4506.59
End time: 4535.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they're doing that because they get annoyed, one,  the Paramount beast that is a new streaming service is like, okay,  but Warner Brothers owns a lot of the CBS content.  So I'm not going to go sign up for Paramount because I can get Sheldon  and stuff like that on HBO Max.  And so it's a tug of war.  It's a tug of war of what's going on and who's doing what.  And I'll tell you what, Mr. Leo LePort.  What, Mr. Vanderpump rules?  I might come to you and ask you for your catalog.  I like speaking text.

Start time: 4583.36
End time: 4656.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or at least broadcast is a very different business from streaming,  and it has a bunch of regulations because it's over the air, airwaves, right?  So you think CBS will continue?  Well, actually, if you look back to the Fox deal  where the Murdoch family sold Fox to Disney,  but they split off the Fox broadcast network and the cable channels that do news.  And they took that separately.  And one of the reasons is that Disney owns ABC,  and so they literally could not sell the Fox broadcast network to the owner of ABC.  So they split it off.  I think that's the thought process behind what may be going on at Paramount,  is they need to unload CBS and CBS News.  And there's a business to be run there, but it's a real different business,  and it's not a gross business.  It's not the same as the Internet.  It's not going to excite investors.  And then they can sell their catalog to the highest bidder.  And the truth is Paramount, I mean, somebody will get Star Trek out of it.  There's some good stuff in the catalog,  but they can then try to auction it to Netflix or Disney or WarnerMedia or Comcast or Apple or Amazon  and get somebody to buy it because none of those buyers want TV stations.  They just don't want that.

But CNN is a moneymaker because every person who subscribes to cable gets money, puts money.  Some of their cable bill goes to CNN.  It's just part of how cable TV works.  And so that's a lot of money and they don't want to give it up.  So they're building a separate streaming service that won't anger their cable partners  and won't shut off that spigot, which is going to shut off, but not yet.  And they can build this other thing.

So they're trying to build a parallel product with some of the same names  so that they can start at least building a foundation in streaming  so that when the cable money goes away or becomes untenable,  then they have something that they can migrate to.  That's what they're doing. It's a hedge.

Transcript:  We're at the point right now where I just wish that cable would just say,  Hey, look, you can't afford Netflix, Hulu, Disney, ESPN, CNN Plus.  You know what you're doing.  You're ending up paying for the cable service that you said was $200 and $300 a month.  Let me do this for you.  Let me just knock the bill down to cable TV with your internet for 100 bucks.  Come back to us.  The dinosaur is now the meteorite.  And let's right this ship because as everything we say is network media is dying,  my God, again, just to run off the list, Paramount, Disney,  who can afford besides us in this bubble to pay for everything?  And then they get mad because people are sharing.  Well, that's why I share gas right now if I could.  Because when something gets too high, you got to figure out a way.  Oil is a good business. You can't share gas.  Carpool, he's got my back on that.

Have you moved? That's fine.  But guess what?  Everyone in the Northeast that's there's 62 people on my YouTube account  that tip me $25 a month.  They don't know my name.  I can say whatever I want.  You don't. Where's the camera?  YouTube in the Northeast.  I have 62 people using my YouTube TV account.  I got them all sending me $20 a month.  And they send you money?  Well, it's $20 better than $65, isn't it?  Yeah.  Well, then there you go.  It's our land windfall.  I mean, I'm just doing all right, Uncle Leo.  There's things out there that we can do in America.  But I get the notice when I leave the region.  Otherwise, you're in Atlanta now.  But no one else gets the thing that says, oh, there's 22 people on your account right now.

And that's the one where there'll be only one region at a time for an Apple TV.  And I always thought that was really hilarious because it's like anybody can use it on an iPad.  Nobody cares.  Exactly.  It's only if you hook it up to a TV that they even check.  But you're right.  I mean, this Netflix thing is happening.  I think it's starting in South America now.

Transcript:  Because this was back in the cable TV days.  This was a big cat and mouse game where people would split the cable.  And they would.  And I remember direct TV.  Was it direct TV or was it somebody?  They were you would share the box.  Oh, maybe it was like one of those cable guy.  It was a hot box for you.  Yeah.  Get with all the channels.  And then and but then what they did is there was this real cat and mouse game.  And they'd sent this in shards.  They'd send a little detection program down a bit at a time.  And then it would assemble itself.  And suddenly everybody would lose their cable.  And it would go back and forth.  Was it TiVo?  I can't remember who it was.  Somebody in the chat room will remember.  So Netflix, one of the things Netflix is going to offer.  And this is in Chile, Costa Rica, and Peru.  This is what you were talking about.  Is, well, if you want to share your accounts, you can.  Just pay a little more.  Pay a bit more.  I'm paying too much.  What they want you to do is think they know.  So you want to be honest.  So you say, OK, fine, I'll give you a little bit more.  And you're not going to get a lot of people with that.  You're saying what they're not going to say is we have no idea.

Because they told themselves, I'm good with a little bit of cheating, but I'm not really trying to break the law.  So sending this message out is going to get them a little bit of money.  Just enough to feel daring.  Yeah.  So it is going to get them a little money and make some shareholders happy.  Matter of fact, that's really what this is for.  This is for shareholders and to make them be proactive and look, we're doing something.  We're trying.  Look over here.  Nobody look behind the curtain.  We're doing it because I'll tell you what, Netflix, you're not going to stop me.  You're not going to stop me.

Transcript:  There is an interesting business model in there, though, in that if you're trying to actually, you know,  if someone isn't a Netflix customer and you're trying to explain to them, oh, I saw this show,  you should really check it out and then you can pay like a one-off fee just so they can view one episode.  That might be quite lucrative in the long run, but I agree with what you're saying.  They're not taking the piss on this somewhat.

Ukrainians have had seven-ish years of awareness  that Russia might invade their country.  So I think a lot of Ukrainian business people have done the thing  where our servers are on Amazon, that's what Grammarly said,  and we've got business offices all over the world,  and we have tried to get our people who are in Ukraine to be safe  or to get them out and have them work outside of the country.

But, no, I mean, he's genuinely a nice guy.  Kaspersky has had a lot of really bad press,  with no real evidence to support it,  and he does say that he's offered to have an independent third party  go through his code,  but at the end of the day, that doesn't really mean that much anyway.  You don't know where it's stored,

Start time: 5407.36
End time: 5427.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and one of the things Kaspersky does, like a lot of antiviruses,  is when it finds something suspicious,  maybe not even something in its definitions,  but something suspicious, it uploads it to the server,  and that, in fact, was how the NSA spy tools leaked.  Now, it was a stupidity on the part of an NSA contractor.  Nevertheless...

But it does make you realize most of the stuff is muscle memory.  They're not in a position where they can see the corners.  They have to know it exists. They walk the track.

So if you went, and this is a 2017 era, but if you went to cancel Amazon Prime before you could cancel, this is a dark pattern you will see everywhere.  Before you could cancel, they started asking you a bunch of questions and offering you a bunch of offers.  They launched this in 2017.  Prime cancellations dropped by 14%.  And when you're talking at the numbers Amazon's talking, that's a lot of money.  The multi-step cancellation process, a version of which remains active according to Insider, basically it's not illegal, but there have been multiple complaints filed with the FTC saying, you really got to look into these dark patterns.  That's the new thing, dark patterns.  I think Lena Conn is very aware of dark patterns.  I wouldn't be surprised if the FTC is receptive.

So it amazes me again when I was working in storage during the pandemic, people were like, I can't get to customer service.  And I'm like, oh, it's easy when you know, it's fine.  But most people have no idea that it's even possible to reach Amazon to talk to anyone.  It's chat or nothing.  And even that doesn't alleviate your problems.  But, you know, they get you in that funnel.  And you'll you'll frustrate.  I bought Final Cut Pro for my M1 Mac after I did the horrible thing.

I did the trial just because I didn't want to.  I didn't know I was getting back to the Mac life.  When I got the trial, I was like, oh, this is actually legit.  This is really good.  Let me buy it.  So I purchased it.  They charged my card.  They never sent me the activation.  Oh, now let me tell you, I contacted Apple.  I was on the phone for 12 hours.  I gave up.  Not 12 hours.  Four hours.  The first time I gave up, I waited six months and I tried again.  Four more hours.  They still never sent the email.  The third time after nine months, right before I got this, I said, I'm getting a professional Mac.  I'm getting a professional machine.  I need this.  And I was about to pay for it again.  Six hours on the phone.  They finally got me what I needed so I could get Final Cut on my laptop.  So talking to someone in customer service was insane.  I'm like, as much as Apple, I talked to 20 different people every call and no one knew how to send me a code.  I'm very impressed.

Amazon, good luck trying to find a phone number for Amazon to talk to a person.  Absolutely intentional.  Where I find it is you Google call Amazon customer support and there are web pages elsewhere with the number because Amazon does not want you to call.  Because guess what?  Every customer service call costs money because you have to pay somebody.  So Amazon really doesn't want to talk to you.

You scroll all the way down to customer service and then you click request a call and then they call you.  That is the quickest, fastest way to do it.  But again, we live in a mobile world.  There's no way to do that on your phone.  You have to be on the web browser to get to it to happen.  So again, when people are out and something's wrong, misdelivered, whatever they want to do, they have no way to get to anyone.

Well, that people are now getting a lot of food delivered from Amazon.  So it makes more sense for having these stores like a Walmart or grocery store to be able to provide that.  And guess what?  If I'm a person who is disabled in some way and maybe I can't afford, I'm on a fixed income and I don't use Amazon like that, but I can now get fruits, vegetables, food delivered to me for free with other options.  The competition is great because it's making for other things to come out.  But then again, we're at the same carrot and stick.

Transcript:  I want to tell everybody how to protect yourself online with the VPN I use, the only one I use and recommend, ExpressVPN.  Going online without ExpressVPN, it's fun because these ads, every time they have some new metaphor, right?  Last time it was going to the bathroom and leaving the door open.  Now it's like changing your clothes while leaving your window wide open.  You might not have anything to hide, but why give strangers a chance to invade your privacy?  I do use ExpressVPN. When you go online without ExpressVPN,  Internet service providers could see what you're doing, see what websites you're visiting, and it's completely legal for them.  In fact, they all do to resell that information to marketing firms and others without your consent.  And you don't know, data brokers, you don't know how that's going to be used.  So that's one reason to use a good VPN. Another reason, of course, geographic restrictions that keep you from watching Doctor Who.  If you have a Netflix subscription, you know you can watch Netflix in a variety of countries and they have a completely different set of shows.  So if you like anime, go to Japan. Big button, you say, I want to be in Tokyo today.  Suddenly you're in Tokyo and you can watch Netflix Japan. That's another good reason.  Another good reason is security. If you're in an open access point now that we're starting to get out and about, you better be using a VPN to protect you.  But here's the catch. Here's the catch. You got to trust the VPN because they know what you're doing.  That's why you use ExpressVPN. When you push the button and you join the server, the server is spun up in, they call it the trusted server technology in RAM only, sandbox so it can't write.  Every time the server is rebooted, everything is erased and the things built from scratch. They do that at least once a week.  There is nothing on those servers. We know it because there have been, and you can read the news stories if you Google it, there have been countries where they don't have warrants.  They just burst in, take the servers from ExpressVPN. There's nothing on them. They can't do anything with them.  You need a good VPN. You need somebody that protects your privacy.  This is my VPN so I know. You know. Yes. It's phone, tablets. It's fast.  It's fast. So you don't even, sometimes you use a VPN, you go, oh boy, I can't take this much longer.  You can put ExpressVPN on your router and the whole family, the whole house is protected. I know I have. They'll never say a word because they don't even know, but they're safe.  That's what's important. Browse anonymously, protect yourself from hackers and of course eliminate geographic restrictions.  It couldn't be easier. ExpressVPN has apps for phones, for laptops. You could put it on your router. You could put it on your smart TV. You could put it everywhere you are.  ExpressVPN. Why would you take off your clothes with a window wide open? Why would you do that? You wouldn't do it.  Secure your online activity by visiting expressvpn.com slash twit today.  Expressvpn.com slash twit.  Expressvpn.com slash twit. And you can get an extra three months free with a one year package. Thank you ExpressVPN for protecting us online.  Before we go much further, we should probably take a look at the week that was.

California, California, Oregon, Washington all have to a certain degree said they want to go to permanent.  We had a referendum. Yeah, because of because of where we are and would go all together.  We're where we are positioned in the time zone. It actually kind of makes sense for us. But this law is really weird.  It basically says everybody has to go to daylight saving all the time. States can't choose.  And, you know, we're going to just do it. And that's weird because there are places that probably should not do that,  should choose another time zone. Why not let the states choose? Because it would be insane.  Hang on. It already is. It's already insane. I have family in Indiana.  There are two time zones in India. They vary by county. Yeah. Right.  Like it wouldn't be that bad. But like Michigan has a good argument to make that they should never go to daylight saving time only because they're far enough north and they're far enough west in the eastern time zone that it's a bad idea.  So let them not. But but this bill, nobody has a choice except for Arizona and Hawaii, who can just stay with the way they are just exempted and the rest.  Everybody else is just has to go.

First is one of the things that's not widely known is a lot of the early space telescopes were spy telescope hardware that were given from the spy agencies to NASA.  And they just turned them around and looked out at the universe.  But the other the other thing, the Hubble Hubble has some spy telescope heritage.  We'll put it that way.  But Web, here's the thing about Web.  You talk about seeing people walk around.  Web is not just going to look at stars far off in distant galaxies.  It's also going to look at exoplanets.  And one of the things they think they might be able to do is even detect atmosphere and get the substances in an atmosphere of a planet, which might tell us if there was substances that had to be created by life.  So plus they may be able to look at other things in our solar system.  Other planets here more clearly than Hubble can do.  So there's lots of other stuff.  They're not just looking at far away.  Can I tell you something?

Post sold, NFT that you can hold during the show live is really a great community.  And if you're in that community and if you want to be in that community, also make sure  you reach out to Lisa and to Leo and to anyone that will listen and tell this man to start  selling or giving away NFTs to club householders.  I want it to happen.  I want it to be a thing.  I want to be a champion and a king in the future.  And 10 years down the line, you can look back and thank me for the $4 that you made from  that NFT that you got for free for being a club member.  I appreciate you.  I love you.  It's been a great time.  Text me, send me a message.  I don't spam you.  And I'm back to doing shows too.  If you like podcasts with a crazy person that rants about things and I do a show up my  kid too.  I love you.  And another tweet is in the can.
