Transcript:  Bandwidth for This Week in Tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com slash podcasting.  This is TwIT.  This Week in Tech, episode 93 for April 2nd, 2007, GMT.  Hi, this is Leo Laporte.  This edition of This Week in Tech was recorded before a live audience at the GMT podcast  seminar in San Francisco at the ZM Auditorium.  We want to thank the Pixelcore, Alex Lindsay, Scott Bourne, and the ZM for their support  in this podcast.  This is a panel that hasn't been with us in a long time and I'm really glad to welcome  them.  Let me introduce from the left, ladies and gentlemen from DL.TV, my old pal Patrick Norton.  I should explain, it's not that there's a, you know, I'm in a very crowded closet.  We're actually in an auditorium.  We're at the ZM, beautiful ZM here in San Francisco where we have a live audience of  about 100 people who have just attended three days of ear bleeding conference on a podcasting  called GMT.  To Patrick's left, Mr. David Prager from Revision3.com.  David's responsible for providing the JÃ¤germeister for each and every episode of Dignation.

Transcript:  There's no more booze, it's all beer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it really?  You don't do booze anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ever since this Reno thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The one where they just kept pushing shots at Alex?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you make drinking a part of your show and then you do live shows, then all the fans  want to provide the drinks and so, you know, you have to accept everyone's drink and it's  a bad situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're learning something in this seminar already.  No hard liquor.  Older liquor.  That's Roger Chang also from DL.TV.  It's great to see you again, Roger.  Haven't been on the show in ages.  Yes, I've been really, really busy.  Well, you've been, yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's Patrick.  He has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just did DL.TV live.  Next week.  Well, this week, because this is airing Monday, so it will be this week.  Right?  Yeah, I know it's hard, but.  It's like bar time.  Anyway, well, that was fun.  I showed off parallels on the show.  Also from DL.TV and HDTV expert at PC Magazine, Mr. Robert Heron.  Aloha.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you.  You've missed your HD expertise.  Yes, indeed.  Good to have you back.  Back from eye surgery.  Yeah.  How'd that go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Went well.  The recovery takes forever, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  David told me you had to face the ground for two weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Eight days.  Your surgery was about 90 minutes followed by eight days straight of keeping my head  face down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This could be hard for somebody who reviews HDTVs.  What did you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I took a couple of weeks off for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I was going to say, you had to have a special chair.  Oh, it was a pain.  That's hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, let me tell you, you do that for a few hours and you get a back pain like you want  the leaf.  It's torturous.  Did you wear a helmet?  No, no.  I had a cool chin thing.  And my chiropractor offered that.  Table with the hole in it so you could stick your face right there.  It's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't ever want to have a detached retina.  That's all I could say, John.  You never want to have that.  Also here from Buzz Out Loud, she's the spy.  Everybody else is ZD.  She's from CNET.  Ms. Veronica Belmont.  Great to have you back.  I tell everybody, if you really want a good tech podcast, you should listen to Buzz Out  Loud.  Well, thank you.  It's true.  Love it.  You, Molly, and Tom Merritt.  Tom's also a ZD, old ZD alum, a former web producer for us at Tech TV.  And in the middle, the center seat, johncdivorek.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Kind of off center, but yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Dvorak.org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go.  Gotta plug it.  We didn't talk last week, really didn't do much news because we had the Tiki guys on,  so we just talked about booze most of the time.  But there are quite a few news stories, even some from last week that we didn't get to.  For instance, Vonage loses its patents to Verizon, putting the whole company in jeopardy.  Verizon claims that they patented the voice over IP technology.  Vonage is using, Vonage said, wait a minute, this is off the shelf technology.  What?  And now they've got two weeks.  The judge will decide in a couple of weeks whether to enforce the restraining order immediately,  which would, I think, would put Vonage out of business.  Can Vonage survive this?  Roger, are you a Vonage?  Who's a Vonage?  Anybody here a Vonage user?  I am.  I work with a Vonage user.  Yeah, I'm a, I'm a, I actually subscribe to Vonage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I was a user for, at the very beginning, and then I gave up on the service.  I thought it was flaky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's, that's the problem.  It cannot replace home phone service, really.  You still need at least a cell or something, because it doesn't work half the time.  And for 911, that's no good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is Vonage claiming they were the ones who invented digitizing sound and transmitting  that in a full duplex mode?  Oh, he's Verizon, you mean it's Verizon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is Verizon's patent?  You mean, it beats me.  They say that they have a patent on the voice over IP technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That seems like really old technology that was just repurposed to, you know, provide  digitized communication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, what it seems like to me, Verizon doesn't like Vonage.  And they want to do whatever they can to put it out of business, right?  I hear that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So how is this going to affect other VoIP services like Gizmo Project and Skype?  And is it just things that go from internet to phone, or is it internet to internet kind  of VoIP style?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It should be in the article.  Apparently nobody knows.  You know, the, I do know this, the Vonage CEO came out and said, this says, don't worry  about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but just because there's, because the stock dropped.  The stock went back up.  Did it go all the way back up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would you buy Vonage stock right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, I wouldn't buy it 10 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Especially now.  It seems like that's not a, not, wouldn't be a good time to buy it.  Maybe actually there would be a good time to buy it.  Buy it really cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'm not a fan of the company, so I wouldn't buy the stock.  Are you a fan of VoIP?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think VoIP has a future?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think Skypes would reuse it all the time.  I think it's fantastic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, VoIP is taking over, by the way.  I mean, if you go, even if you went to the Von show down in Santa Clara, which had, you  know, it was supposed to be video, voice, and all this stuff over networks.  All it was was, was VoIP.  Well, that's all the Von show is.  Yeah, I know.  But they were trying to get video in there and they couldn't do it.  I mean, it was like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, the video thing is the Skunk Works, the guy that started VoIP.  Jeff Pulver.  Yeah, Pulver basically is like, you know, I basically own convention centers.  I think video on the web is the next thing.  So he basically takes two rooms out of the convention center and dedicates that to video.  Hey, you gotta give Pulver credit, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's been talking about voice over the net for longer than anybody.  I mean...  No argument.  That's his job.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But I mean, he started it.  I mean, that's...  Well, it's his specialty.  You can call him up if you have a screwball question.  He loves to talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you'll talk like that, right?  Well, yeah, but there's also VoIP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  A lot of what it's in Von is, you know, everybody here use a phone from, say, you know, a landline.  You know, you're already using VoIP.  It just is in different areas.  Your long distance is probably, is almost invariably over seas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, and VoIP has to be separated from voice over the internet.  You know, voice over, I mean, if you're using calling cards for like long distance, for  example, which are very handy.  These are all VoIP, but they're all private networks.  Right.  And the bridge is routed using IP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To answer Veronica's question, I think Skype probably doesn't use the same technologies.  It depends.  You're right.  How broadly written is this Verizon patent?  I mean, if it's digitizing voice over the network, that could be a problem.  But I have a feeling that this...  I mean, they haven't made any noise about going after anybody else.  They want to go after the guys who are going after their business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  All right.  Next.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, I'm going to pick something a little juicier.  The triple X domain falls one more time.  Well, bad, bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You think that's bad?  Well, I'm the big promoter of that.  I think I may have been the first guy to write about this in 10 years ago.  I think it's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The porno guys say we will never do it.  We hate the idea because it's a ghetto and we want to be dot com.  They should be a ghetto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I agree.  I mean, it's like when you go to a small town, you run into these little...  The red light district.  These booths, you know, the video booths, girls, girls, girls, and it's always, you  know, in a special zoning.  They're not downtown.  You don't put it next to a church.  And the way it is now, the XXX stuff, even though there's no dot XX, is next to the church.  And the weird thing is that some of these church people have been...  They're against it too.  I know.  I don't get it.  I think it's because they want to be next to the XXX place.  I can't figure it out.  It's a funny thing I can figure out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  It doesn't make any...  I think that what happened here is I can... lost their nerve.  They are afraid that they're going to have to somehow be responsible for policing it.  That's what the Canadian government said.  They say, if you guys do this, you're going to decide what's porn and you're going to  decide who becomes an XXX domain name.  And I think ICAN says, we don't want to do that.  I wouldn't want to be in that position.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They are somehow transferring the dot com owners right now to dot XXX.  Who's going to police that?  That's the real thing.  And what's to keep them from simply taking both domains?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the sticky part is really what they consider to be a dot XXX.  Oh, that was poor taste, Roger.  Roger, I am very ashamed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a slippery slope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, it is very slippery.  That's even worse.  It's the camel's nose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, because a lot of stuff that could be considered inappropriate for some people is  just, for example, sexual education material and health issues.  Well, let's use one that's a little bit...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Obviously, that's a real problem.  But what about Playboy?  Playboy's got Playboy.com.  Are they going to say we're XXX?  No way.  No.  Are they going to give up their dot com?  It's XXX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but we've got an email on DLTV that's like, you shouldn't make a Playboy joke.  That's hurting America.  And it's like, I'm okay.  Playboy's hurting...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, if it's painful, you should probably stop.  I'm sorry, I lost my...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Next topic.  That was the first over one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Please.  Important anniversary today, actually yesterday.  Melissa, in 1999, the very first email virus that spread so fast that Symantec and all the  other companies went, what?  We've got a new business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Whoa!

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Remember our around the clock coverage?  Of Melissa?  Did we do around the clock?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because we were one year old on TechTV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yes, and I remember...  That would be Harry Fuller.  No, no, no.  Anytime anything broke, Harry Fuller would make you do around the clock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That was the first time we saw Leo in the shirt and the suspenders and you're sort of...  Oh, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You were doing a...  Good or bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Joining us now, a panel to discuss.  I don't remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I remember the suspenders.  They made him, they'd moved it, they'd taken his...  They talked to him about what happened.  That was TechLive, that was later.  I don't know how...  It was much later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That wore the suspenders to distinguish me.  The whole thing on ZDTV was I did two TV shows, right?  I thought it was HIPAA when I saw you with those suspenders.  So to confuse people, I thought, well, the only thing I could do is wear a different  wardrobe on each show and they'll know, oh, this must be Call for Help because he's wearing  a sweater.  Oh, this must be the screen saver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It was your Mr. Rogers look on Call for Help.  Yeah, and then the screen saver's Hawaiian shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So when I started doing news, I thought, suspenders?  So that way you knew who, which Leo you were watching.  Well, and your hair was perfect.  The hair was always...  Dynamite.  So what did we do in the wall-to-wall coverage?  What do you say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, no, you were...  I remember Becky did something about like, what do you do when your box gets infected  and how you clear it out?  And then we covered it on each of the shows, Call for Help, Screen Savers, the news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When you're a tech network, you hope that something like this will happen.  I mean, is this a strict personal engineering thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In terms of how people acquire the Melissa virus?  Well, the Melissa virus didn't do that.  Did you have to click something and open it?  No, it was a Word doc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a Word doc.  It said list.doc or something like that.  And then if you open the document...

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And it was spoof, right?  I think it was spoof.  It wasn't...  So it would come from me.  It would come from you.  It would use Outlook, I think.  It went through your pocketbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It would send an email to like 50 or so contacts, and then those people would...  Anyone else who opens it would do the same thing through their Outlook.  And then as far as malicious damage, I don't even think it did anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Veronica, did you have a problem in your preschool when this happened?  No, but it passed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good.  Geez, thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was the first big virus that spread using the internet.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It won't be the last.  Not the last.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let's see.  It was 1999.  It was seven years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What were you doing seven years ago?  I was a junior in high school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, I rest my case.  Were you helping people solve their Melissa problems?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  How are you resting your case on that?  You said preschool.  I just exaggerated for a make-a-point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When did I Love You come out?  It came out later that.  That was much bigger.  I love you, Rizzo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Melissa was written...  I love you, Rizzo.  More creative, too.  I liked it.  It was very funny.  I think in the Midwest, he dedicated it to a stripper named Melissa in Florida.  That's where the name came from.  Thank you, Florida.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Thank you, stripper.  Stripper in Florida.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Huh.  But I repeat myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The guy was sentenced to 20 years, did 20 months, and he's out and about.  He probably has a very good job in security.  I bet he's working for Symantec.  Probably.  Probably, right?  That's what happens to these guys.  Kevin Mitnick called me today.  You never want to take a call from Kevin Mitnick.  He always spoofs the caller ID.  He doesn't realize, if I get a call from the White House, I know it's Kevin Mitnick.  I'm not stupid.  Did we learn anything from Melissa?  We learned not to open attachments.  It's not a problem anymore, is it?  Why do you think that is?  It's not because the antivirus companies can act so fast.  They still have that 24-hour...

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, it's because all the smart money that used to do these viruses are now doing spyware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Or phishing attacks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Or something more creative and money-making.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there's another reason.  I think that people have learned not to open attachments.  I don't agree with that at all.  I agree with her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You think people are too stupid?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Totally.  Completely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Social engineering because there is no patch for human stupidity.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What changed are the little messages that come with it?  Before, it used to be pretty boneheaded simple.  It's all, well, it's obviously not an attachment for you.  But now that they put, oh, pick up your prize or, oh, I forgot to email you this.  Or eBay and phishing stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  There's another aspect to this which was the scarier part.  In fact, I wrote a column about this maybe two or three years ago about people.  It turns out people with OCD, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, they will actually, when presented  with a click here...  They'll do it.  They can't not do it.  Oh, interesting.  Essentially, they have to click.  You just have to click.  They start getting the kick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So the entire spam community is basically predicated on the 2% of the population that's OCD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Time to punch the monkey.  Time to punch the monkey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Time to punch the monkey.  I think it's possible too that people are lulled into a false sense of security by these  security agencies.  That they think that they may be on top of it and so they feel more secure than they  actually are.  But that's what I'm saying.  We don't see these...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, this might be okay.  But we don't see these email viruses anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're also seeing more Trojans too that simply are trying to take over the box in such a  subtle way where you might not even recognize it.  That's the point, isn't it?  We may be seeing as many...  ...create an army of zombie boxes to keep your...  But we just don't know.  We just don't know.  It's as we...  As Vint Cerf said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the new mafia, really.  Yeah.  So in fact, there may be just as many email viruses as before, but because they don't announce  themselves, people are getting them and they don't even know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, supposedly 25% of all computers are infected with something like that.  That's what Vint Cerf says.  But I think that number is low and I think we've talked about this before.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, speaking of columns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I gotta tell ya.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John C. Dvorak says Apple should just kill the iPhone before it's too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ah, you happy now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why should Apple kill the iPhone before it's too late?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, I'm just gonna say...  Wait, hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  For one thing...  First of all, I wanted everybody in the audience, you know you're an Apple apologist when you're  booing someone who says that perhaps a product might suck that hasn't been released yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, he's not saying that the product might suck.  He's just...  You're saying this is a business Apple doesn't want to be in.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's what I said in that column.  You're talking about the Market Watch column written last week.  I have said that the likelihood of it sucking is quite high too, although I didn't write  about that.  Because you only make so many points in 650 words.  But I got a lot of...  I got two kinds of email.  I got the typical psycho email from somebody who doesn't...  Like Patrick says, a product sight unseen must be great.  But I got a note from a guy in Singular who's testing the product and he says that...  You have one here?  My phone?  No, no.  Here's the iPhone.  I just wanted to think, do you like it, sir?  Anyway, the Singular guy's testing it and he says there's lots of issues.  He says the...  Well, it's early.  It's not gonna be...  Yeah, he says the amateur mistake that they made is not having a removable battery.  And he says it's also running...  You run 20 minutes and you're using up half the battery power.  You've got 40 minutes total talk time.  Ooh, that's not good.  And he says the interface fouls up constantly.  Who's this guy?  The guy at Singular that's testing the product for the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'd think Singular wouldn't want to put this information out.  They're gonna try to sell this in a couple of months.  He's telling me, confidentially, and I shouldn't be telling anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  This is non-final product, the whole idea of being...  But no, no, because you can't change the battery.  That's gonna be...  Hold on.  I've been testing beta products for a decade.  Performance often goes up dramatically.  Battery life's true.  Let's assume that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But then again, let's go back to the point I was really making in the Market Watch column,  which is that this is a hard business to be in.  Apple's never really competed well where they actually have competition.  And my argument is they've done so well with the iPod  because the boneheads that they're competing with won't even take out an advertisement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you say this is hubris on Apple's part to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, because they kicked the asses of a bunch of boneheads.  They think they can do no wrong, which is not gonna be the case.  You know, I said this for a long time.  They're running into a juggernaut with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't believe they were gonna do a phone for this exact reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Motorola and Nokia are at a death battle.  They're throwing money at it like there's no tomorrow.  LG and Samsung, too.  Well, I know, but those are not even the big players.  Nokia and Motorola are number one and two.  What about Sony Ericsson?  They're four.  They're not even gonna be in the game shortly.  So they're more like six, I think.  They were dominant for a while.  Anyway, so that's what my concern was, and I think Apple should sucker Samsung  or somebody else to take the product as a reference design  and then take all the credit for it if it's successful  and then take none of the blame if it fails.  And that's what my column was about, not about bashing Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Apple suckers everyone into doing everything  the way that they want them to do it.  I mean, they suckered the music industry and letting them sell the music.  I mean, what they've done with the iPhone, as far as I can tell,  is they've decided that they're gonna throw everything out the door  and redesign from the bottom up.  And that's one of the main things that I actually think is kind of neat  in the fact that they've been able to completely take a blank saying,  this is what we want, and not take anyone's influence.  Of course, they took Singular all the way to saying,  we want you to jump in the court with us with this thing,  and we're not even gonna let you see it until two weeks before we announce it,  aren't they?  Yeah, that's amazing.  And if you sign up for a Singular contract on this new iPhone,  we Apple get a cut.  No one else has that deal.  I mean, it's insane the amount of bullying that Apple can do.  And yes, it's a juggernaut of an industry,  but I mean, my God, now everyone wants one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If this were the iPod of the cell phone industry,  Singular made a brilliant move, right?  That was a good deal for Singular.  Even if it's not, they still had, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  how many hundreds of articles have been written about this,  and suddenly Singular seems like this.  We have the coolest phones on the planet,  and look at all this neat stuff we're doing,  and by the way, we're becoming AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That cuts both ways, if the product's a flop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Veronica, you were at CTIA.  Was there any talk of the iPhone there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, apparently it was pulled out of a pocket  at an AT&T event for a little bit,  but it is interesting the way that it is encouraging  cell phone manufacturers to look at things differently  and to do different things.  For example, with the Samsung Upstage,  they have the 99 cent over-the-air downloads,  and that's a big deal.  That's like competing with iTunes directly.  And then, you know, the LG Prada phone too,  which looks very similar to the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like they stole the design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I saw that one too, and it looks really great,  and the touchscreen works well as well.  Oh, so there's good functionality.  The touchscreen works.  Yeah, I didn't try it with text messaging,  but for making phone calls and going through the menu.  Of course, the interface on the iPhone  is going to be very different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  CTIA is the big cell phone conference once a year.  Was this the big buzz at CTIA as the iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, not as many people were talking about it  as I expected.  It was very slow news at CTIA.  Maybe they're all just waiting.  Yeah, that's quite possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We believe we know now that June 11th will be the ship date.  That's what Singular's saying.  Yeah, and that coincidentally entirely coincides  with the first day of WWDC, the Apple Developer Conference.  I was trying to tempt you, Scott Bourne.  I put a microphone out there and everything.  Scott Bourne is the iPhone bigot.  This guy, he owns the site is ApplePhoneShow.com.  All he could talk about on MacBreak Weekly  for the last 28 episodes was the iPhone.  Do you have a response to Mr. DeVorent?  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait.  First, do you have an iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Of course I don't.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Do you?  No, I don't, but I don't think it's going to be great  if I haven't even played with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I have four simple points, the last of which  is the clearly most obvious.  Number one, Mr. Norton, who is somewhat of a curmudgeon in training,  has pointed out to the senior curmudgeon  that the product is not even shipping yet,  so maybe we won't burn the barn down just yet.  Number two, one million people have put their email address  in the hands of Singular saying,  please notify me when this phone's coming.  That breaks probably every record ever established.  Number three, at Macworld, people lined up for hours  to stare at a piece of plastic encasing this phone.  They did that for the shuffle.  Wait a minute.  They did it for the one.  But here's the big point.  Lemmings.  The store was the most beautiful booth babe at the show,  and she was lonely.  Yeah, well, that tells you a lot about the Apple customer right there.  But here is simply the most easily made point of all to rebut this whole notion.  What does he say every chance he opens his mouth?  What words come out of Mr. Dvorak?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Dvorak.org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What this is is another clever trick by Mr. Dvorak  to get one million hits, and that's all it's about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right.  Thank you, Scott Boren.  Thanks for letting me get the plug in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just in case you think Apple can do no wrong,  newlaunches.com has published this list of the ten Apple products which flopped,  including some of my favorites, Apple's Cyber Dog.  You remember that?  No.  Internet Suite developed to work on Mac OS.  It was an open doc based.  Yep.  Taligent.  This was the union.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Don't say that.  That was just a scam from the get go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wasn't that Gil Amelio's deal with IBM to do an operating system?  Was it Amelio or was it somebody else?  It might have been Spindler or even Scully.  It may have been Spindler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Was that pink?  Yeah.  So pink came out of that era.  I don't think it was pink though.  Taligent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple eWorld, remember their AOL competitor?  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.  This is, by the way, eWorld is the most interesting one in this crowd  because this is the moment that Apple was handed on a silver platter the entire internet  because the only browser available at the time was running only on the Apple.  It was the Mosaic browser that first came out of Illinois.  And they were essentially given the opportunity to rock with this.  They would have owned the internet, but they decided to do this because AOL was doing so well.  Right.  In fact, there was a number of initiatives right as the internet was coming online  besides eWorld that showed up that were supposed to take over.  I mean, MSN was supposed to kill the internet according to one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  eWorld was actually great.  I had an eWorld account.  I liked it.  I mean, you had a little town interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It was a little goofy, but it was fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But here's the thing that's interesting.  It came on every Macintosh shipped, but instead of putting it as Microsoft would have on the desktop,  they buried it two folders down on the Mac and nobody ever could find it.  Apple's Pippin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I remember that.  The gaming machine.  It was a co-production between them and Bandai.  It was supposed to be their kind of set top gaming box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it had to get this a 14-4 modem.  Yeah, it was.  It was pretty underpowered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I don't think they ever actually will.  They never released it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You can make the case that 42,000 of this elevated device were sold for silent death.  Somebody out there.  Collectible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Someone built a house out of it or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you can make the case that in many of these cases, Apple was just ahead of its time,  that these were products that are now successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because you know, Tripp Hawkins followed the 3DO.  That was a flop.  I had a 3DO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Actually, going back to the sort of iPhone argument, the Pippin was not ahead of its time.  The Pippin was brought out late to compete with three heavily entrenched and considerably better funded thought out efforts.  PlayStation, Nintendo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, no, the key thing about the Pippin was it's all supposed to do things beyond gaming.  It was a set top box.  It was supposed to do the whole info, entertainment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  PlayStation out before or after the Pippin?  After.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know. That's a good question.  So it was Nintendo that they were competing against.  Nintendo, Sega, Sega.  And Atari.  And Sega.  And television.  And television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Calico vision.  No, both those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Did you have a Calico?  No, no.  Tell her what you're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My mom was vice president of Calico.  Really?  My dad worked for Hasbro.  You're kidding.  Toy dynasty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did they meet when the two merged?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no.  Merged?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I don't think they ever merged.  No.  No, I just think...  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cabbage Patch, yep.  Was your mom responsible for the Cabbage Patch?  She worked with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  And she also worked with me and the Adam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They were real people before they were made into dolls.  Yeah, she was very into...  Very creepy.  The Adam.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you have an Adam when you were in high school, a junior in high school?  No.  In preschool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was a little before my computer time, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Number six, the 20th anniversary Macintosh.  That was supposed to be the future of computing.  Doesn't it have leather on it?  It still looks pretty futuristic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It was cool looking.  Beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It was a great looking computer.  It was just like...  It was at the death of...  It was like the bottom of Apple sales.  The Apple market was a nightmare.  It was too expensive.  It was $7,500.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It did have a CD-ROM drive, which was a pretty big deal in those days, and Bose speakers.  It had a subwoofer, which doubled as a power supply.  That's smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow.  That's a lot like the Adam because the Adam used to have its power supply for the entire  system in the printer.  In the printer?  Yes.  So that went your out of computer.  He's a king of weird trivia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  He's got the trivia today.  He is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Closer to modern times and really supporting your contention, the Motorola Rocker, which  was Motorola's iTunes phone, which was only a couple of years old, nobody bought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  No, there were three or four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Three or four?  They sold a couple.  Macintosh TV.  I think it was very well marketed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That was actually, I don't know, that wasn't even a product.  It was a skew variation.  They were selling to dorms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody pointed out, though, when Apple TV came out that this was really just Macintosh  TV.  It was very similar to the Macintosh TV in concept anyway.  Except it sucks a lot less.  Yeah.  You like the Apple TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  The Apple TV is fine.  The Macintosh TV was fine, but it was, again, that was when they had 42 skews.  They had three different computers.  It was crazy for a while.  Yes.  They had one for education, one for consumers, one for businesses, and they killed themselves.  That Mac portable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I have one of these.  A Mac portable?  Yes, totally collectible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Black and white, though, right?  Yeah.  68,000 processor, 16 megahertz, a massive one megabyte of RAM.  Still boots.  Does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So isn't that just a portable Mac SE?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, it was just basically a big giant clunker.  How much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  16 pounds.  It was huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a monster.  That's light.  15.8 pounds.  It was a portable, not a laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, compared to a compact portable, too, that thing's pretty easy to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, they put the Lisa on this list.  I'm not sure I agree.  I mean, it didn't sell a lot, but it sure...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But the Lisa led the way for what became the Macintosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, you know, I would say that the thing about the Lisa, which is not on the list,  one of the really big flops was the Twiggy drive.  That was the flaw in the Lisa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because you put your thumb right on the media as you put the thing in.  The cutout on the floppy was right where you put your thumb.  Not a good design, though.  That doesn't make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, that wasn't the flaw of the Lisa.  The flaw of the Lisa was $10,000 price point.  I drooled on it, but I didn't buy one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That's back when an IBM AT was costing, like, what, $4,000 with no software, no storage.  Yeah, but 10 was still...  Yeah, there was a price point issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  10 was pretty high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not saying it's not ridiculous.  I was a junior in high school when that came out.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was in grade school.  I learned to appreciate my own best.  When it came out on the auction site on eBay, you mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  I was this many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You were two?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Preschool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was one.  Oh, God.  And, of course, the number one has to be...  Newton.  The Newton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What else, right?  You know what's interesting is that in many ways the iPhone's a lot of what they wanted  the Newton to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  What about that crappy laptop that looked like a cosmetics case?  You were the guy.  He brought so much trouble for saying it looked like a...  The toilet.  The toilet.  Yeah, it was the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The toilet.  And then he said it was like a girly laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's because my daughter thought it was like a...  I thought she'd have a Mattel logo on it.  If I was doing the blog today, I would have...  It did.  It was a Barbie laptop.  I got some more hissing.  You're letting the air out of something.  This is a very Mac-heavy crap, don't you think?  Of course it is.  I mean, you can tell by looking at them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  A million hits on his website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if you go down this list, it proves a couple of things.  I love the Mac, by the way.  I want to make that clear.  Apple has had some failures, although few of these were under Steve Jobs' watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, they were mostly scully.  A few of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mostly scully.  I mean, the Lisa was Steve Jobs.  The Newton was scully.  Well, this little mouse thing is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You know what's interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They actually didn't list the whole...  Oh, that Puck mouse.  When they...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Every mouse Apple's ever made is worthless, if you ask me.  They've never made a good mouse.  Even the Mighty Mouse.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow.  I remember when you first got that, you were like fawning over it.  Now you're...  Yeah, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then he actually used it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Then he used it.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say...  Until the carpal tunnel set in.  I feel the same way about the Mighty Mouse.  It's a shame.  I really wanted to like it, and it works terribly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's because their dogma said, well, we really want a one-button mouse.  They demanded two-button mouse.  Okay, we'll give them one, but it'll only have one button.  We'll show them.  We'll give them one.  It won't have any buttons.  They don't have the love handles on the site.  You get to squeeze.  If you want to left-click, you have to lift up your right finger first, because it knows  that your fingers are on it.  I mean, that's the flaw.  It's too smart.  In a nutshell, instead of having two buttons, it notices where your fingers are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So simple, no one can use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the other problem is if you want to lift the mouse to put the cursor up somewhere else  while you're clicking down, you want to drag something, you can't do that, because once  you lift the mouse up to go up to the left corner, then it releases what you're dragging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's nutty.  I like the little ball, the little track ball in there.  That works because you can scroll in any arbitrary direction, but that's about it.  Anyway, that should be on here too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Because every mouse should have a mouse built into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  A mouse with a little track ball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Intel announced, or gave us a little peek at the roadmap.  First of all, PenRin is the next Intel chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, it's the current Core 2.  But at a 45 nanometer?  Nanometer with some improvements in power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, a significant improvement because they can get up to 12 megabytes of L2 cache in  that sucker.  Wow.  I mean, that's going to make a difference in performance, right?  Definitely.  If they actually put it in there.  They have the room, but they may not build it in.  They might go into server applications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Is it Nahalem? Nahalem? Nahalem.  I mean, it's interesting because they're looking, it seems like they're trying to push  the entire product line into a single design.  That's what's interesting about Nahalem.  Basically, the very number of processors on the die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, PenRin is the second half of this year.  That's the one with, that's a smaller process, 45 nanometers, which means you can get more  silicon on it, which means you can have a lot more cache.  Support for DDR3.  Oh, really?  So faster memory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that if you're using a single threaded application with that processor, it will be  smart enough to go, oh, it's not utilizing both cores.  So, you know what?  Our thermal envelope is such that we can go ahead and overclock one of the cores.  Wow.  And to get increased performance.  More performance out of the one and let the other one win.  It's more aware of what its capabilities are and what its thermal envelope is.  That's PenRin?  Yeah.  And if it's slacking off on one core, it's like, oh, crank up the other one.  Go to town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, next year, Nahalem, and that has built in a built in memory controller.  Yes.  Like AMD.  Interesting.  They've got so much room on these chips now.  And they're stepping away from silicon.  So, you're saying, Patrick, that you believe their goal is to make one product with anything  from one to eight cores in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That's what it seems like.  It almost seems like they're going to sort of a single die with all these different options.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They say, you know, they sell you, okay, how much you got, Roger?  Okay, we'll enable two of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, if you think about it, it would be a great way to scale across a product line.  If you have, say, a single core model, you could make an ultramobile PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Same sockets, same bus.  Think about the money you save on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Does anybody really believe that this is even possibly going to happen with these guys?  What, an eight core processor?  No, I'm talking about one product that they're going to be able to productize in all kinds of different ways.  I'm not saying one product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I'm saying like one design.  Rather than having, you know, what do you call it, like the crappy product, the mainstream product.  Yeah, no, I understand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But the problem is they've got two or three design centers and they all compete with each other.  There's a lot of office politics in a big company like Intel.  The likelihood of this ever happening to me is zero.  We want our own business.  I want my business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, but think about it.  I mean, if you want to talk about the politics of Intel, it's like the Israeli design group with the PennyMM came in and destroyed everybody in the United States.  And I think that's what you're saying.  Completely rewrote the entire architecture for the processor lines.  And then that got adopted into the, I mean, Intel at this point, Intel's got a guy running it that's really pissed off because he got his ass kicked by AMD.  He took a beating in Wall Street.  And now it's a total pride game for Intel.  It's like we're the, you know, we're one of the most powerful companies in the industry.  You know, we have all this money of all these research centers and it's produce or die, even more so than it was back in the bad old days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'm not saying that they're not going to produce interesting stuff.  I'm just doubting that this scenario is going to ever come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you believe 45 nanometers?  That's amazing.  I mean, that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Does anybody concerned about the fact that they're dropping a 2.5 billion dollar fab in the middle of China?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, where else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  China is buying all of our, you know, just a few years ago, our government was busting Toshiba for selling some something to like a Russian submarine company.  Oh, yeah.  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They were selling milling technology for the submarines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't ever cross him on a military stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That happened like in the early 90s.  And that really because it was.  China owns us anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  We owe them how much?  OK, you're right.  We should just give in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but it would be nice to see in that press release that, oh, yes, this facility we are putting in China would include the latest in environmentally friendly processes.  And that's why you put it in China.  Because we can work.  I run the day.  I'm working in an Intel fab.  Did you watch the host?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The movie, the Korean movie with the formaldehyde giant fish mutated creature comes out and whacks everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that true or is it fiction?  It's fiction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it's based on the fact that back in the early 90s, US medical doctor was working in a mortuary.  Yes, it's a mortuary where they put dead people.  Yes, he took he took 200 basically 200 bottles worth of formaldehyde dumped it straight into the drain.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  Down in the Han River.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's actually supposed to be a great movie.  Yeah, no, it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you like monster movies, I highly recommend.  So it's fiction, but it's based on a true story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  How we got from the Intel politics to that.  I'm just saying we.  It's OK for you to plug your website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The show hasn't been the same since you left.  One last thing on the penmanship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've actually enabled that hyper threading style technology in each core.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yes, you can do so really 16 processors in a sense on an eight way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, a couple of virtual processors per core.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, the really cool thing is certain models will have an integrated graphics core as well.  So essentially you could have a single solution on a very small board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm more pleased that software designers and writers right now are catching up with multi core multiprocessor technology.  They're fighting threading.  Yeah, we're seeing a few actually consumer applications, like games in particular.  So games are starting to be more supreme commanders.  Probably the best example out there right now.  Just came out a couple of weeks ago and it is completely optimized for two four cores and automatically detects and rolls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Carmac say that you multi threading and games don't go together at the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He said it. That was a valid argument.  It's like, well, there's that chicken and the egg argument.  There aren't enough dual core processors in the market.  Now everybody has to.  Yeah. And he was more or less pushing for a while there.  At least the easiest way for new developers to get started was to look at the cell phone market and develop Java based platform there and get your start there and then move into the more expensive hardware that's more difficult to design for.  But it's a significant cost nowadays to do a production of a triple A title.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you think all game were you at GDC, the Game Developer Conference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wasn't able to go this year.  I was laying flat down.  A lot of multi core talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't actually sit in on any panels.  Okay.  Or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All I can say is Alia, Yakta, Est.  That's our guild.  No, that's our guild.  That's our guild.  Oh, your guild.  Oh, you and Alia.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay.  See me and give me stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  But you can also say that console systems, latest console systems are also promoting multi core technology or multi core thinking.  That's what PS3 is right?  A-way processor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I don't realize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or at least.  It's interesting because it's like one of the things I saw at GDC was a heavy promotion for a lot of middleware and solutions like X and A where you essentially kind of separate a bulk of the complexity away from the developer so they can concentrate on making the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they write a high level game that doesn't care about the hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean you still have to design for the hardware in mind but it's not so much of writing straight to the metal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's always been part of the point of GDC is for people to sell products to developers.  Exactly.  That's what it is.  It's all it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean they had a bunch of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Active management and porting to different platforms.  Intel says they're going to a 32 nanometer process in 2009.  Can't wait to see that.  Wow.  Can you see?  Can you get much smaller?  I mean when do we run up against quantum?  You run up minus nanometers.  Negative nanometers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, you can't even see the thing.  They have to at some point because you're going to have to do the light based processors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At some point because you're going to have quantum effects and it's just not going to work anymore.  They're effectively going to.  Electrons get busy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I think it's metal transistors from silicon now.  Are they?  They go to life based forms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pretty soon we'll all have brains.  Wait a minute, that's wrong.  Grow your own computer.  Xbox 360 elite.  Elite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, what is that by the way?  Nothing.  It's a 360.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  HDMI, 120 gigabyte hard drive, colored black instead of beige.  And $76 more.  Yeah, and then it becomes the high end model.  Basically they're selling a bunch of them to early adopters.  And then they basically make it the same color as everything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm glad about it because at least I can get 120 gig hard drive now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they're keeping it black.  No, I think it's supposedly a limited edition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think they backed off on that.  They backed off on that and it will be available in quantity.  They're not going to do.  It will be a separate skew totally.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I'm kind of sad because there's no built in HD DVD drive.  No Wi-Fi, that's the big one for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just don't like having Wi-Fi built into the Wii and the PS3.  It's kind of convenient.  And the Apple TV.  And if you go straight with Microsoft, that's another $100 premium if you want to add their version of Wi-Fi to that console.  I just want it to be quieter.  That's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I've got one that's not noisy at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're deep.  The latest model incorporates I believe a BenQ DVD drive that's significantly quieter than the original.  PS3 is quiet.  That it is.  I have to say that's the selling.  Yeah, the sales are quiet too by the way.  If you believe that news report that came out yesterday or the day before from Coato, or I probably said that wrong,  but PlayStation had an FCC filing for an elite version of the PS3 that incorporated a larger hard drive and probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it's rumored to be 80 gigs though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, 80 or there's no reason they can't even go higher than that as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The thing is it's kind of stupid because the whole point about the point that Sony was making about the PS3 was that you could,  the user could swap out the hard drive.  Manuel, I mean why wouldn't you just pick up like 120?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that only in the premium edition that you can swap out the hard drive?  No, you should be able to swap out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You can't swap it out on the Xbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can't find it in the stores except the premium version.  Yeah, but it comes in that funky casing that only Microsoft has the magic keys to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't the drive somehow formatted weird too?  Don't you have to somehow get the image over?  Yeah, because there's DRM on it.  You can't like switch them between different next boxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's tied to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh yeah, well one of the things is when they're also selling the 120 gig hard drive separately.  Yeah, what happens to all my content?  It comes with a cable and the weird thing is you can only move it one way.  So you can move content from the 20 gig up to the 120 but you can't go backwards.  Well that makes sense.  And you can't do multiple drives.  So say you have content spread between 220 gigs.  Roger the pirate foiled again.  Why would I need to pirate anything?  But it's also, you think about all the HD content they're offering on their Xbox Live Marketplace as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's just to give you room for saving those movies you want to download.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  You download two movies, there's no more room on your hard drive.  Very true.  They're big.  But they look good, I have to say.  This is one place where they really beat Apple TV.  They've got high def television shows, true high def 720p and they've got high def movies.  They can only rent them.  The downloads are so huge.  Well they take a while but you just run it.  You leave your, that's why I don't like it.  I'm always in my bedroom, sorry.  All night.  That is annoying.  Yeah.  It doesn't bother me because I'm deep too.  But my wife is.  So why is it in the bedroom?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you sleep in your game room?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's kind of weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Next question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How about that Blu-ray, huh?  James Bond, Casino Royale, suddenly taking the lead.  They sold what?  Ten million units?  Some huge number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, like a hundred thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, alright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Ten million, a hundred thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It was the first high def second gen DVD format to make like the top ten on Amazon.  They sold about a hundred thousand of the Blu-ray version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The death of Blu-ray has been greatly exaggerated, I mean he thinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  No argument.  But it's also, it's still A, a little early and B, the other question is nobody knows how many,  I spent like three hours trying to track down a sales number for the regular DVD version of Casino Royale which was number one in sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So how many did it sell?  Yeah, a hundred thousand is huge for...  A hundred thousand is a lot of HD discs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  There's a lot of Blu-ray discs in this case.  No, I mean high def.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the confusing part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But it may be, you're also talking about Casino Royale being in every supermarket and every big...  Well, and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the scale?  He was the best Bond ever.  But the new guy?  Yeah.  Oh, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Nobody in this audience would agree with that.  You're thinking Sean Connery?  Take a vote.  Alright, Connery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Actually, who was the best Bond ever?  What's his name put on the Majesty's Secret Service?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Moore?  No, not Moore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  George Lazenby?  Yeah, I like him.  He was the best guy ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He got hitched and his wife gets it at the end.  I mean, come on, it's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Craig falls in love with the woman and then she turns out to...  Oh, I don't want to spoil it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  We asked the question, how many think there's a new guy?  I wonder if you all think the best Bond was Sean Connery.  I like the bitters in that.  No, no, no.  It's not the question.  The question is, is the new guy the best guy?  Some people might like Roger Moore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How many think Roger Moore is the best Bond ever?  Oh, come on.  Those are the two best.  Now I know you're lying.  George Lazenby?  Yay.  There's one that nobody knows.  There was an obscure...  Timothy Dalton.  Timothy Dalton.  No, come on.  He hated everything.  He was stiffer than a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And who's the new guy?  Ronson.  Pierce Ronson was the best.  Pierce Ronson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Poe Ronson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Poe Ronson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everybody thinks Sean Connery.  If this crowd laughs when I make a Poe Ronson joke, I know we've got a good audience.  That is obscure.  Pierce Ronson?  Brosnan?  Brosnan.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay, so I said his name.  And who's the new guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Craig?  What's his name?  Craig...  Roger Craig?  Does he have a show on the late night?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I don't know what his name is.  Craig Ferguson.  Craig Ferguson.  Who thinks he's the best Bond ever?  You do, apparently.  Daniel Craig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, come on, Veronica.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wasn't he the cutest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even though his ears stick out?  Cute.  And his face is totally round.  He looks like a muffin.  And he looks like he's been boxed a few times.  He looks like a muffin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  He looks like a muffin.  He looks like a muffin.  He looks like a muffin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He looks like a muffin.  He looks like a muffin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He looks like a muffin.  A few times.  He looks like a Brit.  He looks like a...  He does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think...  He's the best Bond ever.  This latest Bond movie, I think, was absolutely awesome, and I think it's the first huge blockbuster  movie that's been released on HDDV or Blu-ray that's a huge blockbuster.  I agree, and that's why it's selling.  So it'll be interesting to see what happens if there's a really, really huge blockbuster  that comes out on HDDV.  And I just wish they would consolidate, so I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That movie has so many holes in it, it was ridiculous.  Their plot lines dropped all the way into place.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You're saying Bond movie?  If there's no plot holes, what's the point in watching it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're saying there's a plot hole in a Bond movie?  Wait a minute.  All right, next topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Geez.  How is there dialogue?  We're talking about the intel a minute ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just a quickie.  Does Netflix actually provide tracking numbers for what they do in terms of rental sales?  I'd be curious about that.  They probably do.  I gotta go on their site and check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you know you can only choose Blu-ray or HDDV, and if I were to get the LG player,  what would I do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if you're gonna get Casino Royale, that's only on Blu-ray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  So then I have to switch my settings every time I rent a movie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no.  The LG player will play both.  You just drop either disc in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you choose Blu-ray for the time, because you choose a default.  So when I order a movie.  No, no.  I mean the player doesn't care.  I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm talking about Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just order what movie I want.  I don't care what.  Cripple is a strong one.  There are no HDDV.  Doesn't have an HDI, the interactive.  If you look at the logo on top of the LG player, it's not the official HDDV logo, because in  order to have that logo, you have to have three things.  You have to have persistent storage, a piece of flash basically, to store bookmarks and  things like that.  Connect to the internet for everything from interactivity and whatnot.  And the interactive features for the graphics overlays and stuff.  Fully supported as far as the Blu-ray side of things go, but it's all missing as far  as HDDV goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have a great audience here, the GMT attendees.  And I'd like to give them a chance to ask questions.  So if you have a question, just raise your hand and make your way down to the bottom  of the stairs.  Actually on this side.  And then we'll have somebody who can hold the mic up.  If you have something, doesn't have to be a question.  Could be a comment.  Could be a suggestion.  Could be mocking us.  Could be telling us the actual name of James Bond.  So Dell is, we'll do that in a second, but one more stir before we do.  Dell is selling Linux.  That's a loss.  Gee, wow, unbelievable.  Not just on servers, on desktops.  They're supporting it.  This is the third or fourth time they've done that.  No, but I mean, I was at the airport, I said, oh, they had a big banner.  Said Dell, Linux, together at last.  I mean, they were making a big deal about this.  At last, they did it five, six years ago.  No, but only on servers.  This is on desktops now.  Have they said what flavor of Linux is?  They haven't.  I'm wondering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you're allowed to choose when you do your customization.  That's cool.  I'm not positive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's great.  So will they support if you choose anything?  Will they support SUSE and the booktube?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to get one just to see what they preload on that.  How badly they can corrupt it the way they corrupt a Windows machine.  See if it looks like a Windows box.  With just crap that expires in 60 days and stuff I don't need or want.  I want to see the great new AOL Linux client.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I want to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I want to see all the Dell branded applications that should pop up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well Michael Dell's back in charge now, so.  He's running the show again.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Give me back my business.  He was the guy who wanted to advertise on Twitter.  So we like him.  Thanks, Dell.  Thank you, Michael.  Anytime you want to be on the show just let us know.  Vista support now in boot camp.  That's good, although obvious.  I guess the only reason it's significant is because there was some thinking that Leopard,  which is going to support boot camp, was being held back because Vista support was so difficult.  Some people thought that would hold Leopard back to the end of the year.  Now because they've shipped a boot camp that supports Vista, everybody says, oh good, we'll  have Leopard someday.  When?  When?  Before the summer.  Before the summer.  They say in their typically Northern Hemisphere centric way in the spring, we should say in  Northern Hemisphere spring since we have many Australian listeners.  Absolutely.  Don't you think?  I think so.  It's time we stop this Northern Hemisphere chauvinism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Throw a month out there.  A quarter.  Quarters are good.  A quarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the end of the second quarter, unless your fiscal year is.  Three.  Yes sir.  What's your name, please?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My name is Joe Kuhn.  I'm from Asheville, North Carolina.  Hey Joe, how are you?  Welcome.  I'm Alex, because this has been an awesome seminar.  Best bang for the buck.  It's been wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And please, when we do another one, everybody come, because we'd love to have you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My question is, Adobe CS3 has been announced, and Premiere has come back to the Mac.  Is this a good thing, or a Final Cut Pro user is going to flock, or are we just going to  go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think so.  What do you think, Patrick Norton?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Roger and I have both seen it.  I was actually in a conversation with the vice president of that division and the product  manager for Premiere about eight months ago, and said point blank, you're like, so you're  going to think about converting over to Premiere in your production cycle?  And I'm like, yeah, just as soon as hell freezes over, and I have something better.  Sorry, I hate Premiere.  I use Premiere One, I use Premiere Two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But even if you loved it, if you've used Final Cut, why would you change?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well actually, I can't talk about a number of things, but the new version of Premiere.  Why not?  Because I honor my NDAs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute.  Yeah, well that's because you signed them.  That's right.  I consider it an unethical thing to do.  I refuse to sign any NDAs.  So I would honor them if I had signed one.  I don't sign them because I forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So tell me about the last time you bought a computer product, Mr. Ethics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right then.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  What?  The thing is, there's some really, it's a really, it's a really, no, it's, well look,  I've got issues with Final Cut right now too.  You know, Final Cut Express versus Pro, they're different code bases, they screw up video  in different and exciting ways.  And I love Final Cut Pro, but the new version of Premiere looks really, really good.  And if they do a competitive upgrade, it's starting to look really compelling to think  about walking away from Final Cut.  Oh really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It seems surprising to me that they'd even try to get into that market.  Final Cut is so dominant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm so confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you like it or do you not like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  No, if, before I started seeing what's coming out with the new version of Premiere, right,  the new version of Premiere is very exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It would have to offer something compelling over Final Cut for you to switch.  It offers a number of compelling things over Final Cut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Like what?  He can't talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I was trying to trick him.  Well you know, it's a way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I won't divulge anything either, but I would say like when I actually learned video editing,  it was a pretty crappy piece of software.  But when they actually shipped out Pro for the PC, that was actually the first time I  could actually use it without it crashing on me repeatedly.  What software crashes on?  Premiere?  On Windows.  And the thing is when they rolled out Premiere Pro, that was actually a very stable, usable  product that if you used Adobe Photoshop and all the other Adobe products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That's sort of the things you would expect from Adobe, like stability.  Adobe Premiere is also the only program that Adobe's ever junked the entire original source  code and rewritten it from scratch, which is part of the reason when they went from  Premiere to Premiere Pro, Premiere Pro started bringing people back to it.  They basically, they bought, remember the guys who went from Play and became Serious Magic?  They acquired Serious Magic, they pulled in all of those engineers.  So a lot of people who really, really like video and know how video is supposed to look  in the real world are influencing not only Premiere, but also things like Flash, so things  like AV sync, you know, little things like that.  A lot of the, we should see some really improved things coming out of Flash in the next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's kind of funny because in many ways it's a lot more, I'm not sure, forward thinking  than most people would imagine a video editing suite would be.  Compared, I mean the thing is with Final Cut, it was always kind of geared toward doing  kind of cinematic theatrical, you know, either a short movie, a long movie, but it wasn't  really designed around, say for example, a news production environment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not designed around a production environment at all.  And that's the integration across the different applications within CS3 is pretty incredible.  Versus the sort of crap in a box you get, because you can't buy, well no, you snicker,  right, but who here wants to pay, you know, how much, how much, $13, $1600 for Final Cut  Pro Studio when all you really want is to edit video?  Oh, right.  You know what I mean?  It's like you don't, you know, it's a really, it's a really well thought out suite.  It's really going to do interesting stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's your name, what's your name, sir?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dennis Moore, Lake Tahoe.  Hey, Dennis.  Hey.  About the Apple TV, everything that I'm reading about it is people want to hack it to make  a product line.  They already have significantly.  Yeah, here's the thing, I read someplace the other day that all of those hacked machines  when they're calling home for updates are all locking up and becoming $300 door stops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's what you do, it's very simple, you make an image of the drive before you do anything  to it.  I think the most important hacks are going to be on external drives.  It turns out you can boot a USB drive.  So I think what you're going to see is all the hacks will move to the external drive.  People will keep their Apple TV intact internally, boot from an external drive with all the hacks  they want.  If Apple disables it, which they may, who knows, I mean, I would expect they would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Just read it.  What's the, can you explain to the listeners out there exactly why any hacks are being  done in the first place?  What's, in other words, what's wrong with the product that needs to be hacked?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Couple of hacks are very popular.  One is putting in a bigger hard drive.  And a 40 gig hard drive is not enough, but if you, of course it streams pretty well,  but let's say you wanted to put everything locally.  The other one is putting a Divx or Xvid codec on there so you can play your Xvid movies.  And I think this is maybe what Apple's worried about is that people would, I don't know,  put a BitTorrent client on it, put a Xvid codec on it and all of a sudden.  Why wouldn't they care?  Well, you're right.  I don't think Apple cares, but I think the movie industry does and they probably put  a lot of pressure on Apple.  You're right.  From their point of view, the more you hack it, the more they sell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They don't care otherwise.  They would have put more protection against doing it.  They didn't protect it well at all.  They want to sell hardware.  That's, I mean, the only reason they're doing what they do with iTunes is to sell hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have to keep the, if the movie industry gets really unhappy, that can hurt them.  And remember, they're trying to get studios to move to iTunes.  There's only a handful of them on there now.  Well, there's like one.  Well, no, no, no.  Some other movie studios have moved there, but it's, you're right, it's not a lot.  So they need to make sure the movie studios play ball with them.  And I think that's the only reason.  Yeah.  And I think you're right, David.  That's why they didn't hack proof it.  I think that the big hacks will be coming in the next couple of days and there'll be  bootable USB drives.  And then, you know, anything you want to do.  Suddenly it's a $300 Mac.  Well, it is.  It's a penny mm.  It's not the greatest Mac ever, but it's enough to play back video.  I want to thank everybody here in the audience for putting up with us.  You've been a great audience.  Thank you for joining us at the GMT conference.  And it's been so much fun getting back to the original Twitter panel.  We really appreciate Patrick Norton from DL.TV.  Thank you for being here.  Roger Chang, also from DLTV.  It's really great to see you again.  Come back again.  We need more military expertise on the panel.  It's important to have you.  From Revision 3, David Prager.  Every time I see you, you've got new announcements, new shows.  Things are coming along.  It looks like Revision 3 is doing very well.  J. Adelson at South by Southwest said he believes that the Apple TV in conjunction with Revision  3 is the beginning of IPTV.  We'll see.  I gave him a big opening there.  I don't know.  He's a busy, busy man.  From Buzz Out Loud.  And ladies and gentlemen, the vlogging air guitar champion.  Let's see a little air guitar.  Veronica Belmont.  It's great to have you.  I'll see you in World of Warcraft.  You know there's a lot of people in that guild.  There's like a thousand people.  I thought it was exclusive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  We capped a thousand and then it ducked down again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought it was exclusive.  It was podcast.  It was everybody in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's millions of WoW players so a thousand could be exclusive.  Okay, I guess you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  What level do I have to get to before I can actually be part of your group?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

I'm an old warrior.  You said you needed some warriors.  I thought I could tank for you.  I'm really working on that.  What a geek.  I play this game.  I'm sitting playing this game.  My son, my 12-year-old son comes up and says, Dad, that game is only for really major geeks.  And he brings his friends come over and says, look, my dad's such a geek.  Look what he's doing.  He mocks me.  Also from DLTV and PC Magazine, they're high definition television expert Robert Herent.  So great to have you back.  Thank you.  Now that the bubble's out of your eye, I hope you'll make it more.  Almost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like I'm wearing swim goggles over the castle of water.  And I saved the best for last.  Center stage, ladies and gentlemen, dvorak.org.  Good to have you back too, John.  Thank you very much.  Thank you all for joining us.  Another twit is in the can.

Transcript:  Round the board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Too much work.  The problem is there's no limit.  My server's completely collapsed.  So here's the deal.  I'm just trying to get the thing up, but I have a hell of a time.  I can't even get the two screens.  Like, forget it.  I'm killing you.
