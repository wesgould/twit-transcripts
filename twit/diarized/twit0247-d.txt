Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  August 27th well that's I don't know that's the end of the  that's when school starts I don't know I have to look I would love to go  don't count on it. I would love for you to come. Thank you Callie. So  boy have we talked about actually I'd love to get your take because we haven't  had you guys on  on this whole iPhone  thing and I know MG you were following this fairly closely  is there any new news I mean I know that they the guy who  who founded on the barstool says he regrets not looking for the owner  more with more severity

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it sounds like they're just kind of  saying whatever the lawyers tell them to say at this point still. Now give us a story that I don't know what you're talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  oh come on get out of here John C. DeVore. The really big question MG  is is there any movement at all on the shield law  issue you remember of course that Jason Chen the writer for Gizmodo  who showed off the stolen or missing or lost or purchased iPhone  his house was searched a couple weeks ago by the react squad which is a  special Silicon Valley  police unit they confiscated computers  laptops, iPads even his business cards  he had a letter. Those business cards just in case.  He had a letter from the Gawker  COO who's also an attorney saying this is a working journalist he's protected  by the California Federal  Shield laws you may not take anything and they took it the letter  right. I love these guys.  They said oh good thanks and they added that to the pile  so but then a couple days later they said well we're gonna pause in the  investigation till we get a legal ruling on whether this stuff  is admissible whether there is a shield law protecting is there any movement on  that at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  as far as I know there hasn't been a lot of what going on in the past  week or so I mean they're still trying to determine you know the key thing of  this is  if he if he or Gizmodo or Gawker or the parent you know purchased the  actual stolen unit and knew it was stolen at the time  then does that throw out the shield law you know claim that they're trying to  make right

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  that's the key thing. I don't want to I'm not I I know we beat this dead horse for  weeks on end I just wanted to get into a check-in  there's nothing more to say. No there's still a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well I do have one thing to say. Yeah we haven't talked to you since this whole  broke. Hasn't been mentioned we talked about this on the last Cranky Geek show quite a bit  it was interesting because everybody was kind of an agreement  on one thing which is a kinda the embarrassing  tendency for media people  from online and offline and podcasters to  to pile on Jason Chen without all the evidence in as though there's all stolen  goods and I saw it on the  on the blog too. Commenters all stolen goods  throw them in jail stolen goods it was stolen goods and they went on and on  like everybody's a cop  and I find it very reprehensible to be honest about it. I also think it's kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  there's there's two sides to it and it really comes down to Apple lovers and  Apple haters. The Apple lovers  are saying stolen goods and the Apple haters  are saying Apple instigated the investigation is just a lost iPhone you  know it's everybody's got a political position on this based on their feeling  about Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think for the most... Which has nothing to do with the legal issues. I think for the  most part people were  severely severe overly harsh  with Jason as though he did a terrible thing and  I the thing that was ironic is that here he is a guy  serving the public good by getting this phone and deconstructing it in such a  way they can tell us what some of the new features might be which actually is a  consumer  a kind of a consumerist attitude  about things because it gives people the ability to say well maybe I should wait  and buy the next generation phone instead of buying this one  because the public does need this sort of knowledge but nobody gives them credit  for any of that and all they do is jump all over them and now that of course they stole  everybody  the cops took all the stuff they're a little more sympathetic but I was very

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  upset by it. I'm very unsympathetic. I saw a recent blog post that said you know  why aren't journalists hopping mad over this  a clear violation or a seemingly clear violation of

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  shield laws. Callie I'm sorry go ahead. I know I was just going to say as far as we know Jason  didn't actually have anything to do with the grabbing of the iPhone he's just the  one who  who held it up correct. You know I think by the time this is all over and  and some authorities come to a decision  we're probably not going to be paying much attention to it at that point. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  this story is already over the hill but  another one came with checkbook journalism as though this is something  illegal

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  bothered me a bit too. I just I wish there were more attention paid to  the legality of the search and because I think it's so important to emphasize and  I know there's not a popular point of view but  to emphasize that working press is protected  in the interest of protecting free speech from  unwarranted searches and that this I think I'd be very interested to see what ends up  happening with this. That would be amusing I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well there's raids every day in America lawful and unlawful and the funny thing about it is that  once they take your stuff  they say oh we're just going to hold it but they have all of his stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  yeah that they took from his home. We're not going to search it we're just going to find out if it's  legal to search it but they've got it. Exactly once they take it now he's at home no business cards no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  computer no laptop no phone. The business card is what gets me.  Seriously they might as well have took his underwear. I mean you can't operate and have business. You cannot be a reporter you can't do anything with your life  until we're done putting your life on hold. It's amazing. I have one thing to say  forerunner there you go. I'd like to see

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  him. That's an inside joke folks. I would hope that he has some leverage and can  and sue the pants off of everybody responsible and I think it's a possibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Supposedly I think in the warrant too they had the ability to take his  passport and his driver's license but they didn't take that  they just took the business card. That kind of indicates it was a criminal investigation right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I want to take something from Apple's Star class action suit.  Let somebody come raid my house they can take my business cards any day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  There is a story that actually will get it does get me up in arms it is very to  me very offensive  and I think a big deal and I'm going to talk about  the FCC protecting  the public interest. This one is  a shocker and I'm gonna quote from Molly Wood in her Molly Rantz blog.  The Federal Communications Commission decided yesterday that the movie industry  can remotely disable analog video outputs on your home theater equipment  to prevent you from recording certain programs.  Obviously things like first-run movies they're afraid  they assume that you're a thief. Your number one goal in life is to take that  first-run movie they're showing on cable  burn it to a DVD put a blanket on your front lawn and sell it to your neighbors.  The FCC has ruled that it is in the public interest that's a direct quote  in the public interest that the Motion Picture Association of America  have selectable output controls that's the  euphemism they give for the ability to reach into your home theater equipment  and disable the analog hole.  This enables the quote new business model of delivering on-demand movies  closer to theatrical release dates.  I think this is appalling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Ridiculous. Next they're gonna be asking for  control over our microwaves and our computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Come on! Now they did kind of say that maybe the  Motion Picture Association of America had asked for a little too much  so they have quote limited and conditioned the waiver in a manner that  they the FCC says balances the interests of content owners Hollywood  to protect their highest value content and to offer consumers access to early  release high value content.  So this is for you people we're doing this for you  so that you can get movies before they're out on DVD  but in order to do that we're gonna have to let the Motion Picture Association  reach into your AV gear and disable  audio and video outputs on the set-top box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw this coming with a Motorola box that came out some time ago  and somebody was doing a teardown and told me that they had  all these amazing capabilities to do stuff on the network and it's all disabled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Oh yeah if you look at the Motorola boxes they got Firewire  they got Ethernet. And if you actually open the box they're not  connected to diddling.  They just put it on the box. It's not connected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The best thing about that and everything you just said is that it stops maybe my  grandmother from recording a video which she would never do.  But people that are smart or technologically savvy will just get the audio source from  somewhere else. Put it in their Final Cut, sync it and then go about their business.  I mean where do they think the stuff comes from? Half the stuff leaks from Hollywood  anyway from some crackhead getting two three thousand dollars to sell on the  black market and people distribute it. The stuff that comes out screener that  means it was somebody's house and somebody ripped it and put it on the internet.  I mean you can't stop that beast so just doing that it doesn't do anything.  So have that disabled by sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you go to the golden triangle of piracy down off the Malaysian coast where  they stamp out the DVDs all over Asia and every place else.  These things are essentially perfect. They're the actual DVD source code for  the original product or the product that will eventually come out because  some of the features are missing. And that's just what you said.  Somebody got a buy-off or extorted.  Whatever.  And next thing you know. So this just hurts nobody but the public that wants to  do honest backup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I mean this is this is Hollywood again doing this thing that they've been  doing for a while now. You know we saw this a little bit with their their deal  with Netflix and Redbox to kind of pull back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  That was frustrating. Yeah 28 days so Netflix can only give you a DVD 28 days  after it comes out in the store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right and their idea there is of course to prop up falling DVD sales that should  have been falling for the you know last couple years or what not which is once  you know one of their big golden cash cows. But you know this this idea is even  more crazy because this is going to lead to just more piracy. It's like like you  know they really think that people aren't going to be you know figure out a  way to get around this stuff if they want to. What they're trying to do is  obviously you know make a little window in between the theatrical release and  the DVD release where they can charge more kind of like they do in certain  hotel rooms and stuff you know where they have movies that are on there  before they're on DVDs. They could charge like 15 bucks or whatever and you can  watch it. And they're trying to stop people from pirating it. But you know the  whole idea is just backwards thinking they really just need to figure out a  way to make their content ubiquitous and fairly priced and then they will have  to worry much less about piracy than they do now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Why don't they get this? Why are we struggling even to this day? I mean it's  been so long you know and they've done so many things that all of us we  understand that they're doing it wrong. But what is it going to take and what  can we do to convince them otherwise? Is it going to take a generation in between  but then by that time things are going to be so far past that we can't come

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  back to where we are. Who does the FCC represent? I mean does it represent  Hollywood? Is that when it says this is in the public interest? Is Hollywood  the public that they're talking about here? The Hollywood people can go to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Washington DC with the hotties, actresses, starlets and the rest. I don't think it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  the hotties. I'm telling you. I think it's the money. They got a bag, a black bag of money. They say you  would Mr. Senator, Mr. Congressman. You don't know senators. They got bags of money and hotties.  Hotties and bags of money. Hotties and bags of money. Wouldn't corrupt me the money but the  women would. Is that what you're saying? Have you seen Swedish senators lately?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some of the senators might want some guys. I mean you gotta figure out what the money is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  We know that. Hello. Public knowledge points out that some people may actually  buy on-demand movies. People with older HDTVs that only have component and don't  have HDMI in with HDCP, the copy protection required, and not be able to play them.  Sony's response? Call the FCC if that happens. If they give me Julius Genachowski's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  number I'll call him. That'll go over well. Hey Julius. I bet you in the chat room somebody can get that number right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Let's not. I'm trying to get them on the show. It's not harassment. It just strikes me as so  not in the public interest. And as you said, you're absolutely right. There's something  called BitTorrent. If I can't watch the movie what am I gonna do? I'm gonna BitTorrent it.  I'm gonna get it. And not only that I'll get it in high def. It'll be better quality. And then I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  gonna burn a DVD and put it on the freaking blanket. And can I enlighten you something about- What are you so worked up about?  I'm pissed! Well let me help you out too. Besides the fact of all the geekdom and  BitTorrents. I mean if I go to my local barbershop there's a guy with a  table and he's got every CD and every DVD already burnt and ready to go. And let me tell you,  this dude's making two three thousand dollars a week selling two for five DVDs. So don't think  it's just people BitTorrent. And there's one guy at BitTorrents goes to a barbershop. It's not just what  happens in rap videos. I mean people are really slanging physical content on the streets of new  releases that come out. So it's not just BitTorrent. I mean people out there making money. This actually seriously surprises me. I'm telling you. I can't believe you go to a barber. All this hair? It has to be maintained sir. Are you gonna give us this name?  Huh? Yeah where can we go to find those five- You can go to- No no no no. I was joking. Hey his business would boom through the roof right now if I gave out his name. People are looking for him in the streets. Boing Boing said that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  after this decision this is the appropriate sound. We are the MPAA. There is nothing wrong with your television set. Do not attempt to adjust the picture. We control. We are controlling transmission. We will let you. We wish to make it louder. We will bring up the volume. We wish to make it softer. We will tune it to a whisper. Alright quick what show is that? Outer Limits. Outer Limits. Very good. Where'd you

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  where'd your audio go? You gotta talk. John I know the microphone stuff is new to you but you talk into it. Like this? The Outer Limits. I'm taking the lessons from Patrick Norton. I know. The king of off mic. Basically this I didn't know this but this selective output control is already in your set top box. It's already built in. So it just they just needed FCC permission to use it. So they can already disable functions on your

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  on your set top box. As of when? When did this happen? As of when did they get permission? Friday. No no. When did these start appearing in our TV's? Let me see here. It's been several years for sure. I think in the Boing Boing article they talk a little bit about why didn't they just if some of the manufacturers were against this why didn't they just not put it in. Of course they put it in so they could turn it on eventually. So it's been in that some of them have been in there for several years as far as I know. Boing Boing says it's probably also in your

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Macs and in your Windows machines as well. It's you know this this HTCP DTLA and other device based copy protection is in the TV. It's in the set top box. It's in the AV receivers and everything. Your DVD player. I don't like that. How are they going to reach into it though? I mean I guess it's it's got to be a set top box because then the cable company could do it. I just don't like anybody being able to reach into my laptop to do anything that I don't want them to do. That seems like a problem. My my cable box. I rent that. I mean jump in there do what you want. I'll throw it against the wall. Bring me a new one. My laptop somebody reach

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  into my laptop. Mike is smacking the face repeatedly. Well they're not talking about that thousand miles away. How are you going to do that? I will find somebody. There's a plane I got here. I'm thousand miles away. Don't mess with the doctor. He's got attitude. He's got to laptop. That sounds shady. Lots of talk. Hey hey you heard what I'll make a video. I will blog about. I have a blog and I'm not afraid to use it. There you go. All right. I want to talk about the difference between billions and millions and why Procter and Gamble

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  cares in just a second. But first we're going to talk a little bit about our good friends at Citrix the folks who do go to meeting. Citrix has such a great line of products.

So people haven't talked much about this stock market thing that happened. I was sitting here I think it was Thursday. I was doing Windows weekly and all of a sudden I see the chat room saying the Dow has just dropped 500 it's just dropped 600 it's just dropped a thousand points.  It was the biggest drop ever in the history of the Dow came right back.  But here's the interesting thing.  It might have been according to CNBC a simple typo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't believe it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what I want to know is that finger trade. I want to I want to just find out who made the most money in that 10 seconds. It seems a little off. Arrest them. That's what I want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean if you if you look at it because traders they have a specific amount that they're able to trade right without additional approval.  So if you if you look at the difference between a million and a billion people aren't going to be able to hit that button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean we're talking about three extra zeros here and if somebody has approval to do a million dollars worth let's assume that this thing wasn't that I am not I don't come on this show and I assure you to plug my  show however I hear I hear however coming but a big but that's why I said however.  If you listen to today's no agenda Curry actually has a apparently somebody connected to Goldman Sachs who discusses what they say happened which was they were beta testing some software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  That makes more sense because first of all it crashed the system the initial story said the guy typed a B instead of an M when you make it when you make a trade you don't type O N E M I N I O N.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah so that was on the face of it a little suspicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why do I also never get to the bottom of the anomalies with you know some stock prices went from 40 to zero dollars and you know actually nothing went to zero but one one stock went from 45 dollars to 40.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  45 dollars to four cents Procter and Gamble went cut cut in half and that's the one that they think it was a Procter and Gamble futures trade error.  City group says well we you know it didn't happen with us everybody's denying it.  The Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange because it hit both said they may cancel some trades that took place during the frenzy.  I think there's one thing that we know for sure computers did this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes those pesky computers.  Computers did this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Although that a lot of people are just extremely antsy and skittish given everything that's happening over in Greece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well that's what the news story said oh this is about Greece but why I mean it was like that.  It was the most I've never seen anything like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean I think there was something that started right into this and people just started selling like crazy I mean that's why it dropped that fast.  So as soon as they saw it.  Yeah anything going down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well we know there's a lot of program training too so that there are ceilings in their floors and then when it when the floor is hit sometimes people go get out get out get out get out now.  And then I have to say I had a mental ceiling floor because as soon as I saw Apple down you know whatever was 30 percent I thought by now.  Here's a chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All those trades were thrown away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well it's also you know unless you've got a special pipeline go ahead and try it go to E-Trade and try to buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No actually Horowitz was talking about this on another show.  The Disciplined Investor.  No my the DH Unplugged.  Jesus Christ how many shows do you do.  Oh listen to him.  For crying out loud.  He was you know he's a you know who he is he's helped.  I love Andrew he's great.  So Andrew says he tried they did everything they could to buy one share of anything it was impossible.  Right.  There's too much volume.  And they're hooked in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Right.  So even if you're hooked in you couldn't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What does Greece have to do with anything in the world anymore that people would say oh it's because Greece is rioting.  Like what comes out of Greece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Because they owe because if they owe to us or others and they default.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I like China is going to lend us some more money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hummus is really more of a I think more Middle Eastern than Greek.  Baba Ghanoush.  Still you're back you're moving over too far.  Dolmas.  Yeah there you go.  Dolmas baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Olives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is Greek olive.  Sheep.  Sheep feta.  Feta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is like.  Did they answer your question?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  He asked what what Greece had to do with anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  People were like it's a global economy.  I'm like Greece is so small on the radar of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nobody nobody said it had anything to do with Greece.  No that's what the story was initially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Because Greece is rioting and the stock market is vomiting because of Greece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm like really.  Boys.  Boys.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Kelly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Now all I was I was saying was that you know there was some speculation that that it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  had to do with Greece and Greece is bigger than just Greece at the moment because of  all these other countries that are involved are are affected because of Greece defaulting  then then it's a much bigger issue than just Greece.  But who's to say I mean who's to say it was that it was just I'm saying that it was  potentially that people were you know skittish over it.  But then something happened up front to to kind of.  Increase that fear.  According to the Financial Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  By the way one thousand billion dollars was briefly wiped off the market value of U.S.  equities.  Is that right.  Trillion.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For a very short time.  A trillion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  The conventional wisdom according to FT held that an incorrectly incorrectly type sell  order was the likely culprit.  This is what saying Lee managing principal at the eight groups said I would be shocked  if that was not the case is this the fall in stocks were so sudden and extreme.  However.  The first despite the persistence of this story officials were struggling to identify  a specific cause we still don't know what was the initiating signal.  Says Jeff Wecker chief executive officer at Lyme brokerage the verdict is still out.  I think though if there's a moral here it's that the stock market is still out.  The moral here is that we've got to have some sort of this is like war games.  This is like global thermal nuclear war the computers took over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This could be just a warning shot across the bow.  Do you think the Chinese did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Let's just throw away all the computers.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And done with them.  Can you imagine a trillion dollars of value lost if we were doing this with pencil and  paper.  I think not.  Would have taken a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Please don't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Back to paper.  You have to use a horse.  Both the New York Stock Exchange.  Nasdaq and BATS and Direct Edge announced cancellation of trades executed between 2 40 p.m.  and 3 p.m. Eastern Time.  That was the weird time.  But they still they you know they still don't really know what somebody made some money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody made some money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I think there's more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think whoever made the money then you can get something going on.  But I don't know if this wouldn't be it wouldn't be so transparent that that didn't your buddy

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Mr. Conspiracy Theory have anything to I mean more to add.  I mean it seems to me this is the kind of thing the this is the kind of thing the world  global Illuminati conspiracy theory.  Right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm looking for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  This is the kind of thing they do isn't it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We talk about it but I don't want to.  Doesn't he know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah he does.  He apparently has a guy that he has a guy that the person who created the conspiracy  the person who flew over from Europe that was going to put the code in play in Chicago  was there for one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they were trying some software out.  They were trying some software out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What was the software supposed to do.  It was a flash trading system.  The one that Goldman uses.  This makes sense.  They go in there and they flip the switch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Flash trading is designed to make money in very quick short high frequency trades.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so they put this thing on the market takes a huge hit immediately.  They take it offline as fast as they can.  And apparently the guy jumped on a plane right then and there.  Got the hell out.  And flew back home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  This is like you know when they have armies cross the bridge they have them break stride  because otherwise the resonance builds up and the bridge will collapse.  This is like that.  Or something.  We've got to make them break stride.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway so but it's a bad signal.  Because if this could happen so.  It's too easy.  It was too easy.  There's something wrong with this computerized trading system.  Let's face it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't trust Wall Street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Do you trust Main Street Odokta?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I trust half of Main Street more than I do Wall Street.  Forerunner!  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay give us the joke on this forerunner.  Oh you weren't here for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  But the last time Odokta was here he talked about he'd gone into an Apple store.  He broke his laptop.  Oh right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Forerunner you were going to steal the.  You were going to rob the place.  I'm a thief.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hang out at barber shops.  Don't walk around with a gun in your hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe that would help.  Stop it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  He came in there.  He said he wanted to buy a Mac laptop.  The little.  All right.  I must say it.  White girl behind the counter.  I should let you read the e-mails.  Speaks into her sleeve and says forerunner.  And she disappears and a black guy comes out to serve you.  And the doors are suddenly manned.  And there's all these guys coming out watching you Odokta.  Because they thought I think you were going to steal it.  Even though he was offering twenty five hundred dollars cash for a brand new laptop.  I'll let you read the e-mails the Apple people sent me.  Did you ever get an e-mail from the Apple folks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got like thirty thousand dollars.  Did you get an e-mail from the Apple folks?  I got like thirty e-mails from thirty Apple employees.  What did they say?  What was the general?  Nothing official.  No.  Everyone started with please don't post this publicly.  Every single one.  And here we go.  I didn't post it publicly.  I'm not reading them out verbatim.  What did they say generally?  In general half of them said that's not their procedure.  They just meant floor runner for someone to go bring me the item.  The other half said I use trigger words as in I'm in a rush and they thought I had a  credit card and I was using a stolen credit card.  And I said even after I said cash and then they shut up and didn't reply to that e-mail.  So half of them were like that's not how it goes.  So it could have been a mistake.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Could have been that they said floor runner get me a laptop for this nice gentleman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep.  And I triggered I used words as in I want to buy this now and that made them feel nervous.  So next time I go in I just should say I don't know what I should say but I should be.  Give them a note.  I want to buy this in five minutes.  Maybe.  Yeah.  Maybe I should shuffle more.  I want to take a Caucasian friend next time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I have a one way ticket to Tehran and I am ready to use it.  I'm going to take Jon with me.  I have a gob.  I have a gob.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to take Jon with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Jon.  Yeah, nobody would think Jon is anything.  Kentucky baby!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kentucky.  There he goes.  He's got the right shirt on.  He's a Kentucky nutball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's American.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  He loves people.  All right.  So Facebook this week.  Oops.  Little mistake that allows people to read other people's chats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love that.  I think that's a great feature.  Whoopsies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Now, I don't know about you, but chat sometimes can get a little heated, a little steamy,  a little perhaps more than you'd like the world to know.  Is that not true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Is that just me?  It's not just you.  I think it's true.  No, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Explain to us what you're talking about.  Is that not true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Doesn't sometimes, sometimes in chat, don't you do things that you probably would not  like other people to see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you mean when I have stock market picks and I discuss things like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah, that's it.  He's old, isn't he, Kelly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What are you talking about?  He's just an old man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what he's talking about.  He's talking about lady callers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Okay, I'm talking about the booty chat.  There you go.  You see?  Got a little love romance going on in Facebook.  Do you do this, Leo?  No, I don't do this.  I'm a happily married man, but I know others who do.  Huh, who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People.  He can't name names, Jon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just wonder why not?  This can't be that bad.  You've never heard of sexting, Jon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, the internet is all about perversion and close-natured people having fun with one  another, or better yet, talking trash about others.  Where's the pen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's why we should throw away all the computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You might have a pen.  I've got to write this down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Throw away the computers again.  I'm talking.  You just throw away Facebook.  They don't care about privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They just give me a pen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here, here's a pen.  You don't want a pen?  It's a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I've got paper, I've got a pen, and I've got a horse outside for you.  It's a Mustang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, eHarmony, there you go.  I have a code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So, anyway, this is just one more thing from Facebook.  Is Facebook completely out of control?  The eroding privacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's out of control making money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, it's trying to make money, but here's the deal.  They made a promise, implicit or not, that we would go to Facebook, we would post personal  information about ourselves that would only be visible to people we said it was visible  to.  And you believe that?  Yeah.  Was that a mistake?  Apparently.  Boy, you're cynical.  No, not me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You believe that?  The second time around, you believed that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Third time around, isn't it?  It's not the fourth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm just saying, I mean, it's happened enough that I don't trust anything on Facebook, but  the situation is, is that, you know, as high and mighty as we get or as upset as we all  get over it, the majority of Facebook users have no idea and don't care whatsoever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They would when the boss gets ahold of their personalized chat and say, hey, you and Sally  over in accounting have been doing some weird stuff here on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It's going to get worse because MG reported this week in TechCrunch that Facebook's going  to start adding location updates to your status up.  Go rob my house.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have a whole new story along that line.  I'm probably going to post later tonight.  I think I know pretty much everything that they're doing.  Do you want to scoop it?  Scoop it.  Come on, scoop, scoop, scoop.  I'll tell you to check TechCrunch later.  I still got to dig up a few things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, Leo, don't bring him on anymore.  Give us the outline.  Give us a little hint.  We're seeing Kevin Rose.  Yeah.  Kevin, by the way, is not on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  He said, I can't come on the show until dig is done being redesigned, but I'll come on  and I will debut it on Twitter.  So I'm holding on to these with the brand new dig will be on Twitter.  So what give us kind of the outlines?  Is there more than I mean, clearly this is scary for people like Foursquare and go walla  because Facebook's huge.  Yeah, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's kind of weird that Facebook is doing this like right now.  I'm wondering if they might delay what they plan to do for a little bit because of obviously  all these privacy things that are blowing up in their face right now.  If they go and turn on the ability to send out your location to every single person and  maybe publicly, I don't think people are going to like that too much.  So I wouldn't be surprised if they delay this a little bit.  But yeah, I mean, basically what they're going to do is they're going to have a feature that  allows you to check into various places around the country and presumably around the world, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So then the question is, are you going to check in via Facebook or go walla or Foursquare?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's that's kind of the cool thing that they're doing.  I think that they're going to allow you to kind of bring in all the different streams of the different check ins.  You know, you can bring in your Foursquare check in, you can bring in your go walla check in,  and they kind of all get populated in your newsfeed or whatnot.  I'm pretty sure they're going to do that.  But they'll also have their own little thing because they have, you know, I think the Ad Age article  about it talked about how they have a deal with McDonald's and they have some deals with other brands that,  you know, they'll be able to check in places and get special deals on certain, you know, Big Macs and whatnot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Oh, that's great. So my insurance company is going to say, Oh, Leo, we noticed you ate at McDonald's 15 times last month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is one of the reasons I tell people not to get those cards from the grocery store.  Yeah, because it's only a matter of time.  Unless they give you a yeah, the insurance companies will get that data and they're going to say this guy, all he does is eat fat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It's just a matter of time.  Your insurance buddy. You're out.  You have another lemon crisp. These are sugar sprinkled. They're fabulous. I love them.  I think one's enough.  From Bora Bay. We had a bunch of candy in the crunch in the studio yesterday.  Today, they're good.  Normally we give John wine. Today, we're seeing if sugar will change his attitude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He seems sweet to me.  Baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sugar and a bunch of coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I try to deactivate my Facebook account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook is evil. I mean, seriously, like the other day, somebody messaged me like, man, Facebook really knows me.  It just popped up a tennis thing and I signed up and it just was watching that they mentioned that they bought a tennis racket.  So then they just got swarmed with tennis ads.  And then finally they bought something.  But in that case, it works out. It's fine.  But it's just the fact that they're entrenched in everything.  I don't think it's so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It doesn't bother me if there's an aggregate.  I mean, Google does this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they're selling you like body and soul.  It's an aggregate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  But I just worry that the borderline between what you put on Facebook and where it goes seems to be blurring and blurring and blurring.  There's a great infographic on the web, somebody did, that shows the five Facebook, you know, evolving Facebook policies based on the EFF post about the Facebook's eroding privacy policy.  It just shows how it's like an ink stain.  Your personal information, which was once just you and your friends, is now spread out to the entire world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bottom line is it is free. And if you don't like it, get off.  I think I'm going to get off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not like this guy in the three or four people in the chat room say, try and delete your Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, you can deactivate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But don't hold it in case you want to come back to junk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, this is a little scary, but I continuously look back, you know, five years even.  And we would be scared to death of where we were in terms of privacy a year ago.  But now we're past that.  And so, I mean, this it's a stepping stone, right?  I mean, we're continuously getting further and further.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Are we like the frog in the water that's slowly boiling and we're just not noticing it?  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Cooking down the road, not going to be tasty about the types of things we're worried about today.  It's very interesting and a little scary in itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, right now, we've been seeing that over and over again with with all the location stuff that's coming out now.  It's like people, you know, when they first hit last year and they first started to gain a little bit of popularity just within the tech community, even people were talking about, oh, this is going to be the end of times.  People are sharing their location.  This is going to be really bad.  But now, you know, more people and more people are signing up for and getting used to it.  And now it's becoming somewhat of a norm.  Go rob my house.com.  That's a silly site.  I wrote about that.  It's kind of funny.  It's a funny site.  But I mean, they make a point, but they make it in a, you know, kind of a roundabout way.  We interviewed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I mean, it's just it's a jokey thing.  I mean, look, nobody's going to rob my house because I say that I'm here at work because that doesn't mean my house is empty.  At some point is going to start happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Things are going to happen to people.  He's right.  Girl, the super hot that does a semi-popular podcast.  There's going to be some nerd that knows that she goes to Starbucks on Mondays, the gym on Tuesday, and he's going to be like, I really love you.  Don't respond to my emails.  Tackle on an alleyway and then it's going to be on TechCrunch.  Everybody's like, oh, my God, four square date rape drug or some crazy stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, look what happened already with the already happy with Craigslist.  Remember the Craigslist killer.  Exactly.  Poor Craigslist.  You know, I didn't have anything to do with it, but the guy was meeting people on Craigslist and killing them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As soon as it happens, the party's over and enough people's houses get robbed.  And, you know, I think I think your stalker thing is probably more accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, because there are a bunch of these.  Well, Kelly, you're you don't do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You mustn't post where you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Everything.  I actually I'm very careful about where I post.  I didn't get on four square or Gawalla for about a year because I didn't want to create a circle around where I live.  Right.  Oh, very smart.  And I actually did get on because it's a perfect way to do meetups.  If I am at a location where I want everybody to join me, I can do that and everybody can join.  Right.  But it's it is it has been a concern of mine, obviously.  But yeah, I don't I don't I don't just post everywhere I'm going to Starbucks to the bookstore or to wherever I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People do some people do.  They can try. I don't play in my state.  They do. Right.  At all. I only use it when I go out of the state.  What state do you live in?  New Jersey. Pretty big place.  Highly densely populated.  Come find me.  Are you in the top?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I check in everywhere I go.  Everybody knows exactly where I am at all times and still know you're here all day.  Nobody will stalk me.  I keep trying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You're not that everybody knows where to find you.  Yeah, it's easy to days are over.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And just just wait for the popularity of the the latitude based ones, you know, where you're not checking in necessarily.  They know where you are at all times.  I mean, that's a few years away from probably being, you know, as popular right now as the check in thing is.  But that's coming.  I mean, especially now with the new iPhone coming out and you'll be able to run applications in the background.  So some of these locations will be continuously updating latitude has three million users and I which is more than four square and go all come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And I kind of wonder how many of those three million people know that your phone is constantly updating at latitude and saying where you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you sign in via the maps application on your Android phone?  I think they said that over 10 percent of all Android users have latitude turned on.  And I think you're right.  I think I have no idea that it's like constantly updating their background in the background.  I mean, they do send out emails and stuff.  And this is what Google will tell you.  You know, they'll tell you, oh, well, you know, your latitude has been on for the past 30 days.  If you like, you change your settings, please.  But like, yeah, I think people don't know because it's the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It's really tying it back to the Facebook thing.  People are told as we tell them this Facebook, the Facebook executive said it's the media that's worried about that.  It is pundits.  People love the new Facebook changes and maybe they don't love it.  But I think it is true.  They don't have no clue what's going on.  Yeah, that's it.  If we don't say anything about it, they'd never know.  That's right.  And we don't say enough about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's why your job is so important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  But do we.  But you do the same thing, Kelly.  But do are people getting it or are they just going?  So, yeah, I don't think they understand the implications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry, Kelly.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Fine.  You always talk over me.  That's OK.  That's I go on, you know, local Fox stations and I did a Facebook segment about privacy.  But even still, you know, they're a little bit interested in that.  But I don't think they're they're all into it.  Obviously, they're not all into it like we are.  Otherwise, they would they would be throwing up a fit towards Facebook.  But that's not happening.  And they are continuing to use it.  They're continuing to sign up.  And it's just not that they don't see why it's an issue because they're only doing things  in small groups, so to speak.  Do you know what I mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah, they think that the only my friends are seeing it.  They think they and then that's the problem.  Al Franken, senator from Minnesota, on his senator page at Senate dot gov.  Facebook privacy instructions.  Al is not the only senators upset about this.  Chuck Schumer is also upset and is urging an investigation.  He says, Al Franken says, basically, Facebook now shares your personal information with third parties.  He's talking about the Yelp, Pandora, Microsoft, Docs dot com thing.  He says, if you don't want Facebook to share your information, you need to opt out of the instant personalization program.  And he gives you the steps, which, by the way, are his his steps are correct.  Facebook's misleading because if you go to Yelp dot com and you're logged in, I'll do it right now.  You go to Yelp dot com and you're logged in on Facebook.  It will give you a blue bar at the top of the screen.  Let's see. Yep.  Says, hi, Leo.  What?  Yelp is using Facebook to personalize your experience.  Learn more. No, thanks.  And if you if you click no, thanks.  Which I just did still up there, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and yeah, and and but they're watching your every move on Yelp.  Is that what you're telling me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, just to start in Pandora.  But look, here's the deal.  That wasn't enough.  You have to also now go to Facebook.  You can't just you have to block the application.  Otherwise, your friends who have not opted out will be sharing your information with Yelp, Pandora and Microsoft.  Microsoft? Yeah.  Docs dot com. Huh.  So this is I think intentionally misleading.  I think Facebook really obfuscates what's going on.  Their settings are not clear.  You saw I opted out and yet it didn't really opt.  No, your your picture was still there.  Well, that's because I must have been logged in.  Actually, maybe not.  I don't think I've ever.  Anyway, I don't just bugs me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gee, I can't imagine why.  Bugs me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Even though I live in public.  Hey, I want to talk a little bit about Carbonite Pro.  And then we're going to come back and we're going to talk a little more about Facebook and an eighty eight and a half year old woman who was forced recently forced to do something by Facebook compelled her to do something.  And I'll talk about teasers now.  That's a good one, too.  I'm going to tell you.  It's not what you think it is.  But first I have to tell you about Carbonite Pro.  Do you mind?  I love as you know, and you've heard me talk about carbonite, the backup solution.  It's automatic in the background, gets the job done while you're online.  It just automatically keeps you up to date.  And a number of people carbonite found this out.  A number of people have started to use the commercial consumer version of carbonite in their businesses because businesses have the same issues.  If if their Internet or other their hard drive goes down or there's a fire or flood, that's worse for a business.  You're out of business.  And I know a lot of businesses do what we do here.  They have a network attached storage or a big drive and they back up to that.  But what if what if there's a fire and the whole thing's gone?  You're out of business.  You've got to have offsite backup.  It has to be automatic.  It has to be able.  You can be administered from a centralized position from a dashboard with your IT department or maybe if you're a sole proprietor where you can do it.  And that's where Carbonite Pro is so great.  If you've been using the consumer version of carbonite in your small business, you'll save money with this.  It's more effective.  Your employees can access their own backup file so they don't have to come beg you to restore the hard drive and prices for business as low as $10 a month.  I'll give you some examples.  If you have eight computers, five gigs of backup, 25 bucks a month.  If you have 18 computers, five gigs of backup, $50 a month.  Talk about peace of mind for you and your employees and talk about keeping yourself online.  You could try it free for 30 days right now.  This is a brand new form of carbonite.  So they want to encourage as many people as possible to try it out.  It is just fancy.  We've been using it for a while.  I just love it.  CarbonitePro.com.  Give it a try.  I think you'll be very, very happy.  Now, let me pull up the computer here and show you a little video that happened last night.  There was a campaign on Facebook to get Betty White to host Saturday Night Live over a million people on that Facebook page.  And last night, Betty White hosts Saturday Night Live.  Listen to what she said.  The power of the people.  Facebook made her do it.  She looks pretty good for 88.5.  That ain't makeup, baby.  That's face work.  That's surgery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everyone has worked on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just can't believe I am hosting Saturday Night Live.  I'm not sure.  Many of you know that I'm 88.5 years old.  So it's great to be here for a number of reasons.  You know, I'm not new to live TV.  In 1952, I started a...  Somebody laughed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You hear somebody in the background going, ah!

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  ...the sitcom, which is Life of Elizabeth.  And of course, back then, we didn't want to do it live.  We just didn't know how to tape things.  So I don't know what this show's excuse is.  You know, I have so many people to thank for being here, but I really have to thank Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I think that's the first time Facebook got a round of applause.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ever.  When I first heard about the campaign to get me to host Saturday Night Live, I didn't know what Facebook was.  And now that I do know what it is, I have to say, it sounds like a huge waste of time.  I would never say that people on it are losers, but that's only because I'm polite.  People say, but Betty, Facebook is a great way to connect with old friends.  Well, at my age, if I want to connect with old friends, I need a Ouija board.  Needless to say, we didn't have Facebook when I was growing up.  I had phone book, but you wouldn't waste an afternoon on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Eighty eight and a half years old.  And actually, she got some good zingers in there.  I have to say.  I love Betty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Isn't she great?  Yeah.  She thinks we all are losers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Losers.  I don't use Facebook.  She wasn't counting on me.  You're not in Facebook.  Come on.  You know, the only Facebook page I have is not my page.  Somebody put it up.  I do not use Facebook.  Really?  Yeah.  One of the reasons I went back to Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just think I don't have there's not enough time in the day to keep you had to be part  of all these things.  John C. Dvorak, eighty eight and a half years old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  You losers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You losers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  One of the reasons I use Facebook is and I'm sure Kelly, it's true for you too, is that  this is where the fan pages are.  And I tried to delete my Facebook account, but then I realized I would no longer have  access to any of the fan pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.  They're important for people like us in a different way than and I don't mean that like  it sounded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  But that's a publicity vehicle, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It is a publicity vehicle and it's important to be out there.  John, you need to listen to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I use Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But you know what?  It's amazing.  I have always focused really hard on Twitter, but the amount of traffic that actually comes  through Facebook is pretty incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So you know, you can tell that you're getting viewers through Facebook and you probably  post as I do, you know, videos up there, links to shows when I, you know, something interesting  and you see people know that the show is on.  I mean, this is a very useful tool.  They got us over a barrel.  You.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've knuckled under.  Both of you.  You should be ashamed of yourselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, so ashamed.  I want to go eat some ice cream now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  But you wouldn't delete your Facebook account, Kelly.  No, I wouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Nope.  MG, have you thought about deactivating?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.  I mean, it's funny.  I actually think, you know, Kelly was talking about it a little bit.  They have these blowups all the time.  You know, this is a particularly bad one, a little bit more sensitive than the other  ones have been.  But like when they launched their newsfeed, for example, however many years ago, that  was three or four years ago, everyone was up in arms.  You know, like people can see more data now, blah, blah, blah, even though it was the same  amount of data you could always see, it was just in a in a new, easy to read format.  But it's like these things just seem to come around.  They have this explosion with, you know, several like a lot of people, sometimes, you know,  as many as a few million.  But then they seem to blow over right away.  You know, the key thing is that when you've got a network with 500 million people, you  know, people have reasons to stick around either their social graph or like you guys  are using it for publicity.  I mean, they have you locked in there and they're not going to let go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I think the key and this is what I'm starting to tell people, including very importantly,  my kids, we use Twitter.  We know what we put on Twitter is public.  That's kind of the point.  The only reason this is an issue is because Facebook, we had the opposite promise.  Initially was that what we put on here will be private and we will control it.  If people assume that everything they post on Facebook is now public, everything, they  can't go far wrong.  Right.  Now, it's just public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think Facebook really needs to reconsider what they've been doing with their just settings  in terms of the privacy.  I mean, if you look at that page, it's a complete nightmare.  I'm a pretty savvy guy, I think, and I have no idea what some of those settings do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Oh, it's crazy.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So why don't they just have a thing where it's like, it's kind of like more of the  Twitter model.  I mean, I know they've been copying Twitter in other ways.  Why not just go the whole extent of it and kind of make your public page, which everything  is kind of out there in the public by default, and then you've got your private just friend  network.  So you make it so that people can follow you, but you don't necessarily have to follow  them back and they could only see the information that you choose to let them see.  Right.  But it just be like a two-tier system rather than these little minutiae details about what  you can share and whatnot with all these different groups of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Matt Cutts of Google has quit, according to Bloomberg Businessweek reporter Doug McMillan.  Peter Rojas, founder of Engadget, co-founder of Gadget, deactivated his account.  Paul Kudrowski, who's a finance guy, deactivated his account.  Is it a trend?  It sounds like, yeah, well, it's those guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are people that have information to protect?  Big names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I deactivated it, and then I realized I had killed my fan pages, so I reactivated it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Has it made a difference to your numbers?  I don't think so.  Deactivating or reactivating?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  How long was it deactivated?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Like 12 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why don't you study it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why don't you deactivate it?  Should I and see what happens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I think that's a risky thing.  You know what?  Leave it open.  You've been suckered into believing that.  No, I'm going to leave it.  I'm going to do what you say.  I'm going to leave it open, but I'm going to not use it in a private way.  I'm going to use it like I use Twitter.  It is now a public forum, and then I'm fine with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're using it as promotion.  Anything I put there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're using it for dirty chatting now?  Well, not anymore.  I had to stop.  Callie, are you using it for dirty chatting?  Stop it.  I'm just asking.  You can ask me that question.  It's a simple question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I just wanted to know.  I turn the chat off on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I do too because I get bugged.  Just like you probably.  Yeah.  I'm sure she gets bugged a little more than you do.  When you have, as I'm sure Callie does, 5,000 followers, anytime you show up on Facebook,  30 windows pop up and say, hey, how are you doing?  What are you doing?  Are you up there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Are you visiting?  Wait, you want to play Farmville?  I love that interaction.  I absolutely adore it.  But I kind of need it to be a little bit more controlled so I can get the things done that  need to be done, like write a show.  You know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Do you play Farmville?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, not Farmville.  I'm just saying the interaction, the conversation.  Just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Moffey Awards, Yo-Ville.  What do you play?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you play any of the games there?  Any of those games?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  They're important.  Did you see the Zynga?  Maybe this was from TechCrunch.  Zynga is talking about leaving Facebook.  This was a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're not going to leave Facebook entirely.  They're just going to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, Mark Pinkus, the CEO of Zynga, the company that does Farmville and Moffey Awards and all  these...  The most popular games on Facebook says we're going to start making hundreds of millions.  Maybe close to a billion.  They've valued it.  What was it, MG?  So it's like four billion?  We should be so lucky.  Four billion, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're doing okay.  Moffey has made their money back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So at an all-hands meeting this week, Mark says we're going to do our own...  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Network.  Zynga Live, supposedly.  So obviously right now...  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  MG, can you unplug and replug your USB thing after an hour?  So I know the show has now been on for exactly one hour.  The chipset in that headset does that.  Isn't that weird?  Is it better now?  Yeah.  Which heads?  What is the chipset?  It's the C-Media chipset that was in the Plantronics and then there...  It's Plantronics.  Yeah.  It's so weird.  And we figured it out finally that it's exactly one hour.  It's got some sort of weird memory leak in it.  Anyway, go ahead.  You were saying...  What are they going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Zynga Live.  So obviously Zynga has been...  They're on the other social networks, but their main thing has been Facebook.  Obviously they built up that huge following.  Farmville is the biggest social game that there is out there.  And they've been talking supposedly because Facebook has been kind of clamping down on  what they can do.  And the key thing is that Facebook wants them to use their own credit system now, which  Facebook would keep 30% of.  So that would cut a substantial amount of revenue potentially out of Zynga's hands,  where if they did the whole thing themselves, they'd obviously keep 100% of it.  So there's talk that they might try and launch their own social network just for their games  called Zynga Live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  See, I play Wii Rule on the iPad.  I don't play Farmville.  I enjoy keeping my people happy by building little houses for them and growing cauliflower.  It's like the guy who does those oil paintings on KQED.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at the fluffy little clouds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Focus, Leo.  Focus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Focus.  Come back to us, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I had to give up face-ville, so instead I play Wii Rule on the iPad.  Come back to us, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  This is a big bucks business.  Why?  Because these games are free.  Farmville is free.  Wii Rule is free.  But if you want things to happen faster and better, if you're impatient, you go buy with  actual money, you go buy some things.  This is in this case, in Wii Rule, it's Mojo.  A case of 300 Mojos, $30.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  It's the second life model.  I mean, it's a system that's been going on with games for a really long time.  It's going to make money.  It makes sense for them to go off to their own site and do it and keep all their money.  And it's going to work because they've got people addicted to it.  I mean, it's not anything huge besides the fact that they're slapping Facebook in the  face, which is nice, that somebody can do it and somebody has a little bit of clout  to sting their pocket for something.  Yeah.  Did you say face-ville?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Farmville.  No, somebody out there in the chat room says you said face-ville.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I said face-ville?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Whatever.  Drunk off the Kool-Aid on the Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It's not the Kool-Aid, it's the cookies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Face-ville, I have to play.  I love Face-ville.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  All right, well, see, President Obama's got it right.  Are you ready?  This was a speech.  The President of the United States, my friends, gave a speech today at Hampton University  of Virginia, it was a commencement speech.  I tried to find the audio, I couldn't find it, so I'll just have to do it.  You're coming of age in a 24-7 media environment.  No.  No, I can't do him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a cadence thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I know, it's something he does, I just love it, but I can't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He's just so good at impressions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  What's going on?  I'm working on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you should be able to get it within the next two years.  That's all I got, huh?  No, he's going to get reelected.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're coming of age in a 24-  No, you sound like Harry Truman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I'm just going to read it in my own voice.  You're coming of age in a 24-  Do it in a German voice.  You're coming of age in a 24-7 media environment that bombards us with all kinds of content.  This is actually interesting.  I'm not sure I disagree with him.  Listen, he's talking to the kids that are graduating from college.  It exposes us to all kinds of arguments, some of which don't always rank all that high on  the truth meter, with iPods and iPads-  He's plugging products.  Boxes and PlayStations, get this, none of which I know how to work.  Oh, yeah, right.  Oh, crap.  And he didn't inhale either.  Information becomes- That's the new I didn't inhale.  Oh, I don't play Farmville.  Well, I played it, but I didn't buy any mojo.  Information becomes- I think this is astute- becomes a distraction, a diversion, a form  of entertainment rather than a tool of empowerment.  Infotainment.  Yeah.  He's talking about means of emancipation.  He bemoaned the fact that some of the craziest claims can quickly gain traction and the clamor  of blogs and talk radio outlets.  All of this is not only putting new pressures on you, it's putting new pressures on our  country and our democracy.  Are Xboxes bad for democracy?  John C. Dvorak.  Yeah.  Owen Stone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's bad for democracy is the lack of education that we provide our children in this country.  Yeah, you're talking.  I think you're right.  I think the United States wants to get up and talk about video games and pleasure, something  that takes kids off the mind of things, but most people don't even have things right now.  Why don't you talk about education?  Talk about how you're going to fund schools and support teachers and get a better education  in our country.  Don't rag on Xboxes.  When you've got a Black Baron, you're the coolest black president in America with your  $200 Oakleys on, I mean, shut up and fix our country.  Give me stupid speeches about stuff that we already know.  Right on, Owen.  You need a jingle for this.  Right on, Owen.  I'm just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You agree, MG?  Is he scapegoating electronics?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, we're in information overload, but it's both good and bad information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's hard to say it's all bad.  Right.  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've got my Senator's app on my iPad where I can pull up all the records and things that  they voted on.  Yeah, what about open government?  Sure.  I mean, so it depends on what you choose to do, what people choose to do with their children.  Better education.  Why doesn't he say, hey, these are some great educational apps for people that want to know  about our government and our voting system.  Use that on your iPad instead of just playing plans for zombies.  But he doesn't do that.  He's just saying it's a blanket statement because people will watch it and say, ah,  ha, ha, and nobody really gives a crap because they're going to go out and buy Xbox more  anyway.  So fix our country.  That's your job.  You agree, Callie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I agree that, you know, he shouldn't be pinpointing Xbox.  This is the reason for things going wrong.  You know, I mean, in education, I think you have a very good point.  But also, I would say that our parents should be teaching us more or enforcing rules.  You know, our parents have a duty to sit there and say, OK, you can play Xbox, but first  year education or something to that effect.  I'm not a parent.  I can't speak to that.  But, you know, I mean, it's I don't think that entertainment and games and Xboxes have  anything to do with the degradation of the.  But I'm going to play devil's advocate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I'm going to play Callie now.  You're smart.  I'm going to play devil's advocate.  Are you ready for this?  I think there's a lot to be said for the fact that we are.  Perhaps hypnotized by the shiny object, by the focused on consumerism, on getting the  latest, greatest new thing.  Yeah, there's some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Who is talking?  I bought 32 iPads.  They cut me off because I'm addicted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I'm culpable.  I'm not saying I'm not at fault at this.  Shouldn't.  I mean, I agree we could focus on the benefits and the values of this.  But is that what we focus on in this country or do we focus on what's the new iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is America.  We focus on what we want to.  That's our right.  That's what freedom is.  Some people are all about education.  Some people can give a crap.  Some people care about disease and malaria.  Some people want to put socks on troops.  Some people want to eat donuts.  Some people want to eat cookies.  It's a choice.  It's a freedom.  It's America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  God bless America.  But I think I do worry a little bit that we and I think it's going to make us soft and  make us soft.  But we are soft.  Are we soft?  We've been soft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK.  China does everything for us.  Everything in this room is made in China.  They make our socks and shoes.  And we even borrowed the money to buy it.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  The gummy bears made the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  100% USA made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go.  None of these are Chinese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Give me some of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Those are made in America, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Eat that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  By the Albanese confectionary group?  Aren't they from Albania?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Huh?  Albania.  That's false advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You know, the other thing I got to say is it's in Ziploc bag.  It's kind of, compare this to the Chinese packaging.  This is kind of, this is not, this is, this is what we've come to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, we have deteriorated.  We've deteriorated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  What is it we make in America?  Is it great automobiles?  Is it airplanes?  Is it computer technology?  No, it's chocolate covered gummy bears.  100% US made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I bet you that it's not very tasty.  I don't like the idea of a gummy bear with chocolate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, this is what's wrong with America.  We get down on America.  We should just support those guys because some of those actually made in America.  I'm sure those gummy bears taste delightful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Here, you can have them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We want to see you eat one.  Thanks, Leo.  They're disgusting.  I don't want to eat them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're absolutely loathing.  You have to.  Now you've got to support them.  We just heard the lecture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I'm just supporting America.  God bless American gummy bears.  These better be made in America.  But Callie, come on.  I'm going to let these drunks go on off of there.  Drunk on power.  Drunk on power.  But don't you think, I mean, isn't there something to be said for that, that we are  perhaps a little materialistic, focused on the wrong thing here?  Well, of course.  Come on, take the whole, come on, put it in your mouth and eat it.  Just ignore them, Callie.  I'm going to turn their mics off.  Right, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But of course we're focused on the shiny stuff.  We wouldn't have a billion podcasts exaggerating.  About shiny stuff.  You know, geeking it or, you know, you know, it's all about, it's all about the shiny stuff.  But that's what we get our entertainment from.  I don't know about you, but that's my entertainment.  I love that stuff.  I'm passionate about it, but that doesn't sway me from, you know, going out and learning  about a particular topic or focusing on family or focusing on the things that are important.  There's always balance and it always has to be balanced in order for somebody to, I think,  say that they have had a successful life or that they are focusing on the right things,  you know?  But you can't just say, oh, well, the shiny stuff is bad because it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we are amused to death in the words of Roger Waters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So according to Chitika, which is a fully informal number, not approved by Apple, but  remember John C. Dvorak, you and I have a bottle of Bordeaux, of L'Eauville Bordeaux  on the line over the number of iPads sold.  I said that by the end of the first year there would be more than five million sold.  Am I right, John C. Dvorak?  I'm sorry, I can't hear you.  You said there would not be.  According to Chitika, we are now at 1.9 million and they've stopped counting.  We're just going to die in a minute.  They are back ordered so far now on the 3G's.  You can't get them anywhere.  It's amazing.  The iPad is a huge success.  So when do I get my bottle of wine?  You?  No, I said there'd be five million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, it was the other way around as I recall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh no, oh shoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John, he should be disqualified for buying 32 million.  Yeah, right.  He bought at least a high $5,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  No, he should have made that one of the ground rules.  And Leo, you can't buy half of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He boosted numbers, John.  He's playing games with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14

Transcript:  I'm going to talk about Audible, audible.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Audible is the great bookstore of the air.  It's amazing on the internet.  75 million books and counting.  You can play them on 500 different devices, including of course the iPod, the iPhone,  the iPad, the Zune, the Kindle.  Audible, you got to check it out.  Fantastic place.  Most of us, you know, we're busy and this is to me, this is the antidote to this shiny  thing.  It's something that that's got some meat, some fiber, some real information and that's  where Audible can really help.  Of course, there's lots of fun stuff.  There's lots of light stuff, great science fiction.  There's mysteries, there's thrillers, but there's also nonfiction, history, biography.  I try to alternate.  So I'll listen for instance to the new Sookie Stackhouse vampire novel, Dead in the Family,  and then I'll mix that in with Parisians and Adventure History of Paris.  This is the beauty of Audible.  I am always listening and always learning whether I'm at the gym in the car, drunk  under the bed.  I don't have to be able to hold a book up to be able to learn.  This would be going for John.  I'll make John listen to this one.  The last thousand days of the British Empire, a sweeping vivid history of the British Empire  in its last three years.  Audible.com, here's the deal.  I'm going to get you two books, free.  If you go to audible.com slash twit2, you sign up for that platinum account.  That means two books every month.  The first two are free.  You can cancel it anytime and those books are yours to keep forever.  Choose from New York Times bestsellers, award winners, new releases, education, business,  classics, fiction, and more.  I just got the help.  I hear this is really, really good.  Everybody's raving over this.  In fact, I think for most of 2010, this has been the most downloaded book.  I'll play it a little bit, just so you get an idea of what an audible book sounds like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm being a colored man living and working in Mississippi.  Lord, that made me proud.  But one night he working late at the Scanlon Taylor mill.

Transcript:  What is great about audible?  These are performances and they've got five great actresses doing this book and bringing  it to life.  It's one of the reasons this has been one of the bestselling audible books for the last  six months.  So I'm listening to that.  And then I'm also, I'm really excited.  Somebody told me that the, was it the girl with the dragon tattoo?  Have any of you read that?  It's supposed to be a really good book and there is a very good audible performance on  here.  These are my two new books for this month.  I just downloaded.  I get two books a month.  It's by Stieg Larsson and supposedly an incredible kind of mystery family saga, love story, even  financial intrigue.  I'll play a little bit of this.  This is Simon Vance who I love his voice, very British.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And those could have changed hands between friends or being bought by mail order from

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  anywhere in Europe, anywhere in the antipodes.  If you are, if you see me driving by in the Mustang and you listen carefully, you'll hear  a voice coming out of my car and that's those voices of audible.com.  I love them.  I think you're going to love them too.  Why don't you give it a try?  audible.com slash twit two, two free books, yours to keep.  You can cancel it anytime.  audible.com slash twit two.  What you got there, John C. Dvorak?  Oh, you got some grillers rub.  You're big into the rub, aren't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, you have to be at my age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  This is for me.  This is for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  This is a grillers rub.  You do rubs?  Oh yeah, absolutely.  It's a spice rub.  Yeah, that's just a, you put it, you use it.  You see a dry rub, you put it on ribs.  It's a dry rub.  And, and also a pork shoulder.  You might know about this, Kelly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  This is from Laredo, the Rubio Spice Company.  I haven't actually.  They sent this up to me after I was in Austin because I was, I was waxing poetic about the,  about the great dry rub barbecue in Austin.  And somebody sent this up to me.  So go ahead, take it, take a jar, John.  It's all yours.  I will.  Rub your meat with it and tell us how it tastes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had, if only that was possible.  So, one of the things, I've gone through the, for people out there that do a lot of barbecuing,  of course you need to check out these various proprietary rubs.  But the, there's one that, that, that Paprika Company makes and I've only been able to find  it in the Chicago area.  They make a really good pork rub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's Paprika.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Paprika's good.  Well, all these rubs have a lot of Paprika in them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Really?  It's a Hungarian thing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So, it's called Cupid de Tino.  Mike Arrington wrote about this on TechCrunch.  A dating site for Apple fans.  Cupid de Tino, named of course after Cupertino.  Apparently, MG, he says, Mike says, you'd be perfect for this.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah.  Me and Mike get into it a lot about Apple versus Google in particular.  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah.  And you're defending Apple and he's defending Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, mostly as related to the iPhone versus Android.  You know, he quit using the iPhone and loves his Android and I'm not too keen on the Android  phones myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I use the Nexus One.  I'm very happy with it right now, but I am, I have to admit, I'm looking forward to the  next iPhone.  I'm going to take a look at it.  What do you use, Callie?  What are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm on the iPhone, but I love Android and I actually would break, I'm thinking about  breaking my contract with AT&T to go over to either the Incredible or the Droid and  I can't figure out which one.  Incredible.  Not even close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  That's much better.  Not even close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, I've had both and I love both.  I fell in love with the Droid first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Oh, you want a keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, not necessarily.  I don't really particularly care for the keyboard.  So I think Incredible is really the one for me, but since it's my kind of first love,  so to speak, you know, it's still in my heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you know, I think I'm going to switch phones too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You're still using the E71.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I use the E71, but then I also have a Nexus, which I like a lot.  I kind of agree with you on that.  It's pretty impressive.  Well, it's got a beautiful screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You know what I like?  The OLED screen.  And I think we're agreed that, is it right, MG, that the iPhone is not going to have an  OLED screen.  It's going to have an LCD screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm pretty sure not.  It's going to have double the resolution what it has now, but it's going to be.  That'll be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think I'm going to go with the Palm Pre.  I know it's counterintuitive.  That's where I'm going.  No, I'm not.  I'm going to move to the Palm Pre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Now that HP owns it, it's definitely going to be a better product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can get some good deals on those.  That's what I'm thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Twenty nine dollars.  You could use them as a burner phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.  Put a little card in there.  Boom, you're on your way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are you saying, oh, doctor, what do you use?  My iPhone days are over.  I'm currently not in a contract and my iPad has made my iPhone useless.  I'm going to get the HTC Evo when it comes out.  The Evo looks slick.  Then I can use my iPad, which is a big iPhone and not have to pay $130 a month to AT&T or  Apple or Crappy Service.  Still get the full features of an iPhone, but much bigger.  Everybody knows bigger is better.  That's why we love Texas.  So I can cut my phone bill down to like what, 70 bucks a month and get under the, out of  the clutches of Apple and HTC.  I still have my Apple lifestyle, but I won't have to pay $130 a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You should be on Cupidatino.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should be, but I want to date actual women.  I'm sorry.  That's like the biggest fail in America.  There's going to be three women being fought over by 4,000 men with laptops.  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  In fact, didn't we just see a story last week that said women are more likely to date guys  with iPhones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, they can date them.  They don't go on that site to do it though.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's a lot of women using iPhones.  Wait, wait, wait.  Was that a story a couple of weeks ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  There was a story a couple of weeks ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That women are more likely to date people with iPhones?  Men I think mostly, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why?  Because they got money.  If you got an iPhone, I know you got a job because otherwise you ain't got an iPhone.  You ain't got $130 to throw away, $400 for a new phone to come out every year.  If you got an iPhone, you got money.  And women know a man with a money and iPhone is a good man to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you channeling Oprah or something?  What the hell happened there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know ladies.  I know the ladies.  I know the ladies.  I'm a doctor.  He's a doctor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Is that the line you use?  I'm a doctor.  A-H.  Of love.  Owen Stone, the doctor of love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He does have a very, very good point about the whole iPad experience and just getting  rid of AT&T and going with Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You like the iPad, Kelly?  Are you an iPad fan?  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I really do.  Like he was saying, this has been my thought process as well, is that it does give you  a great experience bigger and you don't have to deal with dropped calls.  I've been hounding on AT&T for a while just because my experience is getting worse and  worse and worse.  So what's the best phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You think it's the incredible?  I think the Evo is a good, now it's going to be on Sprint 4G, but what a screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, the Evo looks really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Have you played with the Evo yet, Kelly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Not yet.  I'm supposed to get into my hands though, so hopefully soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  MG Siegler, what's your bet?  What do you think the best phone is right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I'd still go with the iPhone.  I have a Nexus One, I like it.  I've used the incredible quite a bit.  I like that a lot.  I like that more than Nexus One.  The problem with these Android phones is a new better one comes out every two months.  So you buy one, then you've got buyer's remorse two months later.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  All right.  Well, we're going to wait and see.  The Evo will be out sometime soon.  And the incredible, I think right now is the phone to beat.  I love these OLED screens.  I just think that that's what totally sends me on the Nexus One is the screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do you think about using them when it's daylight out?  Can you see it okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  No, no, I can't.  But I'm a vampire.  I don't have that much trouble seeing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He's in the studio all day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  If you use the ambient light sensor on the phone, it cannot be seen in daylight.  But if you turn the brightness up, you can see it just fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what else?  There's this thing called your other hand.  You just cover it, and then you can see everything fine for a second.  That's high tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  There's a thing called it.  You can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you've got two, you're good to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  But you do have to agree that the worst experience ever is trying to take a picture in daylight  with any one of these phones.  You just can't see a bloody thing.  That's bad.  I mean, it's no good.  You just hope and pray.  Yeah, hope and pray.  There you go.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Any other big stories, or should we wrap this puppy up and put it to bed?  Put a dig layoff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She didn't talk about that.  Ten percent.  Come on.  You didn't talk about Y Max versus LTE.  You didn't talk about the real time web.  You haven't talked about any of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Okay.  Darth Vader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  What about Darth Vader?  He's back.  I thought we vanquished him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He's going to be a voice.  Oh, Tom Tom voice.  Yeah, on Tom Tom.  And he did this whole video.  It was really cute.  And where Darth is trying to do these directions.  He's like, go down the roundabout.  I can't do that.  I'm not good at impressions, but it's a really cute video.  And of course I want Darth on my Tom Tom if I have a Tom Tom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought for a long time that it would be cool to have replaceable voices on all these systems,  but I would like to have the old Jewish woman that was carving out your costume.  Tom Tom does any voice you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Now, turn around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where are you going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're going too fast.  Is there anything I can get you before we start?  Glass of water?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You may dispense with the pleasantries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, great.  Tom Tom.  Darth Vader.  Take one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  At the end of the road, turn round.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, I'm going to stop you.  The line is at the end of the road, turn right.  That is what I said.  Terrific.  So let's just try it again.  Tom Tom voice.  Darth Vader.  Take two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  At the end of the road, turn round.  At the end of the road, turn round.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's just go forward.  Okay, we're at page five.  Page five.  I'm sorry, page seven.  We're at page seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I don't have a page seven.  You have reached your destination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is there any way you could breathe a little quieter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  What do you mean quieter?  This is how I breathe.  He's adjusting the mic.  Please take the third exit on the roundabout.  It's roundabout.  Correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Roundabout.  You're saying roundabout.  It's roundabout.  Is there any way you can make it sound a little less depressing?  Exit right ahead.  Don't force it.  Sound natural.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You should have seen his face when I told him I was his father.  I told my son who did not know that I was his father that I was his father.  Yeah, and he has a twin sister involved.  Here it is.  Uh-oh.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Roundabout.  Roundabout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what?  Let's move forward.  That's fine.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Silence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Roundabout.  It's about being around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Don't underestimate the power of the dark side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh, I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  That's actually an ad for something that they are doing, and the voices are really kind of good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That just took over Mr. T as my TomTom voice of choice.  Mr. T is like, turn right fool.  Fool.  Roundabout.  You turn ahead, sucka.  But that is going to be classic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah, there's also Yoda TomTom voice.  There's quite a few of these.  And there's a, one of my favorites, although you wouldn't want to use it for very long, because fans can do voices on TomTom too.  One of my favorites is from the game Portal.  They have a Glad-Oz voice, but she lies.  So she, you know, she tells you, you should turn left when you should turn right, things like that.  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that would be good.  We compile the code.  It's a little confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  That's one of the, I think one of the things TomTom does well.  I had somewhere, let me see if I can find them, the actual Tom, Darth Vader voices on TomTom.  Let me see if I can find these.  Yeah, dude, somebody should do, yeah, Stewie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Brian Stewie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Can you do them?  They've got Homer Simpson.  Have you heard these?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  These are, this is, you have reached your destination and you can hold your head up high because you are a genius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You know, you know, the problem is you announce the ability to do your own voice as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, Avi can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  The Nokia one, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He kind of confusing to be talking.  It's a little narcissistic actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It is, but I think that the brilliance is in getting a friend to do it or something like that.  Callie, you should do some voices.  I want Callie's voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And people would want Callie to be telling them where to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Can I have Callie's voice on my TomTom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't know that anybody wants to listen to me that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, don't sell yourself short there.  She's saying that to get a compliment.  Don't sell yourself short.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  We want to hear Callie say, what would you say if I were at the destination and you have to say something like funny, like Dennis Hopper says,  You're here, dude.  Why would anyone want to go here?  That kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe she have you do to the German guy.  What would you do, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You will turn right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I said, no, you are not following my instructions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My friend has a great voice.  It's I can't do it without sounding bad.  So I won't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, we should get somebody should get Lisa Bettany when she does that sexy voice she likes to do.  Hi.  Yes, she does the sexy voice.  Leo, you're scaring me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I could do it.  You could scare me.  Yes, you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you're such a beautiful man.  I'd really like you to turn left right now.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Protect me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll just push him out of the way when he heads for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you.  Owen, you're here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I'm waiting for you.  You sounded like Peter Laurie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like you're Peter Laurie sexy voice.  Come on, Owen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  Let me play.  This is the Darth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  These are the actual Tom Tom Darth Vader voices.  Here you go.  Depart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Your destiny lies with me.  Obi Wan knew this to be true.  That's when you leave.  Turn around when possible.  I find your lack of faith disturbing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Take the third left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Sense your way.  Oh, I like that.  Left turn ahead.  Then go around the roundabout.  The circle is now complete.  Sith exit.  Sith exit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  What were the other stories that you had in front of you?  There's a bunch of stuff.  You had a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I'm looking at the rundown.  I don't want to give you short shrift.  Skype's going to be doing...  This will be fun.  Skype's going to do a five-way...  No more hacking Skype for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No more Skype-asaurus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's going to be...  It's not going to work.  It's not going to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They fit right in with their integration into TVs and all of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  That's right.  Five-way video calling.  Dig late off 10, although I think it was a completely reasonable thing.  In fact, I thought it was handled fairly well.  Kevin Rose writes on his blog, we're laying off 10% of our staff, which I can't remember  how many, the seven or eight people, but we are still hiring engineers because that's  where we're putting our focus.  This is what happens.  This is what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the story that gets me.  ClearWire may dump Wimax.  It's a Wimax company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, this is the...  No, but Wimax is like 802.11.  It's an open standard.  But they're saying that maybe they don't...  Yeah, 16.  They don't want to use Wimax anymore for the future of 4G networking.  You know, it's not been very successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People in Portland love it.  Well, they are idiots there.  No, they're not.  In fact, Portland's the hot spot.  But by the way, thank you for losing your Portland audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I should have been there by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  No, I love Portland.  I have many friends in Portland.  I've used Wimax.  I've used 4G.  In fact, in Vegas we used it.  Did you try it when you were in Vegas, anybody?  It's not much faster.  In fact, our experience was because we went down to Vegas for CES with every card available,  including a Sprint ClearWire 4G card, and we were never able to get better than 3G performance on it.  It did not knock me out.  In fact, we had to choose whichever is the best technology to stream.  We very rarely ended up using 4G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're telling me this is a fail for Intel because they're really the driving force.  That was who was pushing it, wasn't it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And I think Wimax makes sense for, for instance, getting internet access to rural areas where you don't want to pull wire.  That makes sense.  I think it's not a good 4G technology.  I think this LTE that Verizon is going to use is going to be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's going to cost a fortune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Why is it going to cost so much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because there's a phone company involved.  Oh, that.  Well, same with ClearWire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It's a phone company involved.  You don't have ClearWire in Dallas, do you, Callie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We do, but I haven't had much luck with it, just like you're saying.  The tests that I've run haven't been very successful.  But then I hear from other people in different parts of the city that are having much better success.  So I'm not sold on it at the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Philadelphia is pretty quick.  Is it?  Is it?  It's faster than 3G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I think that sometimes that's the case because nobody's using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be more like the case in Philadelphia, obviously.  There's a lot less market there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Right.  John wrote about the 2009 Telework Improvements Act, a bill which is currently stalled in the House of Representatives that would allow telework.  What is telework?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Telework is what was formally called 15 years ago telecommuting.  Working from home.  Working from home or the beach or Hawaii or wherever you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So this bill, the idea of this bill was to promote?  Government telework.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Government employees to do this.  Yeah, and they entail a bunch of things.  But even the control freaks in the government, because that's what this is all about, is control freaks that are managers.  Well, you're like one of them now.  I am. I'm a major control freak.  They want to see people in the office.  They want to see smiling faces and they don't care where they're at.  No, not me. I don't want to see anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I want them all working at home.  We actually have more people working out of the office than we do in.  Of course, we don't pay the ones working out of the office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, the point is it's never going to get anywhere.  This has not gone anywhere anyway because people are control freaks.  And I have a few interesting examples during the dot com era.  In fact, there was a couple of people I talked to who should have known better.  There are so many benefits.  They want people in the office so they can have when they want to trust their employees.  They don't trust their employees and they want to have meetings.  Oh, I hate the worst productivity killer of all.  Yeah, meetings.  So anyway, this is a good article.  It's in MarketWatch.  So go to MarketWatch.com.  I just want to give you a little plug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Now, Callie, what is this open thing that you're about to embark on?  So it's called Open Camp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's a new conference that I'm putting on with the team here in Dallas.  Everyone's familiar or most people are familiar with the WordCamps and the DrupalCamps and the JoomlaCamps.  Where everybody's kind of divided and everybody's focused on their own platform, CMS platform.  And this year we thought, you know, why separate everybody?  This is really frustrating because I want to network and learn from the people working on other platforms as much as the people working on WordPress, which I'm currently on.  But so it was really all about bringing everybody together and having a bigger, larger group to network with.  So in the morning, it's August 27th to 28th.  In the mornings of the conference, we're getting some general...  I'm sorry?  It's in the morning, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so it's all day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But in the mornings, we're going to have general sessions where it's, you know, topics that everybody benefits from,  regardless of what platform they're using.  So promotion, SEO, marketing, that kind of thing, things that everybody's going to benefit from.  And then in the afternoon, we'll split off and people can learn about the different platforms or just focus on the one platform that they're interested in and learning how to get more out of it.  So I'm really excited about it.  Leo just said that he would come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I'm looking August 27th, 28th, 29th.  He's going to think about that.  Can I come?  I'll come the Friday.  I don't know if I could stay for the weekend because I got to do the radio show, but I'll come Friday.  We're really big.  We are.  In fact, I would like to go there and maybe I'll bring Ken, our newest VP engineering, because we're really big on Drupal.  And we're very excited about what we're doing with Drupal.  We're redesigning the Twitch site.  And that's about when we're going to launch it.  So maybe we could come down and launch the new site and talk about how we're using RCMS, which is Drupal.  I also use WordPress like you, Kelly, I use WordPress for my end Squarespace, obviously.  But we can talk about Drupal and how we're really pushing it to the limits with what we're doing.  I would love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And you know, I've spent some time trying to figure out Drupal, but I didn't have enough time to put into it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Oh, you need a pro.  I have pros.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you can't do it.  Forget it, Kelly.  No, no, no, it's not that bad.  I can't do it.  I've been doing it.  It's very hard to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You said that because you're paying pros to do it.  We're talking about the beings.  No, no, wait, let me tell you something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  When I launched Twit five years ago, I chose I went looked at all the CMS engines and I chose Drupal for Twit.  Twit's been running on Drupal since I think Drupal 3 and I ran it for the first three years.  So I know a lot about Drupal.  It's not that hard.  But you're right.  Nowadays, if you really want to get a super good Drupal install, you want to go to the pros and there are very good Drupal programmers out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Far and few between of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  We have some really good ones.  Probably got all of them.  Lullabot's great.  They did the original design.  We have some great ones here in Dallas.  Yeah, there's great Drupal.  In fact, DrupalCon was in San Francisco a couple of weeks ago.  How many was it?  3500 people.  It was thousands of people showed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How many were actual developers and how many people were trying to figure out what the heck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I would say and I'll have to ask Ken because he was there, but I would say it's about half people who are doing it and half people who say I want to learn Drupal.  This is the time Drupal is Whitehouse.gov running on Drupal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't trust the government.  I thought we've already discussed that.  No, it's a really great.  Just not Drupal down two pegs because the government's easy.  And I love WordPress too, Kelly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I'm a big WordPress fan and there are lots of good CMSs, but I would love to talk about what we're planning to do is make a distribution of what we do for Twitter so that others can take the distribution.  Drupal has this capability of bundling up these distributions and you could take my distribution, put it on your site and have all the functionality that we have on the Twitter site on your site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I didn't know that and I would learn something like that at this conference where everybody's kind of getting together.  And for example, I didn't have any, you know, I think if I was doing a particular site and Drupal was the best one, but I didn't have anybody to go to because I'm not connected to that.  Then that's a that's a more difficult task than if you had, you know, had that that conversation and that networking ability.  So, yeah, I would love for you to come out and kind of showcase that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, you know, I should I should fill you in.  Colleen Kelly, who's been our director of engineering since day one here practically, and she built this studio.  She was what our third employee, Dane.  I think it was you that Frederick and Colleen is leaving us.  She got a job at Google.  She's going to be a video streaming video engineer at Google.  But the good news is we had a developer working on our website, Ken Shepards and Kships been part of our community for a couple of years.  He's going to jump right in where Colleen is leaving.  He's going to he's already become our VP of engineering.  So I'll bring him down because he's the one doing a lot of this work.  I'm just you know, I'm just saying, oh, I like that color.  That's pretty. But he really knows what he's doing, Kelly.  And I'm very excited about what we're going to do with a new Twitter site.  It's it's really cool community site.  That's awesome. Yeah. So good. All right.  I looked at my calendar. I can do that Friday. So I'll be there Friday if I can stay.  If I can find a station in Dallas that will let me do the radio show from Dallas, I'll stay.  But otherwise, I'll be there for sure. August 27th. OK.  OK. See, see, I cleared my schedule for her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  What's the story with TechCrunch TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. So I don't know that much about it because Paul Carr, one of the other writers of TechCrunch, is kind of in charge of it.  He's been spearheading what we're going to do from an editorial perspective for that.  But yeah, I mean, he's got a lot of good ideas.  I don't know exactly when it's supposed to launch, but I've been in the studio and stuff and it's coming together nicely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, I know some really good people who are very good on camera if you want anybody.  This Dvorak guy, I think he's got a future in broadcast somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wish that had happened. That would have been awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  That would have been fun. You could have bought a giant cake and oh, Doctor could have bought it.  You got to go off on Obama. That was worth it.  No, and I like the accents too. He's oh, Doctor on Twitter. Owen JJ Stone.

And I'm here because I'm family and Uncle Leo loves me.  You are family.  And I'm bigger than him and he can't kick me out once I'm in here.  Doesn't he look scary on his Twitter page? Look at that.
