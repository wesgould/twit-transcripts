They came with a cassette adapter for storage because nobody could afford floppies  Although you could get a floppy drive with it hard drive. Yeah, but what it was it five megabytes ten megabytes  It wasn't very big megabytes not gigabytes kids  And then you look at a galaxy note 9  Which if you're willing to pay through the nose has a terabyte of storage as much as as much as so come  so there's the  It's a couple of things. I found interesting you you were there for the announcement so you could tell me more flow but  The  Base unit the base model cheapest when you get 999  Yeah, and that's for 6 gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of storage, which is probably enough for anybody, but probably  then there's a  $1,250 version with 8 gigs of RAM and a 512 gig storage 500 that's half a terabyte and then you put you  Samsung says we're gonna make 512 megabyte micro SD cards you can add to that for a full terrible

I can I just say company stop looking at Apple period  Google's new phones gonna have a notch  Stop looking at Apple period at least Samsung has the cojones

Start time: 1451.00
End time: 1464.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'm saying here's the only question in my mind. Is there a technical requirement?  Do you have to have a notch Oh  Apple put the notch there because they have three different sensors up there and they wanted to make room for them without  shrinking the screen

Start time: 1466.58
End time: 1491.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you don't you only get the but if you look at the total area  Usable area of the screen if you put a slim bezel at the top  You know instead of going right to the edge if you put a slim bezel you could fit those sensors in there  Within a slim bezel area and then have just have  Nice clean rectangle right no notch  And no no nonsense for developers. You know working around a notch and all this other. What's the limit? You'd pay for a smartphone

Start time: 1493.30

End time: 1609.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_11

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Even touch it. Yeah, I think I think actually that did stymie him  Face recognition it's not as good as Apple's but it's fast. It's pretty fast  Yeah, it is fingerprint which everybody I think things is the best way Apple

Start time: 1630.68
End time: 1634.68

Start time: 1635.64
End time: 1643.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_11

Start time: 1644.30
End time: 1658.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm just imagining still seems like it would be a long reach. Yeah. Yeah, you got little hands  You know, I've got a pixel XL  And I yeah, well my hands are not that big, you know, I can just reach the the sensor on my pixel XL

Start time: 1660.32
End time: 1667.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's only a five and a half. It's a very important part for me  Yeah, especially because I use it a Android auto because I touch it to turn on the display

Start time: 1668.30
End time: 1676.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So when your phone is in the dock and the fingerprints on the back, that's not an ideal position for it  Is it because can you get to it? Oh, no, I put the phone like this

Start time: 1677.68
End time: 1682.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And then this part sticks out a little fingerprint and then I just go you can also you know

Start time: 1683.72
End time: 1692.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 1696.16
End time: 1734.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And then you have password and pin of course if you really want to be secure you want to use a  Long strong password because that at least for now the courts say cannot be extracted from you by  Border Patrol or somebody if you want to if you want to keep your phone private interesting features. I'm officially Android pie  Yeah, not officially they could still say you're gonna stay at the airport jail for a little while  And nobody wants to be an airport jail  Is this Android pie or Oreo? It's Oreo isn't anything? It's Oreo Android 8. It's last what?  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, this is I think this is Android pie. This is this actually

Start time: 1735.14

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  What are you talking about?  I think it's I think it's Oreo. Let me show you a nice feature though of pie, which I really like that is designed  For this scenario where you have a fingerprint I can unlock my phone with my fingerprint  But let's say I'm getting on there off an airplane and I don't want Border Patrol. There's a new feature called lockdown  So I pressed and hold the you have to turn this on but I press and held the on off button  And now when I press lockdown before I get off the airplane  Not only does it lock the phone but the fingerprint reader doesn't unlock it face recognition doesn't unlock it  The only thing that unlocks it is your long strong password. That's gonna be great for runs

It only took me two weeks  Well, it's part of this class I took oh, yeah, I don't know why I'm mentioning it  It's just I'm very I feel like I'm telling you man feels good to like

Transcript:  When you enter you can enter it  I haven't I have to do now the UI so that you can enter it in in a nice way instead of typing all the numbers  But you can enter in a Sudoku puzzle. I even did the hardest Sudoku puzzle out there  So a normal hard one it takes a second, but the hardest one out there I found on the Sudoku wiki  Took 25 minutes, but it solved it Wow

Start time: 1880.30
End time: 1884.22

Start time: 1892.94
End time: 1910.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's a brute-force solver so the way it  Now you understand everything it literally the way it does it it builds a tree of all the possible solutions now  It's smart enough to eliminate invalid positions right away  So you don't have to build if you get an invalid position you're not gonna build a tree that

Start time: 1911.60
End time: 1913.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's pretty that's pretty good. It's a little smart

Start time: 1913.70
End time: 1931.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So it bit you know it looks at the position it it comes up with nine next positions eliminates the invalid ones  Then for each of those nine comes up with nine  So on this normal puzzle it pretty much goes through that tree fast, but on a hard puzzle  tens of millions of

Start time: 1931.64
End time: 1933.36

Transcript:  It was the hardest it was literally say they said the hardest Sudoku puzzle ever designed  I'm just proud of it  Use no way I don't even I don't even have no AI that's like that's  I'm gonna ask Matt cuts  You're here in studio with us finally somebody who can legitimately answer this question because you see the phrase AI  It's like blockchain now. Yeah, it's applied as a marketing term to everything everything has artificial intelligence  and I think as  An antidote to that we need a real definition  So that we know if something really does have artificial intelligence  And I think a lot of things are just it's just like that Sudoku solver looks intelligent  But it's just a computer program right that's not clearly not AI  That's only a very broad definition and we should mention Matt works at Google one of the early employees of Google worked at Google for years  Knows a lot about this stuff. What makes something AI? Oh, man

Start time: 1990.70
End time: 1999.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know AI is such a laden term that they didn't teach it when I went to grad school because at the time  They were like artificial intelligence is a complete waste of time

Start time: 1999.32
End time: 2015.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You want to go to school in the winter the AI winter and we're all excited about AI back in the 60s, right?  When everybody thought all computers are gonna be smart. We've got Lisp now everything will be  And it turned out it was really hard  And so there was an AI winner and that's when you were in school

Start time: 2015.84
End time: 2036.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And so it's interesting a lot of people have rebranded it as machine learning. They're like Google prefers that  Yeah, they're like we don't want to have the baggage of AI and and you know machine learning is you know define machine learning  Well, maybe you have a data set and then you're able to extrapolate into new situations  And so maybe it takes a lot of time to train  But when you're done you can do a human like task that we'd not you would not expect a computer to be able to do

Start time: 2036.50
End time: 2045.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I kind of characterize it that no human told it how to do it  That the the computer in effect wrote its own program figured out up to a point

Start time: 2046.84
End time: 2100.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean there there has to be human involvement, you know in setting up the initial model and and there's  Human involvement in tuning it  I've spent a lot of time in the last couple of years talking with a lot of people working on autonomous vehicles  There's a lot of especially deep neural nets, you know, and there's I mean, there's a lot of different flavors of machine learning  You know and the one that's most commonly used for things like  Object recognition are deep neural nets and the thing the thing that has made it  Practical that you know, you couldn't have done this 20 or 30 years ago is these highly parallelized GPUs  You know where you've got hundreds of cores running in parallel, you know tackling the problem and you know the power and in fact  I was just working on a column the other day  And I was talking to Brian Seleski  Who's the he's the CEO of Argo AI and he led the software side of the team that won the DARPA urban challenge in?

Start time: 2107.32
End time: 2117.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  so, you know, I asked him, you know, what was the computing power of  Of the system that they had in there and this was a Chevy Tahoe that had a rack of servers in the back

Start time: 2117.66
End time: 2123.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_11

Start time: 2127.88
End time: 2186.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they had they had 10 blade computers in there with each one with a 2.1 gigahertz core to duo in there  And I was looking up some benchmarks on that chip was about 180 MIPS on the whetstone  So 180 million instructions per second for each of them for each of them. So roughly, you know, depending on what you're doing  How was configured?  No 1.8 billion instructions. Oh giga flops. Yeah  today  Nvidia their their latest chip that they're shipping to customers now for  Automated driving tasks is called Xavier. It does 30 teraflops  It's huge difference then the next generation one that they've just our sample thousand or 15,000 better  Yeah, then that old system the next the next one that they're they just started shipping samples  About a month and a half ago. It's called Drive Pegasus. It's  320 teraflops Wow in a board about the size of a laptop Wow

Start time: 2187.06
End time: 2196.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You could probably cook an egg on it. Yeah, it's about 400 watts. So that's right. So it's really processing  It's also a big memory right because you have big data sets you need to analyze

Start time: 2196.18
End time: 2209.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, well and there's also a distinction at least in machine learning about supervised versus unsupervised data  So supervised is stuff that has been labeled so that you can learn. Oh, here are all the cats  Whereas unsupervised is just you sort of let it free on YouTube or wherever

Start time: 2209.90
End time: 2226.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So that's the example between the difference between deep blue  Which learned to become the best chess playing computer in the world by in a supervised form?  They gave it games and AlphaGo which was the Google intelligence that learned to play go by playing itself, right?

Start time: 2226.46
End time: 2240.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, and that's the perfect example because there's one called AlphaGo zero  That's another generation that basically it didn't they didn't tell it anything is the rules. That's right  You're just like boom go to town and see what you figure out playing better than any human alive

Start time: 2240.34
End time: 2258.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It is and better than the previous versions of AlphaGo and go is very hard go is a pattern recognition problem  There's extremely if you think Sudoku's solving his hard go is really hard  And so that's very impressive that so I would I would definitely say that's not machine merely machine learning. That's artificial intelligence. Yes

It's an anxious  Process, but now that interest rates are starting to go up  It's even more anxious because now there's pressure to get it done fast before rates go up even more  So the folks at quick and loans have come up with a really good solution  They call it the power buying process and this is what Sam was talking about you go to rocket mortgage comm slash twit  To rocket mortgage comm slash twit and the number two and you get the account set up and this is very quick the the initial  Prequalification takes  Maybe ten minutes at most  It's called pre qualified approval. What you do is you answer a few simple questions. You don't have to get paperwork  You don't have to find out what your bank statements were from 2018 or 2012 or 23  Or whatever you just go to the website answer a couple of questions  They have trusted relationships with all the financial institutions once you give them permission  They get the information they need to verify your income your assets and credit and they give you pre qualified approval  That's within a few minutes  The next step is a loan officer comes in reviews it and gives you within 24 hours verified approval now  You've got a letter in your hand that is essentially saying they've got the loan that gives you the strength of a cash buyer  This is important when you're buying a house when the seller sees your offer if you've got this  Verified approval the seller treats you like a cash buyer puts you right at the front of the line  If somebody else is saying well, I'm gonna get the loan. I pre, you know, I'm pre approved. They're gonna still say oh no  That's fine, but I don't want any contingencies. I want the verified approval guy  then  Then once you're verified you get the next step which is called rate shield approval  And this is the thing really takes the anxiety out of it  They lock your rate up for up to three months while you shop it cannot go up  I don't care if the rates in the real world go up  Yours won't if it goes if the real world rates go down your rate will go down  Yeah, but they cannot go up you win either way  This is exactly what you expect from a customer focused company  America's largest mortgage lender for a reason the best number one in customer satisfaction eight years in a row according to JD Power  Quick and loans and rocket mortgage.

So you utilize mass transit on the high-density routes, you know where there's a lot of people going  It makes the most economic sense there and then you know  You have the autonomous vehicles acting as first mile last mile feeding into that and taking you on to other destinations  And also for these other kinds of applications like delivering food and and whatever else  For the economics to work for these services. They need to have these vehicles running 24 hours a day  Generating revenue doing something all the time. You don't want them sitting around  It's just like an airplane airliner, right?  Where it doesn't make money when it's sitting on the tarmac  It makes money when it's flying between tens of thousands of these Chrysler Pacific  Yeah, they've ordered up to 62,000 of them over the next three years and now they're gonna buy the Jaguar and their eyepaces  Yeah, and 20,000 Jaguars and 60,000  Vehicles where he's gonna be for well, they're for the Jaguars will be for a more premium service  So it's their electric.

This is always the case right if you're in HR  The worst time to find a new employee is when the employee quits and now you're down and Lisa's like working double-time trying to  Keep the books and stuff and she's got to find somebody to replace it and I said Lisa  Let's try zip recruiter. Well, I mean they've been a sponsor for years. They're the easiest way to hire  She said alright, this was at breakfast  She posted on zip recruiter and one of the things that recruiter does immediately post a hundred plus of the job of the you know  Of all the job sites out there including Twitter and Facebook  So it's really putting it casting a very wide net which means you have a much higher chance of reaching that perfect person  But the other thing that they do that is really interesting  They actually will immediately start matching your opening to millions of resumes that they have on hand  To find the people with the right experience and then they invite those people to apply and this was the thing that blew me away  I figured well, it's gonna be on those job boards in the next day or two. We're gonna start getting  Applications and by the way, they all go into the zip recruiter inbox  They format the resume so they're easy to read you can have screening questions  It makes it very easy. But what I didn't count on is how fast we would start getting applications. Thanks to zip recruiter going out there and getting people  Like like we're eating breakfast like an hour later. Oh my god. I just got I just got another I got another  Within before lunch, we had five really good candidates Lisa was walking on the clouds. She was so happy  Because instead of having to take weeks to find this right person zip recruiter just just served him up  They're so effective that 80% of employers who post on zip recruiter get a quality candidate  Through zip recruiter within the first day. It's it's almost like they're headhunting for you  No wonder zip recruiter is the highest rated hiring site in America. It really works  We were thrilled and it made our life much much easier  And by the way, you can do this right now for free at zip recruiter comm slash twit  So if you've got an opening or maybe you don't right now, but maybe tomorrow you're gonna go into work  Somebody's gonna quit zip recruiter comm slash twit.

Transcript:  So we saved the more  Thorny issue for the middle of the show and we're gonna talk about info wars now, you know Matt cuts  I think your experience fighting spam at Google probably will be  helpful in this  Info wars Alex Jones kind of conspiracy laden radio show podcast  Has has been around for years?  When I first heard about it and was twit fans who told me about it. I thought it was like a comedy site  It was like weekly world news, you know, I was abducted by aliens  But in the Trump era it's become more because apparently the president listens to info wars  It's become more and more of a mainstream source of information and at this point  Alex is being sued for instance by Sandy Hook parents because he's been saying they their kids weren't shot at Sandy Hook their actors  That's got to be the ultimate insult to somebody who lost a child. They're being harassed. They get  Info Wars army goes after them  So he's been pulled from a lot of places  He's been pulled Apple pulled the podcast from iTunes  They still could still get the app though on the app store. Interestingly Spotify pulled the podcast  Marco Armit was the first one to pull him from his directory and over you Marco from overcast. So there has been some reaction  Twitter won't and there was a really long article  In the New York Times that Twitter invited the New York Times reporters to reporters to come in  To come in we do know is oh boy. I gotta ban him on Twitter

Transcript:  So really I thought an interesting article in New York Times where they basically  Went into the meeting at Twitter where last Friday?  Just a couple of days ago where they were trying to decide what to do about info wars now CNN  Claims that they found seven tweets where info wars did violate  specifically violate  Apple's rules our Twitter's rules rather  But Twitter has decided and they said it's a very tough decision  To for now leave info wars despite the fact that they apparently did  Break Twitter's rules to leave them on Jack tweeted yesterday. We didn't suspend Alec Jones or info wars  We know it's hard for many but the reason is simple  He hasn't violated our rules will enforce if he does and will continue to promote a healthy  Conversational environment by ensuring tweets aren't artificially amplified now  I really actually believe it or not have mixed feelings about this and I thought Mike Maznik a tech dirt  Mike is often very very sharp about this kind of stuff wrote a really  Interesting and very long piece  He actually was so long he summarized it right at the beginning and I'll read this summary because I think it's interesting  He says internet sites have every right in the world to kick people off their platforms  There's no legal or ethical problem with that. No one's free speech is being censored  That said and this is what concerns me  We should be at least a bit concerned about the idea that giant internet platforms  Get to be some sort of arbiter in what speech is okay, and what speech is not and  How that can impact society more generally?  So he goes on to say there are possible solutions to this even if none are perfect and some may be difficult to implement  And we should explore those more  Thoroughly rather than getting into screaming fights over who should and shouldn't be allowed to use various internet platforms  The reason I think of you Matt cuts is because I'm sure you had similar issues  Similar debates inside of Google when you were there. Yeah, absolutely

Transcript:  We had people who would come and say I don't like X  I think safe search should exclude X and and I ended up writing like a canned thing that was like  Okay, you might not like the anarchist cookbook or bomb making but then that leads to pro anorexia sites  Which leads to wiccan sites which leads to you know, and you're literally, you know, here's your slippery slope  Where would you like to draw it along that line?  So in my point of view I was like, okay  Make something upfront and clear and say this is what it is and from that point forward you can at least defend that  What is that rule?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It doesn't exist kind of well and I do think everybody  That I worked with at Google is very thoughtful and trying to figure out how to you want to be comprehensive  But at the same time a long time ago, we were saying well, you just want to reflect the web adequately  So for example, you want to have an accurate reflection of what's on the web  But that's even a problem because all the people who think pick vaccines, you know, they're like, oh vaccines are terrible  There's a lot of people who say that there's fewer people who get really passionate and say no scientific consensus and data says the vaccines work  And so if you were only a reflection of the web, you're still might might not

Start time: 4951.14
End time: 4964.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's very true, you know adequately reflect and Google's been bit by that in the past because the search engine does value stuff with more links  Right and in fact any vaccine is a very good example and but but Google fixes it  It seems like on an ad hoc basis

Start time: 4964.94
End time: 4996.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  well  It's interesting because you'd see people trying to go back and put principles underneath of it like, you know  Well, why don't you allow this ad? Okay. Well, let's figure out the general case  Maybe the general case is we allow some very active as a way not anti a very engineering way to sell  It's absolutely is but what's interesting is every company can have their own personal philosophy Twitter  historically is you know calling themselves the free speech wing of the free speech party and so I can understand why  Their DNA makes them a little more loathe to take action on so how money?

End time: 5038.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it's fair but it does feel like the people that I talked to in the tech industry have realized  Okay, if we don't get this trust and credibility problem under control, that's more of a problem  So like you you definitely saw, you know monthly active users take a hit  With a couple different platforms face serious about this and they're just sort of like, okay  Yeah, Facebook's 120 billion dollar drop  But I would rather have them have realistic true users rather than bots or something deceptive or misleading

Transcript:  Well Mike's solution is to put the control in the hands of the users. So he's saying  Platforms have to get serious about moving real power out to the ends of the network  So that anyone can set up systems for themselves or look to third parties for kill filters  Basically, he says in the old days and used that there were kill files  Emails got swamped with spam, but there were a variety of anti spam filters  You could plug in the filter out most of it

Transcript:  Ineffective as well. I don't think a company is gonna fix any of this  I think this is a social problem and I think tech is trying to find an answer for it  And I don't think the answer is there. It's a societal problem  Would I ban if you were Twitter's I?  Don't know I really don't know I don't know I want it banned because I think it's awful that this stuff is being spread as  truth  I mean, let's not forget things like pizza gate in the sort like that was all

Transcript:  That's the one argument that care to me carries water with Twitter  Which is Twitter as always said we're not gonna allow so much free speech that is endangering people  That is the line we will draw and frankly the law draws if there is a threat if there's danger if you shout fire  In a crowded theater you are not protected at that point because you're in danger and and Alex Jones has cried fire in a crowded theater

I mean I I  You know, I hate the idea of censoring anyone but you know, this is clearly an example of where he is spreading absolute  Untruths known untruths and he's getting people riled up around these untruths and that is more dangerous than they  count, you know then then the risk of

Transcript:  You can imagine reliable sources that you can find but I  Think the Google philosophy is also try to think about  signals that  You know give you some idea about reputation  And so, you know a reputable site is then therefore more likely to rank and and I suspect  You know, you could probably come up with a lot of different ways to say  Oh, maybe articles on this site are reshared without people actually looking at them, you know  And so you say oh they just write the click baiting that sounds like a rationalization that is very it's a very engineering driven solution  I think that's what a lot of Silicon Valley is doing right now. They're always gonna do because they're engineers  It is also the case that there are offline solutions  So if somebody does libel or slander then you can go to court action that way. Yeah

Start time: 5281.10

Start time: 5290.90
End time: 5340.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's really difficult because that's why I say it's a societal thing because I this is how I feel about  This is how I feel about when I mean personally when there is increased  Police presence on things like Bart  I'm kind of against it because I think that that's not actually solving the problem of like why robberies are happening because of great income  Disparity so to this point I say this is not actually solving the problem of why  You want to get the root of the I want to get to the root of the problem  We have a problem  It does but we keep focusing on tech and talking about tech and what the tech companies are doing  But like they're not doing anything for us. They're doing everything for their own gain. This has nothing to do with the users  They're going to acquiesce us so that we keep buying their products and using their services  But it has nothing to do with like actually helping humanity. We have to solve this problem ourselves offline

Start time: 5341.14
End time: 5374.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We have to change it. I think a lot of people can and should take all kinds of actions  I do know a lot of people at tech companies who genuinely feel like okay. This is a problem  Maybe they were trying to get heard before  But it does feel like now the tech companies understand they need to be part of the solution and figure out  Yeah, you know you can't just allow bots  You know to make your user growth look good like it does feel like that moment of reckoning has arrived and at least the tech companies  Realize okay. How are we responsible? What is our ethical obligation, and how do we put that in place?  To it is not a medical require

Start time: 5374.84
End time: 5395.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think there's ethical needs in all forms of engineering not just you know and what Silicon Valley does but across the board  You know autonomous vehicles being a prime example of that  You know the engineers need to think about the human factor in any kind of product  They're creating the way people are going to use that product needs to be considered in the development of that product

Transcript:  About this on Thursday on Wednesday on twig, but he's written an interesting opinion piece for the Atlantic in which he's pretty positive  He he says that what you're seeing at this point is a sign of major sign of process  The process is beginning to work civilization is winning at last  Now I'd be very interested what  Jeff says about Twitter, but he says Alex Jones went too far and the public empowered by the same tools of social media  Jones exploited told the platforms his behavior is unacceptable and it's a civil society  The platforms  Like media and like regulators might prefer to start as you say Matt with a set of rules that can be enforced by government  Social media managers or algorithms, but really in the real world, that's not how we negotiate our standards the breach  Makes the rule you can't necessarily know ahead of time. What's gonna be a problem  We know pornography propaganda trolling and spamming when we see it and then  We write the rules to prevent it Jeff writes the progress always seems to take too long  But it is prudent that we ban what we see rather than everything we might fear. He's talking about, you know prior restraint  That's a big issue to and techno panic right and the First Amendment is very much protective of that  You cannot use prior restraint. You can't stop a newspaper from publishing something  you think they're gonna publish you have to wait till they publish it and then  although the  Interesting history of the First Amendment if you start to read it is that almost immediately after the First Amendment was added to the Constitution  It was violated  By a federal government that didn't like the speech that it was getting I can't remember what the subject was  So it was almost immediately violated so maybe we shouldn't be so surprised.  Yeah, perfect example the Alien Sedition Act. In fact, maybe that was it. Yeah

Well, first of all, you got to bring a guy out  He's gonna install all this stuff  Charges you through the nose for that and then they typically charge you 45 or more dollars a month for this stuff  ring  protect plus  professional monitoring get ready $10 a month  $10 no long-term contracts  No moving costs  No cancellation fees just $10 a month. You'd be crazy to buy anything else  We've come to trust ring with everything now  The ring alarm security kit is available ring comm go to ring comm slash tweet  You can learn more get the base station get the keypad the sensors the motion detectors  They've even got range extenders that that extend the signal from your base station  So you can cover a very large area and then and there's a lot more ring comm slash  To it a smarter way to protect your entire entire home only $10 a month  for that professional 24-7 monitoring Wow, I  Love it classic Skype lives to see another day  Thank You Microsoft Microsoft's listening  They were gonna kill Skype classic Skype we rely on Skype as you know, in fact, I'm not using Skype for the first time in weeks  You guys are all here.

We have a team at the Defense Digital Service  Which is our wing over at the Pentagon and they are sending folks and we're doing a hackathon like a literal  a bug bounty  Called hack the Marines. So yes, that's right. They did hack the Navy  They don't have to do the army hack the Navy. So this is their sixth bug bounty  They had never the federal government had never done a bug bounty before 2016 when the US Digital Service did hack the Pentagon  So that was you well, it wasn't I did the set I helped with the second one  But yes, the US Digital Service helped with that and that's what I mean by you right the collective you didn't bring like all the  Ethernet cable was a wonderful person named Lisa who was really the driver on that. Yeah, but  It's pretty incredible because everybody was incredibly scared of doing this  It turns out bug bounties have been done since 1995 with Netscape. So it's not really scary  They've turned the crank so many times that now people like can you test our system out?

So I mean first off you can earn money like money is cool  You can help secure if you're good at this you could yes be good at it  There is a person who just graduated high school his name is Jack cable. He's going to Stanford in the fall  He's one of the top like in the top five according to hacker one of all the hackers  He's doing an internship with DDS and finding all these security holes  And the point is now this person is doing it because they just want to like improve the security of  Websites so that bad people don't get in bad actors don't get in so it's a win across the board you get better security  At a cheaper price  Industry best standard you know just it's it's the right way to do it

Transcript:  But previously people would pay for penetration testing right and they were paying something like  $13,000 for every security vulnerability that they found hack the Pentagon the cost went to a thousand and eighty six dollars  Wow so an order of magnitude cheaper you find more security holes you fix them faster  The white hats find them instead of the black hats like it's it's just across the board a great idea  It's a win all around yeah better faster cheaper

I saw him able to get pizzas for free though. Here's the good news  If it's gonna be a world where everybody's hacking us, at least we're gonna hack them right back  Sure, the Pentagon is building. This is from wired a dream team of tech savvy soldiers  This happened and I'm sure Matt you're aware of this a couple of months ago when the US Army  Cyber Command was given a given parody with all the other branches. It's basically a branch of the Pentagon  and  I have mixed feelings about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So it's interesting because that article is about the team at the defense digital service  So Chris Lynch and that these are the defensive person that I've worked with. Yeah, and  and and so the idea is if you can figure out ways where you can do these defensive things and  you know, there are lots of talented people in government if you can find them and empower them and  You know try to cut some of the red tape and improve the training like you can actually defend the country much much better

That's the real question. I don't know if the OIG has addressed that I think that would be an interesting question  Did they intentionally keep it down because it wasn't going their way?  I would never do we know there were a lot of phony comments some from members of Congress  That weren't really from the members of Congress that irritated Congress a little bit  Snapchat source code. This is the annals of hacking snap. Sure. It's snapchat source code has been leaked was briefly published on github  Was the iOS version it was pulled down immediately cease and desist  Github pulled down the whole thing  Nevertheless, I'm sure people got a copy of it  In fact according to motherboard some people are actively trading the snapchat source code

I think one general said what?  Where we'll see if I can find the quote. I read it somewhere. You mean people are what?
