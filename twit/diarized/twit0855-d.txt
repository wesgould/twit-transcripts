And in years past, we've flown in hosts from all over the world. We've had celebrities  like Judge John Hodgman, Jonathan Colton, you know, but this year, it's just going to be us.  And I think that's kind of fun. The hosts on today's twit end of year special, Ant Pruitt from  Hands On Photography. And he's pouring a good good good because you don't have any holiday  festive cheer around. I thought a little a little something brown might be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What are you talking about? There's something to do this. I'm going to do this because I spent  misspent youth learning the Greek alphabet. Alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, zeta, eta, theta.  You just stop me when you hear the worst one. Zeta, eta, theta, iota, kappa, lambda, mu, nu.  Now I pronounce it xe. But that's xe. I don't like nobody does. Although my friend who is in  a fraternity says, oh no, that's she. Anyway, see, now I got to do it fast. Alpha, beta, gamma,  delta, epsilon, zeta, eta, theta, iota, kappa, lambda, mu, nu, xe, Omicron, phi, kip, c, omega.  Now I've lost track. Wait, I see the whole chunk in the middle. I think it's not what it looks like.  Phi, kip, c, omega. Now I've something new Omicron. Something new Omicron. Anyway,

Start time: 279.54
End time: 291.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and p. Actually none of that's real because the Greek alphabet is not a Roman alphabet. So I don't  know what it is. P. I forgot p. P, rho, sigma, tau, epsilon. P, kip, c, omega. Pardon me?

Transcript:  Please get a Manhattan. We're going to this episode as we usually do, we're going to look  back at the year, which is actually not a festive thing this year at all. We'll find something to  be festive about. But I thought one of the things that happened this year is I got a very special  candle from a PR agency thanking me for having one of their people on our shows, which as far as I  know, we never did. Maybe that explains the candle because the official sense of this is smitten.  So I thought this would be appropriate during our holiday show. We should have a little,  you know, we've got the fake fire. Let's have some real flame. I'm going to light  the candle. And when I blow the candle out, that'll be it. The last twit of the year.  There we go. So the little candle, we should mention next week is the best of episode,  right? Am I right? January. And then January 9th is going to be a very special future episode. So  we traditionally do this. We've done this for years where one episode looks back at the year  gone by this episode. And then in two weeks, we're going to do an episode. And this was Amy  Webb's idea predicting the future. Amy Webb, our favorite futurist will join us. So one of my  favorite sci fi authors. I'm so excited. Daniel Suarez of, yeah, really love him of demon and  freedom TM and freedom. So many great books will join us. I figured somebody who spends a lot of  time thinking about the future should probably have something to say. And then we have a player

Start time: 441.12

Start time: 447.14
End time: 470.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  about like the interoperability of networks. Yeah, he's a really good guy to get for this because  all of his books kind of our near near future. Here's where technology will take us kind of  stuff. And I think that's really that's fascinating. So Daniel will be a great guest. Of course, that's  what Amy does for a living. But I'm now and I've been putting it off. It's time to take a look back.

Transcript:  Oh, my God. So it was 2020, right, which is when it all started the COVID

Start time: 481.40
End time: 549.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  nightmare. Then then people were saying, Oh, yeah, 2021 WON. And then Lisa the other day realized,  Oh, no, it's 2022. So God, that's what it is the year that will not give up. I guess if we're going  to talk about the year passed in the year in technology. So what we took the COVID has had a  huge impact on tech, it's had people working from home. In fact, that may go on forever. I think in  some ways, it's changed how tech companies work. Many companies are now hiring people all over the  world and letting them work from home. Of course, the great resignation has impacted tech. And I  think you could also say that COVID-19 is complicit, maybe not the total cause of  the supply chain shortage. So yeah, tech very much affected. Oh, and there's one more.  And there's a bright side to COVID-19. A lot of tech billionaires got really rich.  Yay, tech billionaires. It was COVID has been great for Amazon, right?

Start time: 550.88
End time: 596.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, there are more people ordering than there ever have been. And I was just on Twitter  yesterday, seeing different people kind of talking about the year. And that was one of the things  that they were talking about is not only are you ordering your Amazon packages, but people who are  doing grocery delivery. So many of those new kind of industries that at least here in California  have had an interesting go of things due to the different laws that we've tried to put in place  to protect those individual delivery drivers. This has been even more of a thing this year than  ever before, because we are relying on them so much. And we, you know, trying to kind of adapt  the way that we do or do not go shopping and visit stores and use folks who are there to do that.

Start time: 596.76
End time: 649.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In the first three months of 2021, Amazon's profit tripled.  Up 220% profit, up 220%, $8.1 billion. And of course, who benefited from that? Besides the  shareholders, the chief shareholder, the shareholder in chief Jeff Bezos. But his title as the world's  richest man was short lived. Because another guy who benefited from COVID-19, Elon Musk,  quickly overtook him and is currently as of this recording, they're in a battle, a race, the richest  man in the world. Elon is also the Time Magazine Man of the Year, Financial Times Man of the Year.  Oh, Elon, not necessarily for good reasons.  Yeah, he's more notorious reasons than anything else.

Start time: 650.02

End time: 682.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You want to guess? I remember back in the day when we were all talking about Bill Gates being the  richest guy in the world, he had 32 billion. He even said, after a few hundred million,  you're infinitely wealthy. There's just nothing you can spend that on. So anybody, don't look at  the headlines. Want to guess what Elon is worth?  300 billion?  Very good guess. Little high, 243 billion dollars.

Start time: 686.26
End time: 691.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How can one person be worth that much money? It just boggles my brain. I don't understand.

Start time: 692.22
End time: 731.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Elon, of course, famously tweeted a couple of, well, a lot of tweets, a couple, hundreds of  tweets that were crazy. One of them was, should I sell my stock to pay my taxes?  Which really wasn't a poll, although it's a little weird that he had a Twitter poll about  whether he should sell his stock to pay his taxes. He did in fact pay $11 billion in taxes  this year, but he didn't have a choice. It wasn't like,  I'm going to say as he was supposed to.  Yeah, like the Twitter poll made up his mind. Okay, I guess I will. No, he kind of had to.  He also, so many tweets, he also manipulated Dogecoin.

Start time: 732.76
End time: 733.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Dogecoin.

Start time: 733.84
End time: 747.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And continues. I think he's even still saying, he's still riding the Doge train saying, 2022,  it's all about Doge. This is where our bets are. That's a whole other facet of the 2021 is the  Dogecoin.

Start time: 748.30
End time: 770.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He was invited with his great wealth to solve the world's hunger problem by,  I think it's a United Nations hunger commissioner. And Elon said, well, if you can say in a tweet,  how my 10 billion would save, would solve the world's hunger, I'll be glad to do it.  I don't think we ever heard the end of that one.

Start time: 771.46
End time: 781.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unlike the end, the thing is, I could believe him doing that. If they say, all right, this is how  we can allocate this. I bet he would sign the check. Nobody signs checks now. Sorry.

Start time: 784.04
End time: 787.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not a question of signing. Who could be cashed a 10 billion check? That's what I want to know.

Start time: 787.94
End time: 811.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. And that's one of the few times where I sided with him on these shenanigans these days,  because we have all of these different funds and packages that are supposed to be doing this and  that for the people. But yet there's still millions and millions of people right here in our own  backyard that are struggling and fighting to pay bills. And they're getting these little $600

Start time: 813.06
End time: 929.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  checks. It is a little painful when you look at somebody with $243 billion, more than any  human ever could need. And to Elon's credit, it's not like he earned it. I mean, he didn't  dig ditches to earn it. Oh, no, he didn't. But he made the right moves at the right time.  He almost bankrupt himself, both with Tesla and SpaceX. And I think you can make an argument that  both Tesla and SpaceX have been a benefit to society, promoting electric vehicles and  putting us back in space. Research. Yeah. Research. Yeah. It's not like he's not a capitalist. I'm  sure he invested in both of those with the hopes to make money, but he risked his fortune to do  that. And he made a lot. He made a pile of money. Is it fair to say that he benefited from COVID?  Probably not. How? I wouldn't. That's what I've been trying to figure out too.  The one thing he did with COVID early on, and this was actually last year, he did not want to close  the Tesla factory from California. And during the early mask mandates, he was told to, and he  refused. That's right. I remember that. He refused. He risked not his life, his employees life,  to keep making cars. And he said, well, you know, I've got to, because my competitors in Michigan  are not closing their plants. Actually, what really closed plants in 2021 was supply chain  shortages. Shortages, not just of the big chips like Intel's and AMD's chips, but shortage of what  we call legacy nodes, the chips that things like, in fact, who was it? Some one car manufacturer  decided to start just shipping cars without automatic window openers because it's like,  it's like, we can't get the chips. We want to make the trucks. So let's just ship them out.  I wonder if that was Chevrolet, Chevrolet or Ford. I'm trying to remember who it was. And it wasn't  window openers, but it was some minor like seat adjustment thing, something like seat heaters.

Start time: 930.54
End time: 939.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sounds like something Toyota would do, you know, along with their package deal at the key fob thing.  They're thinking of all sorts of ways to break down their vehicles and make money on every single

Start time: 940.06
End time: 984.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  little piece. Yeah, they, we talked about that yesterday on, or actually, whoops, I mean, last  Sunday. There we go. There we go. Good illusion. Last Sunday on, on Twitter with Tim Stevens, of  course, who does road show for CNET. And he said, you know, they kind of got a lot of heat for  something that maybe people pay $500 for that remote start option to Toyota. And it's even  though it doesn't use wireless, doesn't use 3G, it just is a local network. Proprietary software,  right? Yeah. They, they, it was always intended that you would pay for it. They just got the first,  whatever, three years free. And so now that, so it wasn't like they didn't, it didn't, it wasn't a

Start time: 984.20
End time: 990.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  later decision to do that. I bet that was in the contract that the customers initially signed to,

Start time: 990.52
End time: 1055.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but it was, it was. However, you know, it's still silly. It's the same thing as BMW charging to use  Apple's CarPlay, which they eventually retracted. But I asked him, I think I said, is this going to  be, you think this will be the, the future of cars is we'll have subscriptions? And of course, yes.  And that was it, by the way, that's another term that became all the rage this year.  Revenue, what was it? It's R, revenue per per unit, a annual revenue per ARPU, ARPU,  annual revenue per unit. And by the way, user, user, it's per user, but it's also per unit.  And, and it is so technically it is per unit, according to Vistapedia, but of course, per unit  is per user. And the, and this is Apple kind of has done very well, right? Micah saying,  hey, we're a services company now we're going to make, like they don't even tell you how many  smartphones they sold. They just tell you how much they make per user. Yep. And that just keeps

Start time: 1055.40
End time: 1077.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  growing. As you see Apple expand. I mean, we saw that a lot this year, announcement after announcement  we talked about on Smart Tech today about Apple adding its Apple TV platform to so many different  places. You've got Apple music on Android and iOS. So all of these ways that they are able to make  money continually off of those services is it's no surprise that you know, you're seeing a lot of

Start time: 1077.90
End time: 1144.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  companies make that move. General Motors will stop shipping heated seats due to chip shortages.  There it is. I got the actual story. Thank you. It's like building a Lego set.  It is. Just leave that.  Lego pieces.  You're going to leave out the green piece that holds on. You don't need that to drive a car.  But I think it is interesting. I mean, this is Tesla does this. You, when you buy a Tesla,  they say, if you give us $10,000 now, you'll be able to give us $500 a month down the road  for full self-driving, which is like, wait, what? Wait, yes. And wait, what is exactly the  right response? Wait, what? Are you serious? Yeah. Oh no. Oh, and full self-driving.  Elon said this week, it'll never, he said this week, you know, they always talk about charge me  another 500 a month. Yes. In the future. Oh no. Oh no. Elon said this week, you know, they always  talk about the people who died in Tesla full self-driving accidents. They never talk about

Start time: 1144.40
End time: 1209.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the people whose lives we saved. Okay. Were there any? Well, we don't know because they didn't have  an accident. We never really know that. Yeah. Is that a fair thing to say? Like, well, let's focus  on the good that full self-driving does. I mean, you know, honestly, I think personally, I think  Elon has a point. I do too. This is the new technology, right? This is the new technology.  All eyes are on it. We went through this problem. I mean, I wasn't alive when we went through this,  but when vehicles, you know, when motor vehicles were new, that was a new technology. And there  were more deaths as a result of motor vehicles than there were prior to it because they didn't  exist. And, you know, I don't know. I think he's got a point. I think we're so quick to jump on  the fatality that happens without comparing the fatalities inside of, you know, Tesla vehicles  to just vehicles at large. And I think we would probably find out that as a percentage in vehicles  at large, a lot more fatalities, but it's just that Tesla is the new thing. We don't understand  it or the, you know, the public doesn't understand it quite the same. And so it's extra scrutiny as

Start time: 1210.34
End time: 1235.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a result. We are more traffic deaths this year than there have been since 2016 by a huge margin.  There were many, many, many, many traffic deaths this year. And a lot of that is attributed to  distracted driving. So in that way, yes, absolutely. I think that looking at automated  driving as a way to get past that distracted driving death is really important. When you look

Start time: 1235.52
End time: 1304.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  at unintended consequences of COVID-19, people don't think that because the roads were empty for  most of last year and even still a little slow this year because of, you know, people working  from home and quarantining. And so there's some question why traffic fatalities went up in 2020  and early 2021. The thinking is because there are fewer people on the road, people are speeding  more. And of course you're much more likely to die in a high speed accident than you are in a slow  accident. So the fact that there's less traffic is actually increasing traffic fatalities. That's,  that's the best theory anyway. We are going to do at the end of the show, by the way, we are going  to lift you up because I realize we're bringing you down. We're going to lift you up with some  of the funnest stories, the unusual, and this really belongs there, but we're in the Tesla  section. So I'm going to bring it up this week. The first Tesla baby, a woman whose waters broke  while the family was stuck in traffic. They put it on autopilot while she gave birth.  So there you go, Elon, not only lives saved babies born.

Transcript:  With contractions increasing, by this way, this happened in September. We're just learning about  it now with, with contractions increasing rapidly and traffic barely moving. The couple realized  they were not going to get to the hospital on time. Keating Sherry, her husband, put the vehicle on  autopilot, set the navigation system to the hospital 20 minutes away. It's a good thing he  paid that 10 grand for the autopilot. He said he laid one hand gently on the car's steering wheel  as he attended to his wife. She was squeezing my hand to the point where I thought she was going to  shatter it. I was saying, Yiran, that's his wife, okay, focus on your breathing. The decision over  whether to try to wait to give birth until they reach the hospital was an agonizing one.  Because traffic was stopped, they said, she said, should I push? Should I hold? Should I push? Should  I hold? Oh, F it. Let's do this. According to People Magazine, she gave birth to her daughter  in the self-driving vehicle as they arrived to the hospital, whispering,  this is, this might be the motto of all of 2021. Oh my God Keating, she's out. Oh boy.

Transcript:  Congratulations to Elon, but if this were just a regular car, we wouldn't be celebrating that  regular car. People would have just pulled over and handled business with, because they didn't  have autopilot and this wouldn't have been a news story, but... That's true. They would have just

Transcript:  Actually, you can go right ahead. I did tell the story on the last twit and I'm embarrassed,  but of the air purifier I ran all year thinking there wasn't a molecule. It was another one was  a HEPA. I have a molecule in the bedrooms, but I wanted a HEPA in the grand room just to kind of  recycle the air, right? It's because people come over and stuff and it was a big one. It was  supposed to be a thousand square feet or something. It was some huge, so like do the whole room. It  was very expensive, but I bought it. What do you call it? Not used, refurbished.  Saved some money. Came from Amazon. Set it up. We've been running it all year.  Oh, they call it renewed. Renewed. You didn't hear this story? So the light comes on last week  saying it's time for a new filter. It's been a year. I said, oh, that's great. So I ordered  filters on Amazon. They come, I open it up. I wonder where the filters go on this. There  didn't seem to be any apparent place to, you know, old filters to take out. So I  looked at the video online. There were no filters that come without filters. I guess I was serious  for a year. This is a fan. It was a very, very expensive fan. Oh God. Anyway, it's working now.  Thank God we had the molecules. That was, so one of the points of controversy this week,  we talked about in all the shows was that Elon Musk was the man, time of the year,  person of the year, time person of the year. And I, of course always, and everybody does have to  point out, well, Hitler was person of the year once too. So, you know, it doesn't have to be a  good person, just a person. And certainly you could say, you got a lot of attention, but it  was my contention that the real heroes of 2021 were the vaccine scientists, particularly the  mRNA scientists. And it turns out time did acknowledge them as like scientists of the  year. So good. Yeah. But I think that was another thing. And now here's an interesting  point. And this actually was brought home to me when I was talking to Andy Weir, the author of  The Martian. We were talking about his new book, which is excellent by the way. Oh yes. You have,  do you read it? Hail Mary. Hail Mary. Yes. It's great. They're making a movie out of it.  Oh, nice. Yeah. In fact, we tried to get Andy Weir on our speculative thing on the 9th,  but he's having a baby. He just had a baby. Congratulations, Andy. And he's like deep in  production on this movie with, I'm a little disappointed to say Ryan Gosling is the lead.  Okay. You know, you know, Andy said this in the interview and I'm going, Oh, that's nice.  Oh, okay. But The Martian was so good, right? And it was such a great movie. So I'm sure this,  it's the same, it's going to be, you know, the same quality and same writer. So anyway,  Andy Weir, I was talking about the year and so forth and he said, you know what,  you're going to, we're going to look back about 2021 and say, wow, is mRNA vaccines. This is a huge,  huge breakthrough. The ability to use computers to do a genomic analysis. By the way, they were able  to do that back in, I think it was November, December, a year ago, using a computer in a  weekend to generate the whole genome. And then again, using computers, generate a vaccine that  would target that genome. They were in a, in a matter of a week or two, able to create a vaccine.  Now, of course, what took so long was testing because we, rightly so, we want to make sure it's  safe and effective. So that took almost, you know, that took a long time, but they were able to  generate that actually was, they did that back in 2020, almost immediately after the pandemic bit  broke out. They were able to do that. And then they tested it all year. The vaccine came out at  the end of last year, but I think this is officially the year of the mRNA vaccine. And Andy said,  you're going to see vaccines for a huge number of diseases we've thought intractable, including  possibly cancer, thanks to this breakthrough technology. So, you know, we may talk about  supply chain and the latest, you know, chip from Apple, but really it could very well be that  mRNA vaccine, that breakthrough, which by the way, did not happen overnight. Scientists,  particularly one scientist I've been working on it 10 years, laughed at, mocked,  underfunded, but she persisted and thank goodness she was there when COVID-19 showed up.  No doubt. Yeah. All right. We can leave the COVID, unless we want to talk about supply chain at all.  That is not easing up and that is going to be with us next year too.

You use Google Analytics. We just want to see how many people see the site and which parts of the  site are popular. I don't think that that's an invasive thing. But of course, I guess Google  gets the IP address. So maybe it is. Anyway, so we said we have to do a cookie.

And we duplicated that which is basically, look, every site uses cookies, get over it.  And we do too click here. And, and, and nobody's complained about it. Tech has been doing it for a  while. But it's not because we don't, we're not spying on you. We're not trying to collect  information. So the what is the weirdest supply chain shortage? Chips are obvious, you know, no  car seat heaters and GM vehicles. It's been hard to get, you know, what the really bad one has been  the Microsoft's Xbox Series X and to a lesser degree PlayStation. I was going to say PlayStation,

Transcript:  Yeah, sure. And that you can get it. But Microsoft says, we had Chris Capicella on last year,  the CMO of Microsoft. And he said last year, he said, this is going to go on for a while. We don't,  we don't want to give people a chance to order something if we can't deliver it  in any time frame. And this is where Apple really shines. They, they, I mean, if you order a MacBook  Pro 16 inch right now, you won't get it till Valentine's Day, but at least they give you a  date. Microsoft, I said, why don't you do that? And they said, Chris said, we can't because we  just don't know. Is it because Apple pretty much runs the whole stack themselves? Well, they,  they lock it in, they lock it in. So the weirdest supply chain, in my opinion, a shortage is cream  cheese. What? Did you not notice? Cheesecake for you. You cannot get cream cheese to save your life.  Yeah, I didn't notice. Maybe that's because I ate a lot of bagels. I have to have cream cheese.

And then if you want to get an artificial tree to replace it with, because they're made of plastic  and everything, those are up as like 25% over last year because of shortages.

Transcript:  just work it. What's going on here? Actually, I do want to talk about a brand new sponsor. I am,  do any of you use BlueLand? No, I'm Smitten by the way.  I'm Smitten. So we look at, you know, the number one, and far as I'm concerned,  number one environmental thing everybody needs to address is plastic. Single use plastic. It's,  it's a problem. You know, we talk about clean up the oceans. Remember the YouTube stars raising  millions of dollars to clean up the ocean. The amount of plastic they removed for all that money  from the ocean was replaced in 15 hours by more waste. 15 hours. The solution is not to clean up  the ocean. Well, certainly we want to do that, but let's also use a little less plastic in our lives.  An estimated 5 billion plastic hand soap and cleaning bottles are thrown away every year.  I mean, that's just, it's a waste of, of, of natural resources, a waste of landfill. This is  a forever bottle from BlueLand and I like it. So I've, I've actually done it kind of the wrong  way around. I have some other bottles. This is, these are cleaner bottles. It actually says on it  what this is. So this is the glass and mirrors is like to, you know, if you're a glass cleaner,  they have a hand soap bottle. They are famous for their toilet cleaning pellets. We actually  got the clean essentials kit, so it has everything in there. And then there's, you also get a little  tin to put your laundry pellets in. It's great laundry soap. So instead of the plastic dissolvable  laundry soap or the big plastic gallon bottles of laundry detergent, you just throw this tablet in  and the waste is so much lower and it works. Now I have to tell you, Blue's, BlueLand's toilet  tablet cleaner is so popular that it sells out. So they have some right now, but that's a supply  chain shortage, I guess, mainly because people love it. You just put it in the toilet, you let it  fizz, bubble, you clean the toilet, you're done. It's really easy. I'm going to show you how this  works. So this is the, I, I normally what you do is you put the tablet in and then you add water,  but I'm going to do it the other way around because I don't want to get up. This is the bathroom cleaner.  So you spritz this, you know, I've got a multi-surface cleaner. These are the little tablets. And of course,  they don't send you more bottles. By the way, when you buy a bottle of cleaner, not only the plastic,  most of the cost is about, they're about 90% water and then just a little bit of active ingredient.  Right. So they're shipping you water, which you have in plentitude at home. So save the planet.  This is the hand soap, by the way, that'll go in here. So put water in here, put a tablet in there.  It foams up. It's, it's, it's as good as anything. It's great. Here's the glass and mirror cleaner.  So I'm going to put the tablet in here. This is the little, the little blue land pellet. This is all  the active ingredients you'd get with any commercial cleaner, but, but, but it's, they don't ship the  water. They just ship the tablet. Let me do this on camera. So, oh yeah, good. Okay. There you go.  I'm going to drop it in. I'm going to close it up. It's going to foam for a little bit. You let it sit.  And now I have bathroom cleaner, spritzer, surface cleaner. It's just great. This stuff really works.  You buy the bottle once, they call them there forever bottles. You refill it forever. No more  plastic waste. The only thing you got to get rid of is your outdated idea that eco-friendly products  are more expensive and less effective. These work, I can vouch for it, better than some of the products  I'm using. Better. Stop wasting water, throwing out more plastic. Get Blue Land's revolutionary  refill cleaning system instead. Blue Land was founded on the belief that a cleaner planet starts  by eliminating plastic waste while creating powerful, effective cleaners for your entire  home. The dish soap is fantastic. The laundry detergent is fantastic. The toilet cleaner is  fantastic. Just fill Blue Land's beautiful Instagrammable bottles with warm water,  pop in one of the hand soap or spray cleaner tablets within a minute. Powerful cleaning products.  And by the way, they smell a lot better than the smitten candle. Iris agave, paring lemon,  lavender eucalyptus. Oh, that one, that smells good. I don't know what that is. I think it's  the eucalyptus from their best-selling clean essentials kit. That's what we got.  But once you get it, then you just buy the refills to their hand soap duo and plastic-free,  plastic-free laundry and dishwasher tablets. Blue Land has something for every inch of your home.  And as I said, backed by very popular demand, Debbie loves these, by the way. She's been using  them for months. The Blue Land toilet tablet cleaner. Get it before it sells out again.  The high-quality Forever bottles. Some of them are glass like this because of the weight. The  foaming hand soap is glass, so it's heavy. So it sits on your counter. Some of them are plastic  because you're going to carry them around and use them. They start at just $10 when you buy a kit.  They are reused forever, but you can get more, I guess. Even if they lasted a year or two,  you're saving hundreds of bottles from going into the landfill. And then the tablets, get this,  start at just $2. So you're going to save money and this stuff works really well.  Basically, it's the same ingredients. It's just they don't ship them all dissolved,  pre-dissolved for you. You'll love it. Your planet will thank you. Finally, you can do something  without giving, without sacrifice. It's way past time to make cleaning fun, beautiful,  and plastic-free. Right now, you can get 20% off your first order. Go to blueland.com slash twit.  That's 20% off your first order of any Blue Land products. Blueland.com slash twit. They actually  really look nice, too, the Blue Land bottles. And because they're labeled and everything,  they just, I just, it's nice. Now this is still dissolving. By the end of the show,  I will be able to wipe up the smitten candle residue.  Thank you, Blue Land. We're really glad to get Blue Land on.  Sweet. Yeah, it's a really good product. And very happy to have them on our holiday special.  We are celebrating, and I mean celebrating, the end of 2021, the year that would not end.

Transcript:  Holy cow. So the cream cheese shortage is also because in October, Schreiber Foods,  which is in Wisconsin, had to shut down during its busy peak period right before Thanksgiving,  Hanukkah, and Christmas, making cream cheese because of ransomware. They have annual sales  of cream cheese of $5 billion. Wow. Wow. Goodness. So it may say Philly on the front,  but a Schreiber out the back, I guess. The company also makes cheese slices, yogurt.  Every cream cheese producer was already struggling to keep up adequate supply. So there is,  you know, it's partly supply chain, but this does not help. Certainly 2021. And I think this is  going to be, you're going to always say the same thing in the year, 2022 was the year ransomware  got worse.

And I think your grandmother, I mean, for a lot of the women, it's like, well, wait a minute, that's  a number from Dubai, not Boston. But what happened was they slowly improved their attack. They bought  a web domain, harvardcareers.com, put the Harvard logo on it. It got more and more sophisticated.  They got Harvard letterhead. They got the names of deans and they pretended to be the deans when  they called. And they actually tricked one of India's best known news broadcasters.

But, but the problem is they were  targeted all in every, every case, the journalists were anti-Modi anti-nationalist reporters. They had  written critical stories about the government. So no one knows, you know, they gave them passports  and all sorts of details, but none of that stuff was ever used. So no one knows. But the suspicion  is that this is maybe the government or, or sophisticated. It's something like that where  they're, yeah, it is sophisticated and they're, and they're, you know, they're trying to get these  people out of the country to shut them up. Yeah, there's that a little criticism to Harvard for  not doing anything about it, even though they had been warned about it. Just a, just a tragic  story, but it just shows, you know, look, these scams have always happened, but the internet  makes it's, you know, a lot easier, right? Okay.

They haven't said whether they  knew about harvardcareer.com or did anything about it. One of the early victims of the scam called  Harvard and alerted them to this scam, but apparently they did nothing to note to let people  know they didn't look for other victims. So I don't know how much of it is Harvard's fault.

Transcript:  grandma. Yeah. And I mean, so one of my grandma's friends, she was using that kind of as a, as a  comparison, uh, unfortunately was taken by a scam and she, um, was kind of talking to, uh, the friend  because I've always been this way with my grandma, very encouraging of the fact that  if something like this happens, you should not take that time to, to blame yourself. Like it's,  it is easy and you do fall into that pattern of like, ah, how did I fall for that? And her friend  was feeling that same way. And you know, my grandma was talking to her. She's like, what,  what my grandson talks about is how technology should work in our favor and should have all of  these things in place. And so when those kinds of things happen, it's the technology that's at  fault and the person who was doing this to you, who's at fault. It's not your, you know, it's,  it's not something that you should spend the time just, you know, beating yourself up over,  oh, I should have picked that up. I should have picked this up. It's hard to realize those things.  It's hard to pick up on that. And it does, it kills me, you know, for people to be blaming  themselves and feeling so kind of lost after that happens, given the fact that there are any  number of people who could have fallen for that. It's not something that's just so simple to pick  out. So yeah, I just encourage people, don't, don't beat yourself up too much because in those  situations, someone is trying very hard and playing on all of the right psychological things  to get you to do the thing that they want you to do. They've figured it out. They've, they've

Transcript:  cracked the code. That's, that's one thing that, that kind of comes to mind when I'm,  when I'm hearing you talk about this, Micah, is that like, there has never been, it feels,  and maybe it feels this way because we're in the midst of it right now, but when we're talking  about ransomware, we're talking about hacks, we're talking about all of these different  aspects of security online. It feels now more than ever that there is, that the attackers are far  ahead of the people who are protecting and, and, and trying to, you know, lock the doors before  they get in. It seems like the people who are, who are hacking or doing the ransomware attacks,  they know so much more than I think those threat actors in the past seem to know.  There's some distance now between, between the people who would stop this from happening and the  people who are just like, you know what, it's easier than ever. The stakes are as high as they've  ever been. Like it's, it's overwhelming. So of course someone shouldn't blame themselves

And of course, when they went to open that spreadsheet, it was a problem, you know, but at  the same time, we can't fault this person that they were just doing their job.

Transcript:  sadly some mess happened. And you know, somewhat of the blame goes to companies like  Google and Microsoft because their software has been so horrifically bad. I can't remember what  the last count, uh, we'll have to do Italian security now next year, uh, on, on zero day  flaws in Google's Chrome, but it was more than 13 in a year, more than one a month,  more than one a month. And, uh, Microsoft's 2021, you know, I, I'm sure Microsoft really,  really wanted to, uh, to be able to say, Hey, you know, we've really locked down our operating  system, but routinely on patch Tuesdays, there's more than a hundred flaws being fixed  every, every Tuesday. And that doesn't even bring up the big ones, which, which are the exchange  server vulnerabilities, uh, you know, the solar winds flaw. Uh, there's some, there've been some  really nasty ones on June 8th, Microsoft patched zero six, zero days, six of them. Wow. Then there  was the print spooler vulnerability, print nightmare. The kid, yeah. Micah has to listen  to security now. He produces a show. So, you know, he was nothing but every week. Oh,  and there's another one. Oh, here's another one. Where's another one.

Transcript:  Just don't, uh, that would be a bad idea.  Best tech support ever. I, it's one of those things where, you know, I've always said,  okay, fine. If Microsoft fixing flaws from older software, that software has problems and fixes  them. You should fix them when you find them. That's fine. But if they're fixing problems  introduced newly, then you need to really look at your process and see what you're doing that you  keep making these same mistakes over and over and over again. Of course we're, you can't even  really say we're looking back at 2021 when we talk about the worst flaw of 2021, which is probably  the worst security flaw of all time. We were just starting to see the fallout of the log for Jay  problem. This is a Java based logger that's used on pretty much every server, everywhere.  Apple uses it. Microsoft uses it's from the Apache foundation. Uh, every Amazon uses it.  Everybody uses it. And it is not merely, um, a bad zero day. It's, it's, it's trivial to exploit.  So I could do it, which is not saying, I mean, if I, anybody could do it, uh, it's just putting a  little string in your browser and suddenly you have full access to whatever is behind the wall  on that server. That's horrific. And the problem is, oh, it'll be patched. Probably, uh, you know,  the people who do it, it's an open source project. Volunteers do it. They worked very hard over  Thanksgiving weekend to fix it. By the way, there've been three now and there'll probably be more  because they keep finding more problems with it, but they keep fixing them. But sorry,

Uh, in any event, um, uh, even if they fix it, we don't know how many systems have  been compromised. And we may never know because these guys are going in there and a lot of them  are nation states.

Uh, and you're going to talk about this  is one of your story picks, so I won't, I won't, uh, give away all the story, but, but the good news  is we got them. I think we got them. So they finally did something so horrific, such a horrific  infrastructure attack that the FBI, uh, police from all over the world, we, they tracked them down and  I think they've shut them down forever, uh, and arrested a number of affiliates and maybe even  one of the, one of the guys behind Reval. Uh, Reval was ransomware as a service,  which is another modern concept. Uh, these guys set up a website where you could go and say, yeah,  I would like to, uh, I would like to buy some ransomware, please. I'll give you 10% of what I  make. And then, so they don't have to know anything about ransomware attacks. They just have to get in,  put it on the system. They collect the money, they pay Reval their 10% and they move on. And  so there were many, many affiliates, uh, doing this. So it's not just cream cheese anymore.

It's a good question. And then, uh, Richard Branson, uh, said, no, I'm going to go up in mine  first in Virgin Galactic. And then, uh, Elon, he kind of trolled them saying I'm not going up at all.  I'm just sending people to the space station and the moon. He says, I got bigger fish,  bigger fish to fry. Yeah. That'll show you. Then William Shatner went up, which I think was a  very smooth PR move. Cause, cause cabin curlew is in tears. F you know, he was like so moved.

I like Adam a lot.  And he had Shatner on, um, after his, his, you know, space ride and whatnot.  And the way Shatner talked about it in, in, in that interview, it was just unbelievable. Cause  before, you know, leading up to that, they were just having general conversation. He has this  specific tone and he's, he's a big ham, you know, he's, he's an actor, you know, but when he started  to talk about that experience and just how moving it was and just how, you know, he started to,  to reconsider, you know, what really matters in life. And it was, it was quite, it was quite  moving. If you can, I highly recommend the, I'll look that up and listen to it. It was really,

Transcript:  time before we die in a horrible heat fire. Thank you very much. It was Wally Funk. I think I read  that the amount of pollution put into the atmosphere by that rocket is like the equivalent of all of  Jeff Bezos' private jet flights for a year. I think it's something on that order. Wow, interesting.  That was one of the trolling tweets that Elon Musk said is, you know, our rockets do not pollute  in the same, to nearly the same degree. It's possible to do this with considerably less  pollution. I'm not an expert on that. I've talked about with Rod Pyle on the radio show. I have to  let's see. Oh, okay. Fact check. Thank you. According to USA Today, Jeff Bezos' new  Shepard rocket launch did not, oh, behind a firewall, behind a paywall. Darn it. Did not  something. The year of the paywall. Did not emit carbon. Okay. Okay. So there you go. What did it emit?  We don't know. I had seen this Facebook post that said it put hundreds of tons of carbon dioxide.  That is actually USA Today said it did not. Sorry, Leo, did you say a Facebook post? Yeah.  Yeah, nevermind. I forgot I saw that on Facebook. SpaceX's Falcon rockets use kerosene.  In fact, the Blue Origin uses a liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen combination, Blue Engine 3,  that is not, does not emit carbon dioxide in the atmosphere or during the launch.

Jassy, a close lieutenant who had run the very, very profitable Amazon  Web Services division. And as far as I know, it's been good. One of the first things that happened  when Jassy took the helm is Amazon announced it was going to raise the minimum wage. They did a  number of things that were a little bit, I think probably more kinder to the warehouse staff.  But I haven't seen any big changes in Amazon. It's certainly been very profitable. Well,

While the name change itself is maybe a non-story, the idea that it's  changed its name for the metaverse or that it changed its name to try to get away from all of  the stuff that Facebook had to deal with this year. That part is a big story. I mean, the  Facebook papers and testifying before Congress. Huge story. All sorts of stuff going on there.

I think the quote that I'll remember  is Facebook values profits over people, which is not a good thing for a company that really  pretends that it's all about connecting people. Connecting people at people's expense is Facebook's  deal. And we'll take that. Thank you very much.  I think that we might have said at the beginning of the year that the tech  lash was going to be a big story. Congress, the FTC, the EU all investigating some fairly hefty  fines coming out of the EU now to some of the big tech companies. But I also think we're starting  to see that that was a lot of sound and fury, but I don't know if much is going to happen.  No.  What do you guys think?

But each time it  happens, there seems to be no resolution. There seems to be no there, there. It all seems to be  kind of staged for show. And so if there is change that is going to come about from regulation and  these folks going to DC and having to testify on the behalf of their companies,  we certainly haven't seen it yet. There haven't been many clues this year.  Let's just say that make me feel very positive about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and that's an interesting point because it's certain, I think it's almost certain that  Congress will do nothing, not just because of lobbyists, but let's not forget that politicians  love to advertise on Facebook. You know, at the same time as they're critical of Facebook,  they benefit from all this data collection. They use it. So I think they're maybe somewhat less  likely to try to shut it down. I think they're going to make a lot of noise. I doubt much will  happen. Now, on the other hand, the FTC and Lena Kahn, the new chairman of the FTC,  has more teeth and is more aggressive than I can remember the FTC being even back in the bad era  for Microsoft at the late nineties when they got in trouble with the DOJ. I feel like Lena Kahn,  in fact, Google asked a court to force her to recuse herself because she'd written such anti-Google  and anti-big tech pieces as a professor. The courts, by the way, rejected that. She is very  much going after big tech. Now, can the FTC make a difference? Can they do something without the  support of Congress? And, you know, my suspicion is that the current administration doesn't have  a lot of teeth because of a split Congress or split Senate. I just wonder how much she's going  to get done. But she's it's pretty clear she's going to try. And it's also clear Google is very

Transcript:  afraid. There was something you mentioned on the tech guy that stuck with me, though, that makes me  think that there will be regulations that take place, but they are championed by those big tech  companies because of how they snuff out smaller tech companies who can't hold on to those regulations  that are needed. What was that that you meant? There's a term for it. Regulatory cap capture is

Start time: 4466.42
End time: 4534.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the term that Jeff Jarvis always uses. But you know this is going on because I don't know maybe  I watch a lot of football and there's on every NFL game there's at least one or two Facebook or  sorry meta ads featuring often meta content. I don't know, overseers, you know, kind of people  on the ground who are managing the content on Facebook who say we need a law. Congress ought  to pass a law. We can't do it alone. And it sounds like Facebook's on the side of the angels  saying yeah yeah yeah we ought to be regulate us regulate us. But really it's important to  understand that any regulation Congress comes up with Facebook will be well positioned as big as  they are as rich as they are as powerful as they are to handle but will also have the very strong  effect of stifling any competition because nobody coming up will have the resources to deal with  these requirements. So it's pretty obvious when Facebook's lobbying Congress to pass a law  regulating tech that it is somehow for their benefit and I think that's how it's called

Had they put all the same if you know the the business term has put all that wood behind a  single arrow. Had they put all the energy that they put in all these different things including  April Fool's jokes into dominating the world they might have done it. Google Plus was great but they  just couldn't keep pay attention. Meanwhile Facebook laser like right. Yeah they know what  they want they go get it. Yeah at all costs. Yeah and I don't think I don't think they're  at all thrown by what Congress is throwing out and maybe the metaverse is going to be a distraction.  Let's take a break. That's the next topic of conversation. The metaverse. Here it comes or  does it or is it just second city redux. I don't know. Our show today brought to you by Noom. I  want to talk about Noom a little bit another great product that we use. I started doing it early this  year because of the covid 19 actually is more like 20 for me. Lisa said I'm going to do this to support  you and now she's surpassed me. She loves Noom. She didn't have as much to lose but she's always  had trouble with that last few pounds and I'm sure a lot of people like me who if I see food I got to  stuff it in my mouth. I just kind of complete unconscious eater and I think there are people  like Lisa who is very you know careful and smart about what she eats but was just having trouble  with that last few pounds and Noom work for us both because I'm going to say this I don't know  if this is their motto but because I don't it's not a diet. Noom is education. Noom is teaching  you better habits for better long-term results. You're in it for the long haul and I just love it.  I mean I've been on every diet ever. I've done them all and you know that and I've talked about  them before. I don't know if I want to live on kale for the rest of my life. Noom doesn't make  that distinction. I'll never forget when I first started on Noom I had to have a hot dog. I had a  hot dog and I wrote to my coach. You get a personal coach. Tia is my coach. Hi Tia. I wrote to my coach  and said I had a hot dog. She said what's wrong with that? There's nothing wrong with that. Did  you log it? Yeah. That's great. In fact Noom because you get lessons it's about 10 minutes a day of  lessons, food logging. It's very simple, very easy to do. Every once in a while they surprise you.  They say time for some fun. Take a day off. I've never had a diet do that. It's awesome. Instead  of making you feel guilt, regret, feeling bad about yourself, feeling thwarted, Noom empowers you  to keep going. If there's a single secret to Noom that's it. There aren't strict rules. Noom gives  you knowledge so that you understand what you're doing. You understand I'm a fog eater. I come home,  I stuff my mouth. I don't even think about what I'm eating. I don't even taste it. One of the things,  a great lesson we did with Noom, Lisa and I both still do this. We love it. Is we turn off the TV.  We put away the phones. We put away any distractions and we take one bite, put down our forks and  really taste the food. I can't tell you what a difference that makes. It all comes from Noom.  They use a cognitive behavioral approach. You focus on the why instead of the what to change  your relationship with eating. That's it. Your relationship with food has changed.  It's important too. Everybody's journey is different. Nobody's perfect. Noom is not about  perfection. It's just about progress. It's about eliminating the pressure, eliminating the good,  the bad, fitting yourself to other people's expectations, having the feeling that I can't  do it. Then with Noom, you find things that work for you and you go, this is it. I can do it.  No one wants to be on a strict diet, do two a days at the gym, drink these weird teas. No one wants  to do that and that's not Noom. Instead of trying to cram your life into somebody else's idea of  health, try Noom. It's a tested psychology-based approach to find a healthier balance that's  moldable to your life. It really works. 75% of Noom users finish the program. They go all the way  through. By the way, even when you're finished, it stays with you. It's always in your head now.  More than 60% of users who really engage with the program keep the weight off for at least a year.  I just look at Lisa and I just go, wow, it's amazing. She never thought she'd get that last  couple of pounds. You don't need rules to lose weight, just the knowledge and wisdom to empower  you to build a smarter, more sustainable habit around food. Noom weight's cognitive behavioral  approach lets you better understand your relationship with food, how to be more  mindful of your habits, gives you the knowledge and support you need for a long lasting change.  It's what you want, trust me. This is what you want. With Noom, taking care of your health is  empowering, not stress inducing. Because you know what happens when you get stressed? You eat.  That's why diets don't work. You say, you can't eat that. What are you going to do? I got to eat  that. Not with Noom. No need to fear ruining the whole program with one off day. Noom keeps you  on track and gets you back on track. All you need is a daily 10 minute check in, no grueling,  early mornings, huge chunks out of your day, no fasting, nothing hard. It's easy. Start building  better habits for healthier long term results. Sign up for your trial right now. Noom is  noom.com. I know you've seen the ads and I had seen them, actually Lisa and I had seen them many,  many times when we finally decided to do it. I thought, you know, maybe this is right.  And I'm so glad we did. Noom.com.com. Sign up for a trial. It really, really works. My health's  better. All my numbers are better. My doctor says, what are you doing? I said, Noom. He's happy too,  which is good. Thank you Noom for your support. It's a sci-fi trope. You put on the headset or  you jack in the back of your head. You're suddenly in the metaverse, a world that is, and by the way,  I have to point out in every single science fiction novel, whether it's Snow Crash or Cyberpunk,  or Ready Player One, and every single one of them, when you're jacking in, it's because the real world  is so awful, so dystopian that you don't want to be in it. Right? Is that our future, sir? This world

Transcript:  Yeah, I dig the VR stuff, but I think the way your future guest host, Mr. Daniel Suarez, put it  in his franchise, the demon franchise, I think that is something that's way more useful. And that  was just the wear and advisors that gave you more of a, not VR. What is it? AR. It was augmented  reality. Yes. I loved his vision of AR. You're right. I think that's the way to go because  you're not totally jacked in to something, but you are out in the real world and you're able to  see different things in the meta space that may be useful for you out there. Now, granted, there  are some security implications with that because I don't want to look at strange person coming down  the street and see their credit history and things like that, but it would be nice that if someone  walks up to me and say, Hey, are you Ant from Twit? I could look at him and make sure they're not some

They're walking around and you can see  people's reputation score floating around their head, but you're still in the real world. You're  still in the real world. Additional information that's mixed reality or augmented reality. That's  what apparently they say Apple's working on. Microsoft has the hollow lens, which is kind of  a not very satisfactory experience of the same thing. I just don't like the idea, especially in

Transcript:  this time that we're in with the pandemic and people having to be locked in. I don't like the  idea of just giving more of a reason to stay locked in and isolated from people. Even if you're  in your, in your house, you're now isolating yourself from people within your house because  you're in this virtual environment kind of thing. I got boys that like to play on their phones or  play video games or what have you. And every now and then I have to tell them, put it down.  I don't care if you ain't got nothing to say to me, you need to come out of that room and get some  air and be around other people. I think it's better for the psyche. I don't get the feeling that

Transcript:  Because he wants you to be transported to a whole different world where he's got control of the  advertisements there too. But I mean, genuinely that's what it is. And what's fascinating about  all of this, I feel, is the psychology behind it. Because there is, you know, what Ant's talking  about, there is a lot to suggest that human physical touch is something that psychologically  we need. And those interactions, in particular the physical touch interactions, are starved in VR.  However, our brains are not very good at the base level of differentiating between real and imagined.  And there are a lot of really interesting studies surrounding that that I won't go into.  But the point is, you can be taken away to another world where you are communicating with other people  and outside of human physical touch, which I do think is very important, you can have those same  interactions, experiences, and the psychological benefit of being around other people in this  virtual space if your brain is capable of... If your brain, you know, sort of falls into that and  you kind of get taken out of yourself. So I agree that there are the pros and cons of people maybe  having an issue where they do get so sucked into it because it is like real life in some ways and  will continue to get better. And I'm certainly more of a proponent of AR over VR myself as well.

End time: 5361.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  there. Imagine, you know, a few years hence... There's an embodiment there that you feel in that  scenario. Hearing what you were saying and as far as kind of like the disconnectedness and needing  like reality and real touch, especially in, like you said it as well, Micah, in the last couple of  years where we've been so locked down, I would pose the counterpoint to that, which was that  during the true lockdown where like no one was going anywhere, like things have eased up now,  but when things were really locked down and we were starved for like getting out and doing something,  I was thanking my lucky stars that we had a couple of headsets here because me and my girls could  throw on the headsets and we could go to a virtual bowling alley together and it was like we were  bowling together, you know? I just happened to be up in this room and my other daughter was in our  living room and the other daughter was in the den, but we were all in the same place together and it  really, it really was like we were in a place hanging out together. It was so much fun. But  that's the difference though. It was exactly what we needed when we couldn't have it. But that's the

Start time: 5362.20
End time: 5389.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  difference. You actually came together and said, hey, let's put the headsets on and then when it  was done, you took them off and y'all came back together. No question. Yeah. Right. Yes. I'm an  introvert. I love just chilling by myself, but I do have to make sure I spend time with the family  and you know, cause it's healthy, you know, it's the right thing to do.

End time: 5430.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  controller mechanism is way different, right? It's not nearly as intuitive as it is on the,  on the Quest and Quest 2, but then I prefer the Quest 2 just because it's a higher resolutions.  Just it's maybe a little less comfortable, but yeah, they're both pretty similar in my opinion.

Transcript:  So I got to be a part of Horizon Worlds while it was still in invite only stage and try that out,  which is Facebook's like first take on the metaverse. And it was a really fascinating  experience building my own little world, but then also going to this shared space, there was a VC  over in the corner talking with somebody else about investments that he just made. It was like,  I'm staying very far away from that. That sounds really boring, but there was a, there was a,  sounds like clubhouse, right? There's a young person going around saying hi to everybody,  but then a Facebook person, like community, you know, guru or whatever came into the space  and she was walking around and was telling people about some different kind of hidden  Easter eggs. And so you saw all of these people kind of having this delightful moment of learning  new ways to interact and make sparkles appear above your head and all sorts of stuff. And I  was kind of listening in a little bit from a distance while I was playing with a paper airplane  game, standing atop and kind of looking down on this whole group of people. And I was able to do  this all from my real party. It was, it was, it was really like a real party. It was around  Halloween too. So this one world would take you to different worlds that people built where there  were Halloween themed things. So there was like a haunted house and some games where you tried to  get rid of ghosts and different people could play. And there was a huge scoreboard in the background  where everybody could see their score and compete against one another. And I didn't have to move  from a spot, which was a pretty cool thing to be able to do again while you're in lockdown. So  I do see some value to this. I think the big thing is adoption and whether or not that is

Start time: 5529.82
End time: 5561.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  going to take place. I'm actually not worried about adoption because I look at how people have  taken a VR and they really love it. I mean, there's a certain percentage of people who  will always be nauseated by it. I think I'm in that group, but I struggle with the latency for  the, yeah, maybe it, maybe it'll get better and it won't be an issue. What you just described  sounds pretty cool, Mike. I guess the question is, do we have to be in meet space to relate to one  another or can we really have a genuine experience with one another in a virtual space? Do you think

Start time: 5561.96
End time: 5660.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we can? Right. I think that there's, so I'll tell you, I think two things. One, this is still in the  way that it's working now is relatively new. And so there will be a number of studies that go out,  but the studies that we have seen, I think in psychology today, even there was a piece about  people going through therapy and the empathy that can take place in a virtual space. But I will say,  I joined Horizon Worlds and I've got this issue of everywhere I play, everywhere I create an online  persona, I always use my name at Micah Sargent on everything. And in Horizon Worlds, after I'd  already created my character, my avatar, whatever, I thought, oh man, I feel kind of bare and open to  the world. I kind of wish I would have just come up with a different username as I'm walking around  and my name's above my head. And that was a weird experience for me because I'm on camera a lot of  the time. I talk to people, talk in front of people. And so to feel enough exposed in this virtual space  was kind of an interesting thing that I was not expecting to feel. And it kind of changed how I  interacted with it. I had to get comfortable turning off my mute switch for the microphone  and start to participate in the conversations that were taking place around me. So yeah, I do think  that we can, I want to go with the word supplement. I don't want to go with replace, but supplement  some of those interactions we have elsewhere. Because we're trying to do that now just in  text based and in video conversations. And so the closer we can get to the real thing, the more our  brains can sort of give way with that suspension of disbelief. And I think the more than it will

Transcript:  work. I definitely agree with supplementing it because I think about every dag gum Wednesday at  about 2 to 30 p.m. Pacific time when I get to sit down virtually with you and Mrs. Higginbotham  and Mr. Jarvis and just how much that means to me. The conversations we have every week, yes,  I'm working, but it is I freaking love just sitting with you folks for those two hours.  And I think that's something that most people would enjoy if they had that type of connection  with people. They can't necessarily go out and hang out at the bar or anything like that. But  if you can fire up decent audio and decent camera and be able to see each other and just have some  meaningful conversation, that goes a long way in supplementing just the regular in-person experience

Start time: 5712.00
End time: 5779.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  in my opinion. I mean, John just pointed out we are actually in the metaphors, the four of us.  We're not connected, we're not in the same room, we're not in meat space. And people who are watching us, I think  at this point probably feel like they're around the table with us conversing. Here's the thing I  really don't want to have happen. I think there's a lot of potential in that. It'll be very exciting.  And I think that the things that have been most exciting about technology have been things have  been created by individual creators working in garages, working independently. I really don't  want Mark Zuckerberg's vision of what this is to become the dominant vision. That is not ground up.  That is from top down. I think Mark's a creep and I don't think his vision of what the metaverse is,  I mean, I find his ideas creepy. I don't want him to, but is this technologically so hard that it  isn't going to happen kind of naturally as the internet happened? It's going to happen  only from a big corporation? If you ask Intel, Intel will tell you that there's no way we're

Start time: 5779.68
End time: 5809.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  going to get this in the next five, 10 years. There was a blog post by an Intel exec who,  or a research scientist who said, look, this is going to take a thousand times the compute power  we have right now. Unfortunately, the blog post ended up kind of being an advertisement because  at the end they're like, but we can do things like machine learning and artificial intelligence,  which Intel chips can do to get us sort of the way there. But the larger argument was that,  yeah, the thing that Facebook is trying to say is coming next year or the year after.

Start time: 5810.36
End time: 5863.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree with you. And if you look at it, it's very cartoony. But let's not forget,  what's the order of magnitude between the first IBM PC running at four megahertz  and today's iPhone running, we've got billions of transistors in our pockets  running at many gigahertz. That's more than a thousand. So I don't think saying, oh,  a thousand times more power is really a deterrent. You're right. It's not going to happen today.  It's not going to happen tomorrow. Some form of it might, like what we're experiencing right now.  But maybe 10 years from now, maybe 20 years from now, we'll certainly have that capability.  The only question is, I really don't want it to come from a big, I don't want to come top down.  I think it needs to be organically developed. I don't want one company to run it. That would

Start time: 5864.04

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sure they are. I mean, people like Jared Lanier, he's been working on this for 20 years  himself. One of the very first proponents of virtual reality. So I think that there is a  movement that way. I just don't want it to come from, I don't want Mark Zuckerberg to own the  metaverse. That to me is a nightmare scenario. It's worth pointing out that Facebook did actually

Start time: 5891.06
End time: 5903.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  say, or Meta did actually say, we don't want to own the metaverse. But exactly. Then you name  your company Meta. So really, I don't know if I believe that. I'd like to see, I would love to,

Start time: 5903.44

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, look what the internet has done. And I don't think we would have known 20 or 30 years  ago what the internet was going to be today. And it's certainly made a huge difference in our lives  and everything we experience. I think that VR, AR, mixed reality, I think it's all going to be part  of something, is absolutely going to happen. It might take 10, 20 years. But just like 20 years  ago, you saw the beginnings of the internet. I think now we're seeing the beginnings of it.  I just don't, I think the internet succeeded because it was a lot of little people. It eventually  became dominated by a handful of companies to its, I think, to its disadvantage, to its detriment.  But maybe we can do something a little better this time with AR and VR. I'm hoping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a love-hate relationship with NFTs. I totally dig the idea of creative artists being  able to get money for their works another way. But at the same time, it is such a  ripoff in some instances when it comes to minting things and gas fees. And then there's the whole  aspect of people just fricking right-click and downloading whatever digital asset that you have  out there anyway, if it's like an image or what have you, and you totally lose out on that.  But I do like that people want to collect things like, oh, Doctor was saying before,  baseball cards. People wanted to collect baseball cards. And they invested in that. They paid their  however many bucks per package of baseball card. And I like that a creative artist could earn  revenues from that and make a living off of it. But what I don't like is just how difficult and  expensive it could be when you're dealing with gas fees and stuff like that. So you can try  different blockchains, but boy, we are so early in this game. And then you start talking about  wallets to people and they assume you're talking about PayPal. And no, I'm not talking about PayPal.  I'm talking about an actual crypto wallet. Well, how do I create a crypto wallet? Okay,  you go to this website. How can I get money into that crypto wallet? Well, you need to make sure  you convert your USB to something like ether, BTC or do what I'm going. And so I've already lost

Totally NFT-able, right. But I guess anything is really NFT-able. But there is a lot of interest  in this from the creator space, just from the perspective of, hey, great, here's a possible  potential way for us to actually be paid what we feel like we have to work.

Transcript:  One of the things I asked you guys to do before we started the show is to come up with your stories  of the year. I'm curious. Let's start with you, Jason Howell. What was... In your sphere,  and of course, a host all about Android, so I'm going to guess it has something to do with that.  Yeah. In your sphere...  It's shocking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I guess each and every year following Android, I could possibly say the latest version of Android.  But this year, I feel like it was especially important. In the past however many years,  the new major version of Android had felt significant, I suppose, enough for another  number increment or whatever, but still at the onset, looking at it, kind of hard to come up with  like, okay, what's different here? Oh, it's a little bit of this, a little bit of that.  And I felt like Android 12, at least, you could argue whether you like it or not. But at least  this time, Google said, hey, let's make a big change to the US and really get in there and kind  of shake things up a little bit. I just kind of felt like Google had been kind of getting a little,  I don't know, a little sleepy. I don't want to say lazy because they've definitely done  work behind the scenes. But the OS just kind of needed some extra attention.  And I actually like Android 12. I know that at least you, And you've said that you aren't a  huge fan of Android 12. I like the changes that they made with Material U. I really like a lot of  the privacy focused changes, seeing the little chip that tells me when my camera or my microphone  is live, being able to have approximate location information instead of very specific, here's where  you are, you can tell an app, I'm approximately in this large geographic area. A number of other  changes. It's not ground, like record shattering by any stretch, but at least it shows that Google  is still putting some time in to come up with something different and unique. And I appreciated

Start time: 6359.30
End time: 6408.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that. I can't think of another Android version that has been so controversial. On the one hand,  Jelly Bean. Really was Jelly Bean? Yeah, Jelly Bean was the one for tablets though. That was  no, not Jelly Bean, Honeycomb. Honeycomb. Okay, okay. Honeycomb for sure. It was a long time ago.  But I have to say this one, there are people who say it's the, you know, and the pic going,  I have to say to me, Android 12 and the Pixel 6 kind of go together. They do, they do. Because  you can't get anywhere else. But I've seen people say the Pixel 6 and Android 12, that's the phone  of the year, the best phone out there. I've also seen people, and it's not alone by any means,  say this is a nightmare. This is the most buggy version of Android ever. It's a real hit or  miss proposition. I myself have some issues. At first, I was thinking, okay, it's the developers

Start time: 6409.02
End time: 6425.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  with the apps that I like to use. You know, they haven't quite updated. And you know, I get that.  That happens. But then when I started noticing core functionality of the OS just puking on me,  it's not the developers. It's Google and its development team that did a crap-tastic job

Start time: 6425.92
End time: 6459.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of quality assurance testing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There are aspects of the OS that when I've  encountered them kind of make you feel like, okay, maybe this was kind of rushed to hit a timeline or  whatever. But I have no problem with the UI. I feel like you could say that about all of their  releases. That's just kind of how Google works, right? It's like, let's put it out the way we  have it. And then you find out after the fact that it's never perfect. It's literally never  perfect coming from Google. I guess I'm used to it. Yeah. KitKat was okay, right? KitKat was okay.

Start time: 6459.38
End time: 6495.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is such ancient history though, Honeycomb and KitKat. It was so long ago. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,  I wouldn't, of course there have been problems, but I thought Android 11 was pretty reliable.  Android 10 has been pretty good. 12 seems like there's issues and there's some protracted and  long-term issues. And then other people are saying, oh no, man, this is the best thing ever. So I'm  actually very puzzled. I think you could make an argument looking at what we've talked about today  with Microsoft and Google and Apple will get to the Apple that maybe software is just starting to

Start time: 6539.48
End time: 6567.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in the sites in the target zone. When that went down and to hear the story about, you know, it's  just a lack of security on Colonial's behalf. Actually that one was DarkSight. I apologize.  That wasn't Reval. It stung. But at the same time, when that happened, I was on vacation  and gone back to visit my mother in Carolina and all of a sudden we couldn't get any gasoline.

Start time: 6570.28

Transcript:  hoarding gasoline and long lines. Plastic bags, really? I go to get gasoline one day and this was

Start time: 6584.18
End time: 6696.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  like my second day there on vacation. I'm like, why is there a line in the middle of nowhere South  Carolina for this petroleum? Sure enough, man, I picked up my phone and saw the news about the  ransomware and they had to shut down the pipeline because of this and just the whole trickle down  effect. So I spent a lot of my time. I was able to go out and do one shoot, but I spent a lot of  my time just sort of sitting on the couch because I didn't have much gasoline. It just stung. But  then the next story is another ransomware attack with Sinclair Broadcasting. And that one hit close  to home because my mom is a Sinclair employee. Now, granted, she's not going to tell me everything  that went down, but she had her concerns like all the employees there and the people that don't know  about Sinclair, it's a television broadcast network. And when this happened, this happened on the weekend  during football games. So that's when a lot of these networks make most of their money  during football season and the ads during football season. And things just sort of went to crap  that weekend and they were down for quite a while. I believe I saw a news story that they were down  at least until November of this year. The attack happened in October, but I believe they were down  until November of this year because of that, which made me question, wow, how are their backups? What  happened? You know, what else is going on with this? How are they down for a month after a ransomware  attack? Yeah, of course, Colonial paid the ransom. That's another trend. I never heard  word on Sinclair because I looked that up to see if Sinclair paid. I never heard word if they paid.

Start time: 6696.72
End time: 6721.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a feeling that's one of the trends we can talk about in 2020-22 is just giving up saying,  all right, take your money. In this case, the FBI got some of that money back. I don't know if it  got back to Colonial or if the FBI kept it, but they got some of that money back. And it was an  infrastructure attack. And I think those infrastructure attacks are what really got  our government to sit up, take notice, and to do something about ransomware. So in a way,

Start time: 6722.24
End time: 6739.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that was a turning point. Don't insurance companies now offer ransomware protection?  They did. I don't know if they still do. I thought about this because if they're offering this  protection, then the company that gets the company, yeah, they just like whatever.

Start time: 6740.64
End time: 6770.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It doesn't cost me anything. Yeah. This was at the beginning of the year, maybe it was the end of  last year. I think maybe in the end of last year, thanks to the pandemic, a lot of schools were  kind of abandoned and schools and city governments ended up getting really attacked. And it turned  out that one of the reasons they were so popular is because they often did pay because they had  insurance. And so ransomware authors and their affiliates are not dumb. They're going after

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  where the money is. It's like, what's the incentive on being more secure in my enterprise IT or small  business IT? Yeah, if I got insurance. Right. And then what's the incentive for the bad guys to say,  oh, they got insurance. They're going to pay. They're going to keep coming harder and harder at it.

Transcript:  You know, that's right. Yeah. Micah, what was your story of the year?

Start time: 6792.98
End time: 6969.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My story of the year. So it's kind of a jumping off point because in 2020, this was actually when  the Apple versus Epic case kicked off. So if you are not aware, the Apple versus Epic case was this  interesting start to a conversation where Epic games, which makes Fortnite released an update  to its app in the app store and nothing happened at that point. But then it made an update on the  server side that pushed an update to the game essentially that let people sort of circumvent  the app stores, Apple's app store, in app purchase system to be able to get credits for the game that  they were playing. And then they publicized it on purpose. Apple shut them down. And then Epic Games  put out this whole press release in this video where they did a parody of an original video from  Apple, original advertisement from Apple. And then things went from there. Essentially Epic Games said,  Hey, look, we think that the app store is a monopoly and that we should be able to have our  own payment system within the app store without having to pay Apple's commission, etc, etc.  And then that turned into, for me, especially, I've never paid so much attention to  antitrust and and sort of fairness rules, so to speak, when it comes to tech companies,  I had not personally considered the app store and Apple's commission as much as I did this past year,  I had not considered Google's take on this and their commission, I had not considered and paid  attention to all of the companies who were making changes. Chris Capicello was just on  Windows Weekly for the end of the year episode and he was talking about something that he  considered to be one of Microsoft's hidden gems, which was clearly a kind of point at the other  companies talking about app store fairness, where in the Microsoft store, the Windows store,  the commissions are different and that they are more fair and equitable.  Can have a store and they don't charge very much. Yeah, exactly. And so there's just a lot  of attention being paid to that this year, that I think it hasn't seeped as much into the general  what milieu as the supply chain has, it's not as much of a meme or a hashtag, but app store fairness  and that kind of conversation about what developers deserve and sort of the examination of epic's  handling and now this ongoing, the court cases is continuing to be sort of pushed back and pushed  back and pushed back and pushed back. All of that regulation of the government kind of paying  attention now to these app stores and Apple and Google's place in that, I think has been a really  fascinating thing to watch this year and I think it's going to continue on for several years.

Start time: 6970.68
End time: 6998.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In a way, even though Epic did lose this case in every respect, even down to the judge's  requirement that Apple open its app store being overturned by the ninth district  just last week, Epic got nothing tactically from the suit, but you're right from a point of view  of mind share, they kind of did win a victory and Apple even has had to kind of cave and give in a  little bit and give some stuff, right? Yeah, there's been a few changes that have come by that Apple,

Transcript:  you know, of course says, oh, you know, this is what we were going to do. Yeah, it's very clear  that it's in response to the EU and in response to sort of these, yeah, it's getting ahead of  those things, these preemptive decisions that are very clearly so yeah, they didn't win the war,  but they certainly got into the history books. Yeah, very good point. I actually hadn't thought

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  about that, but we wouldn't be having these conversations except for Epic's lawsuit.  Three good stories when we come back, the silliest stories of 2021, and this was hard to pick,  believe it or not, there were quite a few. We'll get to that in just a bit as we wrap up our  holiday special. So nice. I'm so glad you guys could get together. It's funny. I completely  forgotten. We're not, we were hoping we could all be in the same room because of Omicron. We can't,  we're not, but it does. This is virtual reality, isn't it?

Transcript:  and we'll come back and get silly in just a little bit. Our show today brought to you by userway.org.  Accessibility is so important. I mean, it's the law in the United States, the Americans with  Disabilities Act requires that any public entity be accessible and that includes every single  website. But it's also important because there are a large number of people who can't use your  website, who can't shop in your store, who can't use your shopping cart. And I think you want them  to be able to. It's a right thing to do. It's good for business. It's also the law. Now the problem  is, and I'm very sympathetic running quite a few websites myself, you look at that and go, now what  do I have to do? Do I have to hire developers? How much time is this going to take? How much is  it going to cost? Let me introduce you to userway. Userway.org. It's amazing. They are doing so much  to make the web accessible. They have an incredible AI-powered solution that tirelessly enforces the  hundreds of web content accessibility guidelines, the WCAG guidelines. And they do it, from your  point of view, it's very simple. With one line of JavaScript, they can achieve more than an entire  team of developers. They also do it very, very, very affordably. Making your website accessible  can be overwhelming, I understand. But userway's solution makes it simple. It's easy. It's  cost effective. First thing to do, go to userway.org slash twit, run their scanning tools, see if you  have issues. You probably do. And you probably want to fix them. I know you do. Well, let me tell  you, userway is used by more than a million websites. Some of the biggest websites in the world,  Coca-Cola, Disney uses userway, eBay, FedEx, UNICEF, Walmart, many leading brands, because it's an easy  and a very effective way to make your site accessible. Operating an accessible, compliant  website just makes business sense. Millions of people will need userway just to purchase your  products. And rest assured, as you grow, userway is there for you. I mean, if they can handle Disney,  they can handle sites of any size. Userway will, first thing they'll do, they use their computer  vision to generate alt tags. All the images in your site have to have text-based descriptions.  And they can do that quickly and easily. They give you a facility so that you can enhance them if you  want. Makes it very easy. So you could just go boom, boom, boom, boom, and add to those text descriptions.  But the text descriptions they do, they're remarkable. They're really, really good, thanks to AI.  It'll fix complex nav menus, which is often a very big problem for blind users. There are screen  readers, they just get lost on those hamburger menus. Userway ensures all your pop-ups are  accessible, your forms, your shopping cart. It'll fix vague link violations, fixes any broken links,  makes sure your colors are all accessible, without changing your brand colors, by the way.  There's an accessibility layer on all browsers. So people come to your browser  and just use the front page. If they can see, they just use the front page. But if somebody comes  there and they have disability software, screen readers or such running, it'll use the accessibility  layer. And it does two things. First of all, it shows them, shows the software the stuff they need  so that they can generate a speech or whatever it is to make that site accessible. But they also make  it customizable. And that's important too, because everybody's different. There's no one disabled  person there. There's all kinds of disabilities. So it's important that you also be flexible and  Userway does it. Completely platform agnostic. WordPress, Shopify, Wix, it's easy to add Userway,  AEM, Sitecore, same thing with SharePoint. Because it's one line of JavaScript, pretty much any website,  you just add that line and it's done. Userway integrates seamlessly with everything. It lets  your business meet its compliance goals. It improves the experience for users. Just ask Susan  Bennett, the voice of Siri, what she thinks of Userway. Hi, I'm Susan Bennett, the original voice

It's a great way to showcase your brand's commitment  to millions of people with disabilities. It's just the right thing to do. Go to userway.org  It's already very affordable. I mean, it's very inexpensive, but we're going to give you an  additional 30% off just because you saw it here. Userway's AI powered accessibility solution,  30% off when you go to userway.org slash twitter. Userway, making the internet accessible for  everyone. Userway, USERWAY.ORG slash twitter. We thank them so much for their support of this  week in Tekken. For all of our blind listeners and disabled listeners who really appreciate  making that stuff accessible. So last tweet, we talked about scientists taking a tardigrade,  which is every kindergartner's favorite animal. It's a microscopic animal, lives in moss.  Sometimes they call them a water bear because it looks like a bear. It's got little claws.  It's really the cutest thing, but they're also tough. They've been put in space for two weeks  and survived. They've been frozen. They've been shot out of a gun and survived.  So this gave me the inspiration for this whole segment because scientists have taken, in Singapore,  have taken a tardigrade, this little microscopic water bear, and it's the first multicellular  organism to be put inside a quantum entanglement. I don't even know what it means. I don't even know  what it means. They put it on a qubit from a quantum computer. It was in a quantum entanglement.  And so that made me think, you know, I bet there's some other stories from the year that-  Is that five nanometers or what? Oh, it's tiny. Let me see. Oh, I get it. What's the process?  Oh my God. He's making geek jokes now. Oh no. I tried to pull a Kevin. I'm sorry.  These are so cute. Look at the tardigrades. They're so cute. Little water bears.  They're cute and creepy. I mean, there's just something creepy about those claw hands.  The like pucker face is kind of unsettling to me. It is a little, it looks a little bit like a sci-fi  alien. It really does.

We had a lot of fun playing this. Oh, it's been disabled. I can't play it. The Italian  video. Yeah, probably. I didn't check.  The Italian sportscaster who couldn't during the Olympics, couldn't log into the laptop in the  booth. Apparently unwittingly on Mike, he asks somebody in the booth, what's the password for  this thing? The guy shouts the password, which is terrible.  Oh yeah, I remember that.  It's the boost number. And then he says, but that's a terrible password.  But security through obscurity. It was all in Italian. So  obscure to us. Anyway, I will translate. It was during the broadcast of the Turkey,  Chile volleyball game, Turkey, Chile. That sounds like something good.  I do like Turkey, Chile, the Turkey, the Turkey, China volleyball game.  Here goes our Turkish and Chilean fan base. He says, and we had, I think Carolina Milanesi  was on the show during this. So she was translating. Do you know the password for the computer in this  a commentator booth? He asked. And when he was told that it's based on this booth number, he said,  Oh, he said Italian profanity. It was too hard to call the password people, people, Pluto, Topolino.  It turns out the password was booth.zero three, which was in fact the name of the booth.  Lord have mercy. He concluded using the  popular Italian swear word that literally means a pig's misery.  Anyway, I don't think any security breaches as a result, but if you're ever in booth zero three,

Oh, that's so cute. But if you hear a noise in the kitchen, now it's just macking on  the teenage daughter. Here it is. Here's going. It's running off to the kitchen. My favorite part  is when it raises its periscope to look around. Oh, that's so creepy.  I can turn on the sound. It's going in. Oh, there's a mess in the kitchen.  It's raising the periscope showing you a picture. And then he presses the alarm button  and the raccoon scampers away. While grabbing whatever it was, a cupcake.  Does the robot clean up? No, because it can't. It can't do anything except bring you a beer.  If you put a beer in the cup holder on the robot, it'll drive around with it.  So this is not rosy.

Transcript:  Oh, God. Smitten by 2021. Smell the funk. Finally, the story of the guy who accidentally swallowed  his AirPods. Turns out he was sleeping in them, rolled over. And groggily, he says,  I moved my phone off the pillow and removed the wireless AirPod headphone from one ear.  The other had fallen out and I couldn't find it. Still barely awake, I padded to the bathroom for  a sip of water, but couldn't swallow properly. A clue. My throat filled with water. A clue,  but wouldn't go down. I had to lean over the sink, let the water drain out.  It was bizarre and alarming, but I was so tired. What did he do? He went back to bed.  So frustrating to me. The wife says, call the doctor. Honey. He says, no, no, I'm fine.  I checked again for the missing earbud in the morning. I used the find my AirPod function on  my phone, which makes the headphones beep, but the batteries were flat, so they didn't beep.  Still couldn't swallow. A clue. Anyway, eventually, eventually, after another mouthful of water comes  straight up, he begins to wonder. It took him like all day. I'd also become aware of a faint  pressure in the middle of my chest. He goes to the doctor and they give him an x-ray and  the doctor's expression when she returned was priceless. I bet this dude doesn't eat breakfast.  Obviously not. Well, I'll be damned. She said. She led me to a workstation surrounded by my  medical staff on the screen, a cartoon clear image of my ribs parked between them at 45 degrees.  The missing AirPod. You solved the mystery. Okay. A clue. Even more terrifying. They went  to the endoscopy center. The AirPod was retrieved using a tube with a lasso attachment and he says

They just don't do college football the way the rest of the  country does. And he wanted to bring a bit of a presence, so he was able to get some sponsors to  put some stuff together and they came up with the Los Angeles Jimmy Kimmel bowl and it ended up being  really good. It was Oregon State versus Utah State. Oregon State's from the Pac-12, Utah State's from  the Mountain West, I believe. And it was an entertaining game. I thought the Beavs were

That's Canadian, right?  I think so. The story apparently is kind of embarrassing. Is it with banks? No.  The lords of the manor would box up all the food from the Christmas feast that they didn't eat  and distribute it to the peasants. So it's not a day we like to think about, us white folk.  I prefer to think of Festivus. Nothing to celebrate. Have a great Christmas to you and yours,  Jason, and give big hugs to the kids. They are at the perfect age for Christmas.
