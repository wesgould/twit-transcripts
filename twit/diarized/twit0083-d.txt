Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  owned I've had my Mac my first and only Mac for all of about five months now oh  you're hooked you're hooked now but oh it's it's fantastic we're gonna make

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dvorak nauseous here so let's be careful you know yeah well you look like the  last show we did we had these other two guys who are big Mac users like you two  guys but they're ranting and raving about how great Vista was and that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  making me sick what was that all about you just easy easily nauseated I think  I need a patch we I just interviewed literally moments ago Peter Gutman from  New Zealand who wrote that article that's that's just spread like a wildfire  on the internet about Vista's content protection and how it was gonna hobble  Vista and make it unreliable and and and really what a big problem it was going  to be for for users I mean did you did you read that article anybody and John  did you read it did you have an opinion never heard of it never heard of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  isn't that something that came out quite a while ago it came out on a security

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  newsletter about a month ago the day the Telegraph in England picked it up and it  was yeah that's an old thing at all it went around the internet pretty much a  couple of days after Christmas is when I got about yeah it's internet years you  know okay well we just talked to minutes it was actually a fascinating  conversation will be on security now on Thursday but what's the deal wrap it up  for us essentially it looks like what Microsoft did is is really give  Hollywood everything they wanted and turn to turn Vista into a platform  for playing high-def content in order to do that I mean the things you have to do  the AACS you have to support the the ways you have to you know the spec from  Hollywood is very vague mate mostly it looks like you have to prove to them  that you're interested in protecting their content and and and Microsoft's  bent over backwards at their cost of reliability there's this thing called  tilt bits here's I'll give you a good example you know as you know Bill  McCrone the hardware and PCs is pretty cheesy and voltages fluctuate like crazy  and it's really you know there's got to be a lot of tolerance a lot of redundancy  to make a reliable PC well essentially Microsoft said is well anytime there's a  voltage fluctuation anytime anything doing a little anything a little odd  you set a tilt bit and you have to reset the entire video subsystem you have to  you have and we don't know how long that'll take but you have to essentially

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is to avoid piracy so this tilt bit is named after a pinball machine is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  what it is that's right the idea is if you're if you're piracy stealing stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we're gonna brick your PC well you know this this comes down to one simple fact  and that is that there is no reason to ever buy a media center PC especially if

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's running Vista but but the point is it's in all versions of Vista and that's  what's really scary I think what's what's odd is that Microsoft has put so much  effort and so much energy into this and when it's really only a small subset I  think of Windows users that want to be playing high-def movies on their  computer I mean how important is that for computer users for guys who want to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  like rip rip their high-def content and watch it on the airplane it ain't gonna  happen what's wrong with that what's wrong with ripping the content you paid  good money for and then watching on the airplane come on nothing but try and do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it on a Vista PC you'll be surprised you'll be surprised anyway when it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  just another hack that we have to work around well in fact that's one of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  stories we're gonna talk about a guy named I want to say Muselix Muselix 60  foam or Muselage Muselage you know that's the old glue you remember that  shows your age John I don't think they make Muselage anymore that's not you  I make it at home library glue isn't it cracked I make it from the dog's toenail  clippings it was made out of horses hooves here yes that's exactly right  this guy Muselix 64 has cracked HD DVDs content protection now that the crack he  did is a little bit difficult to make work because you have to go out and get  keys and he doesn't give you keys but it's but it's a good proof of concept  and he says he did it because he was so mad at Vista right so you know why did

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Microsoft bother when they well actually they had to bother otherwise but but  they probably knew from the outset that it'll crack it in 60 days the real

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  consequence I mean I feel bad for a video card manufacturers because they've  got to do all this jumping through hoops too I mean it's tough to make a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  compliant card and they've eliminated the audio card business yeah that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right that's right I'll have to say though I'm hooked on the HD DVD format it looks  good doesn't it it does and honestly the reason why I chose it over blu-ray I  don't know I might go back who knows but it was just because it was so cheap and  expensive for an add-on for the Xbox 360 you did the same thing I did 199 bucks it  was a Christmas present it was just done deal came with it always comes down to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  price that's right yeah although the DVD format does have a lot of I like I said  I think the way we talked about this last week or the week before work I've  been to these dog and pony shows that they're putting on I'm gonna go to a  couple more down at CES and and the HD DVD guys have a better pitch that's all  I can say it's a better pitch it's a much better pitch and when they show you  some of the cool features that they demand everybody put in those players  you go wow I mean these other guys have got a problem here Bill McCrone if you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  come down on one side of the other in this war I like what LG did they've got

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a combo player and they live on both sides of the fence you know I had an

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  order out anyone bill where is it well they say it'll be out soon they're gonna  announce it at CES I'm gonna look at there but I bet you don't ship it I had  an order for the Toshiba HD DVD player because one thing I don't like Kevin is  how loud the Xbox 360 is yeah and so I really oh yeah haven't you noticed it's  kind of whiny I haven't got a lot I just crank up the audio Leo you'll be fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah that's probably my problem I'm playing it way too loud yeah I watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  chick flicks where there's actual conversation and that's yeah that's when  you can really hear it you know those long pauses you go hmm so but I had  ordered it because it was so noisy I ordered it to Shiba HD DVD player and  then I cancelled the order it's been back order for a while because of this  LG so you don't think LG said Thursday it's gonna launch a DVD player that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and HD DVD you don't believe it John no I believe they're gonna launch it but I  don't I would like to see it when they ship it I mean these I just I I'm just  skeptical about this because everybody's been announcing these things over the  last few years and then they pull back for some unknown reason I'm not I just  don't know I mean I until I see one in my hands that is actually shipping and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not gonna buy into any of this yeah what's the price point on that I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  have a I don't have an Xbox and I don't have a ps3 but if this thing ships and  it's not insanely expensive I'll buy it well that solves the problem yeah I feel

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the same way I wait which wait let's wait let's go ask the Polar guys now what  what is not insanely expensive I mean you what would you pay for one would you pay  600 bucks is that cheap or 350 bucks for it 450 that's insane at 399 right now the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Blu-ray is around a thousand and the HD DVDs around 500 for the standalone  players I'd pay 500 I wouldn't pay a thousand for a player yeah but it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  still too early to figure out who's gonna win I mean it comes down to when  my mom and dad want to go out and buy one they're gonna want to spend a hundred  to 150 bucks and whoever can get there first is gonna win I went to Best Buy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and it's frustrating because I'm looking at the HD DVD and most of the movies I  want to earn HD DVD but there's a couple of titles on Blu-ray you know you just  really want that evil what is it Evil Dead 3 and it's only it's only on Blu-ray  it's a little frustrating oh man that keeps me awake at night actually the  truth is most of the movies on Blu-ray don't attract me and that's another  reason why I thought HD DVD might win yeah they certainly are out early and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know it's funny because the studios have all said well we're Blu-ray and yet  they've cranked out all of their content on HD DVD because it was there first

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and it was cheaper and more reliable man I watched a movie by Sony this is a  sidebar but I watched a movie by Sony last night I went to see the holiday it  was I don't know it's a so one of the Sony movie companies MGM or whatever  there was Sony computers Sony TVs Sony players it was like a Sony universe and  to me it had a negative impact on me you know it's odd since the Japanese are so

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  into subtlety it was far from subtle I mean via computers everywhere you look

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that's like the the new James Bond was that way well what was it what was it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sony yeah Sony yeah they were everywhere I think it's terrible I think it takes  you out it it takes you I blame Howard Stringer it takes you out of the movie  it doesn't make me well disposed towards Sony it's certainly not you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  subliminal that reminds me of when we watched 60 minutes with the family you  know we finally get the kids to watch something like that and then as soon as  they do one of those puff pieces which they do constantly now usually about a an  actor or a movie the kids all chime in going it's a bitch it's a Viacom movie  I'll bet you the Viacom movie Wow so everybody is clued into this savvy to  that yes they know that yeah but CBS 60 minutes 60 minutes did a puff piece on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Howard Stringer yeah well there you go I don't know Leo would you be saying this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  stuff it was an apple because you'd be seen power books all over the place you  but I but it's you know you don't care if it's an apple no but they the Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  pays for it it's like for product placement it's not like corruption I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  still would bug me if it were if you what it doesn't bug me is you see some  apples and some some other stuff but if it were all Apple it's just not credible  that's why like 24 the bad guys use PCs the good guys use Macs like in real life  just like in real no no but I mean that's to me I don't care if it's  switched around bad guys could use a max and but but at least there's some other  models out there it I mean there's not it's it's it takes you out of the movie  to be in a Sony universe it's not a Sony universe all right let's get to the CES

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  blitz that we will in a way we've kind of been talking about CES because these  are these are gonna be the big stories in fact one of the big stories in fact  if you look at the my recent column in Market Watch it's a ready for the CES  and s blitz blitz I mentioned I think one of the big things that's gonna  happen there I think everyone else can chime in on what they think is gonna go  on but the HD DVD blue ray wars I think are gonna be a big deal there

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  absolutely and if LG if there are if there are dual player boxes won't that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  be the big story yeah I'm sure that's why I'm first thing I'm gonna check out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  will there be you think there'll be booths facing each other with HD HD DVD  and blue rolling marshmallows at each other shooting yeah absolutely now  you're not going to CES Bill McCrone do you feel like you're gonna miss no I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  not no I don't I mean all of this stuff is on the web I can talk to any PR person  or whomever I want to or you know I can get all of the information I want and  matter of fact I've gotten about all I can stand so I don't see a particular

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  reason to subject myself to Las Vegas last year I didn't go and I put up that  website you know which was like the virtual CES show because there's so  many the show is over covered I wouldn't go myself this year if I didn't have to  do a couple cranky geeks there because somebody insisted because believe me I  don't like the show at all I'm not gonna enjoy it I guess I'll have you know I  get to see a few people get them you know glad hand and say yeah yeah let's  do lunch this year you know people haven't seen for five years I'll never  see him again he's gonna be cranky that's good it's just a bit yeah well I'm  cranky generally anyway I don't know what it is the weather but you know it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  seems like Comdex used to be fun maybe it was because I was fresh-faced and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  wet behind the ears but conduct decks to me was always more concentrated it was  about one thing this has got multiple topics and it's kind of a horrible thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to transverse yeah I agree Comdex was was more single focus it was all about  computers and it was total immersion and it was certainly right for its time  CES you know always has been and always will be I guess more than you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  encompass or more than you'd want to will it do you think always will be I  mean will CES survive why did CES survive when Comdex could not and and E3  could not and so many other trade shows have gone by I'll tell you what Gary  Shapiro one guy kept it alive this the chairman of this the consumer electronics

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Gary Shapiro is the yeah I think if he left to be honest about I think  the show would change drastically he's a you know I just give him all the credit

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  for it but if but he sells it hard if nobody wants to go there and nobody  needs to go there why do we need to show well some people need to go like for  example me yeah cuz Patrick Patrick by the way is not here today because he and  Roger Chang are in a van driving to CES right now this is why when somebody asked  me why don't you go to CES because I don't work for Ziff Davis anymore and I  have to say I'm really pleased I'm not on the way to CES on the other hand I'm  looking forward to going to Mac Macworld Kevin Rose are you excited about it yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Macworld's gonna be fun we're gonna do a live dig nation there so that'll be cool  from the showroom floor you're doing that Thursday Wednesday Wednesday okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  where are the days of Macworld well Tuesday is the keynote it starts on  Tuesday and then it goes through Friday well the conference on the 8th and then  the expo opens on the night right dead I mean this is this has happened once or

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  twice before right against CES well not quite I mean we can still do both shows  on Thursday I'll go to Macworld and then I'll do a comparison report for the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  first time in a long time Macworld's actually taking up a little bit more of  the San Francisco Convention Center two halls instead of just one it's in fact  it's in the past it's but kind of pathetic it wasn't even taking up a  whole hall there was kind of a curtains around it and so you wouldn't see all

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the vastness that was empty. The problem with Macworld that I find though  at least in the last couple years that it's all about the iPod yeah and it's  like there's the entire floor a good portion of it is nothing but accessories

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  for the iPod yes the iPod accessory show this is here is I've been told by  everybody is gonna be a big year because of the announcements Apple's gonna make  now here's the latest on the iPhone you you you Kevin really kind of broke the  iPhone and I've heard now a number is you said it was gonna be a dual mode GSM  or CDMA I had somebody tell me on the radio show sounded like he knew what he  was talking about was gonna be CDMA and that they were working on the deal he  just sent me an email saying the deal didn't happen and and that means that  there will not be an iPhone announcement they couldn't make the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  carrier agree what were they gonna call it because the Cisco had the iPhone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  name it wasn't gonna be an iPhone in fact this guy said it wasn't gonna have  I in the word at all I had another another guy told me that it was good  that it was gonna be called the I chat mobile which I find hard to believe yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yeah terribly name well it'll be interesting probably nothing will come

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  up but there won't be a phone there won't be a phone there will be the ITV I think  we agree won't be called the ITV this is gonna be an interesting device effect  a number of people told me this is gonna be much bigger than anybody realizes you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  know I heard a rumor about the ITV that has to do with them partnering with  Netflix and doing rentals streaming downloadable rentals through the ITV

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow high def I don't know about high def but I want that high def this has to be  high def there would be a that would be the biggest mistake they could make but

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  by not going high def so this is a solution that maybe a good way Apple if  you if instead of trying to build in this high def capability into the  operating system and bogging the whole system down make it a black box take it  out of the computer if you want high def content buy a separate box well they

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  have that right now I mean have you tried the marketplace for the Xbox 360

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yes I have and actually I love so have you seen the downloadable high def

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  movies they have you can get Superman right now on the Xbox 360 high def their

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  rentals and there's one and there's one big problem you only have a 20 gig  currency no yeah that's a 20 gig hard drive you could put one high def movie on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  there yeah but yeah they're rentals that's true but you know what else kills  me is that the currency that they use they use those Microsoft's like little  points and you can't figure out like quickly what the conversion rate is you  like am I spending items being no idea what you're spending credits or at six  dollars approximately yeah it's it's just kind of confusing kind of worked for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  though I just spend spend spend because it's all just points right right yeah  funny money yeah it's funny money it's weird it's a it's a the the TV shows are  I believe a buck 99 although it's what 160 Microsoft points or something that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  weird all right well you know another thing that's gonna go on at the CES  show apparently according to the list that CES themselves put out as a  promotion of this HD PLC what's that which which is the new high definition  power line communication you know standard that supposedly you know this  has been going on for years right Bill's been following it and I've been  following it where you have these you know these systems that use the power  lines in your house and then the whole neighborhood for all that you know for  all practical purposes that to to communicate at some high bit rate you  start off at one megabit then went to two then with the ten they went to 100  supposedly and now is this thing called HD PLC which is supposed to be the  system that you can plug in the wall and then anywhere in the room house you can  plug in a connector and you get high definition stream from your PC over the  power line and so is it networking or is it networking it is networking it's  not just for TV no no it's networking and then the you know that long-term  speculation is that what you have you'll be able to buy television sets that have  that networking capability built into the power plug itself and you won't have  to hook anything up but you know I I want a microwave with that built in that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  knows what movie I'm watching it puts the right pizza in or maybe it's the cat

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in do with the throughput capacity is supposed to be of this HD PLC well I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  gonna look it up right now that's that's one of the issues with the ITV as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  as it's gonna be over Wi-Fi according to Panasonic it's a hundred and ninety  megabits you need a hundred megabit no but you only need like 19 megabits for

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  high-def right right yeah that's Panasonic is a big pressure of this by

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the way so in theory if I had a neighbor that lived a couple doors down they could  put a movie in for me to watch at my house you know that's what I'm thinking

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you can you can join the net their network but you know you can already do  this I say already the stuff isn't really available yet but wireless USB is  getting an equally big push and that's ultra wideband and it's and of course  it's not over the power lines it's it's transmitted but that's 480 megabits  that's full speed USB and what's the distance that that goes it doesn't have  great distance yeah but all you have to do is put a reflector behind your antenna

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and you're there yeah you know but that's not as good as stealing the  signal from your neighbor come on well now you can beam it to your neighbor

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  does it go through walls I mean is it pretty high frequency what's the frequency it well it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ultra wideband it covers a huge you know it's like that spy stuff that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in that spread spectrum yes well actually it's not quite it's not really  spread spectrum it's more of a you know I've been in my Hetty Lamar right no  that's Hetty Lamar ultra wideband it's a different kind of it is technology it's  a sputter radio it's got all kinds of different names but but it goes through  walls pretty well it's used for for radars good ground penetrating radar is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  this technology will it heat up my Alpo you only what I must be hungry we're  doing this but the serious point is that these microwave radiation I mean this  high-power microwave radiation could be dangerous good now ultra wideband is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  like spread spectrum in that it doesn't stay long at any one frequency so the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  heating effects are nil very cool it's actually worse than that because the FCC  has limited the power to such an extreme that is you get more radiation from a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  from a digital watch I put out of my put my Wi-Fi base station at the head of my  bed do you think I'm gonna get brain cancer not not from that no yeah I mean  we don't think you're gonna from that says John so what will I get it from

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  John the radium dial on your clock or it's more dangerous probably yeah and by

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  far well so the ITV the rumor is we'll use 802.11 and and of course the reason  there's a rumor for that is because all of the new Macs have this kind of stealth  802.11 and capability is that fast enough for I def are you kidding was it up to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  600 megabits per second with the latest iteration but in reality is it yeah it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  really fast okay so we've got really a number of ways to move these high def  signals around I mean I think that that's what people want better not to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  use wires if you can yeah they said it's gonna have an HDMI port so you're good

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  there I'm excited about so so you the rumor is that Netflix deal any other

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  rumors about that Kevin no that's it that's just all I heard so I don't know  when that's coming out or and will you have a hard drive I guess it'd have to  if you're gonna download movies well with stream it from your client right so  if it was built into iTunes you can log into your Netflix account through iTunes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  or through just yeah I don't know that would solve the problem because iTunes  they only have Disney movies in iTunes that'd be huge yeah but but you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there is a silliness factor in this all of this wireless USB and so forth because  you know they're talking about you know cameras just bring your camera into the  room and you can transmit the pictures to your PC well the wireless USB isn't  gonna recharge the camera or all of those other devices that recharge from  your USB cable so you still have to plug something in I want those little mats

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that I've been seeing all over the place on dig and gadget and all that have you  seen those little mats you can just set yourself on or set your camera on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah and so then you have to basically attach the antenna which you know is  just a wire and a diode to the to the back of your device so that it can  receive that power and convert it into DC and charge the battery. Have you tried it Bill? Does it work?  well of course it works but I mean this this is not new technology by any  stretch I mean Nikola Tesla invented this yeah exactly exactly I mean it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's it's really a century old so more well sometimes the good stuff is the old  stuff we're gonna see speaking as one of the old stuff we're gonna see a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  new TV technologies at CES this year? Well the the biggest non-show is SED. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  want my SED. Silicon emitting diodes is that what that is? No surface

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  electron emitter. Yeah this is the same Bony Bologna technology that the  FEDs were years ago field emission diode whatever they were. So that's why we're not gonna see them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are they not is it is it bonus? Hey you know I all I know is I got into arguments

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  with Heron about this. He was all excited about it wasn't he? Yeah he was all jacked up about it and I  told him this is this is a BS technology that looks good on paper and it has all  these other characteristics and then the FED thing went on for almost ten  years the company candlescent you know dropped more money than any other  company in the history of venture capital they couldn't get the thing to  work but there's a couple of companies out of France it was going one and most  of those patents have been all bought by Toshiba and they're trying to they  renamed it SED. Oh it's exactly the same? Did you see the SED set last year? No I never you know what the thing is everybody does say this one thing I have to say I saw old FED technology but the SED stuff everybody says it's the most spectacular flat panel you'll ever see and it's possible but I mean but that doesn't mean they can make them. Well exactly I mean that's that's the problem is is that Toshiba has come out and said it's not going to be a consumer

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  product for this foreseeable future but as a professional display product so  that means it's going to be you know ten thousand dollars and up for moderate  sized SEDs but boy are these things gorgeous. You saw it? Yes yes. And it looks  great? It's it's like walking up to I don't know like like a McKnight lithograph  except that it's a television set I mean it's a flat surface. Is orders of magnitude

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  better than an LCD or a plasma then? That's what everyone says. Definitely better yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  visibly I mean just walk right up to it and man the resolution the the color  saturation everything now the problem is is that it's it's a phosphor emissive  display so like a plasma you could conceivably burn it in so it's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  perfect. Right but it's the same way with a regular old CRT I mean my understanding  was that this is the CRT this is a flat CRT essentially. Instead of having a  scanning electron gun it has a individual electron guns behind every  phosphor so it can be totally flat and that's what an FED was but they they  had all kinds of problems with heating was one of the things that things would  heat up and you know because of all these guns and it melt and then they had  and because of the gun was so close to the foster would also burn out the  phosphors they need a special I mean there's one thing after another with

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  this technology. So are they gonna even bring the demo TV back? Not this year. Not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  even the demo? I don't think so. Wow that's not a good sign. I think it's it's off the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  bad side. If you can't even bring the demo you know you got a problem. But on the other

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  hand the Elcos sets the liquid crystal on silicon you know JVC and as their what  DILA and Sony is SXRD they're looking pretty darn good in the rear

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  projection. I have to point out John you didn't think Elcos was gonna happen in  fact a couple of years ago maybe it was last year you said this is it it's over  nobody makes them nobody's gonna make them. Well you know I'm not gonna I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  still not gonna give the Elcos the award for like taking over the world I'm in  terms of I mean I've seen some Elcos displays that look pretty good I don't  know I have mixed feelings about it. We have a guy on our blog by the way  dvorak.org slash blog you may have heard of it. Yes. Alex Poultrie who is actually an  expert he's actually an editor at one of the magazines that does describes parts  more or less but he's like a superstar with in when these with this display  technology and he's written about this quite a bit and we'll post some of that  stuff but yeah I have he he's kind of more actually he's kind of leans toward  Elcos too a little bit never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of the two I think that JVC's DILA is probably a little better than SXRD  unfortunately they don't make a set that fits in the nook that I have. If size and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  price were no object and you could choose any technology right now Bill

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  McCrumb which one would you choose? Tough choice because the you know some of the  DLP sets that are now illuminated by three LEDs and three DLP chips are awesome  because the the LEDs are have a bigger color gamut than any light bulb and the  you know it would be between JVC DILA or some of these three DLP sets. Plasma's  out it's gone it's over? I'm not interested in plasma I don't know you  because when you when you do get close to them and I don't advise it because  they just don't look good when you get close. LCD has yeah LCD has better  resolution when you get close and Elcos has seamless resolution. There's no  pixels at all. You don't see that that window screenish kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  separation that's what you do on the direct view. The guy we should be asking is Kevin he's the  only one amongst us here that can actually afford one of these. Well he got his sofa did you buy a TV now Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did get a TV. What'd you get? I went to Best Buy and got a Samsung flat screen LCD.  How big? I don't know how big is it Prager? How big can you buy them? I'll buy the biggest. It's probably about 42.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like standard. Yeah it's like $800 TV. That's not bad. I confess to having just bought and I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  now know that I made the mistake I bought a plasma TV. I don't think there's a mistake. I like it.  I like my well the Vizio man Vizio just announced a what was it under three

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  grand they just announced a new huge LCD. And they look good they're cheap. Yeah they do look good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think where you get where you lose something in Vizio I may be wrong and I  wish Heron were here to verify this is on the processing capabilities when you  put watch as standard definition television for instance on it it just  does not look that good because they just don't have the hardware in there to  upscale. And the plasma? Or the LCDs I think that's where they're where they're I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they're cheap these Vizio's are very expensive. That's because it costs you have to put those

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ferrucia circuits in there. Exactly or whoever. And that costs money. Yeah it's all licensed that's right and they make a bundle on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here it is Vizio 60 inch this they'll probably show this at in fact they are  going to show this at CES 60 inch plasma get this for a 60 inch plasma under $3,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah unbelievable. My sister and I just bought my my mama a flat screen from

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Costco. 29.99. The maximum. Dirt and cheap. Yeah they're amazing they've really fallen credit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Costco we're getting more publicity for Costco. Costco's great. I know but they owe us all this free publicity they owe us free memberships now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait a minute. That's true. Do you have to pay for a membership to Costco? Yes $50 a year. United Costco member what planet do you live on?  I thought you had to be in the Union or something. No that's Gemco from the 60s. I'm not in the Union I don't know if I can join.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was that the hey Jerry what's the story guy with the belly or was that an East Coast thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't remember that one but so other TV technologies are there any other new TV technologies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've heard a lot of rambling about metadata and TV and building your own custom clips.  Is anybody released anything on that? That'd be cool. Well they were who is it was Direct TV that I went to their booth last year at CES and they were talking about okay let's say you know Brett Favre throws four passes over the last three weeks that have gone longer than 40 yards and you'll be able to put that into your  television it'll build you a custom clip based on the recordings that are on your DVR. That's what I want. Why do you like Brett Favre that much? I do. It's Brett. Brett Favre not Butt Favre. I thought it was an operay. Did I say Butt Favre?  I'll have to go back and check the tape Alex. You can't tell me that's not cool though. It would be cool. And for any clips it would be great you could have the best Seinfeld jokes or the you know I mean yeah I think that's a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's taking Flickr style tagging and bringing it to TV. This is when you get a chance to have your hands. That's what's gonna happen with YouTube don't you think that's what's gonna happen? You can launch your own station and people can groove on your clips. That's right. It's the Leo station. I am nauseated.  Officially we've now nauseated two out of the five panelists. That's really great. Hey let's talk about other ridiculous stuff. Okay. It has a working list right? I'll give you one that's on the dvorak.org slash blog blog. Okay. And that is the new dual HD DVD Blu-ray discs. Yeah you know I'm skeptical about this one too. Time Warner discs? Time Warner Warner

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  brothers is announced. They're gonna make Blu-ray and HD DVD single disc. It's called total HD DVD and I guess you could put it in either player. Great idea. I mean this is the one upspinship from the combo disc. I think it was universal or whoever it was. It said they're gonna have a regular DVD on one side and then HD DVD on the other. And so this like ups the ante on that idea. But the technologies are so different from HD DVD and Blu-ray. I don't know how they're gonna make them. I mean it's doable. I mean except for the fact that it's  gotta be an expensive proposition. I think a dual player is a better solution than a dual format disc. Is it a two sided laminated disc? You got one on one side and one on the other. They couldn't interleave them. I can't imagine. No you can't interleave them. No. Well the problem with Blu-ray the surface that's recorded on is very close to the surface of the disc that you're reading from. With the regular DVD and HD DVD it's actually behind the label and you have to go through a bunch of plastic to get to the data. And so you'd have to have this one

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  layer that has both. I mean it's just maybe laminating two discs and gluing them together might work. I don't know how they're gonna do it. It's very... clearly there's some attempt to resolve this battle. I mean from a number of different camps. I don't know. I like the idea that... am I wrong? But does Blu-ray only support MPEG 2? Yes. That's one of the issues too. I mean HDOT 264 is so much better looking. It just seems to me that that's a disadvantage. But Blu-ray holds more on the disc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So less compression. Yeah. If you start adding layers. If you start adding layers Blu-ray can hold a lot more. I think the Blu-ray... I'd like to see the combo disc work out because I'd like to see a Blu-ray that we can use in our computers. You know that have multiple layers read write capabilities. So we can back up these huge hard discs that we're starting to get. And then HD DVD I think should be the stuff for the consumer electronics. I think the combo thing is the way to go. That's the only way it's gonna be resolved. Speaking of... Multi-layer...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Blu-ray writing. That's gonna be expensive. I'd like that though. I'd like... well a number of... I'm sure HP and Apple both are gonna do Blu-ray discs. Maybe the Apple will even announce them on Tuesday. But I'm sure they're both gonna do Blu-ray drives in their machines. That would be cool. Soon. May not be multi-layer. Maybe single layer. But they'll be read write I'm sure. Speaking of big hard drives. Hitachi announces the first terabyte drive out by end of March. Pretty cool. Would you buy it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Terabyte drive? I have one now. I have a terabyte drive. I have one of the Mac Store ones. Oh, it's not one disc. It's multiple drives. Well, yeah. Rated to make a terabyte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Terabyte? But you can still do it with just two. You can do it with two spindles. That's not bad. Yeah, I guess. So is there a point in getting a terabyte drive? I just worry about the density on the discs. Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because if the aerial density is so high, they're gonna be unreliable. Okay, well this brings me to an anecdote. Here it comes. Okay. So I'll tell you, years and years ago when the first gigabyte drives came out and then the first one was a 9 gigabyte...  I remember when the 9 gigabyte drive came out. It'll never work. Micropolis was still in business. And Micropolis decided to stop making these big drives and go into raid. And I went to the booth at one of these shows and the guy from Micropolis says, you know, in the same panicky way that you did, Leo, he says, you know, this is the way to go, this raid thing, because nobody will ever trust 9 gigabytes on a single spindle.  It'll never happen. I got 9 gigabytes in my pocket, baby. It's unbelievable. So the terabyte, maybe when you get to a petabyte, that's when I'll bail out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Alright.  Hey, can I try something out on you? Because I don't know whether this is great or ridiculous. You know, it worries me when I can't tell the difference.  We'll be your ridicule meters.  Okay, alright. So location-based services, GPS, you know, the whole you are here phenomena and here's what else is here now that you're here.  Awesome.  That's built into Vista.  Sorry, sorry, sorry. Keep going. Keep going. You didn't finish.  So you can get a Garmin or, you know, you name it, GPS device, and the way they're going with these things is it can give you not only the location of the local gas station, the nearest gas station in case you're low, but also the prices that they're charging.  Oh, that's great.  So you can compare it and show it.  I love it.  Local weather? I mean, you are here, why don't you just look out the damn window?  I mean, I don't understand.  Do I really need to compare it to gas?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, are you, is this a company you're going to get involved with, Bill?  I would buy a device if that had that capability that you just described.  They're already available.  Well, where it gives me the gas prices?  Yeah, the way you call, who is it, 680, the, who is that?  The Nuvi from Garmin?  Nuvi 680, yes, has that feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  David, you have that.  Trigger has that.  I know, I just got it.  Okay, so you can get a device that's available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't have one and I'm telling you the features.  No, no, I think either I have the 600 or the 680.  I have one of the new Nuvis and it's got, I mean, the coolest thing it has is the traffic stuff.  That gets that from XM, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then I am pretty certain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a $10 month thing though, it's an add-on.  Oh, now this one, the Nuvi 680, I think it's a $10 month thing.  Yeah, I think it's a $10 month thing.  I think it's a $10 month thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's a $10 month thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's a $10 month thing.  I think it's a $10 month thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's a $10 month thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Nuvi 680 gets it from MSN Direct.  And that's why you get gas prices in movie times.  Because you have MSN basically tied into it.  Wow.  So it's the Spot Watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Except it's on your dash.  It's a Spot GPS.  You know, it's better on your dash than your wrist, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Those Spot Watches looked so stupid on people's wrists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and the thing is they're still small enough that you can stick it in your pocket and go hiking or walking around the town or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a thousand bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How much was the one you bought, David?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got it for the holidays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it was a gift.  But they said, what do you want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm like, how about this?  And I send a link and the next thing you know I got it.  If I ever went anywhere I'd get one of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I never go anywhere.  I know exactly how to get to my office and back.  Well, I mean the great thing about having it is that you can take it.  It's so portable you can stick it anywhere you go.  Which means you might not want it in your factory-conditioned automobile.  But when you travel you can throw it in your backpack or your suitcase.  And take it anywhere you want.  Very continental cars.  My brother has one of these products.  Not the same model, an older one.  But he used to live in Prague and he has a place out there.  And he was able to buy the maps and load it onto his garment device.  And all of a sudden he can drive all over Eastern Europe with the darn thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think to answer your question, Bill, I don't think location-based services are at all goofy.  I think there's a lot there.  You know, Vista will find other Vista computers and say hi for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It sounds like something I don't need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think the neat thing about the gas station thing is I've been on the freeway with these things.  And you can look for gas stations and it'll tell you there's a Shell over here, there's a Chevrolet over here.  And if it'll also tell you the prices, then I'll go to the ones that have the cheap prices.  Love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I have a question for everybody since Bill's asking these open questions.  Where did Garmin come from out of the blue to become such a dominant character?  They came out of the blue. They took over the business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They came out of the military-industrial complex.  They were doing all of that early GPS system when it was all proprietary and mostly military.  So they've got the heritage to do it.  They have the oldest heritage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My first GPS that I purchased for some of the stuff, I was even doing Boy Scouts way back in the day.  Boy Scouts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You had GPS in Boy Scouts?  Well, like at the tail end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We barely had fire.  When I was a kid, we didn't have kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it was Garmin-based.  It was really nasty and clunky, but it was an old Garmin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Interesting story that needs to be told.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  According to Wikipedia, Garmin is a Taiwan-based company incorporated in Georgetown, Cayman Islands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This doesn't sound anything like Cayman Island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This whole thing sounds...  Let me see.  In 1991, their first Garmin GPS was in 1991.  So that's a long time.  Are you looking at the same Wikipedia?  No, I'm looking at Garmin's site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not sure that I would trust the Wikipedia article.  This doesn't sound like a military operation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What started out in 1989 with a handful of dedicated engineers and a great idea for a product has grown into the GPS leader in sales.  But I don't know.  You know what? You're right, Bill.  From the first GPS handhelds supporting the coalition forces in the first Gulf War.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're absolutely right.  But that doesn't mean they're not in the Cayman Islands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It could be that too.  They could have been bought by the Taiwanese government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Further below it says it was founded by a guy named Gary Burrell who was born in 1937 with a degree in electrical engineering from Wichita State.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well then what's the Taiwan connection that's a Taiwan... maybe they sold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you know what? The manufacturer's done by...  In fact, if you go to the Carmen site, there's co-founders Gary Burrell from Wichita and Dr. Min Kao.  So they obviously have a Taiwanese manufacturer.  They partnered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I design, you make.  Yeah, perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That makes sense.  Have we answered that question thoroughly?  Yeah, that's good.  Okay, another open-ended question. Anybody?  Kevin Rose, I have a question for you.  What do you know?  You must know something.  Your sources at Apple, come on.  You've risked them before.  Risk them again.  You know something about Tuesday at Macworld.  Tell us all.  I really don't know anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, I'll tell you what.  Other than what I said about the iPhone.  I'm going to say some things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If it's true, I just want you...  Honestly, I wish I knew.  I'm just giving you a hard time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I lost one of my sources a while ago last year.  You got him fired.  Yeah, no kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We had somebody email us who said that one of the ways to know  what's going on at Macworld is to go to the printers  where they print up the banners.  Of course, this makes sense because during Job's keynote,  these banners are all covered.  And as soon as the keynote ends, they take the wraps off  because now you know about these products.  He claims that the iTV will be called the iMix.  I don't think that's going to happen.  The iPhone is the iChat mobile.  I think what does happen,  and I think this happens fairly frequently,  is they plan for these announcements.  And then sometimes things that they thought they would be  announcing don't happen.  I think that's what I've heard now is going to happen  with the iPhone, which would be a bit of a shocker.  It was supposed to be made out of zirconia.  You're a materials guy, Bill McCrone.  Zirconia, which is a zirconium metallic alloy  that's basically a ceramic.  And it's radio transparent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  And can be made transparent or can be translucent  or any solid color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sounds like a perfect cell phone material.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like cubic zirconium is made from this stuff.  Yeah, exactly.  It's kind of the same.  It's kind of the same.  I mean, it's not dirt cheap.  I mean, it's not expensive, but it's not dirt cheap either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's not a plastic, though.  It's a metal, essentially.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's a crystal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a crystal.  So it's like ceramic.  It is a ceramic thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about just a plastic?  If you want to make it clear, make it loose.  Because we don't want scratches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We want it robust.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you're wrong.  I think they want scratches.  I think the whole iPod deal was to make them so they scratch up  so you have to buy a second one.  There's a lot of people out there  that have two and three and four of these things  because they got all scratched up.  That's a good point.  I think it's done as a marketing ploy.  I need a new iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Has anybody ever power buffered their iPod?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would work.  You can buy it.  You're right, Bill.  Just buff out the scratches, you're saying.  You get a high-speed buffer and some of that stuff  you can buy at most hardware stores.  Turtle legs.  No, it's a special stuff.  You just use...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Toothpaste.  Toothpaste actually works very well for plastic scratches,  but I restored my son's iPod,  which just looked like it was brushed stainless steel kitchen  sink metal instead of shiny,  and buffed it back into bright shiny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're talking about the metal part, not the plastic part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Actually, I did both sides, and it looks gorgeous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I bring it in?  The best part about that, by the way,  the best part of what Bill did,  it buffs out the Apple logo.  That is so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's still there.  I like how Kevin buffed in the dig logo  to his aluminum MacBook Pro.  Laser-etched it.  Is that awesome?  Yeah, it's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You should come out and get yours done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leah Culver did it.  It's her company, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, she...  She did it first.  Yeah, she didn't do mine though.  Phil Trone did mine for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you explain in more detail to the listeners  what you're talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's a laser-etching machine basically  that is made for engraving pretty much anything.  I don't think laptops, but...  Is it the same one that Yoshi had?  Yeah, it's similar to the same one that Yoshi had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is a VersaLaser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  VersaLaser, they're great.  And you can certainly do a laptop with one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so we were at FooCamp and Phil basically said,  hey, if you have your company logo  or anything else that you want on your notebook,  come on over.  And there's a list of probably 30 or so plus geeks waiting in line  to get their laptops and cell phones and iPods laser-etched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think they were doing it using like CorelDRAW or something.  Yeah, it's always...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just for the record, you guys, I broke the VersaLaser.  I introduced it to the world.  Very cool, very cool.  That was my discovery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you check them out in Phoenix, Arizona?  Yeah, actually they're in Scottsdale.  Okay, yeah, I went out there with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did Yoshi get to keep that one or do we have to send it back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what Yoshi did?  He had it, he took it down to G4, he had it in the loading dock there,  everyone got fired.  He could have taken it with him when everyone got laid off and fired  and he left it sitting there for so long that they sent it back to the manufacturer.  Well, that was good.  He was so wrong.  No, that stinks.  No, he just was too lazy to take the darn thing.  You got a $10,000 laser printer.  Take the darn thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's funny because this...  Laser printer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry, yeah, laser, it is a laser printer.  It is a laser printer.  No, it's not a laser printer.  Yeah, it's a laser printer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It prints on metal.  It works just like a dot matrix, well, no, just like a printer,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  except like a dot matrix printer, but it shoots a high-end laser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Squid Labs, that's probably what they're using to do their etching  and they're making some good money on that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, Phil is starting a business where he's going open source with it.  So I think he's developing an open source laser that he's going to release the plans for  and you can build it at home and then go out and...  Well, it's only 25 watts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not that powerful a laser.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So now instead of all the little kids shooting their little red dots on the movie screen  in the movie theater, they'll be actually ripping little holes in it from their screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they'll be writing their initials on someone's forehead with this thing.  This doesn't sound right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, Kevin, you got the DIG logo laced onto your laptop.  Yeah.  How's it look?  It looks pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I got it done on the black MacBook and it comes out...  Oh, you got it done on plastic.  No, well, this isn't really plastic.  It's something, it's some kind of aluminum.  Oh, the black MacBook is not plastic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's not plastic.  Oh, all this time I thought I had a plastic notebook.  That's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, maybe the front, the surfaces where you type, I feel the back of it.  It's metal.  So it's etched into there, huh?  Yeah, so it's etched in there, but yeah.  Is there somewhere we can see this?  Yeah, it's on actually, I put the clip on YouTube.  Oh, cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we just search for laser and dig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, just bookmark it in delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it sounds like I should do the Dvorak.org slash blog logo on there.  Do that on your forehead.  You should.  Well, no, I don't think so, but I think on a laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you do it on Dignation or was it...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, we showed it on, well, I have it on Dignation every single week, so you can see the logo on the back side.  Right, I've seen it on Dignation.  Yeah, that's where I've seen it.  But you didn't do it on the show.  No, we didn't do it on the show.  Wow.  Next time you have, so I was talking to Phil about this, and next time any one of us puts on kind of a live event, you know, a hell of live Twitter or something, he'll bring the laser out and then offer free Twitter logos.  Okay, I'm calling him right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Call him up and see if he can...  Well, we're doing a show Tuesday at 21st Amendment Brew Pub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If he's in town, I know he was in New York for a while, but yeah, hit him up, email him, and if he's in town, have him come out and laser edge people's notebooks.  That would be so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That would be so cool.  I'd love to do that.  Everybody could go leave with a Twit logo on their notebook.  That'd be awesome.  Is it safe?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, sure.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was some alignment issues, like you have to make sure...  Well, if you screw up, you've got a bad logo burned on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What about potentially blowing out that little fluorescent bulb that's behind the case?  You know, right behind the LCD, there's a light bulb back there.  You'd have to go pretty deep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it doesn't really engrave that deep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You do get some awesome smoke from some plastics and woods and things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and remember, the manufacturers, they're not too happy about this if you have to do warranty repairs or things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, in your case, Kevin, you could just say, do you know who I am?  Oh, boy.  Do you ever do that, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  Nobody knows who I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's because you're not going, do you know who I am?  I'm going to play the...  Oh, this is Leah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  David Prager just sent me a link to the YouTube of Leah etching her MacBook Pro.  But yeah, and you had that MacBook on Dig, right?  On Dignation?  Yeah, yeah, on Dignation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, she is actually dating Daniel Berka, who's the Dig designer.  You're kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  Oh, well, well, well.  Yeah, she's cool.  Well, well, well.  Well, I'm impressed.  Any woman who can write Django is okay in my book.  Yeah, she's a Java developer.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  She's a developer, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, so anything else we're going to see...  Wait, I'm getting a big echo back.  No, no, hold on a second.  John, what are you doing?  John, what are you doing?  This is our friend, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you did?  No, that's not it.  I thought I was just saying...  It's etch-a-sketches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've seen that one, though.  That's the guy that does the etch-a-sketch art.  I've seen that one, though.  That's the guy that does the etch-a-sketch art.  All right, so any big announcements at CES that are going to be surprises?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've already kind of covered what Macworld's going to be.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No, nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's talking about the displays and the HD.  They're saying CES is going to be evolutionary, not revolutionary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, one of the things I expect to see that's going to be maybe a surprise because of the  collapse of E3.  I think a lot of the gaming companies are going to gravitate towards CES.  And they're going to pump something up over there.  The other thing I'm looking at is I think there may be a little bit more of a push for  this EVDO cell phone technology, which I find kind of distressing, which is the CDMA online  internet connection game that's being played right now.  EVDO is huge.  Yeah, I know it's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it exclusively Verizon?  Right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a technology that a bunch of...  It's essentially what Qualcomm sells.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's who you do the deal with.  If you're a notebook vendor and you want to use that new Vista Microsoft sideshow display  thing, you can keep your Outlook synchronized and your calendar synchronized even when your  notebook is off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Has anybody released a sideshow laptop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't comment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So maybe we'll see some of those at CES.  Could you say that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe not on the show floor, but probably in a suite or two, in a back room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You want to describe what sideshow is?  Because it's kind of a neat idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sideshow is a mostly Microsoft innovation that you attach to your notebook and it can  be anywhere from a one line screen to something the size of a small LCD window.  It's got its own microcontroller that just sips power and it's connected usually to the  Wi-Fi and or EVDO cellular connection.  So it's sitting there even when your notebook is off receiving updates and calendar stuff  and so forth.  And it just shows up in this little LCD window which probably isn't even going to be backlit  on most machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why do I want this?  Because they couldn't sell the Spotwatch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why do I want this?  Because the norm in business today is that you're accessible 24-7 and this thing will  even keep you updated while you're asleep and while the notebook's asleep.  The one thing that it's really, really good for is for these mobile professionals and  everything else.  When you're in the airport and you see all of these guys doing one last sync before they  get on the plane.  Yeah, I've done it.  Yeah, we all do it.  This obviates the need for that because you're always in sync and when you get on the plane  you just supposedly shut off your cellular radio and your Wi-Fi and then you can sit  there and watch the movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's the onus for the propensity of words like Crackberry because people get addicted  to stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I imagine this would be built into the lid of the laptop or somehow attached to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly, or the actual side, the vertical height in some cases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, because it could be a one-line display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is more crap we don't need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You heard it here first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this is a pretty decent idea, not for you and me but for the people who really  are on the go all the time.  There's this whole kind of subtle thing where it's rude to have your Crackberry out on the  table during the meeting because it's beeping and scrolling messages and you can't keep  your damn eyes off it.  You can't have your cell phone out for the same reason but you can have your notebook  on the table closed off and yet you can look at the little sideshow display and see all  the stuff that is demanding your attention, schedule changes and what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  And no one's going to notice you doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just checking my laptop edge right now.  Don't mind me.  I'm going to look at my laptop.  You could just glance at your watch and people know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Obviously.  But anyway, it's one less thing to carry.  They're looking to replace Blackberrys with this thing.  It kind of fulfills the role of the pager once did except that it also syncs with outlooks  so you're always up to date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like replacing cigarettes with cigars.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  Well, I think we're going to wrap this up because I don't see any other big announcements  coming out of either Macworld or CES but maybe we'll be proven wrong and we'll be back next  week to talk about it.  I hope you'll join us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We definitely have an exciting show next week because it's all action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Action.  Action's going to happen.  Usually January is considered a slow news month but not in tech.  It's a big month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, by the way, that laser etching thing that Phil Tronford-Make is doing, it's called Adafruit,  adafruit.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's in New York City, unfortunately.  I don't sure.  We're so unfortunate about that.  Well, for me, it's unfortunate.  It's good for you, Bill.  Actually, it's cool.  Kevin says you could just stop in and make an appointment like a tattoo apartment.  You just walk in and get your laptop tattooed.  Not my arm.  I think it's probably a good idea.  Don't laser your arm, laser your laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They got some really cool photos on their website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Adafruit.com.  Yeah, slash laser, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you'd find a link there anyway.  Right.  And the photos are pretty dope.  I mean, you can laser etch an iPod Nano.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's amazing what they can do.  It really looks good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not the Nano.  I mean the little shuffle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they've got what is that?  Glenn Gould's signature on a shuffle?  I think that's cool.  Yeah, it's Glenn Gould.  That's neat.  Or this one is a laughing squid.  There's a lot of laughing squids.  I guess that's where the original idea came from.  I like this one.  It looks like it's the universal symbol for do not steal his laptop.  It's a triangle with a reaching hand and a line across it.  I don't know if that'll work, but it's a good idea.  We'll be back next Friday, or next Sunday I should say, to talk about what happened at CES and Macworld.  Maybe we'll have some great things to say.  I want to thank you all for joining us.  Bill, do you have a website that you want us to send people to?  No, actually I don't.  I ask you this every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to have to steal Bill to put some stuff up on my site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Come on, Bill.  Get a MySpace page, something, anything.  But we always love Bill McCrone, and it's great to have you.  I bet you're happy you're not on the way to Vegas right about now.  I'm very happy.  Yeah, me too.  I couldn't be happier.  John, you probably got to get on an airplane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going Monday, coming back Wednesday.  Don't kid yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Short trip.  Staying at the Bellagio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, actually I'm staying at the Paris.  I don't care.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As long as it's not the circus, circus.  Remember that, Kevin, when they put us up in the circus, circus?  That was awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I stayed with my parents that live in Vegas because I prefer that over the circus,  circus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the hotel where they bolt the lamps to the table because you might want to steal  them.  Absolutely.  And the remote control.  I hate that.  David Prager, do you remember that?  That they bolted the remote controls?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who are we with?  Well, there's just clowns everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's awful.  Nobody can sleep well when there's clowns everywhere.  Clowns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who are we with?  Was it you, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I stayed at the circus and I stayed at the Luxor and I'm somewhere else.  Are you talking about the clowns from ZDTV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now the...  Greg Drebben was bolted to the table.  Who was it?  Maybe it was just a...  I'm not sure.  I don't want to get into any trouble, but was stole a lamp from the Hard Rock Cafe?  I mean, the Hard Rock Hotel?  From the lobby.  Why?  I don't remember.  It was a strange thing to do.  It was a group of us.  They put it under their coat and it ran out the door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's really funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It doesn't ring a bell?  I'm pretty sure it was a Tech TV type.  It wasn't you, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it wasn't me.  Chris Krause?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It might have been...  Yeah, yeah.  If it was anybody, it would have been Chris Krause.  Bill McCrone, johncdivorak.org, slash blog.  We thank you for joining us.  David Prager, revision three.  Anything you want to tell us about revision three?  Now that Kevin's here, he can be your counselor, your conciliary.  He can keep you from saying anything bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to plug MacBreak weekly.  MacBreak says coverage of Macworld next week.  Thank you.  Will you come out for that?  I want to, except I'm going to be...  Yeah, let's see.  I'm going to be at CES on Monday and Tuesday.  You're going to CES.  We're shooting two episodes of Indigital.  Oh, that's cool.  Yeah, well, that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, that's a gadget show.  That makes sense.  I'll tell you.  I'll tell you.  And then I'm coming back for...  That rant I did for you about the Zune.  Oh my, that was everywhere.  It was awesome.  It got me in a lot of heat.  I don't mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was funny.  Speaking of Macworld, though, I do want to plug that Dignation, starring Kevin Rose, is  going to be doing a live taping on the 10th.  Wednesday.  And on the 10th in the North Hall at Macworld.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you can still get free passes to Macworld.  Anybody that uses the code DIG when they're going to get a pass, you don't have to pay  the $40 completely free.  Oh, cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good, I can get in.  I'm coming.  I'll be there, Kevin.  And that's at 4 p.m. on the 10th.  MacBreak Weekly will be Tuesday at the 21st Amendment Brewery, and that is on 2nd Street,  just a little ways down from the convention center.  And that should be a lot of fun.  It starts at 6 p.m.  Lots of Mac luminaries.  That'll be...  And if I can get Phil Turone, we'll blaze any logo you want into your laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then you guys are releasing a whole bunch of little shorts, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Macworld's going to do wall-to-wall coverage.  I mean, MacBreak's going to do wall-to-wall coverage of Macworld.  Yeah, it's going to be a lot of fun.  It's going to be interesting.  It's just an experiment.  We'll see how it goes.  You guys get Steve Jobs from the interview?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Never happen.  Never happen.  He won't talk to me.  He won't talk to anyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, not since that volleyball incident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But twig.tv if you want to see Macworld coverage.  I don't think we're going to do any CES coverage, so revision3.org if you want to see CES coverage.  And if you want to see Dignation...  Do we have .org?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I say .org?  .com.  You're not a nonprofit.  Let's make that very clear.  Any profit, welcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, we have revision3.org.  I had to check.  Do you?  Yeah.  I don't think...  They don't care if you get .org, .net, .com.  You can't get .gov and you can't get .mil.  TheBroken.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  TheBroken.org.  That's it.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  TheBroken's a nonprofit.  Because no one will advertise it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No one will ever advertise it.  That's why.  Dignation.com for Kevin's show with Alex Albrecht and of course dig.com.  That's where the big bucks are going to be.  Congratulations on your second round of funding.  That's wonderful.  Oh, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And dig the Twit podcast.  dig.com slash podcast.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you.  That new podcast feature is fantastic.  Number two.  Number two.  Twit.  Yeah.  Guess what's number one.  Just take a wild guess.  Will we ever catch up with Dignation?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're close.  We're close.  You told your entire audience to go dig Twit.  You passed.  We're only 2,000 votes away.  I can't believe that it's 12,337 votes for Dignation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  10,242 for Twit.  Hey, what's the deal with getting...  Where's Cranky Eeks?  I'm surprised you're that high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo, what's the deal with Twit getting the ninth best podcast for Time Magazine?  Oh, I forgot to mention that.  I'm shocked that you haven't brought that up at the beginning of the show.  I completely forgot that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Time Magazine named us one of the 10 best podcasts of the year.  You are so modest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's...  Well, no, I'm just baffled.  Believe me, he's not that modest.  John knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, the worst thing is, and I sent him an email, but Time Magazine's a black hole.  They put a link to my radio show in there, not to Twit.  I don't understand why.  Isn't that bizarre?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's modern journalism at its best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll tell you.  They can't use Google?  They couldn't go Google, Twit.  If you Google Twit...  It's unbelievable.  The first thing that comes up is Twit.TV.  I don't understand it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twit is very popular.  I get a ton of mail every time I'm on one of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's inexplicable, but we are very grateful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Explicable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very explicable.  You do a great job.  Well, thank you.  You all do, too, and it's great to have you.  Kevin, David, Bill, John, have a great week.  Wherever, whatever conference you're going to, we'll re-adjourn this afterwards.  I'm just going to stay here in my little office and read Time Magazine.  What a fabulous journal that is.  Just love that magazine.  Another Twit is in the can.
