Transcript:  Veronica's shadow goes here and it should be another person next to her.  There really is tech news to talk about this week.  Let's start with, I want to start with Amazon because the Kindle announcements weren't all that.  They get a nicer screen.  They're a little thinner, whatever.  I thought what Bezos did was really interesting though because he brought people to him.  He didn't have a big onstage announcement.  And then he said, oh, and by the way, we've got this little button now where you press called the Mayday button that within 15 seconds, 24 hours a day, seven days a week,  including right after Christmas when everybody gets new Kindles, someone, a real person will show up on the screen and talk to you and help you with whatever problem you want.

Start time: 283.06
End time: 299.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Unless your problem is your Internet connectivity.  One assumes, which I would like to point out, and I'm not trying to be a big buzzkill here, so to speak.  That is probably the number one problem that new Kindle owners have getting online.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Other than that, though, good idea.

Start time: 300.39
End time: 330.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I mean, is it?  How helpful are people?  I don't know.  Like, I don't know if somebody is going to be able to let me if you are and tablets are not exactly trying to crack the final code here.  You know, they're designed to be user friendly devices.  If somebody can't figure out how to use a Kindle on something, hitting the Mayday button, how much is a that person on the other end with?  I mean, who we have no guarantee exactly how helpful these people are going to be.  If tech support is any.

Start time: 331.16
End time: 335.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have a promise Amazon has said they'll be trained and they'll be able to take over your tablet with your permission.

Start time: 336.06
End time: 372.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Is there anybody that is that like, do we ever get word that like, oh, call this 800 number?  They're not trained at all.  They have no idea what the hell they're talking about.  They're going to be on the same tree as the people that would be on the phone.  It's an interesting idea to, you know, say, oh, well, if you look at them, it's going to be a different experience.  But beyond what I think Amazon is smart to do, which is to be kind of the anti Google or Google is almost famously anti customer support.  They're pro customer support.  I think that's an interesting idea to establish that they are making strides in that direction.  But in terms of how helpful it's going to be, it won't be that.

Start time: 372.90
End time: 403.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Does anyone here use Amazon remembers or Amazon finds Amazon remembers where you take a picture of something and you say, I want this, find it on Amazon.  So they already staff people like this around the clock because they can usually get back to you within like 20 minutes or less.  You're just out of the store and you take a picture of something.  They'll email you right away and say, here it is on the site.  So they already do this kind of staffing.  I don't think people know about it all that much, but I use it a lot and I think they're pretty successful.  They've already figured out the model of how to staff that.

Start time: 404.44
End time: 445.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I actually do think that they are going to provide good customer service.  And I think, though, the more important point is that they are attempting to show that they're going to provide good customer service and that that is really valuable to people.  People love that.  That was one of the weird things that weirdly rather that was one of the things that people loved about the nook.  And one of the ways that the nook built such a sort of cultish fan base was on the promise that you could take your nook into a Barnes and Noble store anywhere and get help.  And the Kindle is a slightly different user interface from Android, from iOS.  I could actually see if your problem again was not getting online, which I bet you that 80 percent of the problems are.  I'm not just saying that I really know.  I think there's going to be a lot of people like I'm hitting the Mayday button.

Start time: 446.24
End time: 447.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And I'm pressing the any thought of that.

Start time: 450.40
End time: 461.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And so probably if you press the Mayday button, it says you're not online.  Go to www.kindle.slash Mayday.  They probably will have that through.  Call them.  That's a good idea.  Guys, do that.

Start time: 461.96
End time: 462.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They haven't been good.

Start time: 463.26
End time: 488.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they are trying to sell this to people who are using it as their only machine.  Right.  And so they need to provide some phone support.  I mean, Amazon definitely is saying this is the Mayday button is meant not for us, but for the person like my mom.  My mom has an iPhone.  That's it.  She doesn't have a computer.  So she doesn't have another machine.  Yeah.  And I think that's what they're hoping with the Mayday button is for those people.  This is going to be their only computer because tablets are becoming that for some people.  How does that work?

Start time: 489.90
End time: 512.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If the Mayday button is what they're hinging their holiday sales on, and this is what I thought at the time,  then the Amazon Kindle line may be in more trouble than we thought.  The Kindle tablet line, because it didn't seem to me to be or maybe it doesn't matter.  Right.  Maybe they're like, look, these are great.  They're selling great.  We're perfectly happy with them.  We added this new thing.  It's super.  They're all about customers.  So, you know, they're getting it from Zip.  No, it's not their Siri.

Start time: 513.26
End time: 521.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the we've we've the tablet.  We can't like innovate on the form anymore.  We need to throw in a software feature that people will buzz about.  OK.

Start time: 523.37
End time: 548.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I mean, yes.  That's what I mean.  OK. Yeah.  No, I mean, it is a thing that they can put on a press release and we can lead Buzz out loud with, you know, like it.  You don't work on that show anymore.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I get I get, you know, sorry.  Take you right back.  I know.  So, yeah, it is a discussion point.  But beyond, you know, tech pundit talking heads, is it something that anybody cares about?

Start time: 549.26
End time: 596.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, do people look at Amazon outside of the Kindle and think great customer service?  If so, then this is an extension of that belief, right?  This is a confirmation that not only do we provide excellent service and value online, but we also put that kind of energy into the mobile experience, which, like you were saying earlier, is totally like the other side of what Google does,  which is provide none of that.  Exactly.  And that's perfect for the that's perfect for the moms and the dads and the grandpas and the people that just don't really like ingest and involve themselves in the technology aspect of things all the time.  That's that's possibly good enough.  But I don't know if it's enough to completely hinge sales around a holiday season around.  It's just kind of what hardware manufacturers need to do right now.  The hardware is hard to push any further.  So what else can we do outside of that software service?

Start time: 597.42
End time: 627.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I'll tell you what Natalie was saying about the like look at look for it on Amazon thing, I think is a way more interesting and awesome solution for customer service because they can send that to somebody that they can train that may not even speak English.  That just knows, look for this, you know, type these letters into a machine, search for it on Amazon, and then send an email super quick.  Like they can staff that in a way that I don't it's going to be harder to staff somebody to look presentable and speak in a in a way that's going to be.

Start time: 629.16
End time: 650.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And don't forget that makes me think May Day is going to be used not just for tech support, right, not just for connectivity, not for how do I change my settings, but for I want to find this item in your store Amazon because Amazon's trying to make money off the Kindle by getting you to shop.  They'll be providing that service.  So it'll just be a shopping buddy.  It's no, it's no holds right.  It's your Amazon Clippy.  That sounds like a really fun job though actually.

Start time: 651.04
End time: 657.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm just saying if you're having trouble finding a job in Seattle.  You need a shopping assistant.  Shopping, Amazon shopping assistant.

Start time: 657.90
End time: 670.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I do think that it is staffed in Seattle.  I remember the last, the last iteration of that of that shopping buddy thing was staffed in Seattle.  So I think they are probably English speakers.  I mean yeah if they're, if they are.  They're Seattle.

Start time: 671.29
End time: 724.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If they're staffing it.  Kidding, kidding.  They're stoked about a lot of things, but otherwise.  Bumbershoes instead of umbrellas.  It's gooey duck is how you say it.  I do think though that it's cool.  I mean I think if they staff it appropriately and you really can and you're online and you press this button like if my mom could press this button.  I think it's kind of neat.  I mean I think it's a neat value add.  I don't think it's the be all end all.  I mean like is it a demoable feature?  Right.  I mean I still did when my dad called me and said hey I want to get a tablet.  Like a seven inch tablet.  I said get a Samsung Galaxy Tab.  Because I said do you want to read books on it?  No.  I'm going to keep my Kindle because I like the e-reader and then I couldn't find a reason to recommend a Kindle Fire to him.  So it's not necessarily the feature that's going to put somebody over the top because I did not think to myself my dad's going to need a solution for customer service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There probably is something we could come up with to talk about regarding Apple this week because there always is.  There's like 12 stories in here.  Apple's biggest two things that I could think of are the controversy quote unquote about sales figures.  Is the iPhone 5S and 5C a success?  And I think more interesting Tim Cook's rumored upcoming meeting with Carl Icahn on Monday where Carl Icahn is known as an activist investor who companies often fear.  And Tim Cook seems to be embracing him.  Does the panel have a preference?  Do we care about the iPhone sales?  I think the sales are fine.  I don't think they're indicative one way or another of whether Apple is in trouble or not.

Transcript:  I think that I think most of the world is now programmed to purchase iPhones and until such time as the programming wears off.  It's not that it's not that remarkable.  It would be remarkable if they were not selling iPhones.  I bought one.

Start time: 821.27
End time: 824.31

Start time: 825.27

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Finally.  All these years of listening.  I can now talk back.

Start time: 828.98
End time: 843.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  No.  Yeah.  I mean, I think you switched.  No, I did.  Although I did.  I had an Android and then I stopped using an Android because my five got stolen.  So I had a stopgap Android and then I bought the 5S when it came out.  Oh, see, that doesn't totally count.

Start time: 843.90
End time: 845.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it doesn't.  You had to get a phone.

Start time: 846.86
End time: 862.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I did have to get a phone and I was really excited and I do enjoy it.  But you make it do the thing.  The what?  I think I'll tell you the touch ID.  Can you finger it?  Yes, I can finger it.  Boom.  It just got fingered.  Is that inappropriate?  Not if you don't make it inappropriate.

Start time: 864.00

Transcript:  Can you do it with your toe?  Now we'll really get there.  No.

Start time: 875.70
End time: 905.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I agree that it is not the story that it would be if sales figures were really down.  You know, it is something that is on the trajectory and we can talk about whether or not it is  as big as the numbers initially seem to be.  But I agree with you that there's not really anything here that we can say like, well,  obviously they're in gigantic trouble or obviously this is what it was four years ago  where it was absolutely just dominating everything.  Yeah, it is.

Start time: 906.14
End time: 913.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's an iPhone.  It's on sale.  It sold about as many or maybe a little bit more than the last one or something like that.  But the icon thing, that is interesting.  That's interesting.

Start time: 913.96
End time: 930.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know what's going on there.  That is really dishing.  It's either.  It could be a lot of things.  I think it could be a change in Carl Icahn saying I'm no longer going to go after the  chaff.  I want to go after some wheat.  And I think Apple is the right kind of wheat for me to go after.  Well, can we get a I'm making bread.

Start time: 931.90
End time: 938.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  We had a brief conversation on Carl Icahn for those people who don't are not aware of  his history.  Activist investor.

Start time: 939.52
End time: 945.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Probably most people remember him from insider trading in the 80s, which he escaped from.  He did not get in.  I don't think he was ever prosecuted.

Start time: 946.14
End time: 972.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He still feels like he's pushing the line there because Carl Icahn is the guy who tweeted  very recently, like had a great conversation with Tim.  Everybody should buy Apple.  I already bought a ton.  Yeah.  And then Apple stock went.  Yeah.  Like had a massive spike and everybody was like, is that legal?  Like, are you allowed to say that I had a really good meeting with Tim Cook and then I  bought a bunch of Apple stock.  That's outsider trading.  Yeah.  That's just like the most obvious.  And then I'll make a bunch of money after you buy the stock.  So thanks for that.  What is wrong with this system?

Start time: 973.77
End time: 1009.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if you don't dump, then the pump is OK.  I think.  Yeah.  Isn't this also kind of a pump?  Can it be like insider cheerleading?  To finish for those who don't understand Carl Icahn with Yahoo and with Dell kind of  waited in at their most troubled moment and messed with them.  And Marvel too.  That's a great example.  Dell most recently, Michael Dell had the deal.  He was going to take the company private.  He had the equity investors.  It was all done.  And Carl Icahn comes in and goes, I don't think that's a very good deal and caused trouble.  Got the stock price to rise.  Made some money off of it.  That's usually his M.O.  So what he's doing with Apple.

Start time: 1010.40
End time: 1012.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's why it's interesting because his M.O. is usually you're in trouble.  Yes.

Start time: 1014.26
End time: 1031.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But maybe they are in trouble, not in reality, but stock price wise, because there has been  a decline.  And maybe on a Carl Icahn spreadsheet, it's like, I don't care if Apple's truly in trouble  or not.  Here's a stock price that is declined by the percentage that triggers off my alerts.  That means I go in and buy it and try to get it to lift back up.  Right.

Transcript:  And there's no question that Apple's stock price has suffered a decline that Apple seems  to think is unfair, that Tim Cook has said is the result of a lot of misunderstanding.  What's interesting to me, though, is that he is so publicly taking meetings with Carl  Icahn, which is it's like one of those things where it's good and bad.  I mean, Carl Icahn obviously is the only one tweeting about how he's going to have dinner  with Tim.  Apple's not like, oh, we're seeking the advice of Carl Icahn to make sure that our stock  price is where it's going to be.  But it still does seem to suggest an openness to outside ideas that was previously lacking  at Apple and or, oh my God, we need to plan bad.

I mean, they did almost double their sales this year from the last one.  Like nine million is nothing to sneeze at.  So I don't know, there's this sort of misconception or I don't know, there's a, we're not exactly  sure how to think of this sometimes because it's not like the hot, cool thing, but it's  hardly hurting for sales.  These were still impressive sales.

So there's another meeting coming up.  So that doesn't change much of what we're talking about here, but this is an ongoing  relationship.

Transcript:  Well, I mean, they're definitely not buddies.  Like this is a budding business relationship for whatever reason.  I don't think it is a bad, to be clear, I don't think it's a bad idea for Tim Cook to  take meetings with Carl Icahn.  I think that's a great idea.  Their stock has suffered, whether it's unfair or not.  They have been in trouble to that extent.  They feel like they're in trouble.  They're not right.  They've got bajillion.  And that's what's so interesting is on the one hand, not in trouble.  Stock went way up after the announcement of the nine million phones sold.  They still have more money than Detroit.  Way more, right?  More cash than some other countries.  Yeah.  So they can finally build the RoboCop.  Apple could build RoboCop probably and probably have tried.  Nevertheless, given Carl Icahn's history as an investor who comes along to help out  companies that are in trouble, it's just an interesting, it's hard not to apply that  historical perspective to the fact that he's meeting with Tim Cook at a time when  everybody's like, is Apple so cool?  Yeah.  It's all like, of course it's inevitable hand-wringing, but it doesn't make it not  interesting.  He's the maggot that cleans the wound.

Transcript:  Okay, but number one, the idea that a CEO of any company, let alone Apple, would take  meetings with investors is really not news, because you would assume that they are meeting  with people, that there are meetings all the time with people.  A, we know about it.  B, Carl Icahn is who he is.  But I don't know what that necessarily says.  I don't know if that is anything to read into, besides the fact that now all I can think  of is Steve Jobs coming back as Robocop.

Transcript:  All I can think of is maggots.  But you have to admit that Carl Icahn is very publicly having...  He is deliberately...  Outwardly, very deliberately.  These leaks about the upcoming meeting, I suspect.

End time: 1273.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And part of it is that, I mean, part of it, to be clear, may not be trouble related at  all.  It's that most investors, including Carl Icahn, want a stock buyback.  What day was that tweet?  Like a huge amount of this was reported September 26th.  Oh no, this is when he tweeted last month about the upcoming meeting.  So that was the last meeting.  We'll see what he says again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, absolutely.  Because that's what all the shareholders want.

Just isn't as dramatic as, and the company is failing, right?

Transcript:  Let's talk about the Microsoft Surface announcements.  Surface Pro 2 and the Surface 2.  The Surface Pro 2 is the successor to the Surface Pro.  And it has better specs and it's fancier and a little slimmer.  The Surface 2 is the successor to the Windows RT tablet.  So they took the RT out of it, but it's still the RT operating system in there.  Is everybody caught up?  Yeah, okay.  Tegra 4 processor in the Surface 2, improved battery life, $449.  I think the Surface Pro 2 is easier to explain because they've sold them.  Most of the manufacturers who got on board with the Surface Pro are still making Surface Pros.  So they're likely to do some Surface Pro 2 type stuff.  I mean the Windows 8 tablets.  Which was the better reviewed of the two initial.  Nobody's making Windows RT tablets anymore except Microsoft, but they're still riding this horse.  Is that smart?

Start time: 1594.87
End time: 1605.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By $50 or something, right?  Yeah.  And it does most of the things.  It may not have all the apps, but...  It does not have all the apps.  You can get, no, I know it doesn't.  I mean, I think that is a perception problem.

Start time: 1606.81
End time: 1630.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I think that's a really hard one to overcome, right?  People say, but does it do the things that my iPad does or that my friend's iPad does?  It's just an easier sell versus, well, the Surface looks totally different from anything that you've used before.  It doesn't have all the same apps.  It has most of the ones you're probably going to...  I don't know.  Who...  I don't know.  I feel like I am unfairly biased because I used it and just could not.  I thought it was got off.

Start time: 1631.08

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a Surface RT and I love the hardware.  This is exactly the same way I felt about the Playbook.  I love the hardware.  I actually love the QNX operating system on the BlackBerry Playbook.  The Windows RT operating system is okay.  It frustrates me because, A, I'm like, okay, I need an IRC app.  And then I can pay $3 for an app or I can get a free one that just doesn't work.  It's better than it was.  They have an official Twitter app.  They always had a great Netflix app.  So it depends on what your app needs are.  But then you go to that desktop and you're like, oh, I have a desktop and I have a second browser and I have the ability to do Office but only in the desktop.  And the desktop interface doesn't work very well on touchscreen.  I frankly think they should have not done the desktop on Windows RT.

Start time: 1669.94
End time: 1695.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know why they did desktop on Windows RT because actually the tiles are attractive.  It is overwhelming and the tiles are completely confusing.  And if you don't have very many apps on there, it's just sort of a mess of what looks like ads, to be honest, because you're like, I don't know what this content is.  It's not anything that I put on here.  But to then have a desktop on there is completely baffling, completely baffling.  Every time I use it, I did the accidental little Windows split thing and then I could never get the Windows back.

End time: 1723.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I think your sort of muscle memory starts to remember that.  Once you have that happening.  And I still think it's too early to give up.  I mean, they've got their cost function and their production function.  They know what supply, demand and how much they can afford to lose for however much more they push.  So I think that if we would fault them for giving up on this by now, I think.  Everyone else has.

Transcript:  Everyone would applaud them for giving up.  I would applaud them for failing faster on RT.  I really would.  I think that it's OK to fail fast on one version.  It's possible that I mean, look, the surface.

Start time: 1737.90
End time: 1747.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe that's an investment in the future that we don't completely understand.  So I give you that.  But I'm talking about in general, like, you know, second generation.  I still think it's too early.

Start time: 1747.90
End time: 1754.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, I mean, is this them not wanting to give up the ghost on the lower price point, which would be more of a consumer facing device?

Start time: 1755.04
End time: 1804.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's it.  I think they look at the atom or they look at the atom processor.  They're like nobody is building for that yet.  So we're going to continue to go on arm processors because that's where you keep the price point down and we can have a four hundred forty nine dollar tablet out there and say, hey, guess what?  You can get a tablet that runs Windows and does all the great Windows things like Office and you can't get that from Apple and they're going to charge you more.  That's been their marketing pitch and they're going to continue to do that.  But I think it is just marketing pitch until you talk about the surface pro two.  And Natalie, that's where I do agree with you.  If we're talking about the surface pro two, even at eight hundred ninety nine dollars with a Haswell processor, you've got great battery life.  You get all the Windows things now that they have this dock that they announced and it can actually be not just your tablet, but your desktop as well.  All of a sudden, that seems to be the other end of the scale from the surface.  And I are T based.

Start time: 1805.12
End time: 1835.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I think there's nothing wrong with saying we have a premium product.  Right. Apple's gotten away with that for a long time.  I would lean into the surface pro two and I would say this is a device that that's better than a MacBook Air, for example, because it's smaller, it's more portable and it's a full version of Windows and it's at least two hundred dollars.  I would love to see the pro two at seven ninety nine.  I think that would be a super compelling price point.  But that is a good machine.  The surface are T does has so much explaining to do that.  It doesn't make sense to say you have a cheaper thing.  You're just confusing your market.

Start time: 1836.74
End time: 1843.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Is that Microsoft at that point kind of giving up on the consumer side of things and maybe targeting more for business because it's more expensive and maybe designed for that.  I agree with Natalie.

Start time: 1855.64
End time: 1894.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, but it's like deliver the quality and the functionality and people will pay the premium for it.  And that is I think what we're seeing is two different philosophies.  And Microsoft doesn't want to give up on the idea that price point and a checklist of things that the surface can do versus an iPad mini, for example, will sell devices.  And I don't think I think that they are more on the right path with the pro.  We're just hey, look, let's let's compare this to an air.  Let's say if you are a Windows user, now you don't have to think about giving up what you normally do.  Here's this new device that will solve a lot of problems for you.  And here's the price that you have to justify in your mind to spend on it.

And they're just distracting themselves by trying to pitch them both.  They confuse it.  I mean, I dare you to find a sort of an average consumer who can tell you what the difference between the R.T.  and the pro is.  I think dropping R.T.

Start time: 1915.87
End time: 1930.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  from the name is an effort to try to reduce the confusion.  And I think it does the opposite because suddenly you say, oh, there's the surface and the surface pro.  They must be the same thing.  But one of them is just a little beefier for the professional user.  And they're not they're not they're not the same operating system.

Start time: 1931.08
End time: 1944.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or as long as we're having both out loud, deja vu, this is exactly the conversations we've been having for years about the way they tier their operating system.  So when are they going to understand that like the new Windows titles are really confusing?

End time: 1948.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 1949.90
End time: 1962.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly.  This is just a weird.  This is like a strange brain groove that Microsoft cannot get out of that.  They feel like they've got to have all these different options.  This is less confusing than.  This is.  But I mean, like is.  They do it for us.

In terms of a consumer focused like new world that they have found themselves in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, because because one more thing about the surface thing, because if you look at the price point difference and people are understand that they're used to looking at iPads and a iPad.  Costs this much money and then the more expensive, you know, by one hundred fifty or two hundred dollars version just has more memory.  That is not a metaphor that Microsoft wants to deal with when their higher price model has so much more functionality.  So people will look at this and say, well, why would I pay this extra X amount or think that these two surfaces are the same thing just because they're named the same thing and they're separated by a couple hundred dollars.  And they're not there.  They're they're two completely different devices and one by all accounts is good and one sucks.

That's where the problem is.  They're both called Windows and Windows Pro on the surface means something different than Windows Pro on the desktop because all the versions of Windows that I buy for the desktop can run all the same apps for the most part.  But not both the windows that I buy with the surface can run all the same apps unless they're in the tiled interface in which they can.  But did I buy the tiled interface? No, I didn't, because I think that's annoying.

Start time: 2090.08
End time: 2118.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the fix for that, it's a very quiet show.  The fix for that is Microsoft saying, look, eventually we want all the apps to work on all the platforms.  We don't care if it's Windows Phone or a surface.  And let's leave aside the fact that that is almost impossible given what they have with Arm.  Let's say they do ditch Arm and now they say, OK, you'll have tiled interface apps only on the phone and those will run on Windows on your desktop.  And then that will also have desktop apps as well.  Is that a good idea? Do we want that?

Start time: 2118.90
End time: 2138.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, I think we do. I think we do.  And because if you think about how that would work in the Apple universe, that you could update certain apps inside of your desktop experience.  I think that's why this story on the verge about how they're working on a universal app store.  Yeah, I think that's a really good idea. If it works, I think it's really hard to do.  Oh, it is.

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, Natalie, you're absolutely right.  It sounds so promising and it would be so seamless for users,  which is exactly the thing that Microsoft has been promising its users now for nigh on 15 years, I think.  I mean, I remember Bill Gates coming to E3 10 years ago and talking about how Windows was finally going to extend to Xbox and you would have a gamer tag that was available to you across your devices and across all your platforms.  I mean, they cannot figure out this integration thing.  And there have been a million different exposés on Microsoft that talk about why that they foster internal competition instead of platforms and divisions working together.  I mean, Apple hasn't figured it out either.

Transcript:  Well, you've got different interfaces. You've got different capabilities.  You've got different instruction sets.  This is it's a really difficult thing.  And I almost feel like, yeah, of course, I would love a land where I buy an app and I can use it on any device that you know, because I'm living in that universe.  Right.  I would actually prefer where I buy an app and I use it on any device.  Doesn't matter who manufactured it.  Since we're talking about crazy lands.  And I just, you know, when you create Photoshop for the desktop, you can't really do Photoshop for the phone.  You have to do a different program.  Maybe this is just it's a universal app like iPad where it's actually two different apps.  But when you buy one, you get the other.  And maybe it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's true that maybe it doesn't matter.  Maybe this is a dream that has been planted in our heads that we actually just need to give up on because the use cases for these devices are different that I get that I am OK with the fact that there are things I do on my desktop that I do not need to do on my tablet or my phone.  That's OK.  I do.  I would like it.  I would like it if my gamer tag rank would follow me.  That would be if we could get that eventually.  Those are the easier wins.  Those seem like the easy ones.  Exactly.  So focus on the easy wins.  There are certain things that are well integrated on the Apple platforms, obviously, like iTunes.  There are ways like I message.  Yeah, although I message seems totally broken and iOS evidence making me furious.  But that's a different conversation.  But maybe give up on trying to integrate everything and just do the platform things well.

So there are still people innovating in this that I mean, the technology goes beyond my scope of understanding.  But I do think that I think that it's too early to get up on that dream, too.  I'm not giving up on anything.  I know.  Natalie, you're so great.  You're totally the positive one today.  You're like, no, things are OK.

And I am not immune to wanting to poke fun at the man because he is hilarious in his  tromping and stomping.

But we do live in this sort of like jaded hipster world where everybody sort of just  wants everything to be cool and way more indie and way hipper than the last guy.

Oh, no.  No, this is not yet.  Let's not fall into the Nixon was a statesman.  Yeah.

It's like you forget that there's a dude and that dude at some point is driving a lot of  the strategy and he has an inability to let go.  He gets over emotionally attached to things.  He becomes convinced, furiously, angrily convinced that dirty dancing is the best.  If you idiots just do your jobs, that this will work.  Like, it's it is telling that, you know, every in great man theory, every personality is  what shapes a company.  And you can really kind of walk back the cat a little bit.  I don't know if we can read that much into this.  The great man theory of history.  Oh, please.  We can allow Steve Jobs's name to be invoked for every single decision at Apple, no matter  how small.  But like Steve Ballmer doesn't have that kind of control.  No, I'm bomber.  I interviewed him at Redmond.  You are not allowed to make eye contact with him at all when he is coming down the hall.  Nobody speaks.  Only essentials are allowed to even be in the hallway as he's coming down the hall.  Everybody else flees like the control that he has at Microsoft is absolute was was absolute.  Oh, well done.

Molly posted something on Facebook about how public education doesn't allow men to  have their emotions.  Oh, that is not good for boys.  We had this long talk on Facebook about it.

And Valve did like a kind of an augmented reality  or alternate reality game on the internet  where they had one announcement  very inconveniently timed at the start of Tech News Today  Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, 10am Pacific.  That is rude.  But they announced the Steam OS  which is their own Linux based operating system  meant to run Steam in your living room.  They announced the Steam Box.  They will have kind of a ready player one-ish.  You have to do a quest to get...  Entered to get one of the 300 prototypes of the Steam Box  and then you can test it out.  I love that.

But it's a touchpad in the middle.  Touchscreen, I mean, in the middle.  And then they have touchpads on the right and left.  So they say this is the way you'll control your Steam Box  and it feels like a regular controller  and it will also be open  so you can hack it  and it should be usable with anything that you want  because you can map the keys to go with anything you want.  That's the other way they're saying  that it's going to work on any Steam game.  It's because those keys are remappable.  So if the Steam game, like Team Fortress for instance,  is keyboard controlled,  you can match the keyboard controls  to the controls on the controller  and control Team Fortress with the hand controller.

Transcript:  So we're talking about like an OS  that's an actual full-fledged OS,  not just for gaming.  You wouldn't dual boot it with Windows.  You would actually use it and it would support browsers.  You could do it either way.  It's a boot to under the hood.  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  It should be wildly popular, one imagines,  more so than the Box.  And it was, wasn't it?  Weren't there email?  That's a good question.

Transcript:  it will be more wildly popular than the Box.  But I think that the Box has the potential  to be more wildly popular, generally speaking,  but it's a bigger question whether it will.  Because that's what Valve wants,  is everybody to go,  I'm not buying an Xbox, I'm buying a Steam Box,  because I already bought all these games on Steam  and now I'll be able to play them in my living room.

Transcript:  I think, in the case of my brother and others like him,  there's sort of this resurgence in people  who are into PC gaming because consoles are too hard  to keep up with and they're expensive  and PC gaming is sort of cool again.  And then they do a lot of their computing on tablets,  for example, and smartphones.  So they don't really need an actual desktop PC  that does all the things that a PC does.  So for example, in this one example,  who I grant is probably not emblematic of everyone,  but my brother is like my go-to for gaming.  So he's full of abandoned consoles,  but he got Windows 8 and just lost his mind with rage over it.  So this is a cheaper, better, more functional option  that creates a PC that does only what you want it to do,  which is play games.  Well, yeah, I mean, that's the thing.

Transcript:  As long as PC gamers or people following the gaming industry  thought that this would be, that now is the time,  and there have been many now is the times,  that PC gaming would kind of step to the forefront.  For PC gamers, the huge success of consoles  have obviously been a frustrating element.  You have to wonder that now as Sony, as Microsoft,  kind of zig into the, well, we're games,  but also we're everything else that you want to do in your living room.  We're also content. We're also Netflix.  We're also all these other things.  That the idea of, all right, we do none of that.  Here's what we do.  We put games in your living room, and we will have AAA titles.  Is this the moment? Is this now, of all the other,  this is the moments, the real moment,  when PC gaming comes to the living room?

Start time: 3380.74

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I kind of feel like it could be.  I really do, because I don't think that the,  I think now every box in your living room does,  I mean, I have, so Chromecast comes out, right?  And I go, well, I have six devices that I can count  that do what Chromecast does, some version of what Chromecast does.  I can currently get Netflix on six devices in my living room,  one of which is the Xbox, which is the one I never watch Netflix on.  Because I have it on a smart TV, and it's really easy,  and I have it on TiVo, which couldn't be easier,  and now I have a damn Chromecast too.  I don't think that there is as much of a need for consoles  to do all of the living room stuff as they thought  there was a couple years ago.  And so now the idea of a more dedicated box  where games don't cost 60 bucks is really appealing.  Yeah, and the idea of it's almost kind of more,

Start time: 3429.72
End time: 3487.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  and Valve has been very open about saying,  hey, listen, the people who are going to disrupt the gaming industry are Apple.  Like, it's Google.  It's people that already have a track record with a certain kind of gamer  and already have their accounts,  and now if they get to the living room in a big major way,  then all of a sudden all of this comes down.  And Valve is rushing to be in their own way,  to bring what is special about Steam,  a lot of which is very ease of delivery,  being able to download stuff day in day out,  the Steam sales, which dominate my Twitter feed with all of my gamer friends  whenever something is kind of super cheap.  It's really created a community that I think can translate.  It's just the question, here's the big thing.  How much are these going to cost,  and are they going to be sufficient to run a game,  run a AAA title as fast as you would on a console?  What do these things cost?

Transcript:  Well, the chat room did point out to the exclusive game deals  that keep PC gamers from getting things.  So back to the PC element of it.  You're talking about the box?  Yeah.  Yeah, so back to the PC element of it,  somebody in the chat room made a good point,  which is that there are exclusive deals that keep PC gamers  from getting games as quickly as consoles.

Start time: 3506.12
End time: 3544.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the question will be,  can I play all the games that I want,  which is what you're pointing at.  What are those AAA games?  Some of the times that will be a problem  because it's exclusive to Xbox or Sony,  and that will exist for a while.  But also some of it will be,  that one isn't available for Steam OS,  it's only available for Windows and Mac,  because they haven't ported it to Linux yet.  Now what they're trying to do is say,  hey, we have in-home streaming,  so if you have your Windows or Mac game on in your house,  you can stream it to the box in the living room.  That's a good patch,  but if that becomes how it's seen,  a lot of people will go,  oh, why do I have to deal with that with my Xbox?  I can just play my games.  Natalie, I think you were muted earlier,  and I think you were trying to say something.  Can we hear you now?

Okay, just wanted to make sure your mic was live again.  Sorry about that.  Oh, you know what I did have,  I just was wondering,  this was something that emails were flying around with codes,  right?  That's how that was working for the invite?

Start time: 3565.02
End time: 3611.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For the invite, you have to go into Steam  and choose to do a quest.  Let me get to the screen that has the participation.  So you go to the Steam Universe Community Group  at steamcommunity.com, groups, Steam Universe.  You agree to the terms and conditions.  Make 10 Steam friends if you haven't already.  Most Steam users probably already have 10 Steam friends  if they're excited enough to do this.  Create a public Steam Community profile.  I object to the forced friends situation.  You create a public Steam Community profile,  and then you play a game using a gamepad in big picture mode.  Big picture mode was something they rolled out  that is kind of the precursor to Steam OS,  giving you that living room feel.  That's it.  Once you've played the game,  then you can complete those steps in any order.  As long as you do it by October 25th, you're entered,  and 300 people will get the prototypes.

Transcript:  Well, this lives or dies...  That does seem like a lot of work.  Yeah.  I mean, for people who are regular Steam users...  Yeah, a lot of these steps are already done.  Yeah, it's not crazy.  But this lives or dies on whether or not  they can attract these AAA titles  in the same way that we're saying,  well, now you have these exclusivity agreements,  they want to change that paradigm.  They want to say, hey, these are hopefully boxes  that are cheaper than the PS3 and the Xbox,  which I think is very...  It's like a huge key for them.  And then they can extend their footprint  in a way that PC gaming is just not growing.  As much as it might be more in vogue,  it's not going to be...  The era of people buying desktops so they can play games,  I don't see as a booming industry.  So if they can...  I mean, this is a big play for Valve.  I mean, this is a next 20 years play  and a future of gaming kind of play.  I would say if it is successful,  we'll be looked upon as more of an important iteration  than whatever these new generations of Xbox and PlayStation will do.

Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think that most general users  are going to want to install an OS on their own machine.  But I think enough of them will that it could actually give them the boost they need.  Like, it could flesh out the numbers so that the game distributors go,  well, if you're going to have some boxes out there in 2014,  and hey, guess what?  Some big time manufacturers are making the boxes.  And you got some people installing the operating system.  Okay, maybe that puts it over the top.  I don't think it's the deciding factor.

Start time: 3745.08
End time: 3760.66

Transcript:  And we don't know how they measure success either  because Xbox measures success in millions of consoles,  whereas this is a pretty nation company and the OS is built.  So, you know, they may not need millions.  Steam measures success.

Transcript:  This is an Amazon model versus an Apple model, right?  Microsoft measures the success in the number of titles.  Well, I guess it's not exactly the same analogy  because Microsoft measures the success in titles sold as well.  It's a little bit of a loss leader.  This is all loss leader.  Steam measures the success in how many people buy games through Steam.  Yeah.  That's why it's a free operating system.

Transcript:  And the idea that they can get,  like that they want to not be the left behind element of games like Grand Theft Auto.  Like they don't want to be the,  and then they don't want to be the dollar theater for these games.  They want to be among those platforms that get them up front  and be able to be a viable place where people want to develop these kind of contents for  or just change where we are now that like,  well, of course you're going to sell an exclusivity to one of the consoles.

Transcript:  But the operating system, I mean, did they have investors?  Do we have investors?  Do we know, did they have investors or was this privately?  Yeah.  It was invested because the operating system is a sunk cost now.  So whether or not they make any money on the consoles,  it will depend on whether or not they keep with that model.  But again, I'm just going back to how they measure success  since they've already built this operating system.  And then in order to make back their investment,  they may not have to sell that much.

Transcript:  And I just there's so far seems to be a limit on how much processing power  you can pack into.  I don't know.  I just for some reason, I'm stuck on this idea that there still is a future  for PC gaming and that the OS makes that a really promising future,  that you could start selling gaming PCs that have more power than a tablet  or even a console ever can.  It's not about.  So you can have a true gaming PC.  It's unbelievable.  The power is ridiculous.

But then, I mean, don't we just kind of see these are merging markets?

Transcript:  I mean, like they want people having dedicated gaming systems  and whether or not we think of them as a PC system  and somebody interacts with it with a mouse and a keyboard,  or they have a controller, a Steam controller,  if they're plugging it into a flat screen and playing it,  then that's what they want.  They just want more people doing that and making that decision  instead of just saying, well, of course I'm going to get this Xbox  and playing off the idea that a lot of people look at these consoles  and say, I don't really need all this stuff.  You know, I've got an Apple TV.  I've got a Chromecast.  I've got all this other stuff.  And now Microsoft is going to put themselves in a position,  I think that they're already heading there,  that they're just going to have to,  they are going to try to lure people by way of content,  that they're going to get into, you know, creating their own content  and buying exclusive content, you know, going forward.  And that's why you're going to have to get into their ecosystem.

You got a to-do list today,  but some of you probably do have this on there.  But a lot of you don't have backing up your computer on there,  and you definitely should.  Backing up your files is important.  I just had a drive start to go south on me recently,  and I had no compunction in changing the drive because I was backed up.  And you're not alone, though.  Most people don't back up their files,  so you can suddenly be better than all of them.  Carbonite backs up your computer files to the cloud automatically and continually  whenever your computer is connected to the internet.  Unlimited backup space for your PC or Mac is just $59.99 a year.  And if you run a small business,  Carbonite has plans that will back up all your computers,  your servers, your external hard drives, for a low flat annual fee.  They're stored safely off-site after you have a computer disaster,  which I know nobody wants to think they will, but it can happen.  It's probably going to happen at some point.  It's easy to restore your files.  Plus, you can access your backed up files on any computer  or on your smartphone or tablet with the free Carbonite app.  You can even email a file right from the Carbonite app itself.  Unlimited backup for your PC or Mac, as I mentioned,  only $60 a year, $59.99.  Start your free trial today at carbonite.com.  No credit card required.  We're sure you'll love Carbonite,  so remember to use that offer code TWIT when you do purchase,  and you'll get two bonus months free.  That's carbonite.com, offer code TWIT, T-W-I-T,  and we thank them for their support of this week in tech.  Jason, should we talk about YouTube comments or Twitter IPO first?  YouTube comments.  YouTube comments is pretty interesting.  First!  Agreed.  Yeah, okay, there we go.  I'm sorry, am I the only one who gets those?  No, I'm pretty sure you're not.  Sadly.  Yeah, so YouTube comments have a reputation,  if you didn't know somehow, if you weren't on the internet,  for being rather harsh,  and Google is now integrating Google Plus in as a way to allow for cross-posting,  allow for threaded replies, thank goodness, welcome to 2002,  and also to hopefully help keep the comments under control a little better,  make it easier, because YouTube channels,  and I mentioned this on Tech News today,  like Geek and Sundry that heavily moderate,  don't suffer from nearly the problems that unmoderated YouTube channels suffer from,  but most YouTube channels are unmoderated.

I can't help but look, even though I know that if I do...  Don't look at the sun, Jason. That's horrible.  I know, totally.  No wonder you're blind.  Okay, okay, maybe when I was little, I guess, is what I meant to say.  But you can't help but read those things,  because in between all of that noise and that, a lot of times,  just those horrible comments is really about valuable information.  So being able to kind of filter it out,  sort it into the things that actually matter most to you,  maybe the people that are within your circles,  I think that's brilliant.  Well, I mean, the very...

It's really annoying, especially because Crash Test Mom is a product-driven show.  So we do reviews of strollers and car seats and all of that junk.  So a lot of times, someone will say,  well, what do you think of this one?  And I can't link them off to another video at all.  I have to sort of say, email me here.  You know, it's really limiting.  But in Google+, they have a lot of options for linking  and posting videos directly and putting your own.  It's much more robust.  So I'm glad to see this, because it does feel like 1999 on the web.

You don't get to go around punching people in the face  or threatening to kill them or pulling out chunks of their hair  or whatever, however you act online.

You do not have the right to be a douche.  But yeah, that's actually not a right.  You will not find that in the Constitution.  Particularly.

Transcript:  What this is, and I think it is a meaningful...  As YouTube has become a bigger cultural element of our society,  it is shifting from an idea where anybody who types the thing five seconds ago  is the first thing that you see up there.  And the very rudimentary idea of the most thumbed up thing is, you know,  rotating as the top comment, right?  To a, okay, we understand that we don't need to prove virility on this site,  that people are here and talking about things.  We can now show the most enjoyed topic with the idea being  that there will be more people that will want to communicate,  even if just on a plus one, I like this stuff level,  that the conversation will lead more toward civility than graffiti.

Start time: 4501.27
End time: 4513.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  However, the other thing that I like about that,  because I think the culture of YouTube at this point is not civility for the most part.  So the other thing that I really like about this is the new tools for censoring these idiots.  I like that.

Start time: 4514.04

Transcript:  And a lot of them are very young, though.  YouTube still skews so young.  So I'm wondering if the sort of younger population is going to really like  being pushed through Google+.  And I think that could possibly hurt them.

Start time: 4526.68
End time: 4592.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they don't have to be pushed through Google+.  So they're not trying to necessarily force all.  I mean, they are.  They're encouraging users to go that route,  but they're trying to give you more Google+, like tools, as far as I understand it.  What I like, though, is the ability that you have increased tools for managing comments.  So increased decision making, like Tom mentioned, about who you allow to comment when.  You can create a list of approved users who can always comment.  You can blacklist certain words.  And they're now doing what I think is a really good thing that a lot of companies do.  They sort of sandbag blocked users.  So they make them, they don't let user, when they ban a user, they don't let them know they've been banned.  Previously, they would say, we ban this user, which would cause people to create new user names and go around and proxy and all that stuff.  Now they don't tell them.  So people think that these comments are getting through.  They don't know.  But it prevents them from kind of trying to game the system and create new user names.  And so there's they've in addition to all the Google Plus related stuff, I think the most welcome changes here are in actually managing comments as they appear on YouTube pages.  Because frankly, at this point, like the idea of having a free for all of comments on YouTube to me just seems masochistic.  And unless unless I'm sure.

Transcript:  At least closer.  I read that crap like, you know what, for all of you who think that you've scored points like my favorite Twitter feed in the world is don't read the comments.  I want to hold t shirt.  One of the stay calm memes and it's going to say stay calm and don't read the comments.  I do read the chat room.  I really like the chat room.  Yeah.  But I mean, with this.

Transcript:  So here, unless I'm just reading this, this is putting this kind of power in the hands of the personalities.  Are the people who own the channels.  Which is the way that YouTube needs to do it, because people who are I mean, the biggest growth in YouTube are people who are in love and really want to follow personalities.  And for them to say, now it's different if Jenna Marbles says, well, I'm doing these and now I'm no longer allowing these words because that is a different story than the faceless, nameless executives or Google saying, well, now you're not allowed to say blank, blank, blank, blank.  Yeah, I think it's a smart way to do it.  And it is a sign of evolution for not only this, you know, the site YouTube, but also I agree with you guys, the Internet in general, because YouTube is such a large part of Internet culture.  Right.

Start time: 4673.06
End time: 4688.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you wonder what kind of content that they might now include that was precluded before because people just had such thin skin.  I mean, Molly and I have taken our our share of, you know, shots over just being women on the Internet.  And it hurts.  Wait, wait, wait.  And how much did we want to give up?  Dinosaur skin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can say that, but, you know, it still hurts.  No, it's terrible.  It is totally terrible.  I was a complete lie.  So how many people have started a YouTube show or kind of tested the waters just to hear people say, like, your boobs look saggy or whatever.  And then that hurts and they don't ever post again.  So maybe this will open up the content a little.

Start time: 4710.98
End time: 4748.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and I do think, too, that part of this is very it's it's about protecting personalities for sure.  People don't want to necessarily participate in a platform where they are putting themselves open for attack every time that they appear there.  That is that is discouraging to the talent and the shows that YouTube is trying to promote.  It's also discouraging to advertisers, like from a purely monetary perspective.  Yeah, good point. No brand wants to be associated with a page that is filled with the kind of like vile,  disgusting, immature, violent crap that appears in YouTube comments.  So it's so Google and YouTube are making a very smart play here to say we're worth the higher CPM.

Transcript:  Look at what Popular Science did turning off comments because they said they cited a study saying when you had comments that were disputing the science without good science behind it,  it lessened people's confidence in science.  Now, there's some other people saying, like, that's the wrong way to go about it.  Popular science, what you should have done is heavy moderation, et cetera, et cetera.  And there's probably valid reasons to that.  But in absence of the resources to do all of the better things, shutting down the comments versus leaving them up and having people not believe your content because of the commenters is the decision they made.

Start time: 4782.41
End time: 4797.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was I was in favor of that decision by PopSci.  I really do, because I think you could you could devote ridiculous amounts of staff that they don't have to trying to make sure that the comments are OK and that they don't distort the science in some way.  Or you could say like, you know what?  This is not up for debate science.

End time: 4824.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I hear one one devil's advocate thing.  If let's say if let's say this takes if this makes people less likely to comment.  And even if you are eliminating an element that needs to be gone, is that healthy for YouTube?  Is is the idea of interaction, which is such a cornerstone of that site, is tamping down on that lifeblood.  Good for that site.

Start time: 4825.02
End time: 4843.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But does anyone know the numbers?  Because I know for blogs and news sites, it's really only like 10 percent of readers read any of the comments at all.  So is it a higher percentage of YouTube viewers who actually go through and comment?  Does anyone know those statistics?  I think 100 percent of showbiz readers read the comments.

Transcript:  I mean, especially the ones who say they don't.  People. Yes, of course we do.  But but do people do viewers?  Do viewers read the comment and do viewers then comment?  I think the proportion if you I mean, that's probably easy to prove.  You look at how many people have viewed a video versus how many people have commented.  It's usually significantly fewer.

Start time: 4865.74
End time: 4907.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. And I think the key question, right?  Key question you're bringing up, Natalie, is if you have comments on, do you know why?  Right. For the longest time on the Web, it was like, oh, the Internet can do comments.  Let's turn them on. Right. Exactly.  And I'm guilty of that.  I'm guilty of that. We did that at Tech TV and ZDTV.com and I did it at subrilliant.com before that.  We've learned since then and we're seeing in action the process of learning how to exist on the Internet and saying, OK,  maybe in these situations you need this kind of moderation and these situations you need real names and in these situations you can have open comments.  And different approaches will apply in different places.  And you're asking the exactly right question, Natalie, is is it worth it to have comments?  And if so, in what way should you approach them to make your product better?

Start time: 4908.04
End time: 4926.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And there will be times when it's worth it. And YouTube, I'm sure, does not want comments to go away.  But they do want to create. I mean, let's be honest. I think what they really do want to create is a better place for advertisers.  And so at the end of the day, their determination will be, can we make more money from brands by having better comments on the site?  And that's the answer will be yes.

Start time: 4926.66
End time: 4953.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Because Google has already had their handful with selling advertisement on YouTube because they won't sell ads on channels.  They sell ads on demos. And so the idea that they can do a site wide change does a lot to make that idea a little bit more palatable to advertisers because it's less of a cesspool.  If it's like, well, I really want to advertise on the My Drunk Kitchen channel.  But that also ends me up on these other things that have these horrifying sites.

Start time: 4953.74

That's where the tech stocks usually go. And Nasdaq has had a little issues here and there.  So just what we taught. We promised we'd mention Twitter. So there we go.

Transcript:  I have an idea for Blackberry. I think Blackberry could still make a comeback.  How? I have a whole marketing plan for them. Call me.  I think on your bar, I really it will probably only appeal to women because we love an underdog.  But remember how the whole whole Arab Spring was organized over Blackberry message.  And I just think that there's something I saw a guy on the New York subway last week and I was like, man, he's using a Blackberry.  And that's kind of awesome. And it just made me love it a little bit.  And I think if they started to trade on some sort of like underground hipness, right, if they were like, look, iPhones kind of played Android getting played.  Like it's really just Samsung. Everybody needs a sidekick.  And they kind of just tried to be a little like set Blackberry up as this cool underdog, the one you want to root for the Rudy of smartphones.  And then they could have an ad with like a bunch of really hip people using Blackberry.  And then at the end, they could like high five like a business dude with their black.  No, nobody's buying this at all. I want to love like I feel like they could be OK.

Yes. And Lazaridis was on the board.  He was like, what the hell is this? Why would you do a smartphone without a keyboard?  Like the keyboard is a differentiator and everything else is not.

Like you can't reach me 24 7 makes me even more cool than the person you can always reach.  So Blackberry should just like I mean, I know they had their outages, so they kind of tried that.

I am not stinky, overweight, beard wearing lumberjacks.  No, I mean, I think that they're... Look, I'm not saying that trying to find something actually cool is not an extremely daunting task.  See all advertising ever, but just like go get some of those Apple people.  Don't get celebrities because that isn't cool, but just do something legitimately like the hippest people, you know, all European. I don't know.

Transcript:  Yeah.  So I have Crash Test Mom as a YouTube show and we review.  It's like CNET for baby stuff.  So if you have a kid on the way, it's stroller reviews and car seats and all of that stuff.  And then also here in the Morris house, we are app developers as well.  We have an app called Read Quick.  So if you have an iPad or an iPhone, now you can download Read Quick.  Go to readquickapp.net.  I always forget the URL or just search Read Quick in the App Store.  And it's a speed reading app.  So you find long articles that you'd like to read on the web and it displays it to you one word at a time very quickly.  And just for the next day, we're having a little promotion actually.  It's $2.99 in the App Store.  It's normally $4.99.  So head on over and check it out.  Read Quick.  And let us know what you think of it as well because we've worked really hard on this.  It's because my husband and I both work in news.  And so we just wanted to create something that allowed us to read long form articles quicker on our devices.  So readquickapp.com.  And unfortunately, there's no Android device yet.  Sorry.  We'll get to that.
