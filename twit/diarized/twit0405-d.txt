End time: 217.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just never really used it either  So now now I have to you know  Get the word out that I'm working on a gadget stuff all I'm all editor emeritus means is used to be editor

Start time: 218.20
End time: 221.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_11

End time: 242.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did like occasionally contribute stuff. Yeah, so you'll still write a little bit  Yeah, I've got I've got a piece that I'm I'm working on that I'll have up in the next  I think one to two weeks. It was about taking a road trip  I think one to two weeks. It was about taking a road trip and a Tesla Model S down to Southern, California  And it was better weather

Start time: 243.60
End time: 248.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, you survived and gadget. How is that gonna change with the AOL acquisition? Um

Start time: 250.18
End time: 288.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's kind of to be determined. I think you know more more than anything specific to gadget  You know a well acquired us  Because we have you know some know-how around some kind of key areas in the media space  That they want us to help kind of beef up and I think they have the right DNA  receptors for what we do so  Yeah, I mean, you know  If gadget is is around for a couple more years  I wouldn't be surprised if gadget eventually gets folded into end gadget. I wouldn't be surprised either  We're just gonna kind of you know figure it out as we go and do the best thing for for both communities

Start time: 288.94
End time: 309.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, you pivoted a little bit with gadget and made it really more about products and kind of an  Hot rotten tomatoes for products where you get reviews from real people and the critics reviews and you have a score and that does fit  Very well with what and gadget is doing they're doing more of a longer form stuff  Articles and so forth. So it seems like there's a natural pairing actually

Start time: 310.26
End time: 334.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if you see us starting to apply that model to some other verticals as well over time  It's it's worked pretty well. Yeah, it's it's it's unique and it's like, you know, we don't want to like be noisy and  There are plenty of sites out there to  You know do original product reviews and stuff like that  And you know, we find ways to add value that that are not kind of in that exact same format. Well, congratulations

Start time: 334.20
End time: 345.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I you know, it I  Mean you left aol you left in gadget. Is it a little weird coming back?  Are you happy to be back? You're gonna say you're happy because it'd be imprudent to say otherwise

Start time: 347.07
End time: 374.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I  Would be honest. I'm actually having a lot of fun. It is a very different company  It's like yeah, it is like literally a completely different company that just happens to have the same name  From when I left it literally could not be any different from the inside out. It's still a big company  It's still a big internet company and you know, they're still figuring a lot of stuff out  But I'm actually really stoked to be able to kind of help them figure some of these things out must be fun  It's nice to have a big budget to spend  Well, I don't know how big my budget is right now spend ariana's money

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, so we're we're getting ready for Google I oh I presume I know Cedric's in town for that and I presume you're gonna  Be going to that Ryan. I will be there for a little bit. We'll be there covering what we're gonna do on Wednesday  Which is thank goodness Google decided to consolidate what was three keynotes into a single keynote that we can actually cover  Three hours it'll be long  It starts at 9 right and it'll go till noon and we'll cover it live here from the studio with Tom Merritt and  Sarah Lane and I as act are and then Gina  Tripani and Jeff Jarvis and I will be at the keynote and then we're gonna drive back  Quickly after the keynote and we'll do this week in Google shortly after to kind of analyze it  Unfortunately, I think Google might have made a mistake because in previous Google IOs, this is their big developer conference  They gave away a ton of stuff  They gave away almost $1,200 worth of stuff last time and the focus now on Google I O is all about well  What are we gonna get at least for the press maybe not for the developers?  But it seems to be instead of what's Google gonna announce? We know they're gonna talk about glass  We know they're gonna talk about the next generation of Android, which is probably just  Not key lime pie, but just another jelly bean update. We know they'll probably  I hope they'll talk about you know, Google TV and and Android and tablets, but  Mostly people want to play the game. What are we gonna get under our chairs?

Start time: 459.76
End time: 477.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't it a  Free publicity they're probably gonna give away  Nexus 7 the new version of Nexus and instantly the whole world is gonna know that you know, there's a new better cooler  Version of the thing. So I don't know if it's really a mistake  It would probably be a mistake if they didn't have anything to give away this point

Start time: 477.64
End time: 512.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's unlikely to happen, you know, we got a queue last year. That's a nice collector's item paperweight  Beautiful one beautiful paperweight heavy wonderful  What else do you think we'll see there's been some rumor and I think they need to the Nexus 4 came out late last year  It's not old. It's not ready to be replaced  But it doesn't look when you look at this the kind of the hot to high-end  Android phones today the galaxy s4 and the HTC one  It doesn't look like it's quite up to that doesn't have LTE  Would we perhaps see a new developer phone from Google and Nexus? Well, the rumor is X

Start time: 514.97
End time: 552.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It would make sense  I mean they've waited so long before actually having Motorola can't come out with a Nexus time for Motorola to step up  Absolutely, and they can't really announce one without real without releasing it  So it would make perfect sense for and it would be a real comeback for Motorola  We actually needs this but among the amongst the rumors. I read something about a Nexus 11 inch tablet from Samsung  Oh, that would make sense as well  And of course we need to know more about the glasses although even Robert Scobel last week said no no  No, there's no way they're releasing the the actual glasses this year. They'll talk about it  but

Start time: 553.64
End time: 569.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Eric Schmidt kind of let that leak a couple of months ago  They had been saying late 2013 and he said no not till 2014 and now they've all aligned behind that that seems to be the  Consensus and anybody who's played with glass realizes for this to be a consumer product. They need to do a little bit more

Start time: 569.28
End time: 573.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they need applications so they actually need to put it in the house. Do they because you can't

Start time: 574.58
End time: 588.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  What yeah, I guess I mean  We were talking to Gina Schiappani who has hers and she said I put the New York Times  And I don't want to see headlines while I'm walking down the street  What you know, there's a limited number of things you can do with this  Device, I mean they don't they don't do everything

Start time: 588.98
End time: 599.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We only know right now is that the key knows is gonna run three hours. That's a lot of time  That's that's enough time to announce a bunch of stuff. Yeah, but Google also has a gazillion product

Start time: 599.44
End time: 626.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it is there's a conference. So  You know with an with an Apple keynote, we know that it's gonna be you know, it's it's very hit  It's very hits driven right like all they really spend time announcing is either how many things they've sold or new products  And with Google they have like a gazillion small new products that most of which, you know  I think kind of get forgotten about pretty quickly with a three-hour keynote man  They're gonna have a really hard time keeping people's attention

Start time: 627.46
End time: 655.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You're gonna forget about it before the keynotes over seriously, what are they talking about better take good notes?  What about do you think they'll talk a little bit about their gigabit internet?  Initiative they've it's gone. It seems to me better than they had thought they really really initially said  We're gonna pick a city as a demo and they're announcing they've announced two more cities and it seems it feels like  It's getting some steam. It's getting some headway  What is what is the French internet situation? Do you really want to know?

Start time: 656.42
End time: 660.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's it's actually really good. Yeah, and I don't want to know it's cheap

Start time: 661.60
End time: 666.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's it's it's as fast as DSL is fast. It's government sponsored. Not really. No

Start time: 667.46
End time: 699.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, most yeah, most or all of it is private. Yeah  but  Most of it is DSL a little like cable is maybe five to ten percent and there's no fibers or fiber out there  There is fiber but it's it's taking a good long while to be rolled out because it it costs a bunch of money  So basically what you get now in France for 30 to 40 euros a month is all you can eat internet on DSL  plus TV plus unlimited  phone service  That's pretty good if you get all of that

Start time: 701.50
End time: 705.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But is what is the DSL speeds because in America DSL speeds never really

Start time: 705.30
End time: 714.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's kind of depends sort of depends on how far you are from your what you call it PBX  So it's I don't know maybe between 3 5 and 20 megabits

Start time: 717.42
End time: 722.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yes, typical DSL. Yeah, typical DSL and you have a DSL too. I think oh, yeah for the most part

Start time: 723.70
End time: 728.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And V DSL is coming out and so no, I mean, you know, we're okay

Start time: 729.04
End time: 753.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So right now Google fiber if you go to the fiber page is in Kansas City both, Missouri and Kansas  I thought that was funny as well as some of the suburbs. It's going to Austin, Texas and Provo, Utah  next I  What do you think Ryan? I mean you think this is a business for Google?  I mean initially just felt like we they wanted to show other ISPs  Hey, it's possible to do gigabit and maybe even customers want this

Start time: 755.14
End time: 796.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a weird one  This normally will take a long time to recoup costs. I think yeah  Google is in a very unique position to throw cash at these kinds of initiatives in some ways  This kind of reminds me of where Microsoft was about a decade ago where they just had all this money sitting in the bank and you know  Burning a hole in their pockets and and very few companies have the luxury of being able to say alright  Well, let's take on you know, a multi-billion dollar bet that will take us ten years  to achieve some kind of market dominance and and  Xbox is one of the projects that came out of that and they still haven't made the money back  No, actually Xbox is is is profitable for them now

Start time: 797.06
End time: 801.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But that but they haven't made the money back  All the way they lost so much

Start time: 802.40
End time: 831.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know if they ever released or will release something saying that they they made it all back but  but the point is really, you know when when you reach a certain level of size as a company and  certain amount of excess capital  You have to put it to work and this is a really interesting way to put it to work  Will it make them money? Will it eventually be profitable for them?  I don't know, but I'm glad somebody's doing this because man, this is pathetic  Nobody's built new infrastructure new communications infrastructure in this country in quite a long time

Start time: 831.72
End time: 842.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Google's kind of unique in the capitalist world because I think they seem to be a little longer  Term focused than a normal company and certainly not quarter to quarter when they started in Kansas City and made sense

Start time: 843.06
End time: 854.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know as sort of a experiment. It's an experiment  But I mean now they're rolling it out in several markets. That's what puzzles me what what more information  I'm gonna get from Provo that and then they got they say we make money

Start time: 854.60
End time: 860.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I know that's all we just want you to use the internet more  And so if we roll out faster and you'll use it more we'll make money

Start time: 861.04
End time: 899.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah  but you know it might be it might be one of the reasons might be that at some point the internet is going to  Somehow have to overtake or at least seriously compete with TV and in order to compete with TV you need HD  Reliable HD streams and possibly fairly soon ultra HD scene, you know see you 4k  And that needs really really fast connections, which we don't have so  testing it in a couple of towns and then maybe expanding it not as a  Business but as a way to pressure other ISPs to up their game  Might make sense in the long run in the in the ground grand scheme of things that might be about video

Start time: 900.56
End time: 913.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just speculating I agree it might be about balance of power  You know Google showing the the ISPs and the telecom world, you know  Don't mess with us because we could actually be the network tomorrow. Well, they have to be a feared as I am of

Start time: 915.16
End time: 922.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Bandwidth caps which could kill stuff like what we're doing right now  and these you have in France the

Transcript:  Is it a do a doopie doppy doppy a lot too popular it by the time this show comes out it might not exist anymore

Start time: 930.32
End time: 948.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That would be a great thing. Although we have the carriers voluntarily  The ISPs voluntarily agreed to support a six strikes not a three strikes  But a six strikes law here in the US even though nobody was demanding it of them  They said oh, well, we'll do it anyway that way you won't bother us any better than passing a law. It's easier. Yeah

Start time: 949.32
End time: 973.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's actually you know, it's actually even a little bit worse the power that the ISPs have we have one issue here in France with  The free which is one of the biggest ISPs which is purposefully throttling YouTube  To the point that it's unusable. So that might be also reason for  Rebalancing the the power at least making a show for us. This kind of regressive policymaking is really bad for YouTube

Start time: 973.94
End time: 994.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's not merely that we're gonna make it faster. That's good for us  It's also that it could go the other way and actually be bad for us  If we don't if we don't really show people what a free and open and fast internet really can be sure  All right, we all agree and sexually worse on mobile and mobile. Well mobile is a whole nother totally kettle of fish

Start time: 994.08
End time: 1002.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a tough what I mean with for with 4g. It shouldn't be I  Mean it has to be a little more managed and you know your DSL fiber and cable networks

Start time: 1002.40
End time: 1008.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The cost is you have to you have to get  Data high speed data to each of these cell towers, right?

Start time: 1008.66
End time: 1017.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But notice how for mobile people are just getting used to the idea that what they can do on the network is just different from  The wider internet. They're not expecting as much. No, no

Start time: 1020.22
End time: 1033.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Time Warner apparently is  According to stun when in our chat room has been confirmed that they are throttling YouTube and twitch the Justin TV gaming  That's that's it seems so regressive to me

Start time: 1033.76
End time: 1039.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well in France, did you hear that go ahead? Oh, yeah, let's start speaking French

Start time: 1044.96
End time: 1064.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have been one other thing that free is doing in a real  Bout with with YouTube and Google is that they actually activated by default a an ad block service on every all of their  users  Connections and they ended up deactivating it because you know, they're they're not completely insane

Start time: 1064.62
End time: 1075.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They were logging the apps that we were they were blocking. Yeah, they're blocking ad block. I'm sorry  Okay, yeah, I thought you said Apple Apple block right in your DSL box enabled by default

Start time: 1077.20
End time: 1081.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So yeah, if you want whose ads were they blocking everyone's up, but well mostly Google's

Start time: 1084.02
End time: 1091.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Again you can see why this is suddenly more than a hobby for balance of power  It is absolutely makes perfect sense. It should be more than a hobby, you know

Start time: 1091.92
End time: 1131.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the thing to remember though is they're gonna call it a hobby  They're gonna keep calling it experimental because the moment they say this is a thing that we're doing and it's a business for us  Not only do they have to start meeting, you know market expectations  In terms of you know being a public company  But then they also have to actually deal with regulation in a very different way right now  They don't really have to deal with that regulation because they're having the cities come to them. They're saying hey  We want to do this in your city  If you're interested as a city  Come apply and so now they don't have to deal with all the red tape  They can just kind of come in and do their thing  That's a really great position to be in obviously it limits your rollout, but nobody else is doing this anyway

Start time: 1131.90
End time: 1165.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So what's the difference right? Well and those who have tried and especially cities who have tried to roll out their own  Public internet have been thwarted by laws. I mean is you know as soon as  Philadelphia rolled out free Wi-Fi in this in the town where Comcast is based  Comcast went to Congress and they made sure that this was illegal  You're competing with a free market by providing a good service  That's that's bad for our business and you can bet that that's the next step is like  Maybe we shouldn't let that we should get to do some of this Google this Google guy

Transcript:  You're in San Francisco Ryan I noticed the other day  I was very impressed went to San Francisco with an AT&T phone was getting amazing LTE speeds

Start time: 1176.28
End time: 1190.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've really upgraded their backbone. Yeah, they've they've been able to maintain a really great LTE  I remember the first week I had the iPhone 5 last year and I was getting like 50 60 megabits on it  I was just blown away. I mean that's actually faster than what I get at home on cable

Start time: 1191.46
End time: 1241.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I was a care deli square with HTC one got 50 megabits down eight megabits up. It's crazy  It's a great time. It's a great time to be alive. I  Don't think that's the case, you know used to be well, that's the thing  I think in San Francisco  It was a real struggle when iPhones were so popular  AT&T really wasn't prepared the amount of data that iPhone users used and for the first three or four years of the iPhone  It was horrible. You couldn't phone didn't even work let alone the data and I think AT&T  Jumped it takes a while, especially in San Francisco to get through  Regulations like several years to put up a new cell tower  So they probably started working on this in 2008 or 2009 and finally it's starting to click and I think this is probably true nationwide  That's kind of interesting. It means it is possible as a mobile provider to give better high-speed internet than a land-based provider

Start time: 1243.24
End time: 1257.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's incredible it all depends right it depends on how many people are on your mobile network depends on  Where you are and also depends on what your landline is if your landline is Google Fiber  Then you're always well, but your chances of getting better and right for Verizon

Start time: 1257.58
End time: 1278.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I mean, you know Verizon was rolling out Fios at it was it was estimated a cost of about  $5,000 per new customer  It's very very expensive because they have to retrench they have to put fiber in the ground and eventually stopped  They're not rolling out a Fios anymore. That's it. They're done with Fios, right?  There's no there's no more new Fios installations

Start time: 1279.74
End time: 1292.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think I think they they picked up rolling it out again. They did. Oh, I know that I know that there's still people getting  Fios. I just don't think it's as aggressive. I mean they actually they advertise Fios all over the new Iron Man movie

Transcript:  That Tony Stark was nothing  No, I was watching there's a Showtime show that I really like with Don Cheadle  About management consultants and unaccountably everybody in the show is carrying a Nokia Lumia 920  Like you never see those in real life.

That's everybody in business. Oh, well, you have a postage meter, right?  I see people in the post office waiting in line with their postage meter. That's really dumb  Why lease a postage meter why buy special ink why go to the post office at all?

I was just completely  Befuddled by it and I left feeling more frustrated in about 10 to 15 minutes of using it than I've ever felt using  Any piece of software in memory? I mean, I literally could not think of a time. I was more frustrated using anything and  Yeah, okay. Maybe it's because I have these preconceived notions about how Windows should work  but  The reality is if somebody who's been using Windows for the last 20 years is having this hard of a time just doing basic  Discoverability around the operating system.

You will learn how to use it in a half an hour  But I'm with you Ryan, I know and I've been using it for six months now  And it's not that I don't know how to use it. I do  But it's not it's it's what it feels like is this kind of mishmash hybrid between a touch-based  Tablet operating system and a desktop operating system. It's as if Microsoft couldn't make up their minds  I think they wanted to and I think they're gonna try to move the world towards touch-based tablet operating system a Windows RT style  but they even on our tea they could not bring themselves to abandon the desktop and  They're right because the majority of Windows users in business at least are using the desktop  That's what they want.

It's a rain  But it's it sounds like he works at the Department of Redundancy Department. It's it's a little strange  Anyway, he says it's not a soda pop  He says and this almost feels like he's begging  Windows 8 is a good product and it's getting better every day unlike a can of soda. Okay a  Computer operating I didn't compare it to a can of soda  But anyway, apparently that somebody has unlike a can of soda a computer operating system offers different experiences to different customers to meet different needs  I'll agree with that while and this is this is if you listen carefully what Microsoft's up to moving the entire industry  Toward an exciting future of touch

But I mean we I want to encourage this  I want to encourage Microsoft to try actually try new things and not just do Windows 8  That's like Windows 7 repackaged. Yeah, so of course Windows 8 very much feels like a transition  hardware wise and software wise and interface wise  I guess Windows 9 will sort of  Homogenize all that well at least that we can hope in a world.

He says there was even a time  Time when acknowledging that you were listening to feedback and acting on it was considered a good thing now  I might point out that Microsoft has not in fact listened to feedback  And in fact, that's been the problem is that they really did this without asking people in fact  Even Julie Larson Green who's currently running the Windows 18 admits that they thought they didn't listen to people who use the desktop enough

You do you do innovation by by you know you put 12 people around around a table  And they all have to agree on the list of features, and then they just send it out to the engineers to build to build it  That's what it feels like right now. It needs to be streamlined in a way or  Or maybe I don't know me when it's installed it needs to be something for PCs and some things for the touch interfaces  But I'm really actually good to see what Windows blue is gonna bring especially since what I have at the office is still Windows XP

Transcript:  I'll tell you I here's what I'm interpreting from this a blog post and another data point is that Microsoft is actually very nervous right now  Mm-hmm  That their PC sales are dropping off. Yes, they sold 100 million copies. That's not how many they wanted to sell or hoped to sell  There's a softening of the market and I imagine the OAMS  Like Lenovo and Dell are also saying them guys. We're having a hard time selling this they had big hopes  So the other data point is that Bill Gates is now normally bill has does not talk about Microsoft bill talks about his  Initiatives in Africa his charitable enterprises his philanthropy rightly. So that's his focus  They got him on CNBC saying how great the surface was and I really think that this the fact that Microsoft has gone  Clearly gone to bill and said bill, please. Can you make some appearances and and and shore up?  Windows 8  He said tablets are growing in popularity and quote. It's going to be harder and harder to distinguish products that are PCs versus tablets  He says the surface brings the portability of the tablet but the richness of the PC that's markers  That's that's the core of what Microsoft's trying to accomplish, right? He also said this is where he went off  He went it went too far of people using iPads. A lot of those users are frustrated. They can't type they can't create documents  They don't have office  So that's why the iPad is such a flop that's a bit Bill centric  Yeah, and by the way, the only reason doesn't have office because the Microsoft is not shipped office for the iPad

Anyway, I wish I do I wish Microsoft  Well, we need competition Apple is by the way, and for those who say I'm an Apple fanatic Apple isn't necessarily  Any better they're more and more imposing  In fact, that's there what they're famous for imposing their vision of the world upon the rest of us and  I'm not sure that well, we'll see we'll have to see what the next version of OS 10 brings but OS OS 10  0.8 mountain lion brought a lot of iPad and iPhone like interfaces including full screen  to Macintosh

Apple makes mistakes all the time and and they get called on it  Every bit as much if not if not more and in the mistakes that Apple makes are in the grand scheme of things so much  More minor and they get so much more blown out of proportion  But that's that's fine. I mean, that's you know, expectations are also different for Apple and they know it well and to make this fair

It's old  It's just it's a mess  And you know the fact that they wouldn't be rewriting that for Windows anytime soon is I think indicative of how they view iTunes which is  Too too bloated to save at this point

I want the exploit on the zero-day  They use teams of what they call cashers who encode magnetic stripe cards like gift cards with the compromised card data  so  So they target databases of prepaid debit cards  They breach the debit card account security protocols  And that's why they focus on some banks are probably a little easier to hack than others  They change the withdrawal limits to make it maximum and that's by the way  There are ATMs apparently not in the US, but in some countries where you can get as much as ten thousand dollars in cash  I bet that changes so they eliminate withdrawal limits  Which eliminate which enables the participants to withdraw unlimited amounts of cash until the operation is shut down  Then they distribute these credit card numbers not the cards they just get online and they get these cashers who encode the cards  Oh pop-sci has as a good article.

What is so great about this that I have to have it instead of a really good Android phone or really good iPhone?  Is it too is it just that it's too late that people have already chosen one of the other? I  Think it's it's always just about what is the best product?  I think if they would switch if they could convince you of the value of doing that  I have to believe that anybody who makes the best product in its class  Is going to win at any given time because upgrade cycles on phones as we all know are only about two years  Yeah, I would switch to I have no problem switching to a Windows phone. It's just okay  So there are some app issues there, right?  But like platform is not so much better or so much more efficient or you know, easy to use that it's worth the switching cost

Oh, go ahead rain, please  Well, I was gonna say this address is one of two problems  The first problem is how many of the apps that I already have are on this other platform and that's that's a big problem  That's that's a big fear  But to me the bigger problem is the next cool app that comes out. Where's that coming out first?  Well, it's probably coming out for iOS. There's a chance there's possibility  It's coming out for Android. There's zero possibility. It's coming out for Windows unless it's Microsoft Office. Oh Scott, right

Well, you don't have to use those options, I guess  By the way, I'm sorry. I'm logging into my outlook account so I could save the list of app. This is like 18 steps later  I gave up a long time ago, but for you, I'm gonna finish this. I now have to get an email  Verifying that this phone is in fact  part of my outlook  Yeah, yeah, we'll just move on for the time being  Oh by the way one other point about 145,000 apps that sounds good  But it's only 5,000 more apps than the last time they mentioned this a few months ago  So it's not growing super fast  Thousand as long as the right 15 you want are in there. No, you're right. So that's why I almost wish you would say what?  It doesn't have exactly  Microsoft rumored to be looking at buying nook  Microsoft made a big investment into bards and noble nook platform  Several hundred million dollars as I remember was a significant investment  Causing us to joke about Microsoft releasing a Wook a windows based nook  Now they're offering a billion dollars to buy this  Business this is odd given that the nook is in fact showing a real erosion  It can't be for the hardware  Well, I have a theory about this Microsoft and Barnes and Noble by the way are not confirming  But when they get the nook  They get more than the nook hardware they get nook media  Which includes interestingly enough the textbook the e-textbook business and a bunch of stores in colleges  And I think Microsoft's retail strategy does call for more stores  I think the textbook business is not a bad business.

We talked to them the other day. They said yeah, we're done with our podcast experiment  What was it working? Oh? Yeah, we get great results, but we're done with that and the problem is not results the problem is  Yeah, we got to buy ads on NBC. We don't  You're only a million bucks here or there.

Transcript:  That's what's interesting to me that even though it works  They it's just you know I think that these are all agents for the most part agency buys on these big companies  And I think the agencies it's not a big enough buy so they don't get a big enough commission  And it's a little risky, and it's a little harder for them. They have to explain to the company  Well, we're gonna buy this stuff. It's independent media. It's not you know. It's a it's the old line  Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM  No ad agency ever got fired for buying. You know CBS. It's  It's a simple easy kind of thing and so I think while you you're probably right that  French ad agencies are even more conservative there still is that

We see we deal with this at a well right  It's not about the quality of the product or even the results even if you get really great conversion  You know their job is to buy ad impressions for hundreds of millions of page views or you know tens of millions of audience  Members per week, and it's really really hard to make even the best possible conversion on a much smaller scale

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, the high numbers yeah, because we because we because they were worth it  It wouldn't work if you didn't get a return on the investment, so we charge a lot of money for ads on these shows  We only do a handful of them  I know it feels like probably to the audience that we do a lot  But we only do one per half hour and at most I mean I'm from radio where it's 19 minutes every hour  In on the on the radio show 19 minutes an hour of ads so half an hour  Every you know a couple minutes every half hours nothing  I'm patient. I'm nothing if I'm not patient  And and General Motors don't worry. We're coming to you, so  It's like a Don Draper on madmen you got to have a car  Our show today brought to you by one of our big supporters actually Citrix the folks at Citrix are believers  the in fact  You'll see them on lots of podcasts on lots of websites because they know this stuff works and let's be fair  They're selling a more technical product. They need a more technical  audience  And so I'm really grateful to them for their for really supporting  What we do this is a product perfect example  You're never gonna see this on NBC  But I'll tell you if you're a geek if you're a support professional or an IT guy  This is the product you got to know about go to assist you probably know about it because it's the number one  Remote support solution has been for the last 10 years  But what I love about Citrix is they add features all the time now not only do they have the best remote support  I was doing this with my mom by the way unattended support Mac to PC PC to Mac mobile devices  You can support people from an iPad  But also they've got a service desk which allows you to manage track and resolve issues  You've got a release and configuration management built in it got a beautiful if you're if you're a independent provider  You want to be a managed services provider they have a portal. It's branded for you a white label portal. It looks fabulous  And then the monitoring is something I'm really kind of thrilled about we've installed that on our network  It goes out crawls the network looks at all the hardware in the software  You've got a complete inventory of everything and then with point-and-click you can set up trackers  They keep an eye on things like network performance even things like hard drive space toner cartridges  So you get texts or emails or instant messages when there's a problem  So you can fix it before the problem becomes a problem and  All of that goes to you may being like a support hero somebody who's really making a difference for your clients  A great solution for anyone  I want you to try it free and you can try all three modules for three for free for 30 days  When you visit go to assist comm click the try it free button and when you do you'll notice there's a link that you need  To click that says what's the promo code?  And I want you to click that and enter in the promo code of twitchy right here says promo code  Just put TW IT in there if you would just so that they know that's something that's another thing we do to let you know  We couldn't do that with Ford. No, you know click a Mustang and  Tell them to it say but we get you know, they even said this we got we get more email  More tweets people saying I bought it just saw in the chat room four people said I bought a Ford cuz of you  So I think it works we'll get them back thank you Citrix for your support go to assist comm the offer code is  Twit I would love that so as long as we're talking about crazy purchase ideas  And apparently a billion dollars is now what it costs to buy a company.

You just see people on the map  It's no there's nothing social about it the way that Facebook is social. It's just a traffic app  Yeah, it's like a traffic beacon and data app and they're all about traffic data and mapping and that's that's a it's a great product  I use it all the time. I love ways it has nothing to do with Facebook  I mean at least Instagram you could say okay Facebook one of their primary use cases is photos  They need to retain dominance in the photo space  Instagram equals photos on the phone  So clearly owning Instagram means that you know, they're taking out one of their biggest long-term competitors in in mobile  Ways is just there's I don't even see it but who knows I mean, you know, Facebook's got to buy somebody right Facebook wants location though  Right.

Transcript:  Well, it's good for business because it's an annuity and I have to think that business does now put your says there's two different markets  For Adobe's creative suite. There's the individual graphic designer  But I think probably the market that Adobe's looking about is the designer in a larger business the people who do your  GDT site or do the engadget site who are working in-house instead of going to the boss and say hey boss  I need to buy a $2,500 piece of software. They say boss  We need to subscribe to this for 50 bucks a month  It's a the boss is gonna sign off on the 50 bucks a month a lot faster, right easy  So I think that's what Adobe's thinking is the purchaser is not the same person as the person who's choosing and  Whatever is gonna make it easiest and certainly it's good for Adobe because it's it's all about piracy, right?

No we think it's a good idea  Very interesting the mobile live stream will not carry the same ads as a television broadcast  But we'll have the digital to ads that you see on a site like ABC comm  This is according to the New York Times because the Nielsen company had cannot measure mobile viewing of live TV.
