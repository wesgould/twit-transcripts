But I think it's very interesting  none of you guys are going to CES. Isn't that great? Yeah. That's how you know somebody's been  covering tech too long. They say, I'm not going this year. I'm so happy. And loving it. And loving it.

End time: 263.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I need to know. It's over covered. Well, I think it's worse. I think it's really, it's just that  the internet exists. You don't need to go, you don't need to have a trade show. In fact, this is  now. This is the last year Microsoft will be at CES. And they don't need to be there. Who needs

End time: 281.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  to be there? Yeah. I don't get anything from Microsoft at CES. It's the little guys that you  pay attention to. That was the secret of the old West Coast computer fair was the little  hundred dollar booths where the startups were. Is there actually, you weren't, that wasn't

Start time: 281.98

Start time: 286.46
End time: 324.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's just two, I think. I think this year they paid a little more attention to credentials in it.  They didn't give a press pass to everybody who wandered up and said, Hey, I'm a blogger.  I'm not so sure. I don't know. But I remember last year meeting John in the press reception  and there was something like a thousand people trying to get into it. A thousand people with  press passes. Wow. That was absurd. Yeah. You couldn't get into the big announcements because  they were all taken up with bloggers who came there and slept all night on the floor in front

Start time: 344.60
End time: 380.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  a couple, in fact they were very liberal last year when you walked, because I came in late and I showed  up at the press credential area and they just essentially didn't care to look at anything. If  you showed up, they'd give you a pass. Really? Oh, that's interesting. Compared to like maybe  three or four years earlier where they were turning away bloggers and anybody who, and we're not  talking about just kids, we're talking about real bloggers that were important and I guess they  caused such a fuss that they changed their policies. Don't they have separate credentials  for bloggers? No, no. I think it said blogger press, didn't it? The badge? Mine said press.

Start time: 380.52
End time: 383.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I went last year. Okay, well then just say, but I went to an event recently. They had a separate

Start time: 383.64
End time: 393.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  blogger room. I went to an event recently. I can't say which one it was, but the badge said  blogger press for everybody who was a blogger or press. Oh, blogger and press. Yeah, blogger

Start time: 394.46
End time: 414.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  slash press. So you're part of the same clique. Wow, I don't know what we are. We're going to be  there. We have a sky booth. I've said there's about 15 people going this year and we'll be doing wall  to wall coverage. We're kind of like bloggers, though. We're not really real journalists.  Well, Gina's going to be there. Is Gina going to be there? You're writing for Gina, aren't you?

Start time: 415.10
End time: 466.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. So what happened to the bite thing? It's not my story. Get Gina over. She loves,  she wants to be on the show. We'll ask her. She loves, she thinks you're the best and she wants  to know if you'll let her... What, are you her spokesman now? Yeah. Do additional, she wants to  know if you let her do additional distribution so you can put like the twit feed. Are you writing  for her too? I'm working with her. She's, but the name of her site is some weird name. It's like a...  And? What is it? A new domain. A new domain, A&D. So she wants to know if it would be okay to use  embed code. Do you allow that? Do you have it? For what? For the twit broadcast. Sure. It's  Creative Commons. You can do anything she wants with it. There you go, Gina. Gotcha. She can edit  out all the bad stuff. She's not going to do that. Just have a nut. That takes work. But we'll know

Start time: 466.76
End time: 470.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  too that she edited out all the bad stuff. Yeah, you'll be able to tell. That's the control. So,

Start time: 471.92
End time: 490.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  would you... I mean, I could not talk about CES if you guys think it's a waste of time.  No, I think we need a preview show. This will be it. Not a waste of time. There's some things to  talk about. Last year, well, two years ago, CES was all about ebook readers. I think Amazon kind of...  And between Amazon, Barnes and Noble, that's probably it on that. Yeah. Amazon just owns the

Start time: 491.22
End time: 495.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  ebook space. My thinking is that this new CES is going to be about one thing and one thing only.

Start time: 495.96
End time: 512.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, wait a minute. Let's... Okay. Last year was 3D TVs and tablets attempting to compete with the  iPad. iPad won 2011, no question. Those tablets all disappeared. And 3D TVs are still here. I'm  sure they'll be back this year. What is it going to be this year? You said one thing and I think...

Start time: 512.94
End time: 518.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think everyone is going to flock to see the 55-inch OLED. Baby. Four millimeters thick.

Start time: 519.34
End time: 535.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sharp... Four millimeters. I'm sorry. LG and Samsung. Both are going to show these. I didn't  know Samsung was. Yeah, Samsung has one too. 55 millimeters. But in both cases... Well, in LG's case,  they're an OEM panel maker. It's not LG the television maker. It's the panel maker.

Start time: 536.80
End time: 543.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I wonder if Samsung may be closer to market. I wonder if it's the LG panel being used by Samsung.

Start time: 544.08
End time: 560.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It could be. There's a rumor that maybe Apple will adopt this LG panel for its imaginary Apple  TV. But the thing that's interesting to me is that Sony at the same time has killed its 11-inch  consumer OLED. The only consumer OLED out there. It was too expensive. It was... 2500 bucks.

Start time: 561.24
End time: 578.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was expensive. And if they're going to do anything with OLED, they've got to get the price  down quickly. The prices for LED TVs just collapsed over the holidays. Yeah, they're nothing.  They're right. In order to compete, they've got to bring the price down. Well, they've got to bring

Start time: 578.32
End time: 621.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the price down. But don't we all agree that what with the Kindle Fire and things like that,  we are moving to an era in which there is going to be some kind of a pocket computer, like I  described in Moten God's Eye 50 years ago, that everybody's carrying around with them. It isn't  quite the fire, but the fire comes closer than a lot of the old ones because it's fairly cheap.  200 bucks. And I think that what you've got is that phones are too small for what you want them  for. But men's clothing don't really have anything that lets you carry an iPad. Don't you have a

Start time: 621.70
End time: 633.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  jacket that holds an iPad? I have a Scott E vest that holds an iPad. Yeah, but he can put an iPad  in his pocket. It looks like a bustle though. And I want to wear a bustle. I disagree. I think for

Start time: 633.36
End time: 659.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  years I carried an Italian leather... A fanny pack. Oh, that man purse. No, it was like 9 by 13.  And it would carry almost anything. And I think that one of these days, you're going to have a  change in men's fashions because it's just too dang convenient to be able to have a pocket computer

Start time: 660.16
End time: 673.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that works and is easy to use. I think I might disagree with you, Jerry, on this. I think that  the form factor of these four and a half inch and bigger smartphones is sufficient and they're easy

Start time: 673.52
End time: 687.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  to carry. John's... Go ahead, John. You may be right, but I would carry a fire. I could find a way to  carry it if it were also a phone. I would love that. Yeah. I don't know because you don't want

Start time: 687.96
End time: 692.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  to hold a big thing to your ear like that. No, you use Bluetooth. I don't know. I can either use

Start time: 692.60
End time: 699.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Bluetooth or heck, I have nothing against a little wired gizmo that goes to it. I don't want both ears.

Start time: 700.92
End time: 713.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like these four. This is a 4.65 inch. This is a nice phone. I think it's big enough. This is a  Galaxy S2. It's too big for my taste. Well, you see I have a big battery bump on it because I put a  double-sized battery. That's for the CES. How much are you on the phone? You're never on the phone.

Start time: 713.12
End time: 716.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You don't take email and you never talk on the phone. That's what's interesting and I'm sure

Start time: 716.50
End time: 724.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you'll agree too, Dwight, that these are not phones. These are computers that happen to have  phone capabilities. Who uses these as a phone? Barely. Let me tell you something that's going

Start time: 724.70
End time: 750.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  to happen to all three of you. You're all younger than me. We're going to get brain cancer. Not me.  I don't use a phone that much. I don't like talking. In my case, I did, but let me tell you  something. The legends about absent-mindedness in older people, they're all true. But the interesting  thing is that I've got this little gizmo now and I can carry it around with me. It basically

Start time: 751.90
End time: 763.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  substitutes for the crazy. Especially with Siri where you could say to Siri,  now you don't you have an older iPhone, but if you had the 4S, you could say,  remind me when I leave here to check if I fly up and it would do that.

Start time: 763.98
End time: 769.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Transcript:  Leo is your fly up as I leave the place every day. Perfect. Yeah. Sounds good.

Start time: 775.66
End time: 820.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think that that's a con absent-mindedness I had in mind, but the worst problem with getting old  is you forget names. And you forget names of things you wouldn't believe you had forgotten  the name of as an example. The other day, I couldn't think of the name of the famous dancer  from the early movie days. Now, why I couldn't think of it? Well, you'll come down to it in a  minute. And I couldn't even think of the guy who was his rival. And then, well, I need the name of  his partner. I couldn't remember her name, but I was able to punch in here backwards and in high

Start time: 850.48
End time: 861.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think it's... is it this? It's not mine. I'm sure. I see mine on the little screen down  here and it's just fine. Is it this TV? Is this monitor? It's this camera. It's your camera.

Start time: 861.54
End time: 873.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Your camera. Is it? Yeah. It needs to be slapped. Oh, now it's really... Or punched. There you go.  There you go. Perfect. I'm bashing my cap. Now it's like weird. Now you got half and half.

Transcript:  I agree with you. In fact, I was very disappointed that Google Goggles...  One of the things Eric Schmidt said this year was the one product that we had that we didn't  release was the ability to do facial recognition in Google Goggles. And that would have been,  I just think, awesome if you had your phone just kind of peeking out of your pocket.  And as you came up to somebody and say, that's John C. Dvorak. You used to work with him.  Automatically. And if it had the face recognition, it would do that. I think that was something that

Start time: 902.06
End time: 905.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they missed. It needs to work better than the... It needs to work better than the face recognition.  Especially if you haven't turned up too loud.

Start time: 906.54
End time: 910.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  With Android 4.0.  It would be embarrassing. That's John C. Dvorak.

Start time: 911.14
End time: 935.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know how I handle that because I forget names, but I've always forgotten names.  I don't know why. And I always go, hey, you know, because you have to pretend to know him.  Hey, I haven't seen you for a long time. So what are you doing? Do you have a new card?  I always get it. Because everybody in Silicon Valley always has a new job. They never have a  work for one. Give me your new card.  Yeah. And you get the new card and you look at it and say, oh, you're...  Because you know they've changed jobs. You're at Bloomberg now. That's interesting, Bill.

Start time: 937.36
End time: 947.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Really, my point was, if you're lucky, my partner Larry Niven has had that kind of memory ever  since I've known him, and that's 40 years. He was nine years remembering the names of my kids.

Start time: 965.00
End time: 967.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. No, I think that's normal for smart people.

Start time: 967.08
End time: 1002.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This thing has saved his life in many respects. A lot of his... And if Niven, who's one of the  smartest guys I know, can have that absent mind on his problem, and by the way, Dvorak seems to  have too. I remember on some of our trips, he didn't remember things I was sure he would have.  So I thought, wow, he's like Niven, isn't he? All that's going away.  Right. Carrying a memory in your pocket.  That was the point I was trying to make. I agree.  Not that I'm an old geezer. No, I'm with you.  Maybe I am, but the point is there is a remedy. There's an app for that.

Start time: 1003.28
End time: 1029.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I agree with you. I'm with you, and I think it's very exciting. And to me, this is the right  form factor. But look, the point is that no one form factor obviates any other form factor.  You still can have tablets. You can still have desktops. You can still have all the various...  And people usually do.  And you will. It's not like you're going to say, oh, this is it. I don't need anything more.  But I do love having these in my pocket. And I tell you, if I don't have a smartphone in my  pocket, I feel a little bit disconnected. If I don't have 3G, I feel a little disconnected.  Oh, absolutely.

Transcript:  Here's my question, though, and I'd love to get your guys' thoughts on this.  I think there's a reason more than the price that Sony discontinued its consumer at OLED.  I think the real problem with it was there's a technical issue.  We've heard problems before about OLED, that the purple, the blue dye fades,  that the screens don't last very long. I'm wondering if Sony knows something about OLED  that these guys don't know, that these displays are not very durable.

They don't like that, do they?  They can't do it. So I think they just weren't able to move enough volume to keep selling it.

Start time: 1545.96
End time: 1569.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because what happens is publishers traditionally furnish what?  They have advances, well I don't need advances.  I can live on my income while I write.  They furnish distribution and production.  You don't need that anymore.  Copy editing.  Copy editing.  Your Apple will do that.  Yeah.  Copy editing.

Start time: 1572.60
End time: 1622.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And the other two things publishers do is editing and publicity.  And they do that poorly, by the way.  They're not doing any publicity anymore.  The best publicity I know of right now is if somebody buys one of my books,  Amazon shows down there at the bottom.  People who bought this book also liked it, and they show about nine others of mine.  And they sell a lot of them that way.  As to editing, yeah, you really do need an editor.  Now when I work with Niven, that isn't the case because we edit each other's stuff.  But authors are really pretty terrible at editing their own work.  They really do need an editor.  And that is the only thing left that publishers do that they used to do  that you can't do with a $500 computer.

Start time: 1624.16
End time: 1634.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  It's interesting that Jerry mentions his agent.  The woman who was my agent on the books that I had done,  the computer books that I had done, has become a publisher herself.  She and Ed Bott have started a company called Fairtrade DX.  That's interesting.  They work with the authors and bypass the publishers and do their own publishing,  mostly as e-books.  It's interesting to hear agents taking the part of publishers.  That's the agents were kind of a middleman,  and now they're stepping in and kind of stopping the flow right where they are.  That's really interesting.

Start time: 1707.54
End time: 1741.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well Dwight, more than not, publishers no longer have what used to be known as publisher readers.  People who basically read the slush, because every publisher gets  a far more manuscripts than they can possibly publish, somebody has to select that.  A long time ago, the publisher decided to let the literary agents do that for them.  So they never even read anything that isn't agented to begin with.  Well, that's fine.  If the agents are smart enough to figure out what's publishable,  why do they need that blood-sucking publisher?  Exactly.  Exactly.

Start time: 1743.54

Transcript:  And you need to be careful.  Anybody listening who's taking this conversation seriously,  pay some attention to what's going on on the internet.  Christine Catherine Rush has some...  There are a lot of people out there who claim to be agents,  who in fact are taking kids to the cleaners.  It's astonishing.  My agent is the reason I have my agent do my stuff,  because with our old book, she sold the books in the first place 30, 40 years ago.  And she takes her 15% now, which is fine.  We wouldn't have to give it to her.  But I just think it's fair.  It's right to keep working with her.  But there are a lot of people setting up what they call literary agencies out there,  who are really...  Well, they're thieves.

But whenever I talk about that, people say,  oh, but what about somebody...  You guys are established.  What about somebody new and young and coming up?  How do they break into it?

Start time: 1868.46
End time: 1893.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, how did you ever get noticed?  Come on, most people got into this racket because they went to conventions,  they talked to authors, they made friends with existing authors.  The authors introduced them to his agent.  That's certainly how I got into it.  Mr. Heinlein said, hey, I like what you're doing.  Let me introduce him to the Lurton Blassing game, who was his agent.  But what happens when that system is disintermediated,

Start time: 1897.24
End time: 1919.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  when suddenly you have everybody has the ability to be seen on the internet,  which is the thing with Justin Bieber,  there's a lot of people who are out there putting their music on the internet.  There's a lot of people out there who are doing great writing on websites  and giving it away for free.  That's kind of the new system.  How do you stand out from that system?  That is how you stand out in that cacophony.

Start time: 1919.50
End time: 1958.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the hard part.  There is a cacophony because the more the easier it is,  the lower the barrier to entry, the more people are going to do it.  But in the long run, that's a positive because that means there'll be more great stuff out there.  And I do think in the long run, the cream rises, don't you?  I mean, even if there's a lot more noise,  we also have much better signaling systems.  We have things like Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus,  ways for you to signal that there's something great going on.  I don't think Justin Bieber occurs without YouTube,  but I also really don't think it occurs without Twitter and Facebook  because it was his fans who told other people,  hey, if you like this, you would love Justin Bieber.  And that helped all of us.  And the downside is that this is Rebecca Black.

And I must have one of the things that made Moten God's Eye a best seller was  Long John Neville.  Isn't that interesting?  The Joey Bishop show I was on.

So this guy is on the air.  Larry's snoring over there and he's not next to you.  So you can't poke him.  It's like 2 a.m.  He's like, and he's a good ways away.

When I say Citrix, I always think of Ed Iacobucci and those great times at Comdex  driving around with Ed and Gina Smith.  We had a lot of fun.  I get excited when I go to Vegas because I think back to those good times.  Citrix, of course, was started by Ed because of his intimate knowledge of the workings of Windows NT.  He was working at IBM, but he helped Microsoft write the NT kernel.  He said, I know how to do remote access better than anyone.  In fact, he was right.  Citrix also makes consumer products based on the same incredible remote access back end  like GoToMeeting.  I've been watching GoToMeeting over the years just get better and better and better.  It started with screen sharing.  It was a great way to hold a meeting.  They made it easier and easier to start meetings right out of Outlook or your email program.  You just click a button, invite people.  You don't have to have GoToMeeting installed ahead of time.  It's great for presenting to clients because all you do is you send them a link.  They click the link.  They say yes when it says you're ready to start the meeting and the software installs  and they're seeing your screen.  But now even better, they're seeing you.  GoToMeeting has added HD video conferencing.  They call it HD Faces.  I'll tell you what.  It's one thing to share screens, but when you're seeing HD video of your client and  they're seeing you, it is such a great way to communicate, to meet.  You can turn the audio off on this.  I don't care if we hear them, but this is a demonstration of it.  Literally, that's the video just like that.  You can move the screens around.  It's just remarkable.  If you haven't tried it yet, I want you to visit them.  GoToMeeting.com and click the Try It Free button.  You can try this for 30 days absolutely free.  One of the things we ask of all of our advertisers.  GoToMeeting, click the Try It Free button.  Use the offer code TWIT for 30 days free.  It is a great way to get a sense of what GoToMeeting can do.  You've got to check out the HD Faces.  I think that's just transformational.  People spend hundreds of thousands of dollars.  That sounds exaggerated, but it's not.  Tens anyway.  Building these conference systems with telepresence.  Now it's right in there.  $49 a month.  As many meetings as you want, as long as you want.  Free for the first month.  GoToMeeting.com.  Use the offer code TWIT.  How do you like my dog?  Have you met Ozzy before, John?  Of course.

The interesting thing is they have managed to survive when they went for profit rather  than market share, which strategy was what took them to the point where in 1996 they  were about down the tube, and Jobs figured out a way to make that profitable after all.

So yes, the Super Bowl will be streamed on the internet.  But I'm thinking if I'm the NFL, what do I really want?  I want to disintermediate all the...  I don't want NBC.  I don't want Comcast.  I don't want Verizon.  I want to make an NFL app that you pay $39.95 a year for.  Major League Baseball is already doing this.  And that's where you watch it.  And then I get all the revenue.

And it'd be easy for Apple to do it.  If you have an iPhone 4S, you control it with Siri.

In fact, nowadays, when I put a check in the Bank of America ATM machine,  all it does is scan it and throw the check out.  Yep.  They don't need the check.  They just need the routing number.

And everybody said, what are you talking about?  Logitech already said it was a $100 million blunder for us.  I happen to have the Logitech review, which is a Google TV.  They recently updated the firmware, and I love it.  And I think apps, it's already got some apps.  It needs more apps.  What's better about it?  Well, for one thing, it's not like a Roku box where it's another HDMI input.  You spend all this time on your remote saying, which one is it?  It's horrible.  It's a pass-through, so your cable box goes into it.  So it's an overlay on top of your TV, which means you'll overlay a browser,  you'll overlay Twitter.  You can pull up a menu, you can go to Netflix,  but you never leave that single HDMI, which means it also would build into a TV.  Well, who's going to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Possibly, I don't know.  What kind of services would you like?  The point is because it's their app, they can decide.

Steve Jobs went to the music company and said, 99 cents a song.  They said, no way.  He said, you know what, you're getting killed by piracy.  99 cents a song.  And they did it.

Transcript:  The key is twofold.  Point of access, it has to be easy, right?  Piracy thrived when you couldn't get this stuff.  And that's, by the way, the problem right now with television and cable is,  if you're not the right subscriber to the right thing, you can't get it.  And that's why piracy will thrive in a broadband world.  But if it's easy to get and the price is affordable,  I think people want to support you, Jerry.  I think people want to support John C.

I do think that you're going to see it.  And that's what SOPA and PIPA are about.  I don't think it's about protecting authors like Jerry.

These publishers put a demand on you and they say,  you have to give us all the copyrights and here's what you're going to get paid.  Who's this protecting?  Giant content holders.

He sold it for $5 without copy protection on his website.  The last time I saw it was over a million dollars.  He's donating to the charities.

Transcript:  One of the reasons pirates thrived in the music industry  was because the artists to whom one presumes the audience basically  thinks they owe their loyalty to, that is, audiences don't love record companies,  but they like performers.  The performers and the artists were basically saying,  go ahead and pirate it.  We don't own it.  We don't get any money.  Steal it.  Steal it.  And I think that is really what destroyed the record industry  was their greediness to the point where they were excluding the...  Well, remember the artist formerly known as Prince?

They'll send you...  They can give you money from PayPal.  They'll send you a check if you want.  A Walmart gift card.  What I would recommend is an Amazon gift card  because you get a 5% bonus.  So you just get an additional 5%.  They would love to buy your used cameras, your laptops, your tablets,  your MP3 players, your cell phones.  Anything you're not using, you can get cash for it.  There are 22 categories, not including ISDN, Bitsurf, or Modems.  Every gadget worth a dollar or more gets free shipping.  So what you do is you get a couple of gadgets in there,  so you get the free shipping,  and then throw in stuff that is not worth anything,  but they'll recycle responsibly.  Listen to this, John.  Not only do they not ship it offshore to some Chinese prison camp,  they don't even put it in the landfill.  They recycle it so that everything gets used.

Their stock's gone from 80 bucks 10 years ago to 50 cents on the New York Stock Exchange.  50 cents.  And you're not allowed to be a 50 cent stock on the prestigious New York Stock Exchange.

They knew that their business was going to be completely reinvented.  And they got into it.  And they make great digital cameras.  The problem was somebody asked a Kodak VP, he said, here's the problem.  The margins on film and processing were so high that by losing film and processing,  we're not able to replace those revenues by just selling digital cameras.  That's because they were addicted to the margins.

They got into it.  They had a good digital strategy.  They bought Ophoto.  Remember they had a Kodak easy share site.  It made it very easy.  The problem wasn't that they didn't succeed in digital.  The problem was their business model didn't work.  They couldn't make as much money as they did in film and process.  Well, they were set up for the high margin.

Start time: 4951.34
End time: 4962.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

He said it is not a right.  Technology is an enabler of rights, but not a right itself.  There's a high bar for something to be considered a human right.  He's writing in the New York Times.  It has to be something we need to be able to lead healthy, meaningful lives like freedom  from torture or freedom from conscience.  But internet is not one of those.  Do you agree?  Yeah.  Jerry, I'm sure you agree too, being a good libertarian.

Start time: 5003.40

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I agree to the extent that I don't feel like trying to multiply fundamental rights.  But I am also concerned that without the mechanism of free speech,  and the internet is becoming essentially the mechanism of free speech,  you don't have any way to get your fundamental rights.  The fact that you can run a mimeograph in the basement  may have been an important right back in 50 years ago,  but it isn't going to do you much good to get your cause out now.  I think there is implied in the freedom of speech concept  a freedom to be allowed to be heard.  It doesn't require me to listen, but it does at least  allow you to make it possible for me to listen.  Without internet access, I don't think you have free speech.  Very well said.

There's also a self-serving interest for governments to preserve a free and open internet.  It is a mechanism for innovation and economic development.  It's very powerful.  Oh, yeah.  So it is in their interest to preserve a free and open internet.  I think even China realizes that by closing the internet is in the long run  deleterious to their economic prosperity.

The idea of spot was, oh, we'll use this unused kind of carrier on FM radio that's global,  it's everywhere to send very small, un-customizable bits of information to wristwatches.

I mean, these are very good choices for Audible books because they're cinematic in the prose.  So they just come to life when a reader is reading these books.

But one of the things you say that I love it, and in a way, this is the thesis of the book,  is that nobody understands how anything works anymore.  So if something were to destroy our technology infrastructure,  could we rebuild it?  Do you know how a car works?  Do you know how a microwave works?  Do you know how a computer works?

There's just so many wonderful books at Audible.  Over 100,000 titles now.  And I think you ought to give them a try.  If you like to listen, these books come to life.

Actually, she was very clever because the original idea of this joystick was just some  games.  It was like eight games in one.  She, when she designed the logic, she wrote a back door that if you do this thing.  With the joystick.  With the joystick, it opens up the C64.  You've got the whole C64 ROM.  You've got basic.  You've got the whole thing.  Originally, the guys she made it for, the Chinese firm that she made it for, they were  furious that she put this back door in it.

And then occasionally there's funny things like GS Elevator gossip.  They're just funny to read.  Yeah, no, it's hilarious.

Transcript:  Another one that I-  All right.  Well, you can go back and look at them every so often,  but the one I'm getting a kick out of currently is Keith Olbermann.  Because apparently what I do when people are like-  Whatever happened to him?  Being snarky.  It's a long story.  But when people are being snarky with each other, generally speaking,  you can just ban them because you don't need it.  He encourages it.  So he's cussing people out.  He's calling them a-holes.  That's actually a good strategy.  He's getting into beefs with everybody.  It's hilarious.

So the new deal between Time Warner and Netflix, Redbox, and Blockbuster  is going to double the window for new releases.  Used to be 30 days after DVD sales.

The two kinds of people in this world in organizations.  In every organization, there are people who are devoted to the principles  that the organization was founded for, like good classroom teachers and so forth.  And there are people who are devoted to the organization itself,  like school administrators and so forth.  And the iron law is the second group always gets in control.  Always.

You all know that Newt Gingrich is a very old friend of mine.  I did not know that.  Oh, the first time I ever met Newt was my phone rang in 1980 or thereabouts.  And this voice said, this is Newt Gingrich.  I'd never heard of him.  He had read my book, A Step Farther Out, and he had called the publisher and got my name and  phone number and called me to talk about it.  Now, I haven't had too many congressmen want to call up and discuss concepts of science and so forth.  So I was kind of his science advisor up to the time he became speaker.  Wow.  So Newt's a personal friend.  And that made life easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, what I would like to see is Newt as a postmaster general.  And don't laugh.  I meant by that the way the postmaster general used to be,  which was the fifth ranking cabinet officer.  And he basically was the minister without portfolio.  That was traditionally for a long time in this country,  the postmaster general was the chief advisor to the president.  What?  He wasn't expected to run the post office.

Start time: 7065.38

Start time: 7091.24
End time: 7103.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, not only is he a master,  Newt's problem is that he surrounds himself with smart people.  So he doesn't mind saying something that's fairly silly  on the grounds that the people around him are going to say,  Newt, you're crazy.

Start time: 7104.84

Start time: 7107.62
End time: 7123.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He does that every now and then.  He does say silly things.  And he basically expects his friends to correct him for it.  But it sure as hell gets out in public that,  oh, Newt just did something stupid.  Well, probably.

Start time: 7124.70
End time: 7139.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The truth is, I like your idea because I do think Newt is a brilliant guy  and probably would bring a lot of interesting thoughts and ideas to the table.  But I don't think he should be an administrator,  but make him a postmaster general.  So he has a minister with that portfolio.  Those days are over.  They're gone.

Start time: 7140.04
End time: 7170.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, those days are over, but there are posts like that still.  You will understand that, well, Newt has no administrative experience as such,  except for once.  As the Speaker of the House, he did reorganize the architect of the Capitol's office,  and he actually made it work.  He managed to get the Capitol building back under decent management  when he was Speaker.  That's not generally known.  Interesting.  So he does have some.  Now, that's not a lot of executive experience.  That is his.

Steve Jobs famously said that the reason he didn't make  Apple computers in the United States  is because there weren't enough quality control engineers  and the kind of skilled people  that he thought you needed to do it.  Now that may or may not be correct,  but it would be correct in the case that we're doing.  So we're doing basically a fairy tale.  If you had to run the country with a disaster coming,  what would you do to reform the schools?  It's interesting.  Just make everything different.  Now it's a fairy tale.

Transcript:  Thanks for being here, John.  And thanks also to Dwight Silverman,  who had to leave early at the Houston Chronicle blog.  We are going to go live now to CES coverage.  We will be back.  Our schedule is a little different.  I encourage you to go to inside.twit.tv  to see what the schedule will be this week.  We're doing security now at 9 a.m. on Monday.  And this week in Google, 11 a.m. on Monday, both times specific,  so that we can get those shows in the cam before I head to Vegas.  We will have nonstop coverage of CES beginning Tuesday,  but we are going to be there tonight and tomorrow night.  And we are also doing something we haven't done before.  We are going to live stream Steve Ballmer's last keynote at CES,  because I'm of the opinion that Microsoft is going to go out with a bang.

Transcript:  Anyway, we will.  That starts at 6 30 p.m. Pacific tomorrow.  And we are going to have commentary from our Windows Weekly hosts,  Mary Jo Foley and Paul Therotte, as Ballmer does the last Microsoft keynote at CES.  So that should be something worth watching.  Lots of CES coverage coming up.  We'll be back next week here in studio with Twitter, as always,  Sunday's 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern on Twitter.TV.  Thanks for watching.  And we'll see you at CES.  Another tweet is in the can.
