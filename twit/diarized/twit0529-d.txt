Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 252.36
End time: 262.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, one thing that's changed is you can now buy the iPhone illegally and officially in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a store in New Zealand that keeps complaining about these Americans coming to get the iPhones in the middle of the night.  I fix it. That's what they do. They go down. They buy it because that's the first place, right?  Where the sun rises. And then they, it must be that store must be horrible because there's people dropping them,  putting them in blenders, taking them apart. It's like it must be the worst to work at that Apple store.

End time: 320.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am a plus size too in more ways than one. You are only a plus size in phone.  And I also got pink. Although we were debating before the show began.  Because I think there's some other shades in there when you tilt it. It's like a little gold, a little copper.

Start time: 344.40
End time: 355.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just going to go on record and say that I really like this color.  I was actually a little worried that it was going to be just pink, pink, pink.  But it's more interesting. It's a little kind of iridescent with some copper.  What's wrong with pink, pink, pink?

Start time: 356.00
End time: 364.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But even so, it's not likely that you don't put a case on it, right?  So nobody knows that I've got this awesome pink phone, which is too bad.  But I got a new pink band. Do you like that?

Start time: 366.56
End time: 370.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For your watch? Oh, you got that. Yeah. That's the, oh, that's fluoro elastomer.

Start time: 371.82
End time: 378.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  All I know is I had to pay $50 to get the new extra large band so I could actually wear it for more than two hours.  And it popped up, my hand being ready to fall off.

Start time: 381.04
End time: 404.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's funny because mine are too small and they don't, they won't even the at the smallest one.  It does. It doesn't read my heart rate all that well, so I have to push it to me.  I'm tiny. But also when I went to Disney World, I had to pull off the adult size adapter and wear the child's band for the magic band.  So I just got a tiny band. Just a tiny, tiny person.  I have heard women come. Power's quote. What's that? Small hands.

Start time: 404.54
End time: 405.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Small hands. Big heart.

Start time: 409.88
End time: 428.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My wife also got the six plus S plus.  And I thought the women didn't like the big one because it won't fit in your pocket.  Like, because women have, I didn't know this. I just learned this. Women have shallow pockets.  How did you not know that? How did you know? Because I hang out with women sometimes.  Just getting to know women for the first time.

Start time: 428.04
End time: 437.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like on the IT crowd, he's like, I'm wearing the women's pants.  Which is not fair.  Can you please check the tag on his Levi's?

Start time: 438.20
End time: 444.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that you can get women's pants with deep pockets. You must be able to.  Well, sure, if you want to wear Carhartts, but.  All right.

Start time: 446.02
End time: 458.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're actually pretty stylish now. The type with the long slacks, sort of fellish.  Yeah, it fits in the pants. It's good for the purse though, because if it's too small, then it goes all the way down to the bottom of your purse and you can't find it.  That's a good point too. You want it to float.

Start time: 459.62
End time: 462.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So a six plus floats on the purse to treat us?

Start time: 462.30
End time: 464.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because you can't just sink. There's too much stuff.

Start time: 464.02
End time: 472.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But my friends at work that have larger iPhones that are women that are smaller have a hand problem because their hands are so small compared to their phone.  They almost have to always have two hands on it.

Start time: 473.86
End time: 483.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember, I've turned it off on this one so I can't demo. Remember Apple made a big deal last year about the double tap this and the screen goes down halfway?  Do you use that? That seems so dopey to me.

Start time: 484.46
End time: 485.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And when it happens, I'm like, get out of here.

Start time: 486.06
End time: 490.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why I disabled it. I don't want to see it. But that's to solve that problem right now.

Start time: 490.28
End time: 493.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or at least to address it. I don't think it actually solves it.  Brings the icons to you.

Start time: 494.00
End time: 498.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't have small hands. I assure you, half sizing the screen does not solve the problem. It just pisses you off.

Start time: 499.34
End time: 513.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I think. You don't want icons to move on their own.  So I have to say, having used this for a while, and Natalie I'd be curious what your experience is, unfortunately Patrick just bought the iPhone 6.  Yeah, I'm a little behind the curve.  Well, but that puts you in an awkward position because it's too early to buy another.

Start time: 513.00
End time: 514.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No pinging and popping for you, Patrick.

Start time: 515.66
End time: 536.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say, and I've been using Android for two years because I kind of just got fed up with the closed ecosystem.  And I like widgets. I like the back button. I just felt like Android was more flexible and capable.  I probably will go back to this. I'm very, look at the, you were mentioning peak and pop.  So right now it's just Apple apps and Instagram, oddly enough.  But if I just touch Instagram lightly.

Start time: 537.00
End time: 537.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nope, that's the wrong thing.

Start time: 538.32
End time: 560.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know. You get the, I know. I'm just showing them.  Oh, sorry.  You get the jiggle jiggle. Still just like before.  Right.  And if you touch it a little harder, you get a pop-up. I've done it with the wrong hand.  You get a pop-up menu that shows you the up to four commands typically would be the four most used commands.  I feel like this is a power user feature.  You can go right to the part, you know, I'm going to take a selfie right.  It's awesome is what it is.

Start time: 561.57
End time: 564.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And it makes so much more sense than the interface on the watch.

Start time: 565.00
End time: 568.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's why I was very skeptical because force touch on the watch, I know it's terrible.

Start time: 569.00
End time: 575.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody wrote a really interesting article that they pointed out that there were just too many ways to interface with the watch, especially given how hard Apple had worked.

Start time: 577.01
End time: 601.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  David Pogue proposed.  And it's the funniest thing. He says the watch is too complicated and I have a proposal.  And it was the most complicated. I couldn't even figure it out from reading it.  His proposed simplification, which underscores it's just hard to make a user interface on a device that small.  That's in any way usable.  I mean, look at the icons on this. You can't.  That's almost that's almost it's like mean to make icons that small.

Start time: 602.06
End time: 606.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the other thing is, is you've you've you have entirely too many inputs.  You've got the screen, the button, the crown.

Start time: 608.10
End time: 618.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Steve Jobs was famous for not even putting two buttons on a mouse.  This thing has like four different you force touch.  You got the crown. You got the button. They all do different things.  It's almost like jobs is dead.

Start time: 620.83
End time: 625.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not fun, Joe.  Oh, I'm sorry. I was but fundamentally accurate.  I mean, drinking, haven't you?

Start time: 628.57
End time: 631.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, my point is, I'm not.  Everybody just stopped. Wow.

Start time: 633.91
End time: 640.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll see myself out. I apologize.  I'm just my point was that there's a person in charge of the company and different products.  And so I'm not surprised. Here's the thing.

Start time: 641.12
End time: 698.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I was talking about this in the radio show today.  I had a light went on for me that Apple has a problem because there are very credible phones.  You mentioned in Moto G that's 200 bucks, 300 bucks around the world.  People use smartphones.  Even you look at the Syrian refugee camps, they all have smartphones.  So you can't obviously.  Apple is in a different market. They won't make a cheap phone.  This phone here, Natalie, I bet yours is like that, too.  This cost me nine hundred fifty dollars.  One hundred twenty eight gigabytes. It's ridiculous.  So Apple, not if you're Apple.  Well, but the point being that the other companies making almost equivalent phones or maybe in some ways equivalent phones for a lot less money.  It's very clear. Apple's got a great profit margin.  They're smart. They went. They made it as cheap as they could.  And then they they decided we're going to go with fashion because there's one business in the world.  Natalie, tell me this is you know, this to be true.  Don't people say, oh, how much does that cost to make?  I'm overpaying. And that's high fashion.  You don't ask her, Ms. How much did that still scarf cost you to make?

Start time: 699.50
End time: 713.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't care. No, you don't know.  No, yeah. What's what's the economic term for that is a veblen good is that it's desirable because it's more because it costs more.  Exactly. So that's brilliant.

Start time: 713.38
End time: 728.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good. So Apple Apple has I mean, this is a good business strategy.  You make it as cheaply as you can. Right.  And you sell it for as dear as you can.  And the best way to do that is to make your goods be what is that you called them, Natalie, somehow magical.

Start time: 729.00
End time: 734.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's a veblen good is what you want it because it talks it because it costs more.

Start time: 735.06
End time: 750.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. The Wall Street Journal back in July, Apple share smartphone industry's profits sourced in 92 percent.  They sell 20 percent of the smartphones. They make 92 percent of the profits.  I don't think they're doing anything wrong from a business capitalist perspective.  Hell no. If you're a stockholder, you're very happy.

Start time: 751.56
End time: 754.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Veblen. Is that named after Thorsten Veblen?  Oh, it is. Yeah.

Start time: 755.62
End time: 769.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Material commodities for which the demand is proportional to its high price, which is an apparent contradiction of the law of demand.  Veblen goods are also commodities that function as positional goods.  Exactly. It's a status symbol.  That's the place. It's a status symbol.  I'm quoting Wikipedia.  And well, which makes sense, which is exactly why Apple's going.

Start time: 770.10
End time: 772.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wasn't quoting Wikipedia for the record.

Start time: 772.82
End time: 775.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Yes. I thought I said it in case I didn't.

Start time: 776.00
End time: 782.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Watch this, though. Hey, Siri. Oh, gosh.  What's a veblen good?

Start time: 784.26
End time: 788.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I found some information about veblen goods on Wikipedia. Would you like me to read it to you?

Start time: 789.40
End time: 790.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, please. Yes.

Start time: 792.56
End time: 795.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In economics, veblen goods are types of material.

Start time: 795.08
End time: 797.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's something new. That's actually very, very cool.

Start time: 798.67
End time: 818.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's really cool.  I was Lisa and I were taking a walk yesterday and we saw a street sign I'd never seen before.  It said speed table. I don't want to speed. What's a speed table?  So Lisa asked her phone and it told us.  And I'm walking down the street having this kind of moment where I'm thinking I'm living in the future.  Yeah, that's pretty amazing.

Start time: 819.00
End time: 827.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Remember, there was a time when we thought that we would use like, what's the term for it?  We would have our streaming reality like the Google Glass.

Start time: 828.46
End time: 830.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Virtual reality and always be augmented reality.

Start time: 832.72
End time: 846.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Augmented reality, right. When we thought we would just like point the phone and have it tell us.  But now I think what we're realizing now is we do want to drive a little bit more.  We don't want it always there.  We want to know or to tell it when we want it and then otherwise not have it.

Start time: 847.34
End time: 868.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but as a caveat to the discussion about cost to build versus cost to sell, when Microsoft built the original surface,  I was up on their campus with Steve Misnowsky and they were just shown us the first time in public that these devices were out.  And he said, look, they're going to tear it down and give you a component cost.  Ignore that. They're totally off base and don't try to calculate our margins.  Yeah, Apple said the same thing, too. You can't tell how much it costs us.

Start time: 869.18
End time: 872.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what? It costs less. I believe that doesn't cost more.

Start time: 873.08
End time: 876.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple didn't get 200 billion dollars in cash by accident.  They're one of the most amazing corporations in history.

Start time: 877.00
End time: 918.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this is a brilliant solution to that problem.  Nobody's going to ask how much a Gucci dress cost to make that has nothing to do with it.  In fact, as you point out, Natalie, it's worth more because it's worth more.  It costs more. I'm thinking about the Apple watch. Same thing.  I'm thinking about the Apple car.  We'll get to that in a moment.  But I realize that the point of the watch is not about a technology product or computer.  It's hard to use. It's at $18,000. It's ridiculously overpriced.  That's a good thing because what this is is a status symbol.  In fact, what it really is is a signal that you're one of us.  If you're wearing an Apple watch, you go up and you say, hi, how do you like that Apple watch?

Start time: 921.39
End time: 938.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  These guys are clearly figuring this out and saying, look, we've got a problem here.  Phones are going to get cheaper.  They're going to be just as good for 200 bucks for less.  What are we going to do because we want to keep our margins up?  And they solved it. I think they licked it.  And that's why it's pink.

Start time: 939.36
End time: 946.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

And I never do like a don't you know who I am kind of thing, but I'm kind of like, no, this is something I know what I'm talking about actually.

And he says, you know, when you go into Best Buy, they're going to tune the TV so that the cheapest one works the crappiest.  They do it on purpose.  And Best Buy wouldn't let us publish that part of the video because we were filming in their store.  And they're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, excuse me.  Well, do you blame them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I would have I would have stepped outside the store and say, let's say that again.  Cut it in later in the edit.  So anyway, I don't know. I guess it's not.  I mean, I feel like I had an epiphany. Obviously, I didn't.  The Apple's just brilliant in terms of they always have been a marketing.  But what's happened is they've really repositioned themselves as a fashion brand and they can get away with this price.  Having said that, I don't know if they've done it, but they're trying really hard to.  Well, yeah, maybe not.  I mean, having said that, I do really like this phone.  They've sped up the touch ID.  Natalie, have you noticed that if you were in the habit?  That's nice.  If you were in the habit of turning on the phone to see your notifications or what time it was by pressing the home button, you can't do that anymore because it's so fast that as soon as you press the home button, it's unlocked.  Here, I'll turn it off.  So you have to now use the on off button.  So I think a lot of people went, oh, let me see what time it is.  I'll just wait.  Oh, that is smoking.  I didn't see that.  Let's do that.  Let's do that again.  Let me see what time it is here.  Oh, I turned Siri on by accident.  Here we go.  Oh, this is another thing.  In fact, I learned this because I want to show this the live photos.  Now, I don't know if this is going to take off.  This is a live photo lock screen.  So if you force touch it, that 3D touch thing, it comes alive, which I think is kind of cool.  I have a picture of my dog that to me really.  Let's see if I can find this here.  This is this is what you want to see.  Isn't it?  Some guys swiping through his photos.  So here's here's Ozzy in the car.  Now, that's a kind of fun picture and you get a sense of motion.  But because I held the phone still for a second and a half before and like usual after taking the picture, I didn't drop the phone.  I kept it up for another second and a half.  Now I forced touch it.  And you've got like kind of the video behind the picture, which I think is kind of cool.  Audio, too.

Start time: 1277.18
End time: 1286.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm really impressed by it.  I think it's given how easy it is to actually capture the images and store them.  It's going to be popular.  It's not a lot of extra work.  And so people may actually pick it up.

Transcript:  But they said that eventually, you know, one of the problems with this is that someone will take the picture and then immediately drop the phone and go off on their day.  And so you'll get like a blur at the end of it.  Million of those.  They'll remember and they what they're going to do something on it.  And that's a software fix.  Use a gyroscope.

Facebook said at the event that they were going to support it on iOS versions of Facebook,  which I think would make that compelling.  Actually, I'm more interested in this 360 video.  Did you see the Star Wars 360 video on Facebook?  Yes.

Start time: 1383.40

There's going to be a $99 Gear VR from Samsung coming in November just in time for the holiday season.  But you, of course, need a Samsung phone to use it.  And it's interesting to watch.  It's almost like Facebook knows they need to ease people into the glorious concept of 360 degree content.  And they're doing it by a 2D window on the website just to get people jammed with the idea.

Perfect place to use it, right?  Oh, of course, because everything's going on.  Everything's all around you.  That's why it's quite good looking, to be honest.

You would know how to get around it.  So things have changed a lot in the packaging and the technology behind the screen,  but I feel like the actual iOS core experience is relatively similar to where it was eight years ago now,  which I like, by the way. It works great.  See, that's the knock-eye, because it's still a grid of icons.

And so now from the... the 6 was just such a good phone that normally by the time September comes around, I'm like, oh yeah, I need it because I'm hard on them or I don't know.  But the 6, like it held up to my lifestyle.  It is. It's a pretty nice phone.  Yeah. So I didn't need a new one. I, you know, this is, this doesn't belong to me. I should say that. It's a tester. It has to go back.

Start time: 2050.00
End time: 2071.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I broke the screen and bent mine in the first five days.  And that was because normally I don't use a phone without, you know, some sort of industrial case around it.  And I tried and it just turned out horribly for everyone involved, especially the phone.  But it was, I was actually shocked at how light the case was on the 6. That's like my only complaint about the 6 and the one really attractive thing about the 6S.

It is very, very close to the Chevron refinery, but I've been there for a week when, dear,  I was in the middle of doing the This Week in Computer Harbor podcast.  Did the siren go off?  No, but he comes in, drops a phone in between me and the net cam and says,  refinery's on fire, gotta go, gotta go, gotta go.  And it's a picture of what looks like this orange flame.

These guys are...  I love it because they're so committed to making your website look beautiful and work great.  And that's the two things they do.  They host.  It's best hosting ever.  Never goes down.  Super reliable.  We try all the time to crash Squarespace sites.  You just can't do it.  But they also are really committed to aesthetics.  They want your website to look great, and not merely to look great, but to reflect your  personal style.  And that's great.  Mine is.

So that means...  In fact, if you go to nathaliemorris.com as we try to break it down, you can resize the  page and you can see it's going to look great on any size screen from a small smartphone  to a...  Yeah.

I think that's what every site needs to do these days because you can never be sure what  size screen your visitors are going to come in on.  Oh, more than half of our visitors now come in on small screens.

Start time: 2460.28
End time: 2473.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not surprised at all.  Also, what's great about Squarespace, if I can just add into this little ad, there are  tools to make your site and build it out are great if you're not a hardcore developer like  me.  And so it's very easy to use.  Yeah.  Even I could figure it out, which is impressive.

Start time: 2542.38
End time: 2649.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alliteration.  Yeah.  But also it really is aesthetic.  And you see a lot of other website builders and stuff.  And it doesn't, it looks cookie cutter.  It looks kind of clunky.  It looks frankly like it came from 2004.  And so I think they should emphasize how gorgeous that stuff looks.  So we did talk a little bit about Oculus.  The Oculus event was this week.  We did a TWIT live special covering the keynote.  Big news, the takeaways.  I'll give you the takeaways.  First of all, the Oculus Rift, or as they call it, Rift itself won't be available till  next year.  They still don't say at exact date or a price.  Q1 is all they say.  Little disappointing.  They also have hand controllers.  And the people we had on the show, the experts in VR said that really that's a very big  part of it.  Until you have a hand controller, you're just ahead in space.  And the ability to manipulate objects becomes very important.  Unfortunately, those won't be available till Q2.  They also, as I think I heard, there it is.  That's the touch.  Yeah.  A little bit of haptics, but it's not about you knowing what the surface feels like.  It's really just about you being able to manipulate.  And they talked about a demo.  Have you ever, any of you have done this?  There's a demo that Oculus does where there's two people in the virtual world and you can  play catch or you can cooperate.  And we had a couple of really, we had, I can't remember their names.  Who do we have on the event?  It was Bob and Jeff.  Jeff Grubb from VentureBeat.  And from-  Oh, I love Jeff.  Yeah, Jeff's great.  He does gaming.  And from the road to VR, I want to say Bob, can't be hung, but that's the name that comes  to mind.  Wow.  I'm going to say-  I don't know any personal details about him, but for some reason that's what I think his  name is.

Transcript:  You had an out.  You had an out and you couldn't take it.  What I love, they were going back to the second image we had of the hand controllers.  Ben Lang.  Lang, thank you, Ben.  Sorry.  Okay.  The guy wearing the headset with the little hand-hold thing did look shockingly nerdy.  And I'm curious if there's going to be any sort of perception problems around use of  this technology, especially in the wake of the Google Glass, not meltdown per se, but  just failure.

Start time: 2670.76
End time: 2681.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, not just Glass.  Remember that thing called the Segway?  It was going to change the world except that you looked like a dork riding one.  There is something to be said for looking less dorky when you wear stuff like that.

Start time: 2681.30
End time: 2693.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, first of all, if you're alone in your room-  I'm a Veppelin good.  If you're alone in your room playing games, you probably already look dorky.  If you are in a VR environment, everybody's wearing a headset, so nobody really knows  how dorky you look.

Transcript:  I'm with you because I, and I for a long time thought that AR was much more interesting  I'm now, Ben and Jeff were saying, when you experience this thing where you're in a world  with somebody else, it actually can change.  It's amazing.  I have to say now, having I got the Gear VR, the Galaxy thing, I've looked at a lot of  demos.  I'm a little bit more sold on this.  It is immersive.  And it's not just immersive for gaming, although that's a big part of it.  In fact, for me, not a big part at all.  It's immersive for like going to Times Square or going to Paris or I would love to have  a VR camera in the studio and you could come, you could watch the show, but you could look  around.  See, we choose what you're looking at now.  We show whoever's talking, but wouldn't it be great if you could look back and forth  and see what your reaction is to what I'm saying?

Transcript:  But you'll still, I mean, having watched some of the content created by a large international  media company, like to some degree, yes, you'll be able to choose, but in most cases, they  will still control the narrative by giving you certain things to choose and by using  audio cues in an attempt to create a story that is more compelling.

Transcript:  Yeah.  See, I'm very interested in that, but that's very different because you're not sealed in.  And for a long time, I thought that was better because who wants to be isolated in this box?  And that's one of the reasons having two people is kind of interesting.  But there's a Cirque du Soleil.  If you can borrow or beg or steal a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 or an S6 and this visor, you  put the phone in it, there's a Cirque du Soleil demo and you're sitting in the middle of a  performance and there are performers all around you.  And they were smart when they filmed it because the performers are interacting with the camera.  So it looks like if I look over here, there's somebody interacting with me.  I look over there and you really, and you can look over and there's a person back and  they're all doing different Cirque style stuff and it's fun.  It's really interesting.

I'm curious what we can do that's new and different in terms of content, interactions,  and experiences.  Because if we can do more like Cirque du Soleil, I would like that in my life because Circona  is in Vegas and I'm not.  Right.  Well, that's a perfect example.  Here's the toy box.

Transcript:  But I have a question about cognition though, and I don't know if any of us can really answer  We notice things now because of our peripheral vision.  So when you're trying to focus on one thing, there is no concept of peripheral.  Like this stuff, you don't notice this out of your peripheral vision, right?  You have to then take your attention off of what you're looking at and turn to look at  it.

Transcript:  Yeah.  In a lot of cases, when you look at like Dolby has some pretty extensive VR audio stuff that  they're working on.  Yeah.  And I think that point is like, you know, audio cues are critical for storytelling in  a VR environment because you just said it, how do you get people to turn your head?  We can do an arrow that's really clumsy or you can have something happen off on stage  right and then your head turns to stage right and you know, the goblin comes in or something.

Yeah, the audio was crazy.  But imagine that game now with all this new technology, it would be three times terrifying.  So I'm curious.

Transcript:  I got to say, having used it, I understand what you're saying because it but what happens  is it's interesting.  The mind wants to accept and kind of flesh out even a constrained experience.  So the example is, of course, 24 frame per second movies.  You're not you're only seeing 24 frames a second because of persistence of vision and  the mind's desire to see motion.  You quickly forget that you're seeing something so visually limited.  You don't have peripheral vision.  You're only seeing maybe 180 degrees at most.  Not even that probably.  But there's something that happens.  Your mind wants to accept it as reality, I guess.  And so you quickly kind of accept it and you're in it.  And it's very hard not to.  In fact, that's one of the reasons people I think get nauseous is it is immersive.  And that's when you start feeling queasy because you get nauseous because you've disconnected

You're really just sitting in a cart that's got being jiggled back and forth while big  movies go by and stuff.  And they say, if you get at all disoriented, just look at look outside the cart and you'll  see your bags and stuff there.  And it's true.  Because I'm looking at the floor.  Because it's so when you look up here, you really think you're on a roller coaster.  It's very vivid.  And I think that's what happens.  I think the human mind adapts.

So if you're inside of this helmet thing, like the demo I did with Microsoft, there  dragon that came out and like swung at your head as if it were decapitating you.  And I actually ducked.

Transcript:  3D was a MacGuffin to keep selling televisions when they were running out of the ability  to sell televisions.  But it's also on some level, I don't think VR is really going to work until you're pretty  much you have a socket in the back of your neck and you plug in.  That's a long way off.  I'm not arguing that it's a long way off, but there's still going to be this huge, you  know, as long as, you know, as long as there's your inner ear and the rest of your body receiving  radically different sensations than what your eyes are doing, there will be some level of  disconnect.  I agree that it's incredibly compelling.  The Oculus Rift demo I saw at CES this year was like, was the first time I ever went like,  OK, this is going to happen.  I don't know how long it's going to last, but this is going to happen and it's going  to be really, really cool because, you know, they went through a whole bunch of scenarios  for the use of the of the technology and a couple of them were absolutely and utterly  compelling.

Transcript:  All right. So careful now.  A little bit of warning here.  This is pretty violent and probably will only excite gamers.  This was one of the demos that they showed.  The really amazing guy behind the Unreal Engine epic came on and showed this is a  game they're going to call Bullet Train.  It's a it's a virtual reality game.  So you'll be wearing a headset.  You'll be able to look around in this.  It's very violent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and that OK, by the way, that's one of the issues we're having right now,  which is that these helmets, I don't even know this.  And again, thanks to Jeff Grubb and Ben Langford telling me  the helmets don't know that you're tilting your head.  They only know really one axis.  They only know the current VR only knows that you're rotating. Right.  So you kind of want to design games where you can't really like it's not based  on input like you're tilting your head.  So that's why there's a lot of games like cockpit games like Eve Online,  where you're you know, all you're really doing is looking out a window.  And a game like that, which like bullet time or whatever it's called,  bullet train, where you would imagine  that what you'd really want to do is have a full perspective.  You don't. And it may be a disappointing game for that reason.  You're almost on rails. You can only look like that.

Start time: 3241.70
End time: 3253.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a really short term problem.  I mean, five years. Yeah.  And then also, I think they're going to put sensors on the front  so they can track your hands for you without having to hold on to little sticks.  Right. So, you know, sure.  But that's such a non problem in five years. Yeah.

Start time: 3259.70
End time: 3293.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, not really.  And I I'm kind of a bit more utopic about it because I like I said,  I believe that, you know, the brain takes in only a finite amount of reality.  And so I kind of love the idea that they could step into a Star Wars  or something, because my son's at a point now where he's like,  is this real or is it not?  And I just want him to continue to believe in magical thinking.  So if he can actually step into something and have this experience,  maybe that's just like one less way that he can be desensitized  and, you know, not think that the world is magic.

Start time: 3293.46
End time: 3305.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's very possible that in five years,  like maybe even the next Star Wars movie after this one will be in a 3D  immersive environment.  That technology is not hard to do. It's not hard to shoot.  I mean, you could buy a $250, $350 camera. Right.

But compared to what we're talking about,  it actually is relatively pedestrian and low tech. Right.  So everything's pedestrian and low tech in the early days.

They actually bought the factory in Germany where they make the blades.  So they design them for performance, for precision, and they ship direct to you.  So you get a great price, about half the price of those four dollar  Gillette Fusion blades in the in the grocery store, the ones that are locked up  because they're so expensive.  Harry's guarantees your satisfaction in every kit.  You get a razor with a handle. It feels great.  Doesn't that smell good? You get three razor blades.  You're using the foaming shave gel there, which I think is a lot.  And that's fifteen dollars for all of that.

Transcript:  Well, they've never as far as I know, sold phones in the US, right?  You could get them, but you had to go to a Chinese site to get them.  Alibaba or whatever else. Yeah, Alibaba. Yeah.  I'm excited because we're just talking about this.  Battery life is really, I think, the weak the weak point  when it on Android phones.  The last Android phone I had that would last a day was the OnePlus one.  I haven't had one since that was a 1080p screen.  That's one of the reasons.  But this is going to have a three thousand four hundred  fifty milliamp battery in the five point seven.  That's as big as I've ever seen in a phone.  So if it doesn't have good battery life, there's no hope.  It will come with marshmallow.  Every phone should come with a marshmallow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, I like that. And the Google Pixel  and the OnePlus to uses it.  And it has some real advantages.  It will see how Google implements it on the OnePlus to.  It's just a USB port, the USB 2.0 port. Right.  With a type C plug.  But the way Apple and the Pixel implemented, it's it's a bidirectional.  So you can charge a phone from your laptop as well as charge your laptop.  And it's got fast data. It's got Thunderbolt speed data.  There's a lot of things on the USB type C.  If it's USB 3.1, that'll be very interesting.  I hope Google implements that. That would be nice.  It's going to be a big phone, but five point seven inches,  not six like the old Google Nexus six.  At least again, all rumors.  But at this point, the rumors are pretty. Yeah.  I mean, we're seeing slide decks. Right.

Transcript:  I'm a big I love Android. I really think Android is amazing.  I'll give you an example of the difference in Apple and Android. Apple  made a program that they put on the Google Play store called Move to iOS.  And Google goes, yeah, fine.  They put it on the store. They didn't block it.  Move to iOS.  There's no way that Google could do the same to Apple because Apple's no.  No, Apple store rules specifically forbid mentioning other operating systems.  You know, it'd be fun for them to do that.  You know, they enforce that, too.

It's a beautiful walled garden.  There's lots of flowers, benches, shrubs, but it's a it's walled.  Oh, look at that. Boy, there's a lot of one star reviews.  Do not install and yet unless you want a lobotomy.  Oh, you know why?  These are Android fanboys giving it to Apple.  Seriously? That's why it's not a bad program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do think, though, a fingerprint.  You know what the one the  what phone is it that puts a fingerprint reader on the on off switch  or the Sony Xperia, the new Xperia?

It would search paid entries in the Amazon store before it would find things  that were free on Amazon Prime because they just hadn't finished  programming other things into it. That's really frustrating.  That was irritating.

I discovered fresh books when I was going to Canada every month,  billing Rogers in Canadian dollars.  I was doing it in Microsoft Word.  And then I had to send them expenses.

Transcript:  Never had that problem again because I started using it.  Actually, it was Jambor McArthur told me about it.  They're from Toronto and I started using it and it's so easy.  You create a good looking professional invoice.  You'll email it.  They do have the ability to mail them US mail to or stamp it and all that stuff.  But I was just email it.  The nice thing about the email invoice is there's a pay me button on it.  Makes it very easy for your clients to pay.  Turns out, who knew clients don't look forward to paying bills  any more than you look forward to sending bills.  It's a pain for everybody.  So making it easy means you're going to get paid faster.  In fact, on average, fresh books customers get paid five days faster.  You'll also be much easier for keeping track of your expenses.  You can actually use their app on the phone, take pictures of expenses,  get them right into the invoice.  Time and hours.  Do you bill for hours?  They do that too, right in the app.  Easy to track it, easy to invoice it.  Once you do this, you will say, why didn't I listen to Leo and Patrick before this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so I started just on my own personal site, nataliemorris.com,  a project that I'm calling Chief Home Officer.  Because after I left CNET and went freelance, I sort of became obsessed with investing and  running our home kind of like a business.  I figured if I don't have a regular paycheck, I'm just going to run my house  and do the best I can with the investments I have now.  And I really love it, actually.  I just have studied personal finance for the last couple of years.  And noticed that there's a need for other people to really learn how to understand what's  going on with their finances.  So many of us just sort of have the passwords and pay the bills and don't understand what's  going on in our investments.  So I want to help empower other people to have at least one person in their household  who's the Chief Home Officer who is, you know, not afraid of this or really wants to learn  and just has a good open attitude about finances because when you understand it,  you're in control.

This is the first time I'm actually doing something just for myself because I want to.  Good.  So I'm really learning how to market myself and be the brand myself.

Transcript:  I think it's just a sealed case.  Because if you look at the ifixit teardown, it looks like a slightly tighter match between  it can be effectively waterproof if the design is sealed well enough.  But what happens, though, is there's basically a giant joint  where the case and the screen meet all the way around it.  And if you flex your phone over time, which is a problem with the iPhone 6,  it'll leak at the screen joint, which is what happened to mine.  Eventually, this is going to leak.

Erin Sorkin, of course, the author of the social network, the Zuckerberg movie,  and he's just finished a movie which is coming out soon called Jobs.  You remember that Tim Cook said a while ago, he thought that  all of these movies about jobs were opportunistic.  He said, I hate seeing that.  He hadn't seen the movie yet.

I think they try really hard and I think they probably could do more.  I think they probably will as manufacturing goes.  I think it's getting better.  I think we can agree on that.

And then there's people who upgrade their computers every six months because a new  widget came out.  I mean, I don't know.  It's a big, messy, complicated subject, as Natalie was saying.

We've missed that date, but YouTube intends to bundle two different services into one  offering according to Recode.  They're going to update the music service, YouTube Music Key.

John K. Pogba It was about 30 minutes after somebody just said,  a lot of you were in there realizing that your exit strategy is to be bought by Google  or another large company.  And all these literally, if you counted duck, duck, goose, every goose sank down into their seat  because like, oh my God, they know what my business plan is for my obscure startup that  has a subset of a product feature.  And then it was amazing to watch the greed on a lot of the other faces when they realized  we really should be going for 14 year olds because 14 year olds piss away money a lot  better than 40 year olds do.

Google, who of course puts most of the ads on websites.  John K. Pogba On the internet.  John K. Pogba They, yeah, with their Google AdSense platform,  John K. Pogba they offer a thing where you can pay up to $10 a month, which I pay,  John K. Pogba not to see Google ads.  John K.

Transcript:  John K. Pogba There is a tech war, though, going between advertisers and these ad blockers.  I think that they've started to figure out how to put pre-roll ads on video.  So I don't think it's going to work against YouTube for very much longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John K. Pogba It's going to be the same battle we've had forever.  They're going to do something and then we're going to block it.  But I mean, there was a big controversy in tech this last week about an app called,  I think it's Peace. That was one of the first iOS 9  tools to remove ads from your mobile device. And the guy shot the top of the app store,  made a lot of money, and then he actually took it off the app store. And I believe  Apple's actually refunding all the money because he didn't feel, again, to your point,  ethically okay with that. And it was an interesting moment of like, what's fair?  And how can you disassemble someone else's work and still be inside the realm of good taste?  John K. Pogba You're talking about, of course,

Transcript:  Marco Armit, who was one of the guys, the first programmer at Tumblr. He wrote  Instapaper, which a lot of you have used, sold that. He's written Overcast, which is an excellent  podcast app. And he did make Peace. It was number one. He could have made a lot of money.  Apple does not have a history of refunding people's money, but apparently they thought  this was a big enough deal that they did. That's what began this whole ad block ellipse  conversation was Apple announcing that iOS 9 was going to allow ad blockers. You still  have to download it. And they were going to allow ad blockers. But what maybe is more important to  point out is they only block ads in Safari, mobile Safari. There's plenty of ads in every app,  including Apple's own I ads. So it's not like you, you don't have ads, you just have Apple's ads.

Start time: 6173.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Michael S. Luttrell Well, what I've noticed is that mobile ads are consistently worse than  desktop ads because they're more invasive and intrusive and just make the experience of using  your phone pretty, pretty bad. So Apple probably thought from a you, uh, I think they're representing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  users. Yeah. Which is somebody, I think it was probably Renee Richie who told me that you got  to understand the Safari team is the Safari team. They want to give people the best Safari  experience possible. There are other people at Apple and other companies that sell ads. So it's,  it's not like it's a monolith. And, uh, I think it's reasonable to say, Hey, we want to give people  the best possible experience on Safari. Um, and I think that's what Apple did, but I don't think

Transcript:  other. Yeah, sure. So that's what YouTube's considering $10 a month, no ads in your videos.  This is the text that according to Rico now, I'm some people in chat were saying, I didn't get that  for years. YouTube fans have been telling us, this is what the email they sent out. They want more  more choice when watching their favorite content, more ways to support their favorite creators and  above all the option to watch their favorite videos uninterrupted. So to give fans more choice,  we're going to be launching a new ads free version of YouTube. This is a big shift for YouTube  available to fans for a monthly fee. This service will create a new source of revenue over time that  supplements your advertising revenue. Frankly, if everybody did this, you would be making a lot  more money. I think, I mean, I don't think most people get much money from YouTube at all.

And Jack, of course,  started Patreon. And I asked him, well, why'd you start Patreon? He said, because we had 15 million  views on YouTube and made a few bucks. Yeah. And it doesn't, you can't live off of that. He, he, he,

Start time: 6286.86
End time: 6316.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  he spent like six or $7,000 building like a spaceship in a barn for a video shoot, got millions  of views, got a check for $300, realized he was $6,700 in the hole, asked his audience who thought  it was amazing. Like, like what he basically said, I want to keep doing videos, but I don't  have this money. And they helped pay off, you know, the, the money he had spent creating it.  And that was the, that is the origin story of Patreon, which obviously I'm, I'm a huge fan of  Patreon because they, you know, they're the primary way we support tech thing. Our audience

Start time: 6317.02

They weren't, he's doing great with Patreon  and he's saying he's done a great thing for the internet community and for creators like you.  Tech thing is on Patreon. Yes. So go support them. Thank you. I think we may be moving at least,  and with this YouTube thing into the world where people kind of accept the idea or contributor  that we want content. We don't want these ads. We might have to give, you know, fork over a little  money. If people did this in great numbers on YouTube, 10 bucks a month, it would be, I think,  a lot more revenue for YouTube creators. I would bet. Depends how much YouTube keeps.

And if you haven't signed by October 22nd,  your videos will no longer be available. That outcome would be a loss for YouTube,  a loss for the thriving presence you've built on the platform and above all, a loss for your fans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, better do it. Yeah. I mean, this is, this is not the first time YouTube sent out  very strongly word emails and, and YouTube, YouTube knows for a fact that the vast majority  of YouTube's major video channels cannot migrate that audience anywhere else. YouTube's audience  tends to stay put. And that is a problem for creatives because that means they have to stay  put. It's been a problem. It's been a battle between the creators trying to figure out ways  to have revenue commensurate with the size of their audiences, which are not necessarily  represented by the ad sales that come through YouTube's ad sales team. So they go through  outside ad sales team. They go to, you know, aggregators and, and, and, you know, third party  content groups who sell ads into them. And the big one was, you know, you know, product placement  in ads and, you know, Google kind of did the nuclear option a few months ago, where they said,  you can't do a, you know, you can't do a full screen for a product unless, you know, it comes  through, unless you have an agreement with us or it comes through our ad department and we get our  50% cut period. YouTube is desperate for a revenue stream and they are going to get it some, you

Start time: 6467.72
End time: 6489.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  know, one way or another. But I mean, when YouTube was purchased by Google for what was it? $1.65  billion back in the day, they were scaling so fast, they were losing more money consistently  because their audience was exploding. Right. So they kind of had to find Google as a safe harbor.  But that doesn't mean Google immediately turned it into a very profitable property. I don't think  they break out its KPIs or other metrics in their earnings. So I don't know. I don't, I don't think.

Start time: 6489.72
End time: 6498.70

But  I think the idea is, is they're looking at the success of Patreon or they're just looking for  like, hey, you know, we need all oars in the water. Let's see how many people we can convince.  And your children, by the time they're 14 or 15, their children may dream of the day they have,  you know, a job, you know, or a part-time job so they can pop that 10 bucks a month or probably  $24 a month by then, you know, so they can have their YouTube experience without ads.

Apparently, people like to take selfies in stupid situations. I became aware of  this last week when a tourist at the Taj Mahal started taking pictures of himself, 60-year-old  tourist, his selfie, fell down the stairs, killed himself. Turns out, shark attacks have been far  less dangerous to travelers in 2015 than selfies. He merely is doomed. There have been eight  confirmed shark-related deaths this year. There have been, wait a minute, I think we just got  number 16, selfie deaths. People stand in front of trains. They reach out over bridges. They do  so many stupid things. It's gotten so bad that in the European Union, they've proposed the  criminalization of selfies on landmarks. Oh my. Look at this. I can't believe this is true,  but this is from Condé Nast Traveler. It must be from the Russian Ministry of Interior,  from a Russian safe selfie campaign leaflet. Things not to do when you're taking a selfie.  Don't get on the train line. Don't try to do it in an outboard motorboat on the back of the boat.  Do not do it with wild animals. Do not do it while holding a gun. Do not do it while trying to

Volkswagen has just created more trouble for diesel  manufacturers in the United States than anything has. What we were trying to do is get you to buy  some diesel. Well, what's frustrating, right? Cause it turns out it's clean. Well, okay. So first of  all, it looks like there are rumors that there are, or there are early, there are early thoughts that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that is legal. One of there's a, there's a, there's a magazine, there's a magazine I subscribed  to that is for Cummins diesel's owners. And one of the regular contributors of that magazine worked  for the EPA in the seventies. And he has an interesting perspective. He said, look, our  mission in the seventies was accomplished about a decade ago in terms of air cleanliness, in terms  of reducing pollution, in terms of cleaning a lot of stuff up. Like, you know, most of the, a lot of  people watching the show aren't old enough to have seen videos of the Cairo river on fire, but you  know, when a river's on fire, you know, things are not right. Right. So, you know, or the guys, I got  stuck down in Baja once with a bunch of guys that were really upset about the EPA and they should be  able to roll coal and burn smoke and have whatever modifications they want to the vehicle. I'm like,  dude, you grew up in LA. I've lived in parts of New Jersey where locals did not drink the water  because of the paint plant and the benzene processing plant. Right. But I never could see  the air and in LA, you can still see the air on the bad days. You know what I mean? That, you know,

Start time: 7140.86
End time: 7145.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  nearly as bad as it was in the seventies. Exactly. And you know why? Because of emissions. So, you

Start time: 7146.00
End time: 7229.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  know, if you like the fact that you're getting like 300 horsepower of a two liter engine,  thank the EPA because the EPA laws mandated a whole bunch of stuff that forced engine  manufacturers or automotive, you know, automotive manufacturers to get better at what they do.  All of that aside, Volkswagen basically, yeah, they, they, they put in an algorithm and looked  for a combination of settings that indicated the vehicle was being tested for smog and then put on  all of the smog correction. This is very critical for Volkswagen because Volkswagen said they could  meet smog emissions with their 2.0 liter engine, with the TDI diesel. A clean, so-called clean diesel.  Yeah. Without having additional, it's pretty freaking clean even at 40 times the emissions.  Yeah. I mean, yeah. It's better than your Cummins. Yeah. But I also burn biodiesel in my Cousins,  so my Cummins and my biodiesel is made- You can see your Cummins in your Cummins. No, no.  Careful. There is no smoke coming from my Cummins. Really? I find- Is that belching black smoke?  No. People who belch black smoke from their diesels are people who like to burn money. I am  not a person that burns money. That is burning money and wasting power and it may make you think  your masculine organisms are larger and more functional. So you can tune a diesel in some way  so it doesn't puff smoke. Yes. You just have to have enough oxygen coming into the engine to burn  the amount of fuel you have. I see. I see. I see. I see. Like most of the stuff where people are  rolling coal, it's for effect, you know? Right. Right. But the thing with- So it's called rolling

Start time: 7229.14
End time: 7234.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  coal. That's what people call it. Are you from the South or something? No. It's from New Jersey.

Start time: 7234.36
End time: 7238.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very similar. The trucks, right? The trucks from the- Yeah. With the bike. Yeah. That's called

Start time: 7238.70
End time: 7334.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  rolling coal because it looks like a big old- It's from LBI. It looks like a steam train. I think  it's West Virginia coal mining. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. But the- No. I mean, you know, so I'm amped up  about this because what Volkswagen did is they just tuned- They just gave the EPA an excuse to be  really, really, really aggro about emissions with all the manufacturers. The EPA has basically said  they're going to start spot checking automobiles. So there are going to be federal examinations of  automobiles around the United States. Is this going to be like they're going to pull me over and  they're going to do exhaust tests on me? Wow. Or is this going to be like we are going to go to  dealerships and randomly inspect untested autos? I do not need to be stopped by the EPA. Traffic  is complicated enough in the Bay Area as it is. It is going to- The BBA has a witch hunt, you know,  and to a certain degree the California Resource Board already has a witch hunt on diesel because  they believe that the particulate matter from diesel offsets any of the other diesel benefits  and particulate matter can be tied to cancer, not unlike, you know, breathing in gasoline fumes and  everything else. But so there's a lot of things stacked against diesel in the United States to  begin with. And now Volkswagen has a- Volkswagen's also screwed itself because a vast number of  people who bought TDI vehicles were like, I want something more exciting than a Prius. I want  something that's more interesting. I want something that's more fun to drive. That was probably why  they did this, right? To make more responsive, better fuel mileage. Yeah. So it turns- what it  turns out is that Volkswagen was not meeting the emissions or, you know, we don't know- nobody's  done any thorough testing on this. So they, you know, we don't know- Partly because of the DMCA  preventing anybody from- Yeah. That's a whole nother- That's a whole nother- That's a two hour  conversation. Yeah. That's the entire- it's like a four hour triangulation. Well, for a year they

Start time: 7334.76
End time: 7339.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  denied they were doing anything. They finally said, yeah, we were doing it. You know, so what happens

Start time: 7339.40
End time: 7377.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is, you know, and the thing that also has been really pissed off is GM knowingly enacts, you know,  basically refused to acknowledge a problem with the ignition switches. It's tied to the  deaths of 120 people, writes a $900 million check and walks on a year when they made like $3 billion.  The upside, the high side of the potential fines based on the- what is it, like $34,000 per vehicle  is $18 billion for Volkswagen. Is Volkswagen going to pay $18 billion for, you know, for a  half million car violations? No. What's going to happen is they're either going to retrofit them,  which if they're lucky they can do in software, which may not be possible, or they're going to  have to do a URIA system to- Here's the problem. It's not just in the U.S. they've been doing it

Start time: 7377.28
End time: 7382.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  all over the world. There are 11 million cars. It's not- The cost could be as much as $41 billion.

Start time: 7384.18
End time: 7401.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's like- Just to retrofit. I'm not talking a fine. Well, and that's just- but that's just,  we don't know what they can retrofit. They don't know what they can retrofit. Are they going to  have to retrofit a URIA system to make it comply? Nobody knows, but it's a mess. And it's going to-  the EPA is going to be looking at a lot of stuff right now as a result of this. It is a mess. They

Start time: 7401.16
End time: 7414.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  had nearly 200 billion euros in revenue in 2013, and they sold about 10 million cars a year,  according to this data. So, I mean, even if they got the full fine, it wouldn't kill them. But,  I mean, I can't imagine anyone writing a check at that scale. It's already cost them their CEO.

Start time: 7415.84
End time: 7454.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apologize and quit. Yeah, the CEO has been basically- has fallen on his sword.  We don't know. They cannot sell diesel cars in the United States. They've stopped selling diesel  cars in the United States until they have a fix for this. And I have to imagine other diesel cars  from other manufacturers are in trouble as well. That's just- the problem is, is most of the other  manufacturers were using like, you know, blue tech or whatever URIA-based technology or- yeah.  There's lots of ways to eliminate the emissions that are the issue. Volkswagen said they were  doing it without the addition of like a URIA subsystem or something like that, or what it's  actually referred to as cat squeezings or cat piss. So they- it wasn't a question of them turning

Start time: 7454.18
End time: 7457.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  off emissions and rolling coal. They didn't even have the capability to do a cleaner.

Start time: 7458.46
End time: 7479.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they basically- no, they were- basically, it turned everything on for emissions when it thought  it was being smog tested. And if it wasn't being smog tested, it sort of, you know, leaned back.  But they could have used a cleaner engine. They didn't. Well, yeah, but they felt, you know,  yeah, they could have used it. And the other thing is nobody- what I don't know is, is, you know,  why they did that. Do they gain 10% horsepower? Do they gain 5% horsepower? Do they gain 30%

Start time: 7480.54
End time: 7484.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  horsepower? It's a really curious question. What was then that gain for the damage they caused

Start time: 7485.54
End time: 7496.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  overall? Well, they sold 11 million diesel cars that they might not have sold at all  because people have such a bad impression of diesel. Well, they would have sold. Well, the thing is-  Trucks is one thing. You're going to sell diesel trucks. Diesel- I mean, basically,

Start time: 7496.40
End time: 7527.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ultimobil killed diesel in the U.S. I mean, diesel was much cheaper in Europe and, you know,  vastly cheaper compared to gasoline in Europe. And that's part of the reason why diesel is so  popular in Europe. And then when the fuel crisis hit in the 70s, Ultimobil retrofitted a bunch of,  you know, basically what it amounted to. They retrofitted a gasoline engine design  to work as a diesel and it was a horrible mess. It was a nightmare. And that single car did more  damage to diesel automobiles than anything else in the United States. I don't know. Anyhow,
