In studio with me right now, the acting director of the United States Digital Service.  Actually, you're an administrator, not a director. I don't know if that's a difference.

Start time: 143.24
End time: 146.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm no longer acting. I'm very excited.  Oh, you're not acting anymore?  I took the acting right off.

Start time: 148.22
End time: 159.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You mean you're no longer pretending to administer?  I'm a real boy.  That cuts. Yeah, that's great.  Well, let's fix your lower third and take that acting.  We can edit that off right here, right now.

Start time: 159.44
End time: 161.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's probably from the last time I was here I was acting.

Start time: 161.56
End time: 166.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, what is it? Do they knight you? What do they do when they remove the acting?

Start time: 167.20
End time: 180.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's actually no longer a political appointee position. I am a career.  Oh, I like that.  So, the administrator position is just a career position because you want to get the best technical person you can get as quickly as possible.  And so, it's a good match.

Start time: 180.28
End time: 190.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's fantastic. USDS.gov.  If you're interested in what they do, read all about it.  And if you are, what are you looking for? Coders, people with technical skills.

Start time: 190.88
End time: 201.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Designers, engineers, product managers. We even need a technical recruiter or two.  Oh, interesting.  And we even have one technical recruiter position in San Francisco, so you wouldn't have to move to DC.

Start time: 202.42
End time: 216.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just put that out there.  USDS.gov slash join.  And what you'll be doing is helping government agencies modernize.  Well, very famously, you took the VA website and made it usable, which was huge.

Start time: 216.62
End time: 218.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Healthcare.gov, lots of great sites.

Start time: 218.64
End time: 233.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that how it started?  With healthcare.gov was launched, it had been done by a kind of a hodgepodge bunch of third party contractors.  And it was a mess.  And people in Silicon Valley said, can we help?  Can we just make this better?  Is that kind of how it started?

Start time: 233.84
End time: 245.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's exactly how it started.  And a lot of people decided to stay behind.  Did you? Is that when you first got involved?  So, I was not there for the first healthcare.gov.  I started in 2016, so a couple of years later.

Start time: 246.70

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, just to fill people in who aren't familiar, Matt was one of the early Google employees and a long time Googler.  You probably know who he is if you're a webmaster because his webmaster videos are still classics to this day.  Search engine optimization.  You don't need to go into that.  Took a sabbatical, which ended up being a departure and now work for the USDS.  Thank you for being here.  It's great to have you.  And of course, a regular visitor to our This Week in Google show along with the return of Gina Trapani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Trapani's back.  I asked Gina before the show, how do I pronounce your name?  Because for years, for whatever five, six years you did This Week in Google, I called you Trapani.  And I think it was the last episode you said, oh, by the way, Leo, it's Trapani.

Start time: 299.38
End time: 304.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In Italy, it's Trapani.  No, I would have told you a lot sooner.  It was like years we did Twig together.

Start time: 306.18
End time: 322.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, however you pronounce it, I say it's great.  Gina, of course, one of the founders of Lifehacker.  For many years, a host on one of our shows.  We miss her dearly.  She from time to time comes back here and on Elle About Android.  And I hope we get you back on Twig unless you're avoiding Jeff Jarvis.  I don't know.

Start time: 323.66
End time: 333.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, not at all.  It's because it's during the business day and I just my day is just like meetings.  So it's been hard for me to get back on Twig, but it is so great to be here.  And I miss you all.  I love doing the show.

End time: 371.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  We're a digital product studio when we build apps and websites and kind of big.  We try to shoot for the kind of those big transactional digital platform products that  power lots of different products.  So we're here in New York City.  We've worked with clients like Vice and like Bloomberg.  We just recently rebuilt Audubon Society's Birdwatching app for both Android and iOS.  You can get those in the app stores now.  It's been a lot of fun.  Really, really.

Start time: 375.04
End time: 417.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, I up until about March of last year, I was an engineer on the team and allocated to projects.  In fact, I helped build out the Players Tribune, which is one of our one of our clients,  Derek Jeter and Kobe Bryant's sports site.  But I got to a point where, you know, my partners were saying to me, you know, like you really,  we really could use you in the room with clients and with prospects and can you help us scope out new projects?  So I'm not pushing code on a daily basis anymore, which has been a weird transition.  But I really just I get to spend a lot of my time talking to people about their problems and what they want to build and why they want to build it.  And sometimes they work with us and sometimes they go with someone else or they take it internally.  But I really enjoy just being at that at that level, solving at that altitude.

Start time: 417.68
End time: 429.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're thrilled that you could be here.  Also joining us, another guy who's been with our network for so long, Dwight Silverman of the Houston Chronicle.  He actually took a hiatus for tech for a couple of years, but you're back.

Start time: 429.56
End time: 456.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For a little bit. Yep. But I'm back.  I'm doing my primary job is managing the websites for our business department.  And I also still manage the Tech Burger with which is our technology site.  And that story there, I bought a new car and when I shop for cars, I like to review the tech.  And so that's what I did with this particular one.  That car is awesome. The Toyota CHR.

Start time: 457.52
End time: 459.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that a crossover? What is it? Yes.

Start time: 459.88
End time: 478.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not very well known in Europe. It's really popular.  It's only been here for two years. You look at it, you go, that's a Toyota.  Yeah. And it's really it's like actually sexy.  And the idea that I would drive a car like that is just kind of like blows my mind because I had a Corolla before.

Start time: 479.66
End time: 484.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Always a Toyota man.  Which is the opposite of sexy.  Did you ever consider electric?

Start time: 486.04
End time: 490.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I looked at it. I live, I bought a condo here in Houston.

Start time: 492.10
End time: 496.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a problem, right? Because if you don't have a charger in the parking garage, you're out of life.

Start time: 496.76
End time: 559.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. There's no way to charge it.  And so I looked at it and and when I started out shopping, I was looking at cars that were, you know,  inexpensive, but fairly technically, you know, loaded.  And I looked at the Honda inside. I looked at the Prius.  I looked at the new Jetta, which is a very nice car and very very has a full glass cockpit at the higher end trims.  And I spotted this in the when I was looking at another Corolla and and said, oh, I need to drive that.  And I drove it twice and fell in love with it and bought it.  And and what's interesting, the most fascinating thing about it to me is that it has Apple CarPlay.  And there's a picture of it there in the story.  But usually when you have CarPlay, there's also Android Auto and there's no Android Auto on the Toyo.  That's interesting.  They're going to introduce it next year.  But I'm dying to figure out why they even how.  Right. Right.  How did you not do that? Yeah.  So, huh.

Start time: 559.46
End time: 580.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, Dwight, I have to ask, does Toyota still use Bing as the search engine in the car?  You know, I'm asking for a friend.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  Not there's anything wrong with that.  I just want to know, like what search engine your car uses is kind of a thing for me.  Does your car have a search engine?  Toyota used to have Bing. I don't know if they still do.  How would you search?

Start time: 582.18
End time: 606.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You search it.  It uses like when you want to search for gas stations or what you want to search for.  But it doesn't do that, I don't think now.  I haven't really played with the apps in Intune 3.0, which is their software, to the extent  that I can tell where it's coming from.  And I think most people use what's on their phone.  And I assure you that Bing is not on my phone.

Start time: 608.88
End time: 610.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, now I can get a Toyota.

Start time: 610.88
End time: 614.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where'd that duck duck go?  I'm just asking for a friend.

Start time: 614.88
End time: 636.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Matt, I have an ask for you.  Since you're doing this now, my 89-year-old mother, who has in the past couple of months  has had great reason to dig into the Social Security Administration services.  Can you please do something to make the Social Security Administration's website friendly  to people who are 90?

Start time: 637.72
End time: 654.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh my goodness, that is such a great question.  So I will just say, the CIO at the Social Security Administration, his name is Rajiv,  he came over from the IRS, has been doing a lot of stuff to try to improve the quality  of the experience there.  And I would love to have enough folks where we could go over and help out over at Social  Security.

Start time: 654.76
End time: 656.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do they have to approach the USDS and say we'd like some help?

Start time: 657.56
End time: 673.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a little bit of a give and take because we have to decide how to allocate scarce resources  amongst areas where you can have the most impact.  If you look at SSA, they've got a ton of annuitants and beneficiaries, all federal employees,  retirement, so it's a very high impact administration.

Start time: 677.04
End time: 696.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's also highly used by people who are much older and technologically challenged.  If there was a way to take it so someone who was not necessarily technologically astute  could go in there and figure it out quickly and without a lot of handholding, that would  be a great benefit.  That's harder than it sounds by the way.  It is hard.

Start time: 697.68
End time: 700.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is the number one challenge.  It is hard.  It is hard.  It is hard.

Start time: 701.68
End time: 712.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I'm actually on a, it's called a technology modernization board with Rajiv and so I see  him about once a week or so.  So we'll have some stuff to talk about.  Look at that.

Start time: 713.50
End time: 716.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Talk about instantaneous results.  Dwight Silverman will.  I know.

Start time: 717.58
End time: 720.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Matt on the, I got fired under Matt in the first five minutes.

Start time: 720.48
End time: 723.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Request filed.  As soon as we're done here, I'll call mom.

Start time: 724.78
End time: 760.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Say I talked to somebody in the government, mother, on your behalf.  So I have a question for Matt.  There may be another shutdown on the way.  Have you gone around to all the federal government sites and said, renew your certificates ahead  of time?  Okay.  So.  So there were something like 18 federal sites whose certificates expired during the last  shutdown, which meant they were insecure.  In some cases they were smart enough to say, no, you may not, no, shout not pass.  In others you would be asked to enter the site and enter insecurely enter important  information.  This was a big problem.  Yeah.  As if it was unanticipated.

Start time: 760.86
End time: 767.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and the crazy thing is that now you can set it up to auto renew and you can use  things like let's encrypt.  So this doesn't have to happen.

Start time: 767.94
End time: 769.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do the feds use less encrypt?

Start time: 770.02
End time: 772.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is possible to set those sorts of things up.

Start time: 772.20
End time: 777.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would have thought you'd have to have a, you know, a purchase or, you know, a special  GPO and all that stuff.

Start time: 777.62
End time: 797.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's always harder in government.  And like when I was at the Pentagon, let's encrypt didn't do dot mil.  And so, you know, you got to work out some of that.  But but it is, you know, the government is catching up.  It's taking time, but the government is catching up.  So it is possible to set things up such that, you know, you know, just because you're not  with hands on the keyboard, the certificate can automatically renew.  That's right.

Start time: 798.70
End time: 801.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what do you think if there's another shutdown, are you going to see a repeat or?

Start time: 802.68
End time: 810.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We will see a repeat.  Yes, because people, they had three weeks, you know, to try to get.  A lot of time takes a little longer to get ready.

Start time: 810.12
End time: 834.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Other stuff to do, I imagine, in the interim.  Well, it's good to see.  This is nice. We've got we've got some real experts on the panel today.  I almost feel like I should go pick some special stories, not just the usual run of  the mill stuff. So let me let me think here.  You I wanted to ask, can you talk about Google these days, Matt, or do you have to  recuse yourself?

Start time: 834.64
End time: 846.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have sold all of my Google shares as part of joining the government.  So I can, you know, I'm as a government official, you can't endorse any specific,  you know, product or company.  So I've got to be a little careful that way.

Start time: 846.96
End time: 883.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But so talk about Google last this week, Google announced actually Alphabet  announced its fourth quarter and fiscal year results.  And I'm glad to have your expertise here, because the things that people always want  to look at is not how much money Google made, what its revenue was, what its  operating income was, but the cost per click.  And this is how Google ultimately makes most of its money is, you know, the cost  per click. And it's been dropping dramatically.  In fact, it did drop year over year, 29 percent.  Is that is that something Google worries about?

Start time: 884.60
End time: 895.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's there's a lot of people at Google who pay attention to that, for sure.  But it's not just clicks on Google properties.  It's also clicks on the partners that Google pays.  So that's kind of interesting.

Start time: 896.04
End time: 902.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The thing that's the cost per impression on Google network members, properties,  non-Google properties has actually been going up.  Yeah. So that's good news. Right.

Start time: 903.42
End time: 924.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's there's a lot of different ways you could interpret things.  So, for example, in the earnings, one thing that I thought was interesting  is it looked like their capital expenditures were way up.  So a lot of people might be like, oh, if you're spending more money  on your hardware, is that a bad thing?  But sometimes that can be a leading indicator because people are saying, oh,  we have a lot more stuff to do with our data center.  So we need to build or buy more machines. Right.

Start time: 925.72
End time: 929.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is Google building new network operations centers at this time?

Start time: 929.76
End time: 932.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you know? They are always building out more infrastructure.

Start time: 932.58
End time: 957.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the infrastructure for Google, Facebook,  Microsoft, Apple, Amazon in particular, just kind of just mind boggling.  I read a story today that Amazon owns more square footage.  What was it was some huge number of square footage, mostly for fulfillment.  In fact, AWS is only about 10 percent of that.  So if I can find that story, I don't think it was in our rundown  because it just broke this morning.

Start time: 957.26
End time: 973.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and there was a story in the rundown about Kashmir Hill, who tried  my god, tried to remove the tech giants from her daily life.  And so many things were powered by AWS or various other technology companies  that she she couldn't transfer a large file.  Amazing story. Podcast. Yeah.

Start time: 973.90
End time: 1030.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So actually, that's a good one to talk about.  Kashmir is great. She's ready for Gizmodo now.  She said she wanted to try.  She'd been slowly going on a diet, slowly eliminating the big five  from her daily life.  But when she finally cut out all of them, she says it was hell.  She got she got a tame hacker to, I guess, install a blocker or whatever.  She bought a purism laptop, which is a Linux freedom first laptop,  a Nokia feature phone because you can't buy iOS or Android.  The big five for her were Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Apple.  She'd cut them out one at a time.  But in week six, she blocked them all.  So she had a network tool that would even go to the point  like she tried to use Dropbox, but Dropbox uses AWS.  So the network tool blocked Dropbox. Yeah, that's Amazon.  Not an Amazon company, but they use AWS.

Start time: 1032.18
End time: 1035.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, and the Nokia phone is my favorite.  Isn't that a beautiful that's a lovely.

Start time: 1036.36
End time: 1059.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and that was one of the problems is she had to text using  do you remember, folks,  do you want to type cat?  You have to type one, one, one  pause one, six, six, six, six.  And then you'd get cat.  And then they had T9, which was a prediction service, which was terrible.  She didn't enjoy that.

Start time: 1060.86
End time: 1072.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm impressed that she attempted this.  Absolute performance are I'm just so it's I can't imagine.  It must have been absolute hell.  I mean, everything we touch every day goes to those big companies.

Start time: 1072.90
End time: 1103.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And in ways you don't realize, I mean, that's what I think  the real import of this article is she couldn't listen to music in her car  because she had a Ford SYNC system with a Microsoft car.  Had to turn that off. Yeah.  We are so dependent and it's just five companies.  That's the thing that's really scary.  I don't mind being dependent on 100 technology companies.  But when it boils down and actually, you probably could just say  you could probably take a couple of these out of there.  Like to say Google, Amazon.  And Facebook, and it would still be almost impossible to use the Internet. Right.

Start time: 1104.30
End time: 1130.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Particularly Amazon because of Amazon Web Services and Google,  because trying to live without Google. Right. Right.  I think I think it would have been interesting.  You know, she wanted to go from top to bottom on, you know, what she didn't use.  So she didn't want to use Amazon Web Services.  But what if you simply avoided their consumer facing products?  And, you know, if you had to go through pipes that they owned, fine.  I wonder what kind of exercise that. That'd be a lot easier.

Start time: 1131.02
End time: 1158.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She was being very pure. Right.  Well, I'll give you an example.  I use their sponsor, a product called Helm, which is a home email server.  It's a really clever idea, solves a lot of the problems.  But guess what? It runs everything through Amazon S3.  So I would have to stop.  She ended up using ProtonMail.  I think she's safe there because its servers are in a mountain in Switzerland.  So. But yeah, I mean, you would, Gina,  you probably wouldn't have a job if you couldn't use those five.

Start time: 1160.04
End time: 1179.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, we deploy everything for all of our customers,  all of our clients, AWS or Google Cloud.  Yeah, I mean, I'm sure even even the other services like Heroku and Linno  and all, they're they're they're also using like managed hosts  also use in the background those services.  It would be a very, very difficult.

Start time: 1179.72
End time: 1190.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So is it Richard Stallman level crazy to say, let's just get rid of all this stuff?  Or should we all be really concerned because we're so dependent on it now?  Obviously, it's not easy to get rid of it.

It does sound like by the end, she got to a more deliberate space  where she said she didn't know what time it was because she doesn't use her phone  all the time now and like more deliberate and using the technology as a tool  instead of being, you know, in in wound by it, you know, cocooned by it is.

There are people in rural areas who use a lot less of it and live day to day  just fine and they use they they don't necessarily rely on it as much.  But if you're all in on the 21st century and the way the 21st century works,  as she showed, it's pretty much close to impossible.  I think you could spend a lot of time worrying about it.

Transcript:  This is this brings us to Huawei.  And man, I am still on the fence on this.  So Huawei, the Chinese company that manufactures, it's the number two or three,  depending on the month, smartphone manufacturer in the world, Samsung  and then Huawei and Apple trade places.  It's the number one by far 5G equipment manufacturer in the world.  And the United States has basically said you may not use Huawei gear.  It told it started by telling the Defense Department.  But late but the latest story is  that the White House plans to issue an executive order right  in front of Mobile World Congress.  This is from Politico that will ban  Chinese telecom equipment entirely.  Now, fortunately, there is somewhere you can go.  There's Ericsson and Nokia.  They are they are making 5G gear.  But and the president of Huawei actually wasn't the president.  It was it was the US president, I guess, of Huawei was very upset.  He says we've denied this again and again.  There is no evidence of the Chinese government interfering with our business  or using our equipment to spy on anybody.  This is a political decision.  And this is where I'm on the fence, because I think it is a political decision.  And yet there's some merit.  There's some potential that if the Chinese government went to Huawei,  whether Huawei is, you know, working for the government or not now,  if at some point the Chinese government said to Huawei,  incidentally, we'd like to have access to all your switches everywhere in the world.  They really couldn't say no.  So there is there is a threat.  There's no I don't think there's any evidence that.  Well, there is a little bit.  There's a Huawei executive was arrested for spying in Poland.  Huawei fired him immediately.  Huawei CFO is in jail in Canada, about to be extradited for the United States,  to the United States for fraud.  What do you guys think?  Go ahead, Gina, we'll let you start.

Transcript:  This is a tough one. Yeah, it's to a certain extent, I think.  It's not necessarily new.  I know that in the Obama administration, oh, yeah, I think  the people as far back as James Clapper were warning about Chinese hardware.  And and but as far back as the Obama era, they were not offering details.  They you know, it was national security and that, you know,  that was a curtain over any kind of detail they would offer. And and  you know, I think that  if you're skeptical and if you don't take things at face value,  you can look at this and say, yeah, it's political.  But if you're also technical, you also know it's possible.  Yeah, that's why it's difficult, isn't it? Right.  And then and that's what makes it difficult.  I you know what I think in terms of maybe political,  and it may also be economic, because if you want to give  U.S. allies who make  this gear in the 5G run up to give them an advantage over Huawei,  you certainly could use your political muscle to block that  and allow Ericsson and and the others.  Also, Samsung also makes 5G gear  and allow them essentially to get a head start  in the United States and in Western countries.  So it may also be economic.

Transcript:  Complicated. And yet you hear this, but there are many Chinese companies.  Right. And much of our equipment, my iPhone's made in China.  So is this is Huawei being made an example?  This is an editorial from a couple of weeks ago in The Wall Street Journal.  The US can destroy Huawei.  It's a risky but powerful way to show Beijing stealing no longer works.  This is an opinion piece we should point out.  But he says the really the big part, the big thing, big point of the Huawei story  is it's based on stealing ideas from the West, including a Cisco router.  In fact, an early Huawei router design  was shown to have been stolen from Cisco right down to the typos  in the instruction manual.  They attempted to steal Tappy, the robot from T-Mobile.  Well, how dare you?  It's a robot for testing phones and taps on them.  So maybe this is a I don't know.  I I feel like if you if you're going to say, well, we can't use Chinese equipment  because the Chinese company might be at some point beholden to the Chinese  government, that's going to really become a problem.  That's something you can't do.

And there has not been anybody who's been able to,  you know, come behind to duplicate that story.  Everybody involved has denied it.  Bloomberg has not issued a retraction or a correction on it.  It's a very strange story.  But it's that's I think that and I use the word paranoid.  I think there's a level of paranoia there,  whether it is justified or not, who knows.

Transcript:  The problem is these routers, which are really there are hardware  and software combinations. They have a lot of software.  The software is updated all the time.  So even if you if this actually is an interesting point.  In the old days, when routers and switches were hardware only,  that's exactly what happened. Right.  You'd go through it.  You'd make sure it did what it said it would do and nothing else.  Freeze it. You'd freeze it and then be done with. Yeah.  But so much software is involved these days and that software is updated  so frequently, it's I think impossible to do an audit.

Start time: 1784.74
End time: 1815.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and you'll see a lot more stuff like Google has started to talk about  how much it's doing software to find networking.  So you can. Exactly.  So, you know, if you take that towards logical extreme,  then the hardware is sort of a thin substrate and the real power  is in the software.  And then the software can always be changed.  It's always malleable.  And so it's who holds the keys, who can update that software,  who can sign and cryptographically vouch for that software.  And if, you know, a particular provider wanted to change the functionality,  it's it's not clear how well people would even notice.

I think I have I think that some paranoia is healthy and I think we have to be aware.  But also at some sometimes I just have to be like, OK, we're going to move forward.  I'm going to trust that there are people looking through this code and checking it.  And that and but I also have to expect that huge bugs and vulnerabilities  are going to show up, whether that's through other governments or just,  you know, bugs in the software.  And how do we respond to that?  And you hope that things get better, that the checkpoints get better. Right.  But you're just kind of crossing your fingers and hoping.

Instagram, if you're going to get rid of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp,  that might be a start.  But then I often feel like, well, but then it doesn't matter  because I'm carrying in my pocket a surveillance device with a microphone  camera GPS that's always broadcasting back to bad actors  like my cell phone company will gladly sell it to the highest bidder. So.  Right. It feels pretty hopeless.  You'd have to throw out a lot of tech.  You'd have to become the Unabomber and just kind of live in a cabin in the woods.  You don't have to send bombs.

You might as well control that story. Right. Like we've had, I mean, you can,  you know, make sure your passwords are good and unique across your sites.  There's lots of things that you can do. Right.  But there's also a lot of things that you can't prevent.

And I think there are things that you could do and in your behaviors  that that you can that you can take that can protect your privacy.  But I also think you have a whole generation who's growing up,  who's growing up in this where they just assume that everything is is out there.

I mean, I think it's just it's I want to just be to know  and to understand the possible implications of what she's doing,  the difference between permanence and and what it means when she puts  a picture of her friend or of other people to like.  I don't share a whole lot of photos of her online,  certainly not publicly, just because I want her to make that choice.  But but yeah, just kind of instilling those best practices.  But again, like she's going to have a phone that she's going to be,  you know, all of her location and all of her data is going to be out there as well.

I give people my phone number, my address, everything.  But I am now starting to get a queasy feeling.  The other day we were in L.A.  We rode a jump bike, which is Uber's new electric bike rental.  Really cool. Except that even as I'm using the phone to sign in  and connecting it to my account, I'm thinking the back of my head,  well, now Uber knows everywhere I'm going on this bike.  And maybe I'm showing up on the God.  Remember, they had that God app that would let you know wherever you were.  God view. God view.  And I'm just getting it's a low grade, queasy feeling whenever I use this stuff.  And I don't know if that's a good thing.  Maybe we'll just learn to tune it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

But I'm still getting that queasy feeling because there's this psychological thing of,  well, but people are can spy on me or follow me around or know where I am or.  I just I worry that this is this is not good for our mental state in the long run.  It sure wouldn't be good to be a paranoid in this day.  You have lots of evidence.

Transcript:  So what's interesting is, you know, you asked to you talked about,  you know, your your old daughter, Gina, and, you know, eventually she'll have a phone.  When my kids were that age and I was reviewing computers for the Houston Chronicle,  I would I kept all the computers in one room and I let the kids use the review  machines because it was interesting and instructional watching them use it.  But our computers were all in one room.  I could see what they were doing all the time.  They didn't have computers up in their rooms.  And that was really useful because I could say, oh, well, let me see what you're doing.  Let me let's talk about that.  You can't do that anymore with a smart.  No, no, they had their you cannot.  You cannot limit it at all. Yeah.  And so that's a real challenge for parents.

Start time: 2276.18
End time: 2319.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, definitely.  I mean, I also I'm setting this expectation with my daughter, too, that  that knowing this information is kind of normal.  Like I so I commute home from Manhattan to Brooklyn on the train or the bus.  And so when I leave the office, I send I use city mapper.  I send a city mapper link to my partner who then brings up a map,  a live map where she and my daughter can see how close I am to home  and what time I'm going to get there.  So literally, as I'm walking up to my door, my daughter, it's great.  She runs down the hallway to give me a hug because she knows she can see the little  the little green guy and city where I am.  So, I mean, to her, she's six years old, like the idea that she can see exactly  where I am on my commute, that's completely and totally normal.  And it would be terrible if they couldn't track my location  because they know what time I'd be home for dinner, you know.

Start time: 2320.46
End time: 2331.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's by the way, why you're going to give her a phone the minute you can.  Yeah, because then if she can see where she is.  But not only that, if she needs help, she can call if she's stranded, she can call.

Start time: 2331.90

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

We write our phone number on on her arm  when we go to like really crowded places like the county fair or whatever and say,  OK, if you if you get lost, you go find somebody with a phone  and have them call, she's going to have her own phone for that reason.  So it's going to be really interesting.  I think she's going to have very different ideas and expectations and worries.  I just don't think she's going to be that paranoid about sharing that information.

Transcript:  But it is. It's interesting that Apple's decided to make privacy  like a competitive advantage and to talk about that.  And I think that sets the trend where more so in the future,  people will be making these judgments about the companies that they choose to,  you know, do business with based on, you know,  maybe they won't read the full end user license agreement, but they will say,  hmm, I'm not sure that I trust this company as much as that company.  And it's still possible to take one out of the big five and cut one out.  Like if you choose, you're going to deactivate your Facebook account  or something like that, you can still do that at this point. Yeah.  And it's not too late, in other words. Right.  And if people have to compete, if people get to compete on privacy,  I think that will help quite a bit. Yeah.

I don't know. But Google, Google decided, well, we, we're going to collect data.  So let's be transparent about it.  And I do believe that they're very transparent about what data they collect. Right.  You can go to the dashboard. They're not hiding anything.  And I think it's their hope that, well, if we don't hide it,  people will feel more comfortable sharing it. I don't know if that's true though.

It's interesting that Apple is positioning itself as the company that respects your privacy.  And I mean, I've definitely heard debates about, you know, paying for that.  Like you pay for a premium for Apple hardware and you're also paying for privacy. Right.  So Facebook's free. And part of part of what you pay Facebook is, is, is with your data.  And I think people feel that way about Google as well.  Although it is interesting that I think that some of Apple's products suffer  because it doesn't collect and use data as well as Google does. Like Apple Maps is terrible. Right.  Do you think that Apple Maps would be better if it was the same kind of approach as, as, as Google? Maybe.

Hey, I want to welcome a brand new advertiser to the show.  Smart Deploy. If you're an IT, you know all about this notion of, hey, I got a hundred machines to set up.  I'm going to create a golden image and blast it to all the machines.  But there's problems. Those machines all have to be identical. Right.  Smart Deploy allows IT departments to reimage unlimited computer models from one golden image.  It's a one click user data migration for simplified migrations, zero touch network deployment, imaging over the internet,  application deployment to make your product projects stress free.  But the cool thing is these platform packs and they include 1200 different platforms, Lenovo, HP, Dell, all the major OEMs,  inject drivers into the image so that it will work on that machine.  You make one image when you need to support a new model, you download the pack, you deploy your golden image and boom, you're set up.  And as I mentioned, it's not just for entire operating systems.  You could have all the line of business apps that you use and have it in an image that's just deployed over the internet, deployed over the network.  And I mean it when I say deployed over the internet. You can use Dropbox or a cloud service and deploy it there.  Smart Deploy is the most reliable, easy to use solution. Over 2.2 million endpoints now.  This is awesome. It's the only solution, the first solution to offer imaging over Wi-Fi,  which means you can manage remote users and satellite offices even if you're not on the same network.  You could deploy images, apps, updated drivers. Yeah, you could update drivers too via Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive,  OneDrive for business. It's very easy to use. You don't have to be an IT guru to use it.  They've got step-by-step wizards that will guide you through the process and  complicated steps like Sysprep are handled for you automatically. No ramp up, no training necessary.  You can migrate a hundred computers to Windows 10 in under an hour because it's got multicast.  Isn't this great? Seattle-based support team  made up of imaging and Windows experts. They're just an email or phone call away.  Widely used. Nissan uses it. UCLA, Nintendo.  Smart Deploy  make that dreaded task of computer imaging a little less painful.  By the way, they're giving away 15 free licenses including a year of support.  At smartdeploy.com slash twit. This is a great way to try it out. That's $720 worth of free IT software.  And if you work at a company with 50 to 50,000 computers and go to smartdeploy.com slash twit,  you'll get those 15 free licenses with one year of support and be able to try it out. And I think you're gonna love it.  German regulators just outlawed Facebook's whole ad business.  This comes from the German Federal Cartel Office on Thursday.  The company's antitrust regulator. This is an antitrust thing.  Rule that Facebook was exploiting consumers by making them agree  to data collection in order to have an account.  Facebook has one month to appeal and one month they will have to stop.  Facebook, this is a quote from Andreas Munt, the president of the SCO.  Facebook will no longer be allowed to force its users to agree to the practically unrestricted collection and assigning of  non-Facebook data to their Facebook user accounts. This comes I think as Facebook's considering apparently  merging WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook user data across all three.  Which means billions of people.  It's not clear  what Facebook wants to do about this. We disagree,  they write in a blog post with their conclusions and intend to appeal and I think this is the this is the line  that has the threat so that people in Germany continue to benefit fully from all our services.  It would be a shame  if you were no longer able to use Facebook in Germany.  This is an interesting approach and to see when we have these conversations as we did in the last segment  about privacy, there's always it always comes up. Well, maybe we should just regulate it.  But honestly, this is how Facebook  works. Facebook has 32 million monthly active users in Germany. That's 80% market share.  The regulator says that makes them trust and that gives us the jurisdiction to oversee their data  collection practices. As a dominant company, Facebook is subject to special obligations under competition law.  Should this happen in the US?  Nobody wants to weigh in on this one.  Matt's mic is cut. I think we said before that

Transcript:  when because I think it was on one of the episodes where we were talking about what was happening with  GDPR and that essentially the irony is that it will be Europe that has more impact  on the way American companies behave in America than the US government will.  And I think you're starting to see that.  I think that obviously if Facebook makes changes like this, has to make changes like this in Germany,  it has to look at doing it across its entire platform.

Transcript:  In the past, data and privacy really weren't part of that  consideration, trust consideration, but  essentially  the German regulator is saying look,  you're so dominant in Germany that people are almost required to use you and you're using your dominant position to invade their privacy  in ways we don't think is okay.  This is the first instance where regulators are saying that because a company has such market power,  consent is not freely given. That's the point.  And you know, similar arguments I'm sure will appear against Google as well.  74% of American Facebook users surveyed by Pew last month  did not know that Facebook maintained profiles about their interests.  This is what you were talking about, Gina.  51% said once they were shown what Facebook was collecting, I'm not comfortable with that.  So people don't know about it. In the US, and the regulator is saying even less so in Germany, and they don't have a choice.  And when they say non-Facebook data, they mean data in other Facebook apps like Instagram and WhatsApp,

Start time: 2938.92
End time: 2957.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  but they're also talking about like you go to a website that has the Facebook  bug installed and you're like, oh, I'm going to use this.  You go to a website that has the Facebook bug installed on it, but you don't know that,  but Facebook knows that you visited that site.  I think that is something that like a normal consumer is unaware of.

Transcript:  This was what Congress, remember Congress asked Mark Zuckerberg about,  what do they call these ghost dossiers, the shadow accounts,  as you're followed around the internet.  And Zuckerberg said, we don't do that.  Hoping nobody would follow up.  Well, what are you talking about? Of course they do.  We know they do that.  In fact, if you download your Facebook data, I would imagine you'll see some of that.

Start time: 2987.36
End time: 3007.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and it's interesting that there wasn't as much ability to do follow up in that hearing  because you need more technological expertise in Congress.  And they were only given five minutes.  Right.  You know?  But being able to ask good questions and have people who understand how computers work,  you know, is part of the process, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a long and sad story about the, what was it called?  We had this great group of people that were advisors, technology advisors to Congress.  Right, that got shut down.  That got shut down some years ago.  Yeah, 94.  Yeah.  Although I imagine Congressional staffers are sophisticated these days, fairly sophisticated.  Yeah, of course.  They're smart.  Absolutely.  So the staffers probably knew, but the whole thing was set up in that case not to have  follow up questions.  Yeah.

Transcript:  He's going to turn bright red.  I can't wait till Wednesday.  It's an interesting problem.  In fact, there was a great article in Medium by Ben Longstaff.  What happens when Google says, we're not going to pay the fines?  A 50 million euro fine against Google and GDPR a couple of weeks ago, the French competition  agency imposed a fine on Google saying they were not transparent.  Similar problem, right?  They weren't transparent in gathering information.  They didn't give people a clear enough opt outs on privacy.  So Ben says, OK, well, Google could easily pay that.  But what if that fine were actually the full GDPR fine, which is 4% of global revenue?  That would be $4.4 billion for Google.  At what point does Google say, oh, no, we're not going to pay you.  And what would France do?  Would France then imagine if the French government says, well, all right, Google can't operate

Start time: 3184.06
End time: 3223.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and at first glance, this seems completely unrealistic.  But there was at least Google News in, I think it was Spain.  They did this in Spain.  Where they were like, we can't operate in the country anymore because of the law you  just passed.  And so we're done.  And the impact that it had on a lot of small news websites, it tended to push the traffic  back toward the established publishers.  And so it's interesting to see how you could write a short story about what would happen  if you got something in the end user license agreement that said, by the way, if you don't  pay your licenses, then the company will take over your judiciary or something like that.

Start time: 3223.92
End time: 3303.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this brings us right back, though, full circle to the conversation at the beginning  of the show.  I mean, we're really dependent on these companies.  If they said, no, no Google Maps for you, that would be problematic, to say the least.  My car has Google Maps, right?  I wouldn't know how to drive.  I forgot how to do that.  Well, I don't think that Google would even consider that.  Because I think they understand they're citizens of the world.  They don't want the black mark and so forth.  But you're right.  I guess the question was, OK, they're not 50 million euros.  Big deal.  That's a pocket change.  But what if it were?  What if they did eventually say, we want four and a half billion dollars?  What would Google do?  Wow.  Here's an example of corporate blackmail, actually.  And I'm not talking the Examiner here.  The National Enquirer.  By the way, the choir.  National Enquirer.  I did not want, and I'm going to just say this right now, in case you tuned in to find  out what our esteemed panel thinks about Jeff Bezos and the National Enquirer, I decided  this is not a tech story.  This is a gossip story.  This is a politics story.  But I don't think there's a tech angle.  So I've just decided not to put that on a rundown.

Transcript:  I think that's even still.  That's the tech question.  That's the tech question.  Yeah.  I'll let you talk about that in Tech Burger.  Save that for Tech Burger.  However, Amazon is not above blackmail of its own.  Read this one.  This is in the Washington Post.  The story was leaked to the Washington Post.  Facing opposition, Amazon reconsiders New York headquarters site, two officials say.  OK, I'm going to bet those two officials are Amazon officials who perhaps might have just  called the Washington Post and said, you know what?  If they don't wise up there in New York City, we could just pull out.

Transcript:  They have no idea.  This is a Brooklyn hug.  What are you talking about?  What are you talking about?  So the issue is that a lot of there has been some criticism from advocacy groups and elected  officials because Amazon will, no matter where it goes, get big tax breaks.  But it will also bring twenty five thousand jobs to the new campus, which is on Long Island,  right? It's Queens, right?

End time: 3440.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And but, you know, maybe some people in Long Island City aren't too happy about  just the big Amazon moving in.  Remember what happened to housing prices in Seattle?  You know, there's that issue of tax breaks.  I think, you know, the governor and the mayor think it's a good thing because they're going  to generate jobs so they'll get the money back.  Nevertheless, Amazon.  And again, maybe they're not really considering pulling out.  But remember, they did a big hunt.  They went, you know, big deal.  They went to a lot of cities and what would you give us if we relocated the idea that  a band? OK, fine.  You don't want us. See you.  That's blackmail.

Start time: 3442.20
End time: 3454.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Livestreamed video.  It's very much like QVC.  It features live stream video shows from Amazon, highlighting current deals at Amazon.com.  Also, brands can broadcast their own live streams.  Amazon bought Twitch. I wonder if this is the Twitch back end.  There's a new app called Amazon Live Creator.  This is the future of home shopping, right?

Transcript:  What's interesting is how in one on many platforms, Amazon approaches traditional retailing.  So if you think of QVC as being traditional cable retailing, here they are.  They're going into brick and mortar stores.  There they are.  As they get bigger, they kind of move away from the Internet and go more into traditional  retailing, which people are used to seeing.  In this case, they've added the twist of being able to do your own.  And I assume some of those some of those hosts act like almost like VJs where they will,  if they find something they like, they'll pull it up and promote it.  That's what you want to do.  You want to get featured.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by, anyway, great to have all three of you.  We love it when you come back on the show and it's like old home week.  It really feels good.  Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks.  If you're a freelancer, you know that making invoices is the worst part of the job.  Unless that's your business.  Like we're in the invoice business.  But most of us, like for me, when I was going up to Canada to do the TV show at Rogers,  at the end of the month I'd have to put all my expenses together, send them an expense  report and invoice them for the amount of money plus my time.  I would just put it off, which turns out that when you don't invoice, you don't get paid.  It got to one point I was six months behind.  I finally gave them the invoice for six months.  They said, never do that again or you will not get paid.  That's what Amber MacArthur told me about FreshBooks, a brand new startup in Toronto.  And now here we are, what, 15 years later, FreshBooks is just the king of the hill.  The all-in-one accounting solution helping small business owners thrive.  Yeah, I said the bad word, accounting.  But honestly, it is.  It's full industry standard accounting, but you don't have to be an accountant.  All you have to do is use FreshBooks to create your invoices, keep track of your expenses  and bingo right there on the FreshBooks page.  You'll immediately know because you're keeping track of expenses and income.  You'll know whether you're making a profit.  You can easily generate accounting reports like general ledger and balance sheet in the  dashboard when tax time comes.  You give your accountant all the stuff they want.  And of course you'll send professional looking invoices in seconds.  You can always see which invoices have been sent, which have been paid, which are overdue  and even which have been viewed.  So no more, I didn't get your invoice.  They got it.  They saw it.  What's nice is it turns out your clients are not slow to pay because they don't want to  pay you.  Most of the time they're slow to pay you for the same reason you're slow to invoice.  It's just a pain to get together all the bills at the end of the month and pay them.  It's so easy with FreshBooks because just because as a FreshBooks customer you get automatic  online payments.  So they could just press a button on your invoices, go ahead, pay Leo.  That means you get paid on average twice as fast.  They're always adding new features too.  It's a web application so you're always getting new things like the proposals with rich text  content and images.  You can now get e-signatures from your client that are legally binding.  It's easy to update expenses.  Of course the FreshBooks app takes pictures of the receipts and puts them right in the  invoice but you can even have FreshBooks log into your bank daily and download all your  expenses.  FreshBooks works with everything you use already, Acuity, Scheduling, Pysync, MailChimp and  more.  Keep tabs in your business anytime, anywhere with the FreshBooks mobile app.  You are going to love FreshBooks and a great support team right out of Canada so they're  nice 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. eastern in a video hub where you can learn how to use it and get  more information 24-7.  Avoid the tax time scramble next year.  It's too late for this year but now is the time to get started with FreshBooks.  Get started with FreshBooks for effortless invoicing and just kind of in the process  of life itself all the accounting you need.  Try it free for 30 days at freshbooks.com slash twit.  And if you do me a favor put this week in tech in that form that says how did you hear  about us?  We'd appreciate it.  Freshbooks.com slash twit.  I've known these guys for years and I think the world of them.  Freshbooks.com slash twit.  So yeah it was a bit of a shock to the podcasting community when it was announced this week  that Spotify was going to buy two big podcasting entities.  One Gimlet which is a producer podcast for a whopping $230 million.  Gimlet had raised about $40 million or maybe even a little less in the venture markets.  So this is a big payback for their investors and for the Gimlet founders and also a tool  maybe less known but one I've used and I really like called Anchor which is basically a podcast  platform.  It's like WordPress for podcasts.  It makes it very easy to use your smartphone to make really good sounding podcasts.  I've made quite a few using it.  I think it's a great way to do that.  It's interesting.  In fact Ben Thompson has a very good article on Stratechry about the strategy behind this  and I think I completely agree with him.  The problem that Spotify faced is the same problem Netflix faced a few years ago in the  movie industry said well you guys are too successful.  We're not going to let you have first run movies.  Netflix response was well fine we'll make our own and it's gone very well for them.  Spotify has a similar problem.  Their profits are totally dependent on the music industry.  At any point the music industry could put them out of business by charging more on royalties.  So they need their own content as well and what better content audio content than podcasts.  So it makes sense.  We're on Spotify.  In fact when Spotify announced that they were going to do podcasts we were up there on stage  with Daniel Ek and one of the first.  But their discovery platform is not super strong.  It's hard to figure out what's on there.  I think there's a lot more they can do.  Ben's article actually opened my eyes to one thing that I didn't realize which is that  Spotify is a big advertising company.  In fact they have more advertising revenue than the entire podcast industry put together.  So there is definitely an opportunity here for they drove six hundred sixteen million  dollars in advertising revenue last year.  So there's definitely an opportunity for Spotify to maybe become an advertising platform for  podcasters looking to monetize.  That would kind of make sense.  A couple of big questions though.  A does Spotify want exclusivity because I would think they would because their revenue  streams are twofold.  One is of course advertising but the other more important revenue stream for Spotify  is subscribers and exclusives drive subscriptions.  They don't get exclusives on music but they certainly do have exclusives now.  In fact on some gimlet podcasts if you want to listen to crime town you can't listen to  it on the open web.  You can't listen to it on your Amazon Echo.  You have to listen to it on Spotify.  So I'm a little concerned about that as a podcaster.  I hate to see podcasts become you know hide behind paywalls.  What do you think?  What does this mean?  It's certainly a sea change and maybe this is too inside baseball because after all as a  podcast that's we care about this probably more than the average world.  What do you think Matt?

Transcript:  I enjoy Reply All.  It's a great podcast.  That's a gimlet podcast.  It's a very well done tech podcast.  So I've visited gimlet.  Like on one hand it's interesting that there are they a technology company or are they  a media company.  And you know with the big companies like the Facebook's and the Google's of the world they  always claim to be technology companies.  So it's interesting to say where did gimlet fit in that space?  Gimlet's a media company.

Start time: 4400.06
End time: 4437.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's pretty pretty sure.  It's like buying HBO or something like that.  You're buying and I think this is what Spotify was interested in a company that could create  new podcasts.  I would say exclusive although Spotify denies this for the Spotify platform.  And then and then with anchor they can attract other podcasters.  They could say you know hey you know we'll help sell advertising with our engine and  we'll give you access to 200 million users.  I think other podcasts and use our tool anchor to do it.  Other podcasts they might be able to generate quite a bit of content that way.

Transcript:  What do you think about the fact that like Spotify is doing this now a few years after  podcasts.  I mean serial and all that sort of stuff.  It's interesting Apple has done their play.  You know various other tech companies have done their play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we haven't seen the end of it.  Daniel Ek himself says we've got a half a billion dollars we want to spend on acquisitions.  So there may be more acquisitions.  Pandora which has been struggling just as Spotify has with the record industry is also  trying to figure out what to do.  They've gone into podcasting big.  I don't think Apple needs to because they have another revenue stream I hear.  But Apple's you know if Apple had decided to do this way back when they could have.  I think Apple wisely said we don't want to become a sole source for podcasts.  We like to support podcasts with iTunes and they do.  But we don't want to be a gatekeeper.  Spotify I don't think minds.  In fact Spotify has changed their terms of service at the same time as they announced  this to explicitly ban ad blockers.  You'll actually be kicked off the Spotify service if you try to block block ads.  Now that's for free users.  Remember there's no ads for paid users at least for now.  But that's kind of interesting.

Start time: 4507.72

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're looking at the Netflix and Hulu model of original content being big drivers  of subscribers and being this thing that you sign up for.  Right. So you hear like oh this I don't know names a good Netflix original show.  I don't know Orange is the New Black.  That's I guess that's that's old.  But but people are talking about it.  They're like all right I want to sign up for Spotify to hear that podcast.  I don't know. I don't know if I really like him.  Let's shows. I don't know if they're they have the power to do that.  I certainly hope that Spotify doesn't make all their shows exclusive.  I'm really interested in just podcasting as a medium getting better.  I feel like it's been kind of stagnant.  Like there's still no good ways to get like transcripts or stats or like real numbers  about it doesn't feel like the way that podcasts are distributed and the way that  people can consume them have gotten better beyond the occasional like good client or  or you know or service.  I don't know. I'd be interested to hear from you Leo.  Like you've been at this for years and years and years like and you have built out this  whole infrastructure at Twitter to do live streaming you know video and distribute the  audio across all the different mediums.  Like what what would you like to see to make just podcasting in general as a medium not  specific to a particular company or or product like be better.  What could be better about it.

Start time: 4586.88

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like the idea.  Anchor is really cool.  So I think that making it easy for people to make podcasts and maybe even make some  money on podcasts because of Spotify's advertising engine.  I have no problem with that.  I think that's great.  But I've seen we've seen before in the past others try to kind of take over podcasting  by creating a giant podcast network.  Remember Mevio and they had very restrictive contracts that made it very hard for podcasters  to go elsewhere.  I don't like the idea of podcasters getting locked in to any platform because I think  really the strength of podcasting is very much like the strength of the Internet like  blogging which is that it's democratizing that it's easy to make when it's almost as  easy to make a podcast as it is a blog.  There's this issue of discovery but you know I don't want to see Spotify become the next  YouTube.  And at this point if you create video content you've got to be on YouTube.  Google owns it.  Basically that's where you go.  Others have tried.  Facebook's tried and Facebook Watch isn't a big success.  I think a lot of people listening probably even know that exists.  So Vimeo is profitable but it's not really a competitor to YouTube.  YouTube owns that space.  I'd hate to see Spotify become the place to get audio content because I do think podcasting  is great. It's very vital in the sense that it's it's it's very active and growing and  it's exciting.  You hear new things.  The other thing that worries me a little bit.  Gimlet has a very distinct style.  Gimlet like a number of other startups was created by NPR refugees and has a very NPR  sound to it which we don't by the way we don't do.  We don't don't do our shows like that.  Our shows more sound like radio talk shows because I'm a radio background.  They are all storytelling.  They always begin with a little music.  Alex was walking down the street when something unusual happened.  There's a style.  There's a distinctive style which people love.  I'm not saying that they love it but I would hate to see podcasts all sound the same.  So you know so I think it's a bad I think a monoculture is bad for anything.

Start time: 4714.94
End time: 4737.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it sounds like they're trying to thread the needle where Spotify wants to be beloved.  They want to take the Netflix model and like get a whole bunch of new voices and cherish  those voices and make them more popular and more easy.  But if you can avoid the well I guess down the road they have to worry if they're so  successful that you become the only place where that's the risk that they could become

Start time: 4737.52
End time: 4753.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  like YouTube.  The reason people go to YouTube because it's free.  Right.  I put my stuff there.  They'll sell ads.  I might even make some money.  Some people make a lot of money.  That's exactly my opinion.  What Spotify is going to position itself as is the YouTube of podcasting.  And that has I think that's a bad thing if they become too too powerful.

Start time: 4754.86
End time: 4787.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Spotify has has two offers.  They have a free version and they have the paid version.  So let's take crime town for example which which as I understand it eventually after  it's had its run will they'll kind of set it free on the open podcast market.  But it will you have if you want to listen to the podcast crime town as a podcast when  it is released and you're a free user.  Will you hear ads whereas if you are a paid subscriber will you not hear ads.  Is that how it'll work.

Start time: 4787.34
End time: 4803.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well it's not clear but that would be my guess.  That's how they do music right now.  If you listen to Spotify's music without paying for it you get ads right.  In fact a lot of them six hundred sixteen million dollars last year.  That's a lot of that's a lot of money.  So here's what they estimate the podcast industry made.

Start time: 4803.94
End time: 4815.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if you like say reply all and but you hate listening to ads are you willing to  pay Spotify Spotify account in order to listen to it without it.

Transcript:  So how do you how do you transition.  It's interesting a lot of people love Patreon and I think they only take a 5 percent cut  or some small cut.  And so that's by the way is really jumpstarted podcasting.  Yeah a lot of podcasters.  Right. So how do you know where along the spectrum of the cut.  Do you become the bad guy.  You become what you think of as YouTube or whatever.

Start time: 4837.46
End time: 4872.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't even know what YouTube takes.  They won't say and nobody's saying but I think it's a fairly.  It's more than 5 percent.  One five percent.  They're not a Patreon model.  Yeah I would say it's more than half probably.  That's a very interesting question.  I don't you know I think in the long run anything that does that helps podcasters  create podcasts monetize it and distribute it and be discovered is good.  And in that case this is a good thing.  I'd hate for it to become a monoculture.  That would be a bad thing.  And if every podcast started to sound like a gimlet podcast I'd be very unhappy.

Start time: 4874.86
End time: 4906.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's totally fair.  I think for people new to podcasts like a gimlet style might be a good sort of entry  point. But I don't know.  But I totally agree with you Leo.  I mean this is ironic because we just talked about how we wanted to live without these  big companies. But I've always wished and hoped that Google would take on.  Making podcasts better more discoverable easier to search like like I just I feel like  there's so much fertile ground there to make podcasts just more mainstream even you  know than they and they've become much more mainstream but even more so.

Start time: 4907.62

Transcript:  Google do something.  I mean the problem with podcasts is their audio.  And so you don't have a text to index to spider.  Could Google do that.

Start time: 4917.04
End time: 4925.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely they could do that.  Like there's something in the rundown about transcribe which doesn't just transcribe  but tries to do punctuation and capitalization.

Start time: 4925.70
End time: 4935.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a really cool product from Google.  Yeah.  Let's you do real time transcription.  If you don't if you're deaf or perhaps you don't speak a language you could put the  phone down and it would tell you what's.

Start time: 4936.02
End time: 4970.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's awesome.  And apparently you can get I got a New Jersey in New Jersey and get the capitalization  right. Like I have been waiting for the point where I can train you know just dictate my  emails instead of typing them for a long time.  We're pretty close.  And so if they can do that and if they could get the discovery part.  And by the way maybe the podcast model where you're like I have to listen to every  single episode of you know pick your favorite podcast.  Maybe that's broken.  Maybe it's just show me the one podcast that's super relevant to me because Jean is on  it you know or something.  That episode is the one that I want and I don't have to listen to every single one.  So this is a web versus albums.

Start time: 4970.76

Transcript:  Yeah. This is a website called inverse or I.  Yeah inverse where they used Google's transcription against a rap song by Twista.  Let's see how let's see how well it does.  It's doing so much better than I am.  It's.  Twist is fast.  He's got the flow.  I want to be honest with you.  I don't know if it's accurate.  But it's fast.  It's keeping up with him and it looks pretty credible.  I mean it saw Jimmy Choo which I would not have known.  That's what he was saying.  He says I'm going to get you Jimmy Choo and I'll get the bags.  It got it right.  That's pretty impressive.

Transcript:  I post late we have a podcast called track changes and we pay a production company who's great.  To do all of our transcripts.  But yeah it's it's an investment.  It's a bigger investment than an individual could make.  But to make all of our transcripts searchable and add in all the links and the show notes and all that stuff like that's a lot of work.  You know that Leo.

Start time: 5045.56
End time: 5051.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

End time: 5064.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's so close.  It's so close to where it could transcribe well.  Discovery could work well.  You could bookmark specific audio.  You could be like just show me the relevant part of this two hour episode.  I mean that would be really interesting.

Start time: 5064.42
End time: 5077.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah it also is excellent for reporting if you're a reporter and you're out in the field and you are making a recording as well as using this.  It would it would cut down the time it would take to do your transcription dramatically.

Start time: 5077.98
End time: 5132.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is probably the single biggest problem.  I think most people start podcasts right now aren't trying to make a living.  Maybe you don't even expect to make any money but they would like listeners and discovery is impossible.  I mean if you're not a big name or on a big name network or you can't get it.  Honestly the number one most important thing for any podcast to do is to convince Apple to feature you on either new or noteworthy or on the weekly thing.  That is huge.  That could put a podcast on the map.  But how do you do that if you're just some guy from Brooklyn.  I don't know why I'm picking on Brooklyn but if you're just some guy from Brooklyn I don't know how you do that.  And that's the biggest problem.  So right now the big issue if you're starting a podcast is how will I get anybody to listen to me.  I mean it's the same problem with bloggers or anything else.  If you're a YouTuber you have that same problem.  There's no magic there either.  But I think search would help.  I don't know what do we do.  How do we solve this Matt.

Transcript:  Could I make it just a little more dystopian.  Yes.  OK.  So what is a podcast.  It is you know maybe it's produced but it's a segment of audio.  I could imagine a world in which people can could be convinced to just take their phone and have it be always recording what they're saying and have it be completely personalized for your search.  So I was on a phone call on the drive up here and I could just be like you know what.  Show me you know the meeting that I was in and go to the highlight and you could be like oh yes.  It turns out this person did steal this person's idea or oh there were microaggressions or I did interrupt this person.  And you could score based on how much you know how much of a good actor you are like there's a whole world in which Google or whoever had that technology could be like you're being a jerk.

Transcript:  And so I'm looking at anchor FM which is the other company we don't know how much Spotify paid for them but this is easily the simplest way to make a podcast.  They have apps for iOS and Android.  You record on your phone you can easily put music behind it.  You can incorporate calls.  I've been doing that.  I have a little podcast because I wanted to play with it called Leo on the line at Lottle fun L O T L F U N dot F U N.  And and it's very easy to make these podcasts and I've done all on my phone and you can incorporate other people's questions into your shows which I've been doing which is a lot of fun.  And I just I have a podcast now we're going to really need this but I can see people going crazy about this.  What if you added this feature to an Amazon Echo or a Google home.  You know record my show.  Right.  You could easily do that.  So there is a that's why I worry Spotify acquisition could take the air out of the out of this kind of innovation.  You don't want one company to be so dominant.  So that's why I think it's great.  I'm glad Spotify put the money into this.  And now let's and yeah I don't want to play when Apple came out with podcasting and iTunes.  I think I blogged this is both the worst thing that could happen to podcasting and the best thing.  And that's always the risk when these big players come in.  Apple's turned out to be a pretty good steward of podcasting although they weigh the wheeled huge influence.  Google could do the same thing.  In fact I was very disappointed.  Google has a podcast tool.  They put a lot of energy into it.  I'd like to see them put more energy into it.  Somebody says it's micro aggregations micro aggregators.  I like the idea.  Let's take a little break.  Come back with more.  Gina Turpani.  Trapani.  She's a here from a post let that calm.  So nice to have you Mr.  Dwight Silverman who.  Now tell me remind me because you were on with us January 2010 when Steve Jobs announced the iPad.  Remind me did you love it or hate it.

Google Docs has live typing and comments and like those things are kind of like blue.  At least blew my mind in 2009 when it got.  Demoed at Google I.O.  Like that stuff all kind of lived on in other Google products that we all sort of use every day.  But it's just not called not called Wave.

Transcript:  But you're right we have a lot of those features now in Google Docs.  We do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Our show today brought to you by developers you know this name Atlassian.  If you are a developer and you're not using Atlassian's Jira tool.  Man I don't know how you survive Jira keeps track of your issues keeps track of your development who's doing what when.  Completions it's the most satisfying thing in the world when you can.  You can move that Jira column over to completed and I love that.  We've used Jira for years actually we're in Atlassian house because it just starts with Jira but Atlassian has a bunch of tools.  And it's really about collaboration tools that empower IT teams around the world and the people who work with those IT teams.  It's it.  This is a you know a tough world with complicated software out there complicated relationships.  One of the reasons we love Atlassian is because Jira helps us keep track of who's doing what.  And then it naturally flows into confluence.  It's so important for us that we have documentation of our processes.  And then Bitbucket if you have a code database is a great way to keep track of your code.  But there's a whole lot more there's now Ops Genie status page.  They acquired Trello another great project manager.  Look it's not just for developers Atlassian offers an affordable reliable suite of tools for teams of all sizes.  From DevOps to Agile IT apps to Ops to ITSM and whatever's next.  Jira Confluence Bitbucket Ops Genie status page.  Here's what you do.  Go right now to Atlassian dot com and find the tool for your IT team.  It's easy.  It's free to try and they will scale to whatever you need them to do.  So many big companies and small use Atlassian software.  It will grow with you.  Like of all of Atlassian's products the tools for your team are easy and free to try at Atlassian dot com slash IT.  We're proud to be an Atlassian house.  I say it all the time.  We use it and we recommend it Atlassian dot com slash IT.  Well this has been so much fun.  Let me find some more grist for the mill.  Apple is going to pay back taxes to French authorities.  In fact if you looked at the alphabet results.  Their tax rate was 139 percent last year but it was 11 percent this quarter.  And that's because of repatriation right.  Getting that money back.  And but Apple apparently had a vast amount of backdated tax.  French media estimated to be five hundred seventy one million dollars.  Apple confirmed they have paid the taxes back.  They didn't say exactly how much.  So that's a lot of money.  You know it's a lot of money for you and me.  Not that much for Apple.  Not that much for Apple.  So I don't you know I don't know exactly what to say about these these.  Multi-national companies and their tax.  I wish I could do it I guess.  But on the other hand as an individual who pays almost I don't know how much.  I don't know how much.  I don't know how much.  On the other hand as an individual who pays almost I don't know what it is 40 percent.  Compared to Google's 11 percent.  I'm actually glad to pay taxes because I don't you know this country made it possible for us to do what we do.  We use the roads we use the you know all the all the services of the U.S.  government the U.S.  digital service our armed forces.  I'm glad to pay taxes and I think it would be appropriate for for these tech companies to pay a little bit more.  I understand why they don't they don't have to.  So maybe there's something to be done there.  If you know what I mean Angela Arendt's this was a big surprise.  We're in the middle of Mac break weekly on Tuesday when news comes that the head of Apple retail the CEO they wooed away from  Burberry.  She was the CEO and became the head of Apple retail which looked like a demotion.  She's been there five years has announced she's going to leave in a couple of months.  I think it was a surprise to Apple because they announced they're replacing her with a longtime Apple executive who was in  charge of H.R.  They call it people at Apple.  She'll be now senior vice president of retail plus people.  So it's my guess they're searching for a replacement and this is an interim although they did not say that didn't say why  Arendt's is leaving but you know it's it's one of those where she not she wants to spend more time with her family but she's  looking for new personal and professional pursuits according to Tim Cook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There had been there had been rumors that she was a possible heir apparent to the CEO position at Apple early on just because of  her experience with Boomer Burberry.  And she has a she has a real charisma.  You know when she was on stage she was she was very compelling I think.  And so maybe there is a little friction there between Tim and Angela.

Start time: 5898.70
End time: 5947.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is not unusual.  We've seen it again and again.  I remember Stephen Elop left Microsoft when it was known Microsoft was seeking a new CEO to replace Steve Boomer.  Elop was in the running when he learned he wasn't going to be CEO he quit.  Actually it turned out they hired a pretty good guy who's now selling just now celebrating his fifth anniversary CEO Microsoft  Satya Nadella.  He's been doing a great job.  He's done an amazing job.  And you could absolutely say Arendt's has done an amazing job in retail.  It does make sense to what you say.  I mean she came from a CEO it would be sensible if they said well look Angela come to Apple help us with retail do it for five  years and then you can be the CEO when Tim retires.  How old is Tim Cook.  He's getting close to retirement age.  He's in his 60s in the early 60s.

Start time: 5947.70
End time: 5981.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah I think so.  Although I have to say that you know you say she's done a good job but if you go into any Apple store it's so crowded and it's  it's a very chaotic environment.  It's no longer kind of the Zen and chill that it used to be.  And if you tried to get a genius bar appointment and you try certainly you can't.  It's almost impossible to walk in now that that that whole process of getting the personalized support is really kind of a  mess.  And I'm not sure necessarily in that arena that she's done that good a job.

Start time: 5982.04

Transcript:  No everywhere.  Everywhere.  Even if like in our little Santa Rosa store there's always and you know I think part of the problem maybe this is her fault but  part of the problem is it's a great place and you feel like it's a completely OK to browse and look and try not to buy but just  to go in there and hang out answer you some email.  You know watch some TV and I think they wanted to make it like that but that as a result you owe every time I go in an Apple  store I could see there are a lot of people just hanging out there.  It's become a place to loiter.

Transcript:  I speculated on Twitter that there may be some value in breaking off the tech support the Genius Bar environment from the retail  environment.  I mean obviously you're there you know it's a chance to sell you something but I also think that it's just it's become that system has  become so overloaded that it's not even that useful anymore.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's it.  It's actually an interesting point.  They could have a separate little shop for the genius put them off to the side somehow.  Right.  It's interesting.  Apple has done two things I think to protect your privacy.  They're limiting accelerometer and gyroscope access in the next version of iOS 12.2 for privacy reasons.  This is a new privacy feature in the next version of iOS which will be coming in the next month or two.  Turns out in the past motion and orientation information has been available to websites.  Through Safari is now off by default and there is but there is a setting which the user has access to.  So that's that's kind of interesting motion and orientation access is a new a new setting in iOS.  I don't I don't know of any exploits but you can imagine that that might be something bad guys could use.  We did see one theoretical exploit where you could figure out what somebody's unlock code was using the accelerometer.  And the gyroscope.  So maybe that's that's the issue.

Start time: 6139.80
End time: 6147.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there any other privacy issue with that.  I mean can you would there be something not necessarily evil but.

Start time: 6148.64
End time: 6175.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well Google has demonstrated the ability to detect gate right.  And to you know one of the issues that websites have is authentication right.  Passwords a terrible method for authentication and gate analysis the ability to say I know you're you because I could tell how you walk.  Which uses the accelerometer and gyroscope I guess could also be used against you as a way to identify you uniquely on the phone.  That's wild isn't it.  Oh you're Leo.  I could tell how you walk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Combine it.  Apple's also told app developers if you're going to record the screen you have to disclose and get permission.  I didn't know this was an issue but apparently apps have been using the ability to record log or otherwise make a record of user activity without permission.  Major companies like Expedia Hollister and hotels according to TechCrunch were using a third party analytics tool to record every tap and swipe inside the app.  Oh so it's like it's UI analysis it's like a heat map right.

Start time: 6274.28

Transcript:  There's an interesting aspect to that though because they made the mom of the kid report it via like iOS.

Start time: 6281.34
End time: 6341.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what happened was she tweeted it.  OK.  So that's not exactly a report but she did try to get it to Apple.  At some point she contacted her local Fox News affiliate because she said my 14 year old has found this bug.  I think this is a problem.  And Apple finally said well you've got to do a bug radar report.  That's how you report.  In order to do that you have to be a developer.  So they were essentially they didn't say you have to be a developer but they said look you need to report it through radar.  And that meant you had to get you can get a free developer account but that's a lot of hoops to make somebody jump through.  Apple apologized.  They said we're going to have a new we're getting rid of that.  We're going to make it easier for the property.  What you can imagine though you've got how many what did they say 800 million 900 million active iOS users.  If 1 percent of them report something every year that's thousands of reports a day.  And most of them are I can't figure out how to get home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're inundated with these so I don't fully blame them.  They actually they've said we're going to pay the bug bounty to the kid the 14 year old by contributing to his education.  Well you can't give a 14 year old twenty five thousand dollars.  They just spend it on candy.  No not anymore.

Start time: 6368.80
End time: 6387.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the pump posture.  And yeah they're spending on Amazon TV products.  I think it's a valid question though because like at least as I recall to report security problems on Google you used to use an email address and it was like security at Google dot com or something.  And the problem is it got massively spammed.

Start time: 6387.58

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is not new.  Not only Google and Apple but Microsoft with 1809 their big fall release had some really big showstoppers including one that deleted data.  That's as bad as it gets with an operating system update.  Right.  And it turned out that it had been reported by Windows Insiders months ago.  And Microsoft just did they ignore it.  Did they miss it.  I mean you have this big beta program with Windows Insiders.  You're trying to get this kind of information.  That's presumably a big big deal.  They should you know if you if you were the person who said oh my god stop can't release that.  But they didn't.  And so I think it's a I think this is exactly the problem is there's just too much data.  How do you better systems.  Yeah.  I like these wide mass bug testing programs.  I think they're great.  But if you ignore what you learn from it that's not so useful.  That's totally true.  It's actually worse.  Yeah.  Twelve point one four will fix the FaceTime security flaw actually fixes a number of other lesser publicized flaws in iOS.  We talked about it on security now if you want to know more.

Start time: 6467.76
End time: 6488.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The length of time that it took for them to issue the fix coupled with the fact that everybody knew that this bug existed is like that's a deadly combination.  Right.  You ideally either want the bug to come in through a private channel where the whole world doesn't know about it.  Right.  So that people so the people can't exploit it or you issue the fix almost immediately.  Like it has to be it really has to be one or the other.  But this was just not handled well.

End time: 6517.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Three of them in system D CVE 2018 168 64 65 and 66.  It's in the journaling service.  Pretty much all Linux distros are subject to this and they're pretty they're pretty serious.  In fact researchers have created proof of concept exploits which fortunately have not yet been released.  But so this is open source is as open as you can get.  In fact because system D is so widely used I imagine there are lots of people looking at it.  Doesn't mean there's not flaws.

Transcript:  It's funny to me that if you're a company trying to help secure open source stuff like system D or things like that is probably a shortcut to goodwill.  Yeah.  If you have any kind of security thing like not making your products better or more robust or getting the 14 year old so they can report a bug is one thing.  But if you can make it so that you are helping with internet infrastructure or open source projects like you're competing for programmers and engineers and like if you can help with those kinds of things like people see that.  And I think that would help with their reputation.

Refusing to share it with Apple Linus Hunze has publicly shared iOS vulnerabilities in the past so we know he's credible.  He's frustrated that Apple's bug bounty program does not apply to Mac OS it only applies to iOS.  Really.  Yeah this has been why.  In fact Apple only recently had a bug bounty program for a long time and I kind of understand their point of view that if we start paying people for bugs it escalates it.  It makes it more expensive already governments foreign governments are paying people for bugs.  We don't want to get in the business but if you don't pay for bugs you don't hear about them.  So he's decided not to tell people about his keychain exploit it's called the key steel.

Transcript:  Let me talk about WordPress because I am a big WordPress fan.  I got my 12 year badge just the other day at WordPress.com.  Twelve years I've been using WordPress.com and I started using WordPress before  WordPress.com existed when Matt Mullenweg first created it.  I was looking for a great tool for my website that would make it easy.  I you know at the time I called it a blogging tool but really it's a professional grade  content management system that allows you to easily post create a website make it look  beautiful put in all the features you want including e-commerce as simply as possible.  That's WordPress.com and what a success.  WordPress powers 33 percent of the Internet.  One third of the entire net is running on WordPress.  I think that's as good a success as you can get.  That's it powers my site.  Me too.  Leo Laporte.com and I'm on WordPress.com for a long time.  You know when it first came out there wasn't a WordPress.com I was you know I had to get  a buy a server you know and I had to provision it.  Of course I spent most of my time like messing around with it trying to get plugins to work  and the security to work.  When WordPress.com came along I realized not only am I saving money it's less expensive  I'm saving time.  They keep it secure.  They keep it up to date so you can pursue what you love.  You can create your own site without being a geek without wasting time on any of that.  Just put your time into the content.  And the other thing I love about WordPress it's your site it's your content.  It's not Mark Zuckerberg's content.  It's not Jack's content.  It's your content.  And that means you can upload text audio video music photos to your WordPress site  download it anytime you want.  It's always under your control.  I think that's so important.  Everybody I know yes if you're a business you should have a Facebook page and a Twitter  feed and all that but you also need your own place your own site that everything links  back to.  That's your WordPress.com site.  It was started so anyone could publish their ideas and I think it's really been a huge  success.  No two week trials no hidden fees users own their own content.  I actually do the business plan because I want a lot.  I mean those features are so great.  Everybody gets help 24 hours a day including weekends from not just customers support  people reading a note but actual WordPress experts WordPress dot com flexible powerful.  Some of the biggest companies on the earth use it to build their websites.  Some of us little guys too.  I love WordPress.  Go to WordPress dot com slash twit.  You can get 15 percent off any new plan purchase right now.  WordPress dot com slash twit.  WordPress dot com slash twit.
