Ladies and gentlemen, a very good Twit to you.  We didn't do it last week, so that means we have twice the news, twice the hot air.  Hi, John.  Hey.  Also Jason Calacanis of Mahalo.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What's happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What, the bong back up the wrong way?  What happened there, Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just swallowed a cashew down the wrong shoot.  Aha!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think he's hanging out with Adam Curry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're trying to get Adam on.  We called him once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a box of cashews and macadamias right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, they say nuts are good for you, except for cashews and macadamias, which are  pretty much heart attacks in a can.  Are they?  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pure fat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Eat some almonds, some walnuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I better get some water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't eat those while you're talking though, because if it goes down the wrong pipe, you're  going to be hacking the whole show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's dying here.  This is terrible.  This is terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  I'll get some water.  I'll edit it all out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, why bother?  Note to Dane, whatever you do, don't edit this part.  I think we just lost John.  The night John C. Dvorak died.  Exactly.  You know, today is the 60th anniversary of the transistor.  Invented by that Nazi William Shockley in 1947 on December 16th.  He won a Nobel Prize for it.  John is really out.  John is gone.  It's terrible.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, the funny thing is I thought it was the 50th.  It's the 60th.  Yeah, I know.  I didn't do the math right.  I don't know what I was thinking.  It's kind of amazing.  So how come it wasn't a big deal like 10 years ago when it was the 50th?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They didn't do nothing, did they?  They do the same thing every time.  They ask Moore, Gordon Moore, if Moore's law running out of steam and he says, not yet.  And that's it.  Yeah.  Reporters have no imagination.  Not yet.  Maybe someday soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, with the bio stuff coming out, it's going to probably even increase, right?  Oh, isn't that interesting?  Maybe that's where we'll break the wall.  Yeah, Oatskins and stuff like that are going to, you're going to start getting video cards  that are going to be like protein based someday.  Your kids are going to be growing stuff in their laboratory like, oh, I'm just building  a Pentium chip like in my lab class in eighth grade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's probably true.  Out of proteins.  What are you guys, you guys are up on a new Menta, Jeff Hawkins, a company to kind of  reinvent artificial intelligence.  Do you read Jeff Hawkins' book?  It's really interesting.  I don't know.  I just wonder if you guys think it's a crock or if there's some legitimacy there.  His idea is that you can never have artificial intelligence with the von Neumann machine  that the current processor is.  It's too linear.  It doesn't work like a human brain.  So he wants to build chips that work more like a human brain.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know the problem I always have with this, these guys come up with this stuff, is generally,  what's my motivation?  One of the things about these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's my motivation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All living things have motivation.  They're trying to avoid pain.  Survival.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's all survival.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  There's no way chips can ever get that.  Thank God.  They don't want to be unplugged.  I mean, it's just not happening.  So there's no motivation.  So they can never really be genuine thinking.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you seen this new documentary, Blade Runner?  Are you a replicant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I knew you were a replicant.  I thought you were from Brooklyn, but you're a replicant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All I want is more time.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, that's a perfect example.  Maybe Ridley Scott knew this ahead of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ever have an itch?  You can't scratch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you seen, you must have just seen the new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is so gorgeous.  The new, I saw it at the opening night and then I went back like five nights later.  I saw it twice.  It's my favorite film of all time.  The final, what do you call it?  The final cut?  Final cut.  It is so beautiful.  I saw it at the Landmark Theater, which is one of Mark Cuban's and it's in LA and it's  one with a massive DLP, like double the projection, you know, Lum√®res or whatever, however they  rate them.  The scenes when they are flying through the city or flying in the big opening scene when  they're flying over Los Angeles and it's all smog and whatever, it's so clear that you  can see the details on the buildings and the ships.  You can see the console when they're inside the flying car.  When they're inside Terrell Corporation, you can see like the details on the walls.  They're in Decker's apartment.  You can see that great architecture when he looks out on the city from his terrace.  It's phenomenal.  It's like seeing a new movie.  I want to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, he's done like 50 recuts of this thing.  He can't sit still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's been like three or four official things.  More than any movie in history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apocalypse Now is the only one that's been recut more often than Blade Runner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think the reason was because it was so ahead of its time.  I mean, people were just getting you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  First thing is he dropped the narration, right?  Because the studio made him do the narration because they thought...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they made him do the narration because people were too stupid to understand it.  And then I think what happened was because the film got such a cult following that he  just sort of...  As opposed to George Lucas, which sort of dumbed the remakes down, he made them more  complex and more ambiguous, you know?  And sort of listened to the fans.  So you know, putting in the unicorn shot and you know, is Decker a replicant or not?  He's a replicant.  I mean, we all agree on that, don't we?  It's pretty clear.  I mean, the question is, was he originally a replicant in the original film?  And of course, Harrison Ford says that was never brought up to him by Ridley Scott.  And of course, Ridley Scott says, well, I'm a brilliant director.  I wouldn't tell him because I'm trying to have him play, you know, a replicant who doesn't  know he's a replicant.  I haven't told you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What?  I'm a replicant?  I can tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, now here's an interesting replicant.  Cyberlover.ru.  This is one of those hacker sites that has created a hot, sexy bot that people can buy,  put it on their website or whatever.  It's got 10 different personalities that are, quote, so lifelike, the victims will hand  over photos, phone numbers and more just to kind of get it to like them better.  Oh, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually could be either gender.  I have yet to see a bot that works well without, you know, it's like how many, you know, it's  like a game you can play with these guys who invent these things.  How many clicks does it take before you figure out this is a bunch of bull?  All you have to do is misspell one word and the thing stops working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remember, these poor guys, lonely guys on the internet, they don't want to believe it's  a bot.  I mean, that's the difference.  They're not trying to figure it out.  They want to believe it's a her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely.  It's wish fulfillment.  No, they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You just insulted half your listeners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They want to believe I'm a her when I go on a second life dress.  Well, that's a different story.  Wait a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You go on second life dresses as a girl, Leo?  I'm looking at your Skype avatar right now.  Leona.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leona Laporte.  Look for Leona Laporte and you'll find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leona Laporte.  Hi, big boy.  Want to come to my secret 2D lair?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How about a nice game of chess?  Yes.  Thermal nuclear warfare?  No, how about chess?  No, the more interesting thing I think is using the technology to actually use humans  to game other humans.  So like, you know, the catcher thing.  Spammers who want to create like a lot of accounts on Yahoo are putting catchers on  porn sites.  And what they do is in real time, they have one bot go to Yahoo to get a user.  Because they're trying to sign up for Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They get the capture and they put it on their site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  So a human trying to get porn types in the catcher and gets them their Yahoo account.  That is genius.  Is that smart?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what you do is you get two, you pretend it's a bot, but it's a really human talking  to a human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely.  They have no idea.  And one is doing the task of the other.  That's when like all this mechanical turk and stuff that Bezos is doing at Amazon gets  really interesting, which is why even bother with artificial intelligence when you have  potentially will have billions of people on the Internet with billions of hours of spare  cycles just send out these massively massive tasks to the hundreds of millions of people  out there and let them either do it through a play simulation where they actually think  they're playing a game but they're solving a problem or, you know, incentivize them with  a small amount of cash.  Is that kind of what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it seems to me that these spammers, if they can come up with some of these creative  notions that they could find better ways to make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know, but they wouldn't be as nefarious and they wouldn't feel like outlaws.  I mean, part of the reason people do this stuff is because they want to be, you know,  outlaw.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They like it.  That explains why they go outlaw spammer.  Well, that's why so many of them go public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, why do people, you know, smart people try to do heists?  I mean, it's like they could much easier go work for the man and make a hundred thousand  or two hundred thousand dollars a year as a program or they can send 10 million spams  and try to make a hundred dollars in affiliate links or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, Calcannis, you are the man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's the man.  Wait a sec.  I thought you worked for the man.  Isn't the man Adam Curry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just.  He's another one of the man.  Would one of you decide?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd like to stick it to the man and I just want to know who to stick it to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stick it to, you're the one of the man too, Leo.  You stick it to yourself.  Damn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not fun sticking it to yourself.  So did you see the Microsoft Robo Santa that asked for oral sex?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whoa.  Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Microsoft actually pulled this product.  Talking about changing the subject.  Well, no, it's related.  It's like the bot.  Bad visual.  It's like the bot.  No, no.  This was an MSN.  If you MSN message North Pole at Live.com and it was from Microsoft and they admit this,  you could add this as a bot.  It was a Santa bot.  And if you go to the register, actually we have a link on the delicious page.  If you go to the register, you could get this bot, some programmer, you could get this bot  to say, well, let me see.  It's something like oral sex is fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here it is.  OK, so this is one of these AI things, right?  It was an AI.  So I chat about something else, right?  Whatever you said that it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, listen, now you tell me, you tell me.  So this is the dialogue.  The register says pizza.  Santa says, yum.  What do you want for Christmas, El Ridge?  El Ridge says, maybe you shouldn't eat so much.  You're quite large.  Santa says, my elves will get right on that.  And what else are you wishing for this year, El Ridge?  Maybe you shouldn't eat it.  See if you could get someone else to eat it.  Eat it.  No, thank you.  I don't eat things.  Eat it.  See if you could get someone else to eat it.  Eat it.  You want me to eat what?  It's fun to talk about oral sex, but I want to chat about something else.  You dirty bastard.  I think you're a dirty bastard.  This is an actual transcript.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, were you playing a tape or were you acting that out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was acting that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, Leo's got the man of a million voices that has not been exploited.  I always wanted to be a dirty Santa boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Henry.  You've always wanted to be Henry.  I do.  It's kind of like Henry.  So Microsoft actually admitted this and pulled this guy.  And now when you ask about pizza, it says, if you need a break to go eat,  I'll be right there when you come back.  I like your Santa voice.  Well, come sit on my lap, Jason.  No, Santa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm feeling very uncomfortable right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what Santa's going to be given this year?  Actually, not going to be given.  Two things, wheeze and Kindles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kindles for $1,500.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  $1,500 on eBay.  For the Kindle, the Amazon Kindle, the thing that we have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What maniac is going to spend $1,500 for a white elephant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bought one, but I didn't pay the normal price for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You think that's a PR company doing their thing?  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's got to be.  Come on.  Let's get realistic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't mean to be cynical, but I am on the call with John Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I say that's how the PR companies do it.  They get a product.  They don't make enough.  They sell it out.  They put it on eBay for four times that much, and then they smucks.  They buy it later on.  Dvorak slash org.blog.  That's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's not.  He sounds like somebody.  He does sound like somebody, but doesn't sound like me.  It's his Edward G. Robinson.  No, no, no.  He sounds a little bit like the cop on The Simpsons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what it is.  The frog from MinuteMouse.  Oh, Wiggums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I got the, I got MinuteMouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, my name's the frog.  But the thing is, both Chief Wiggum and MinuteMouse are actually doing Edward G. Robinson impressions.  That's what you don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ah, there you go.  No, actually, one of the guys, I forgot who's the guy who does Wiggums, but he came on Leno  one time.  He says all of his voices that he does on The Simpsons are bad impressions.  Right.  He does the bad Jerry Lewis, the bad Edward G. Robinson.  He's that professor.  Yeah, that's the Jerry Lewis.  And then he does a bad, what's the name of that actor who always played, who was an easy  writer played the stoner, you know, if he does that guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's Otto.  Otto's the bus driver, dude.  Anyway, 14.  There, that's good.  Fourteen hundred bucks.  Actually one Kindle sold for eight hundred eighty, eight hundred thirty bucks.  You know, I like my, I actually got a Kindle.  I kind of like it.  I don't use it all the time.  It's better than the Sony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I applaud them making it because I think that it's the, you know, they're getting closer.  I mean, we've seen this for a decade now with the ebook stuff.  And from what I understand, people who are actually reading it, if you took the price  out of it, people reading it say it's a nice reading experience.  It is.  If you take out the player haters with the nonsensical issues like price, Evdo and all  these other things like paying for blogs, if you assume that it'll be free, the device  itself will be free at some point because they'll make the money in the books or the  device will be free with five books a year or something like that.  Our subscription model will give it to you for free if you subscribe for two years.  Twenty bucks like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it'll be, they'll stop making them by the time this scheme of yours even comes  to fruition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the deal.  You pay a hundred bucks more than you do for the Sony, but the books are a lot cheaper  and you get lifetime Evdo from Sprint.  I mean, I think it's cool.  You buy a book and you got it in like 30 seconds.  It's right there.  I haven't hooked it up to the computer once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you don't have to have the computer.  I was talking to Ev Williams from Twitter.  We were both in Paris for this little web conference and he had one which his wife stepped  on and broke, but that's a little size.  See, that never happens to a paperback.  And done, but broken, gone, brutal.  Oh, that's terrible.  And he has no books to read on the way home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, you have to read the magazines.  Exactly.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the interesting thing though is like, what is version two going to look like?  What is version three going to look like?  And what is the price point?  You know, I just disagree with crippling it though, because why not allow it to be Wi-Fi  enabled?  Why not allow it to have, you know, Safari browser or opera and just let people go to  town with it?  Because then, you know, people can then start coming up with their own uses for it, which  is very unlike Jeff Bezos, who is very much a platform guy with S3 and everything.  You know, he's like, let the street do what they want with this technology.  He's not doing that here, which I find weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wonder how much of that is the publishers that are keeping him from doing that.  Piracy?  Piracy.  There's battery life issues too.  If you put Wi-Fi in it, you know, it'll die in eight hours.  You want it to last as long as you can.  This thing's a turkey, come on.  It's pretty light.  It's easy to hold in your hand.  I've done a lot of reading on it.  I bought books on it.  It does have a browser, it just doesn't do the formatting properly.  Is it lighter than a book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  So if it's lighter than a book, then for me, see, that's one of the problems I have with  these book things is that they're heavy.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's not just lighter than one book.  I got, you know, 50 books in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, but you only read one at a time.  Gosh, it's definitely lighter than 50 books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't just read one at a time.  I have the Chronicle, I have the Examiner, or not the Examiner, the Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The story of the iPod is lighter than 3,000 albums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true.  No, but that's the way I look at things.  It's the same model.  That's the same model though.  Your iPod is your whole record collection.  This could be your whole library.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the, you remember the Rio MP3 player, the first one that came out?  Yeah, I got one right here.  And it was like, what, 128k?  You could fit like 10 songs on it?  Like you could fit an album on it.  And it was horribly flawed, but it showed the promise.  And I think this thing may have flaws, but I think it shows a lot of promise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which means Apple is going to come along and make a better one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, wait, there's a leap of faith here with that assertion.  One is that people were clamoring for MP3 technology.  They loved it.  It was, this college kids were all over it.  Everybody was jumping on anything they could that was MP3.  I don't see that happening with e-books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I said my initial reaction to the Kindle was that, that it was built around a business  model not about around customer need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there could be something to that.  But here's an idea.  Why doesn't the thing support MP3s or does it?  It does.  Okay, so you can put your music library...  And audible books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I love audible.  Hey, so do I.  Although I'm...  Here's your opportunity, Leo.  Go for it.  I'd like your business advice here real quick before I go into that.  So ever since we've been taking audible ads, and I love them and certainly we need the  money to keep this thing going, but the audience has been going down.  And what I'm realizing is these ads are so good, people are going out and getting audio  books and they're stopping.  They're no longer listening to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is audible is that good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to tell you, because audible is so good that it'll make you go right to the top  of your podcast list.  This is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're making up for Cory Doctorow last time.  Audible is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, you know what I like about audible is that they protect all that content for  you.  You don't have to worry about the authors having their work stolen.  Exactly.  We can have a business model that scales and grows, assuring that artists are compensated.  So it's a win-win.  The artist gets to make money, the user gets to read what they want.  Who could be against that?  I mean, you'd have to be a communist to be against that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, when Cory was on complaining about their DRM, they played that cut.  You know, they brought it to the boardroom and played it for everybody.  I hope they do the same for this cut.  I think you're absolutely right, Jason Calacanis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go.  Dun, dun, dun, dun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me change the topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't want to change the topic yet because I want to mention an audible book.  Oh, okay.  Go for it.  It's actually a really good book called Crystal Fire.  It is the story of John Bardeen, Walter Bratton, and William Shockley and the invention of  the transistor in 1947.  It's the full story.  It's the birth of the information age, Michael Reardon and Lillian Hodson, and it is available  on audiobook.  They have some really interesting books about computer history.  There's one on ENIAC.  All the Silicon Valley history books are there, but Crystal Fire is the story of the team  at Bell Labs that invented the transistor in 1947, and it's really quite dramatic.  Highly recommended.  It's available.  If you go right now to audible.com slash twit, that can be your book.  Actually, pick from 45,000 plus books.  They're all great and all protecting the rights of the authors who wrote them, incidentally,  We do actually love Audible.  I really am glad to have them along.  But I just ask, if you listen to audiobooks, and of course you will because they're great,  please keep listening to Twit.  Oh, wait a minute.  The person who's doing that is not listening anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right after Twit finishes, or you can multitask if you're at your desk.  Listen to both.  You can order some stuff.  You put them into your queue and you're all set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Audible.com slash Twit.  We thank them so much for their continued support despite Cory Doctorow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what you can get on there too is they have Chris Anderson's The Long Tail,  which is a very good list.  Must read it.  Yes.  And John Battelle.  The search is up there.  Listen, Cory Doctorow may feel that authors shouldn't get paid, but hey, some other great  authors like John Battelle and Chris Anderson, also very respected in the technology industry,  would like to see people get paid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I could tell you two people, actually three people will not be on this show together.  Jerry Pornell, Cory Doctorow, and now Jason Calacanis.  The three of you will never appear together.  Maybe you and Jerry.  Cory and I, it would be a great show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's my rebuttal to Cory Doctorow.  If he's so into free culture and everything like that, why doesn't he waive his $10,000,  $15,000 speaking gigs for the next 10 years?  You know, it's like he makes money off the speaking gigs, right?  But he gives the books away for free.  If you're an author who can't do speaking gigs like Jerry Pornell, maybe he doesn't  get $10,000 speaking gigs because he can't talk about, you know, whatever.  But maybe he wants to make one of his books.  I mean, is this so wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I understand that.  But I think that is the issue with The Kindle in a way is that, you know, I was talking  about this last night.  I was talking about a great book I had just read and I said, oh, I'd love to lend it to  you, but it's on The Kindle and I can't.  And what about that?  Do you guys do that?  Do you lend books to friends?  Because that's a big part of the culture.  Give it away.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Give them a book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't do that anymore.  But these cost a lot less than the print books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's exactly what I said is, yeah, but for $9 you could buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It costs less to make too.  Yeah, they should cost less.  They don't cost anything to make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But in terms of the user experience, if I paid $7, $8, $9.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there's something about me lending you a book.  Don't you think like, oh, you got to read this.  It's a great book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's that pass around thing that goes around with books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What they should do is they should let you send the first three chapters to another person  so they could try it.  You could squirt it to them.  Yeah, like Zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Something about that phrase just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This show has got some weird sexual undertones.  We got oral sex Santa.  We have the Russian artificial intelligence.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to raise the level right now.  According to English gamers, the Wii attracts cockroaches.  What?  Actually, it's Japanese.  The Japanese language gaming site, Barks, claims the Wii gives off a cockroach friendly  frequency that attracts the pests.  Have you seen cockroaches around your Wii?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You mean talking about the Nintendo Wii?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's not back in the gutter with John.  What?  Yes, I'm talking about the Nintendo Wii, not the other one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually no.  I wonder whether that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you have a Wii?  You have a Wii.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, of course.  I'll give you a thousand bucks for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you have a Wii, Jason?  I have a couple of them.  We have them at the office.  I got one at home.  I've played it for like no more than an hour.  I like that Rock Band.  That is the most fun I've had on a video game system since Defender.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you see that Activision won't let Rock Band work with the Guitar Hero?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Guitar?  That's just dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't bring your axe from another game over here, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wasn't the whole idea of a software bug, or is that just folklore, that the bug was actually  a bug that crawled into a computer and got fried on the chip and that caused the problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That actually goes back to Grace Hopper days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is a very famous page in her notebook where she's taped them off and she said the  first software bug.  As it turns out...  I think it was a hardware bug.  Okay, yes, you're right.  The first hardware bug.  As it turns out, according to my research, textile workers in 19th century Britain, when  they had problems with their jacquard looms, would also say there's a bug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It goes way back.  That makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does it really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, those looms would have a lot of insects in that fiber.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, anyway, she's kind of credited Grace Hopper with creating bugs, but apparently, no, she  didn't.  In fact, she knew of it.  She was making a little play on words.  It was a little joke.  This is a bug.  Anyway, I don't know if that's true or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sure that the bugs in those jacquard looms probably actually did affect the performance,  as opposed to some dead moth next to a tube.  You're a cockroach in your wee.  Hey, I got to plug a couple of guys.  Please.  Robert Phipps, IT lecturer at West Virginia, and Chris Cooling, who does cooltidbits.net.  They both sent me a West Virginia hoodie, which doesn't do me any good anymore because  they lost the one game they needed to win.  So now I feel bad about it.  But meanwhile, my team, the Appalachian State Mountaineers, won three in a row.  Now I need a three-peat sweatshirt or something from somebody.  Jason, you don't realize that I used this show to solicit clothes.  I could give you a Yale cap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that what it's come to?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ever since you lost that PC Magazine column, things have gotten rough for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Aren't you still in PCMag?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, of course.  He doesn't keep up with anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm joking.  PCMag still publishes?  Oh my God.  I am on eBay right now.  I am not kidding.  The buy it price for a Kindle, $2,999.  That's a scam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a sucker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some guy selling it to himself, I think it's a publicity stunt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The question is what are the real bid prices so far on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I see, let's see, $7,000.  You guys don't like football, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, Jason's a basketball guy.  Ask him about the Knicks.  You'll go on for hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, the Knicks.  I mean, that's typical of a guy like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Guy like what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You'd like the Knicks.  Well-endowed gentleman of a...  What?  What's he like?  What do you mean?  He's a Knicks lover.  He's from Brooklyn.  That's his problem.  I'm sorry to hear that.  There was a really great blog posting.  I got to find it because I want to give the guy credit.  Talking about the latest version of Windows and everything that went wrong with Vista  has been fixed in this new version of Windows.  It's faster, more reliable.  All the problems have gone.  For those of you who really put down Microsoft's development team, these guys know what they're  doing.  Windows XP.  It's amazing.  New from Microsoft.  I loved it.  And when you read it, you go, that actually makes sense.  It is an improvement.  The upgrade is XP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The guy was like, yeah, and it's got a very cute, soft, bubbly, retro user interface.  Yeah.  I like...  I'll find this blog.  I just installed the new Mac operating system.  I always wait a couple of weeks until I get the patches out.  It's really nice.  It feels more stable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although I think Apple has the same problem Microsoft does, which is essentially there's  nothing much new you can do.  So you end up screwing stuff up just for the sake of change.  You just change for the sake of change.  Guys you can stop now.  XP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's fine.  The desktop space is probably the best feature.  We can switch between different window configurations.  That's existed in third party apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But give it a chance because it gets confused and you start losing Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't use that feature.  I just find if you have enough monitors, you don't need to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How many monitors do you have, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I only have two, but that's all you need to make...  What size?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Instead of four spaces, he just has four 30 inch displays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We need spaces.  They're not 30 inch, but they're big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because I have two 30 inch at home and a 30 and two 24s are warm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what would you need to swap your desktop for if you got all that space?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's just nice to have the app.  Do you have the 30 in the middle and the two 24s like wings?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  I turn them landscape.  I flip them so they have the long pages so I can put my IRC chat on there.  My iTunes up there.  I have three 30 inches, but it's too wide.  You have three 30 inches, so you can't see the second half of the wingman.  It's sort of a waste.  What I want them to make is...  Your peripheral vision doesn't go far enough.  That's exactly right.  What I want them to make is a curved monitor.  If they can take the 30 inch monitor and make it another couple of inches on each side,  eight inches, and then have it curve a little bit, that would be the $5,000 monitor.  I don't know why they don't have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a monitor made by some guys that you go into.  You sit in this and it's like you're in a dome.  Have you ever seen this thing?  It's actually quite interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've done a lot of research into this stuff.  Ever since the 30 inch monitor came out, they stopped advancing it.  You can't get any bigger.  Can you get any bigger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Could you reasonably get any bigger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course.  If people are having two 30 inch monitors or Al Gore's got three, of course you can go  bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sitting in front of a 30 and a 24, but I do need another 24 on the left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got to go to 24.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Al Gore's got three of them.  Isn't that a global warming thing?  That's a lousy carbon footprint, I'll tell you right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No kidding.  Well, I need more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think he lives in an 8,000 square foot house or something, just him and his wife.  There's some problems there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I don't want to knock out because he's really doing everything he can for the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm doing my part.  I ordered a Tesla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you?  Yep.  The one, the $100,000 Tesla?  110 plus tax.  Wow, who's counting after the first 100 it's all.  This is the one that goes zero to 60 in three seconds, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It goes four seconds.  Four?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's as fast as a...  When are you going to get delivery?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they're going to start in the second quarter.  I got the inside dope on the whole thing.  They just basically wanted to get the best possible transmission in it.  They went through three transmissions.  The first one would have been good enough.  They're being kind of obsessive about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought it's electric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It still has a transmission, though.  The transmission is very important because it uses the transmission to, I think, conserve  the batteries, optimize the batteries.  This is an awesome car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would love to see this.  I can't wait.  It's going to pin your head to the back of the seat, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I have a Corvette right now.  It's the same speed from zero to 60 as the Corvette and the Ferrari F430.  It's all the same speed, but one of them has no noise when you do it.  It gets 250-mile range.  It costs nothing because you're doing it off of electrical.  I'm going to put some solar panels on the garage.  I will be 100% off the grid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you can't get enough juice out of the solar panels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, because I only drive 10, 15 miles a day.  I drive to my office and back.  It's four miles away.  I will be 100% off the grid because they put a battery pack and you charge your battery  pack in your house.  The battery pack in your house is charging all day long.  Oh, so you just plug it in?  Yeah, you plug it in.  You plug into the battery pack, which has been charging all day.  I'll get home at night.  It'll be charged from the sun.  There's also these little windmills you can get that cost like 30 grand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then the wind from driving 0-64 seconds charges the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me get this straight.  $110,000 car, $30,000 windmill, solar panels probably 10 grand.  Yeah, that's a hell of a deal.  I don't know if my 66 Datsun counts, but it only cost me $4 a week to run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, Moore's law, baby.  It basically means that this car is going to pay you $7 to take this car in another  four years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just glad you're buying this so that you're making it possible for the rest of us, Jason,  because you're funding this, you're moving it forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's the idea.  Also, I just want to have the car that is not available to anybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you put down a deposit?  Yeah.  How much?  Five grand, baby.  Oh, it's five grand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's only five grand right now.  However, I let them know that if one of the people on the 100 list or the first 200 who  paid full fare drops out, I want their spot and I'll pay the full fare.  I don't know if they'll do it or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They'll be giving you a call.  I think you'll be hearing from Mr. Tesla.  His hair may be sticking straight up, but you'll be hearing from him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's ... This is why I'm very optimistic.  I think the whole global warming thing is going to be solved in the next 10 years because  of free markets.  Everybody wants to drive an electric car.  Everybody wants to have a solar panel on their roof.  Everybody wants to live in a clean city with great air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But then we'll all be dead from staph infections that can't be cured from penicillin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You got to go to Duluth once in a while and hang out.  Get out of the valley.  Why?  I'm not in the valley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm in Los Angeles.  Worse.  It is worse.  You're correct on that one.  Yo, man, go to Shanghai, man.  You can't even breathe in that town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're saying real people won't do this?  John, is that what you're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think the average person living in the Midwest cares about the Tesla or the electric  car or solar panels, to be honest about it.  What do they care about?  Well, they don't care about that.  They care about what they care about.  They care about their family, maybe.  They care about their neighbors.  That's what this is all about.  They care about the job they have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Saving the world for your kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think ... I think a lot of people believe that saving the world and stuff is  a ... Save yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree that that is how people in our generation or your generation think, but I think this  younger generation has a very obsessive environmental bent to them.  I think if you drive an SUV or a Hummer where our generation thought that was kind of cool,  they're not cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know what generation thought it was cool to drive a Hummer to be honest about it.  Well, like SUV or truck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody just sent me a YouTube video, somebody using a Tesla coil to protect their car.  See, now if you could do that, so if somebody touches your Tesla car, their Tesla coil goes  off and ... That'd be cool.  Isn't it fiberglass?  Oh, it must be real light, right?  All right, let's talk about ... All right, you want to talk speculative future?  Alexander Zaitsev.  No?  Oh, thanks.  Alexander Zaitsev.  How about some news stories here?  This is a news story.  Alexander Zaitsev, chief scientist at the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of Radio  Engineering and Electronics has done something very controversial.  He has access to one of the most powerful radio transmitters on earth and he's sending  message to aliens saying, come on, we're over here.  Look over here.  Now, this is kind of what they call active SETI, instead of waiting and seeing electronic  signals and people are up in arms because ... Because they saw Independence Day once

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  too often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They read a little too much sci-fi, but also some people say, how dare this guy speak for  us and announce the earth's existence, our existence.  We don't know what's out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, if there's anything out there ...  What if this guy assaults people?  They could come over and do an Independence Day, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's get Bobby Slayton up there to make some commentary.  So ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your wife, I slept with her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of the things that has always fascinated me about this whole concept is that if there's  some technology or there's some species or something that flies around and we don't even  know the size of ants, but whatever the case is, what's the likelihood of them to have  developed the exact same radio technologies that we have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they wouldn't, but they would be monitoring those spectrums for any kind of pattern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is actually a limited amount of spectrum out there, so it would make sense ...  Yeah, it's not a hard thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're doing that too.  I mean, we're running out of spectrum, right?  You're not looking for I love Lucy.  You're just looking for organization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the things that's interesting, I was at this EG conference, which is sort of like  a TED-type conference out here, and they were saying that our radio wave technology, whatever  we look out into space with, was not really able to see planets like Earth at a distance  that well, but the technology is getting better and that soon we're going to be able  to actually see planets that match our distance from a sun.  C-class, yeah, Goldilocks planets.  So when that happens, we're going to actually know where they all are so we can actually  do things like target them or listen to them and tune into them.  We just don't know where they are.  That's what this guy's doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's aiming at where it seems likely that there'd be an Earth-like planet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's definitely got to be something out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the Fermi paradox now you're run up against here.  I think it's...  And we know Fermi, the famous physicist, said that clearly the probability is there's intelligent  life out there, but where the hell's the evidence?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where are they?  The other thing, well, I mean, where the evidence, but the...  Well, besides us.  Besides us.  But if we can exist in an infinite, in a world of infinite possibilities, it's going to happen.  Exactly.  The question is, would we ever connect?  And that's the answer to that maybe, never.  So then it becomes moot if it does exist and you can never connect with it.  And what's the point?  I mean, what if our relationship with this foreign planet is that we can send messages  back and forth and we're basically got pen pals?  Yeah.  I mean, it's sort of a plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They might tell us something.  They might say, hey, you know, that Tesla car, that's going to blow up.  They might say something of use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they'd be dead by the time the message even got there if you got one going back and  forth in one iteration.  It's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'd be great if they started sending us wisdom that was just like, you know, conventional

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  wisdom, you know.  Fire.  Investigate fire.  A stitch in time saves nine.  This thing called the wheel.  Do you have one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't let your daughter marry a musician.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. I see a great science fiction book here where you go all this trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got to have like all 10 planets all talking to each other, but they can never make context.  All we do is send like the best jokes around and it becomes like an IRC channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're on the alien mailing list.  The alien joke mailing list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It becomes like it becomes like Usenet.  It could be like the best use we come up with for interstellar communications is like a  Usenet group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The word of the year for 2007, according to the.  Thank you.  The dictionary gurus at Merriam-Webster.  Whoop whoop whoop.  W zero zero T.  How many years has this been around?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A couple like I think I first heard it two or three years ago.  Longer than that.  Four years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think I think I heard it Jason.  It seems fairly recent.  Really?  Now, somebody sent me an email explaining where the or at least what he thought was  the origins because he was listening to some gamers podcast and it stems from the common  reference to wow when you find somebody drops something in a wow.  You get wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  But then where did the two zeros come from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's that's hackerspeed.  Yeah, it's speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or some say it's we hack source.  We owned the other team.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Corey uses woot all the time.  Well, there's W H O O T, which is like woot.  There it is.  But that's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where did you who uses that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's that song.  There it is.  There was something like basketball song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, right, right, right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's some old pre rapper song or something that was.  Yeah.  It's used in games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're right.  Right.  So I think that might have been a precursor to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting.  Yeah.  So well, anyway, Merriam-Webster obviously has decided they're bored.  They got nothing better to do.  It's a great press release.  You know, you're going to get coverage.  People are going to write about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they have to appeal to that next internet generation, right?  Because they're going to need a solution for their encyclopedic needs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Number two word of the year.  Any guesses?  Facebook.  As a verb.  Nobody uses Facebook as a verb.  I'll find out.  They don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what I say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've never heard anybody say Facebook me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  Google.  Yes.  I'll Google you.  use it?  It's like, yeah, hey, I got a hold of Jill the other day and I Facebooked her.  That sounds awful.  It does.  It doesn't sound right.  It sounds terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The show is again going in the wrong direction.  Can we clear the ship?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know.  It's because you're on it.  This is your fault, Jason.  It clearly is.  We've always had, we've always run a clean ship here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't suggest any of the stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All of a sudden, I don't know what happened.  It must be you, Jason, because it's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's a combination of John and I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Other other.  Well, wait until you see the title for this show.  I'm going back and forth between John's nuts and Jason's 30 inchers.  So it's one or the other.  You know, I keep track of this as the show goes by.  I consider titles as we go.  And those are two of the two top contenders.  So whoot.  There's his nuts again.  Woot.  Facebook.  Now, I don't know where these other top 10 words come from.  I mean, why these I don't know why conundrum is the third.  Why would conundrum be the word?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought it was the third one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm at Merriam Webster site.  Conundrum Quixotic Blame Storm.  I like that.  Have you ever heard that blames that sounds like an Internet word?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought surge was one of the big words.  Surge should be a big word.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it the word have to be a new word?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no.  It just has to be the word of the year.  People are using a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, the words.  Let's see.  But I guess it's a vote based on votes from visitors to the Merriam Webster website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, the wood people must have gotten.  That's what happened.  The woopy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they came.  They came.  They've been gay.  That's gamed.  Now, there's the word of the year.  Here's another one.  Number six is sardoodledom.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sardoodle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sardoodledom.  I never even heard of this word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that some Harry Potter reference or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mechanically contrived plot structure and stereotyped or unrealistic characterization  in drama.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't go to graduate school.  I never heard of it.  It's a great word.  Sardoodledom.  Sardoodle.  Like sardonic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It sounds funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, that makes it a good word.  Peck Sniffian.  You would know that, John.  No.  After Seth Pick Sniff, the character in Martin Chuzzlewit.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Dickens.  Dickens.  Of course.  Aren't you a great Dickensian scholar?  I thought you were.  Oh, no, I'm sorry.  That's Spengler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know.  I read Spengler.  You're thinking of mixing me up with Spengler.  Although I do read a lot of Dickens only for a structure because it's like, nobody can  do anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amazing.  At least not over 4,000 pages like he did.  So Pennsylvania Man brought his computer in 2004, brought his computer to a Circuit City  store in Wyoming, missing Pennsylvania and asked them to install a DVD burner.  Didn't, by the way, didn't take the child porn off his hard drive.  No.  Technicians.  Here we go again.  Whoops.  Technicians were testing.  Now, this is where it gets a little weird.  The technicians at Circuit City wanted to test the DVD burners new software by searching  for video files to play back.  This makes no sense, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Why wouldn't they have their own DVD full of test files?  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why wouldn't they just burn a DVD of anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they searched for video files and they found some files that, according to the name,  appeared to be pornographic in nature.  Yes.  And the guy got arrested.  The guy got arrested.  But now...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is there any evidence?  This kind of thing is really a problem because it seems to me that those guys could have  just as easily because they had full control of the machine, planted that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also, the guy's machine could have been a slave by some adware or spyware.  And then also, people are now using this peer-to-peer backup system for unlimited storage.  Good point.  Have you heard about this?  No.  So there's this new peer-to-peer thing.  If you don't want to spend $50 on Moxie and have a secure connection and backup yourself  securely with a third party, you can back it up on other people's...  On somebody else's drive?  Yeah, which I think is crazy.  Basically.  No, not going to do it.  But it's encrypted, right?  Because we know encryption is impossible to break.  And yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you could be storing all sorts of crap for somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, who's going to use these kind of systems?  I mean, the people who use these systems are people with something to hide and who want  to be anonymous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So...  He appealed it to the Superior Court of Pennsylvania.  They overturned.  They said...  They overturned the appeal.  They said, no, no, this is a legitimate...  The court ruled the technicians weren't randomly perusing the drive for a contraband, but we're  testing its functioning in a commercially accepted manner.  They were searching for...  This is the best part.  Codex.  C-O-D-E space X.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what?  These guys are explaining how they found it a little bit too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We were looking for Codex.  They should have just said, we were going to burn a DVD and we went into the My Videos  file just to test to make sure it was working.  Boom, what did we find?  Things with a weird name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's so funny how little the courts seem to understand technology and then they show up.  It's frightening.  It's really frightening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those are the people who actually get to make the laws, you know, are involved in it.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have an anecdote.  I was an expert witness in a case where the Hays modem code was under attack or there  was some licensing...  The ATDT?  Yeah, ATDT.  It was the AT...  Anyway, there's some timing issues involved with the space.  What happened was Hays didn't patent it correctly and they did it after the fact.  It was late and there was all these issues.  Anyway, they went through a big rigmarole in this case and it ended up...  They found the party that was trying to get...  Not be sued by Hays for stealing the patent.  They lost.  Hays won.  Then when they grilled the jury over it, it had nothing to do...  The reason that they all chose in favor of Hays...  This is the thing that the lawyers found hilarious...  Because on the Hays modem plastic box, it said patent pending, which was a patent specifically  to the plastic that made the modem.  It had nothing to do with the AT command set at all.  But because that was on the box, it said patent pending, they lost the case because of this  kind of idiocy.  It's the kind of thing that goes on.  It's really pathetic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So get this.  When Sprint and Nextel merged, they had to merge their billing, they had to merge all  the stuff they charge.  I didn't realize this.  You probably have noticed on your bill something called the Federal Programs Cost Recovery  Fee, which sounds like it's something mandated by the government.  Turns out they're just charging you for the taxes they have to pay.  So they just put that on there.  And Nextel was charging customers a buck 55 a month.  And Sprint was charging customers 55 cents a month.  So what do you think Sprint did?  Raise the price.  Of course.  They renamed it to an administrative charge, 75 cent administrative charge and a 20 cent  regulatory charge, none of which is required by the government.  It's just, he says, the Sprint spokesman, John Taylor, these fees are offset the high  tax burden the industry faces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they can put anything they want on there and people will just pay it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I should start doing that.  Just put a federal, I'm going to put a federal programs cost recovery fee on everything I  do.  Right.  That's the tax.  This is the tax I have to pay.  So pay me more.  So I don't have to pay the tax.  How did the cell phone companies get away with this?  I'm very excited by, I hope Verizon, when they say they want to open their network,  really does begin something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These guys are going to continue to gouge the public as long as they can.  All these promises are going to go nowhere.  This is why I use burners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I don't blame you.  That is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When I was in Paris last week, I was Twittering and I'm with Ed Williams and I'm like, my  Twitter is not working.  What's wrong with the system?  He's like, no, no, that's not us.  That's a message from your provider.  And I was like, this is both, you know, and so then I started using this a BlackBerry  Twitter application called TwitterBerry, which is awesome.  So it uses the web to do it.  You have it?  Yeah, I use it.  So you don't have to get SMS charges.  I'm like, OK, fine.  Then I get online the other day and it turns out T-Mobile turned off Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep.  Right.  Big news item.  Now, they're just blocking the shortcode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're blocking the 40404 shortcode, the Twitter shortcode, right?  Yeah, I guess.  But I mean, the...  So you could still use a T-Mobile phone as I am with TwitterBerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know it's just like, but probably a third of what I use my phone for is Twitter.  So if like they're going to start screwing with it, I'm going to switch providers.  I'm just getting so tired.  I just want an IP based phone.  I want to be done with these people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, just be glad you're not.  Pjotr Stanasik.  He's a 22 year old oil and gas well tester in northern Alberta.  He was using his new cell phone as a modem for his computer.  He has a $10 unlimited browser plan from Bell Mobility, which is the Canadian cell phone  company.  Got a bill for $85,000.  He was downloading big files.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That unlimited isn't as unlimited as it used to be.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He complained to the phone company.  They said, look, for goodwill reasons, we're not going to charge you $85,000 because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  $8500 for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Basically, it's $3400.  That's all.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He could get fiber to his house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeez.  Well, I guess he's to be...  I guess he didn't realize that using his cell phone as a modem would be using minutes, but  he must have been using it nonstop to get that kind of a bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm so glad.  It's actually worse in Canada.  They don't have any flat rate data plans.  You just can't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was in Europe one time and I was trying to download some stuff that was large in size.  It kept stopping.  I'm like, what the heck is going on?  Why is it stopping?  I called up the support line.  I'm in Germany.  She's like, it's 250 meg download limit.  I'm like, what's this?  $24.95 a day.  She's like, yeah, did you read the user agreement?  I'm like, the eight page user agreement and minus one font.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fact, a lot of times I've been in Europe and I've had to buy...  You buy a card or something at some of these places and you use it.  It's supposed to be for the whole day and then craps out in about an hour.  You got to use another card.  Anyway, since you were at the Low Web, can you give us a little report on what happened  there?  What was going on and was it worth going to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the fourth one they've had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Explain what it is, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doesn't Low Web sound like a joke?  The Web 3 is like...  Do they really call it Low Web?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Low Web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's basically like the Web 2.0 conference here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they're French so it has to be 3.0 there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's for all of Europe so it really is probably 5 or 10% French based but it's really  all of Europe comes to it.  They had like 2 or 3,000 people at this thing.  It was huge.  So they brought in Scoble, Ev Williams, Dave Weiner, O'Malley.  The usual suspects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jason Calacanis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it was like a mini rock tour or something like that because what's happened over the  last couple of years...  It's like one of those Motown concerts.  It's exactly what it's like.  Because of the Valleywag blogging thing, tech meme, people in Europe sit there and read  tech meme and Valleywag and they get to know 30 personalities and then when you get there,  you know like, oh yeah, you remember your thing on Valleywag where they said that you're  dog, did you know this?  It's wild.  But it was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, did anything come of it more than just celebrity jock sniffing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was like, I'm sure there's business going on there now because people are paying a lot  of money to go there.  So I think the European market, there's a lot of business going on there.  People buying advertising, people buying software, syndicating stuff.  It's sort of like when PCs became a big industry, what was the big PC event?  PC Expo?  No, well, Comdex was the big one.  Comdex, right.  At a certain point, it just becomes like a trade show where a bunch of salespeople show  up and trade business cards.  It seems like it's getting to that point.  So sort of like when Internet World jumped the shark, it feels like it's getting to the  point where it's a business event.  It's a trade show.  There were like 30 booths.  It's a trade show, which is good.  It means there's a business there.  But when I went three years ago, there were like 400 people.  It was 10 times bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you get anything out of it?  Is there anything that you can report on that would interest anyone that listens to this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was no breaking news.  We broke a little news from a hollow, but nothing major got broken there.  It's not like it was Web 2.0 or the TechCrunch event where we had specific items breaking  at it.  No, it's like a place for all the people to get together.  It's like a drinking club.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Drinking and sniffing.  It's fine.  It's good.  So we were talking about text messaging.  You know that I just saw an article that said that in Britain anyway, text messaging to  break up with your girl is becoming very popular.  We saw it happen with Kevin Federline when Brittany broke up with him on television in  Canada.  According to a survey, 15% of the 2,194 Brits surveyed said they had been dumped by text  or email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was about to say, can we replace text with email and do this story in 97?  I remember this story the first time around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's cold.  Of course it's cold.  I took your advice the last time you were on, Jason, you said you should add everybody  on Facebook.  So I have.  I have some, I don't know, some like 3,000 friends now on Facebook.  What's fun is to read the news feed and watch people break up, get in hookup.  That is weird.  Half the news feed.  You know, Roland is now single.  Max and Dolly ended their relationship.  I'm reading my feed.  Jason is now single.  Drew went from being single to it's complicated.  Margie is now married.  That's weird stuff.  That's weird.  Nicholas and Katie ended their relationship.  I mean, there's tons of this.  This is one page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a friend who's been married for like over 10 years.  And like, I guess his wife just got on Facebook.  So it said like, you know, this person, you know, Jim and Cindy are now married.  So I took a screen grab of it and I sent it to him.  I was like, congratulations.  I was waiting for you to make an honorable, you know, late cat of her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really gets to be an interesting village when you have lots of Facebook friends.  Something weird happens.  It's just a community.  And there's a, this feed becomes very fascinating to see all the people breaking up alone.  Those were all real.  I wasn't making them up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's all marketing.  I'm convinced that all these social networks are like a way to market yourself to your  friends and associates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.  But you see everything as marketing.  That might be your bias.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, when you go out with your friends and, you know, like market to your friends,  Jason, you don't, but no, but think about it this way.  You say, what have you been up to?  And your friend tells you what they've been up to and they say, oh, well, what have you  been up to?  And they do that.  Right.  So that's just, you know, chit chat is what we would call it.  It's called relationship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  However, when you start having thousands of people hooked up together and it starts going  by on a daily basis, it starts to feel like marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you could, yeah, specifically because you don't know, you know, but 20 of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's what Twitter feels like to me now.  It's funny because I took a Twitter hiatus.  I stopped in April and went, came back last month and all of a sudden everything on Twitter  is marketing.  It's all read my articles.  You know, this is what I'm doing.  I'm here doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, although, you know, I did the first Twitter narrative this week.  I left my passport and like $3,000 in my safe.  And I'm at the airport.  I'm like, you get that sinking feeling when you check in.  And I'm like, oh my God.  So I call the hotel, I give them the code, they grab the money, they grab the passport.  I put them on the phone with the person, the agent at the desk and they, I say, whatever  it takes, hire a motor, hire a motorcycle and have them get to the airport.  They hire a motorcycle.  Wow.  Messenger and like they're holding the gate for me and the messenger's coming on bicycle  and the guy's like, you have six minutes left.  And I'm calling the bike messenger.  It's three minutes.  All of a sudden the bike messenger comes flying up on the sidewalk and I was Twittering the  whole thing.  Oh, that's cool.  Twittering, going through security and I was taking pictures and emailing them to my Flickr  account.  So we go on my Flickr account, Jason Calacanis, one word, no spaces, no dashes, no.org.  And you look at it, you'll see pictures of me, of the bicycle coming up.  I think that's kind of interesting.  Dozens of people living the drama with me.  And it sort of made it fun, you know, and the sinking feeling went away, which was like,  you know, and then everybody starts like, oh, well, if you have to stay in Paris another  night, let me take you to dinner.  And that's what I do.  That's what I use Twitter for now is when I'm in a different city, I'm like, anybody  want to go get Chinese food?  Boom, I get like a hundred emails and I just go to dinner with random people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry I missed this whole thing.  I'm reading it right now.  It was all December 14th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I have a question.  Yeah.  Why do you carry $3,000 in cash with you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I knew you'd pick that up, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's just how I change.  That's just how I roll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I grew up 20,000.  What's three is nothing.  I grew up in Brooklyn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like carry a roll, you know, with the rubber band around it.  I always carry a roll.  I feel naked if I go out without a roll in my pocket.  It's just my dad was always like, you have to have some cash with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I wonder if you're happy to see him or is that a roll in your pocket?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you don't use a money clip, you use a rubber band?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, because that was when I grew up in Brooklyn.  You always knew a fake gangster from a real gangster based on their role.  Like what bills are on top?  What bills are on top, if they're using a rubber band or some Tiffany, you know, silly  thing, you know.  If you're a real gangster, you cannot, there's no money clip that's going to hold your role.  Right.  You know, and real gangsters, they start at 20s.  If they have singles and stuff like that, they keep that in another pocket.  They just throw that away.  Right.  You start with 20s and move up.  So if you're you got a nice size roll, it's, you know, basically starts at the size of  like if you put two golf balls in your hand, maybe like that's a decent size knot.  They call it a knot too.  So I always like to have a decent size knot and I basically weigh it against my Blackberry.  It's got to weigh the same as my Blackberry because I keep one in one pocket, one on the  other.  So are you telling us that you're a gangster?  I'm not getting this.  He's a gangster.  That's just gangster style.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jason's decent size knot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even all my life I wanted to be a gangster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well it's true in The Sopranos and all those movies they do.  They take out the roll, they peel off a couple of hundreds and they give it to the.  Yeah, I always peel off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm always peeling off.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I piece people off all the time.  I think that's a very nice.  There's something about that.  I love to piece people off.  What do you call it?  Piece people off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Piece, like a piece.  You give them a piece.  I give you a piece.  Piece people off.  I tip everybody in Los Angeles.  It's just tipped.  It's unbelievable.  People are so cheap.  Because celebrity is the tip out here.  You know, like, oh, you got to open the door for, you know, whoever and that's the tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you like to share the wealth.  You like to spread it around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you're a big, Jason, are you a big tipper?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absurd tipper.  Like, literally absurd.  My wife is like, that's so unnecessary.  But I grew up as a waiter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can dig it.  I do the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I over tip too.  I don't like to give a lot to charity.  up as a waiter.  I was broke my whole life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, a lot of people that worked in the restaurant business seem to be big  tippers.  Oh, yeah, because we know what it's like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I give 50%.  Oh, I'm a hunter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  Yeah, like 30, 40, 50.  Yeah, I mean.  30, I can see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, and that's going down.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  But if it's really good service, if it's $100, I get $150, $140, something like that.  What's the difference?  I hate to go back to the tech news.  It's admirable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's great.  I just think, you know, like people are like, oh, the working man is always the person who  gets squeezed, you know?  And it's like, if you give a good tip, it makes somebody's day because I was a waiter.  That's how I got to school and whatever.  And when I was a kid, it's like somebody gives you a 50% tip instead of a 20% tip.  It makes your night and it only happens once every 10 nights.  Right.  Right.  So why not be a gangster?  What do you do?  Are you a big tipper, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  You have to ask that question.  Doesn't seem like he would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't usually pick up the tab.  I mean, I would be a big tipper, but you know, most of the time, since I'm a starving writer,  I have to like require other people to pay for the whole damn thing.  And I hope that they're big tippers, which is why I like Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like going to the dinner with Jason.  Don't buy a Mac.  I got a tippy.  It's a piece of crap.  I hate that thing.  Don't buy a Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we should just wrap this up.  There's other news, but I hardly even want to go on because I think this is much more interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got a tippy.  I got a piece of crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Online ad spending by 2011.  See, now Jason would have some insight into this.  This is actually an interesting story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can give some insight into this.  This is e-marketing.  Well, the thing is, they're like, oh, online ad spending is slowing.  Yeah, but.  But, OK, it's slowing because the numbers are getting so huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's going to increase, they say, 29% next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Growth is slowing, but the numbers aren't.  Growth is slowing, exactly.  There's a big difference between slowing and growth is slowing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's growing.  It's going to continue to grow.  By 2011, e-marketer says $42 billion in online advertising.  But that'll only be a 12% increase for 2010.  And by the way, I have no idea how they could possibly know this.  We're talking five years from now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What they do is, I think they talk to marketers and they look at how they've shifted spending  and where they anticipate shifting spending.  And then they talk to the people who are selling ads so they can look at AOL and Yahoo and  Google and look at their historic rates and say, OK, Google grows 50% as fast and Yahoo  grows 7% and AOL grows 3%.  So they do it from both the buy and the sell side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can get pretty close to the number if you do enough work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess the question is, would you be nuts to launch a paper magazine or a mainstream  media property at this point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely.  All the ads moving away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's $42 billion?  What does that mean?  How does that compare?  Well, it's more than spending on radio.  There are people who are launching magazines and doing fine.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's always room for a great, great product.  But they're not launching magazines like they used to.  I mean, Conde Nast with Portfolio, most people consider that the last great magazine launch  because they used to launch 20, 30, $40 million magazines on a pretty regular basis a couple  of years.  They're just not doing that anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody's going to launch a new TV network.  Mainstream media doesn't seem like it's in too good shape, especially if you get this  kind of advertising money moving away.  I presume if it's growing online, it's growing because it's shrinking somewhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Most people think that radio is down, TV is down, outdoor is flat.  TV, some people argue, is flat.  But the growth online is so great that on a percentage basis, I think it's going to  keep taking share.  And where's it going to be, Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it going to be banner ads?  Is it going to be podcast ads?  What kind of advertising?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, video advertising is huge growth because it hasn't previously existed.  So on a percentage basis, it's going to seem huge.  But the most effective advertising online is direct marketing style, which means text  ads, which means typically search.  Google.  Yeah.  Text ads are the most effective for marketers because they can track them and they can see  them through to a transaction.  And they only pay by click.  So it's really easy for advertisers to spend money there.  As a matter of fact, what's hard is for them to spend a lot of money there because there's  a limited amount of inventory.  There's only so many people who type in Volvo S430 or something per day and everybody's  fighting over those same people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, now they don't want to pay for click.  They want to pay for action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And it's just arbitrage because if you move to that model, then that's affiliate revenue  and you can basically then charge more.  And if you sell a Kindle, I think you make 50 bucks or 40 bucks or something in the Amazon  affiliate program.  So 39 bucks, I think it is.  Yeah.  So if you make 39 and you can sell one every thousand out of every thousand clicks, well,  then you're making a $39 CPM.  It's incredible if you sell one out of every, you know, $2,000, $20 CPM.  It's still very respectable.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You like to challenge somebody to get those numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, when we did Weblogs Inc. and I was at AOL, we were RPMing revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'm talking about those numbers on the Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, on the Kindle.  Yeah.  Maybe not the Kindle.  Yeah.  No, but I certainly do all the associate links I can.  I mean, I think that's a very lucrative model actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Affiliate links work and comparison shopping engines work.  I mean, basically, every time there is a recession, that's when the TV and the radio and those  people, magazines are going to feel it because what happens is there's a flight to quality.  There's a flight to being able to track the stuff and that's online.  So actually people say, oh, a downturn is going to be terrible for the internet.  Downturn is actually better for the internet because when you're cutting budget, you start  with the magazines, then you go outdoor.  The things that are the least trackable are the ones that are cut first.  That's why I got out of the magazine business.  I was like, this is a disaster.  Makes sense.  Well, it's all their metrics are based on lies.  Like pass along in a magazine, like five people.  I mean, what they try to convince you is like a million people got PC Magazine.  Each PC Magazine was seen by five people and that means five million people saw the ad  on a page, page 128.  You know, it's like, that's a lot of leaps.  Whereas you're like, oh, here's your HP ad on Engadget or CNET.  You can tell exactly how many people saw it, how many people clicked on it.  Now you can tell if people were hovering over it.  I mean, it's to the point at which I think some people are getting too much data and  it's almost like they don't want the data anymore.  They're like, we get the idea.  You can tell us a lot.  You know, just give us more ads, give them for this price.  And because everything's sold in an auction format, it's very efficient.  You know, it's not like you're, you know that the price per click is going to be 19 cents  or 60 cents or whatever.  The market corrects.  So people are not going to overspend.  If it gets up to $3 a click for a Kindle, maybe people are not going to pay it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  We've got to have you on more often, Jason.  That was very, I understood that.  It made a lot of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You didn't ask about the Google Knoll project.  I thought that was going to be like a big...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Knoll's on the list.  You want to talk about Knoll?  Google's Knoll is an attack on Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What a joke this is.  This is why we probably shouldn't have talked about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why is it a joke?  I mean, I think it's frustrating to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wikipedia's got 2.5 million, something like 2.5 million pages.  What's Google doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why do they want to do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They got 75,000 people already, you know, that are committed to it.  So what's the point?  What is this going to, where is this going to go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think that's the question.  It's like, why did they do this now?  And there was an interesting thing I read on Danny Sullivan, who's really great, who  did search engine watch and now he's doing search engine land.  He does the Daily Searchcast, which is one of the best podcasts after Twitter.  And he said when he talked to him that they were saying, this is an experiment, it might  not even launch.  So what I think is they were testing the waters and they've gotten such a brutal response  back, you know, people thinking it's competitive, that I think they're not going to launch it  or they're going to go slow in terms of launching it.  Because if you think about it, what does it mean to publish?  It means to find a writer, pay the writer and get them distribution, right?  And if you look at what they're saying they're going to do here, they're going to find writers,  they're going to pay them and they're going to give them distribution.  And the only piece that's different than them versus, you know, Time Inc or Conde Nast or  Ziff Davis is that they are not owning the rights to the words.  Well, that's a very small difference.  And I think all the clients that Google has for their amazing ad business are going to  take this the wrong way.  And they're going to feel like Google is overreaching, which has been a couple of good blog posts  saying like this is too much.  And even if Google doesn't, you know, attack people with this or they don't do it too hard,  it feels like they cross some imaginary line in people's minds between being a platform  and being a content producer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I don't think they're going to be able to...  They don't want to be in that position.  That's the last thing they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  Look at the last time they did this was when they did Google News and they allowed people  who were subjects in the stories to then comment afterwards.  That lasted three seconds.  Yeah.  Holy cow.  The news people were like, what?  You're talking to the subjects of the stories we're writing?  You're in competition with us?  Maybe we should reconsider running Google AdSense on our sites.  And that's the balance.  When I went to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you know, I think maybe talking as a Wikipedia competitor, I think is maybe misunderstanding  it.  It sounds more like they just want to give experts pages.  In fact, they even say there could be competing pages on the same subject.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then the same way Engadget stole writers from CNET or Curated Talent, well now they could  say to the Engadget writers, why write for Engadget or Gizmodo?  Why don't you come here and we'll pay you directly.  And if your story is good, it gets to the top and cut out the middleman.  And it's that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is Google proposing to pay these guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  There's going to be headsets on it and they're going to give them the lion's share of the  AdSense.  And then it's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a second.  If you're competing for talent with Engadget, right?  Like if I was running Weblogs Inc. at the time, I would be like, whoa, hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But how is this different from Mahalo?  In a way, it sounds kind of like your model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, we're not writing full articles.  That's what Wikipedia does.  And we'll write like a little box on each search result on each guide, but we're not  writing full articles.  So we would probably link to this stuff.  You're paying people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we pay people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I believe we're paying.  It actually sounds more like it's going after you than it is Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't feel like it's going after me.  And I'm not really worried about...  Everybody in the Valley is like, oh my God, Google is going to compete with us.  I'm not really worried about competing with Google.  I'm not scared of Google.  They're competitors.  And so if they compete with us, that means they validate our market.  It means I can go raise more money and I can go head to head with them.  And it means there's a market there.  So it means it's flattery.  I do think that when I went to Yahoo and I went to Google when I was running Weblogs Inc,  Google would say to me, you might not want to work with Yahoo because they're competing  with you on these blogs.  And they would point it out.  I'm talking about the Google reps.  We're not in the content business.  Yahoo is.  So if you're partners with Yahoo, you're basically funding their content efforts to compete with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like me putting ads for Audible on my show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Getting it yourself.  Right.  And I'd be like, yeah, that makes sense.  So I'd go to Yahoo and I'd say, like, are you guys in the content business?  Like, no.  I'm like, well, what about like all these game sites you have?  Don't they compete with Joystick?  And I heard that you offered three of our Joystick bloggers jobs.  And like, oh, yeah, no, those are that's just aggregating stuff.  And we're just doing like a small thing.  It's not really a big thing.  I'm like, well, it's sort of a big thing if it's the same content and the same writers  and you're going after my writers.  So I told Yahoo I wouldn't work with them because they were trying to poach our writers.  Well, now Google, if this depending on how this is executed, they might be going after  New York Times writers.  Right.  What if the science writer from the New York Times says, I can write science articles all  day long, put them on Google and I'll make one hundred to three hundred dollars per article.  And, you know, I'll have this library of articles that I'll own.  I'll be able to write books based on it.  You know, this is when people get nervous about Google.  It'd be the same right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The New York Times science writers making more than that already.  And he probably has the rights to most of those articles to produce in books.  But not online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, you know, but I mean, pick a writer.  So maybe the New York Times is the highest end, you know, and Engadget certainly didn't,  you know, pull New York Times writers onto Engadget.  So maybe it's, you know, Engadget they're going after and CNET because Engadget certainly  interfered with CNET's business or Siff Davis's business.  So maybe all three of those people could see writers leave, you know, to go work on this.  But I think honestly, Google is a good company.  I think it's good people there and I think they're smart and I think they're not going  to use this in any kind of heavy handed way.  I want to wrap this.  They're good people and they don't do things to destroy other companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's interesting also how protective people are of Jimmy Wales.  I mean, I think that's part of the other side of the reaction to this is don't Wikipedia's  sacrosanct.  Don't go against Wikipedia.  Jimmy Jesus Wales.  Yeah, it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got in a couple of fights with him and I was like, this is like fighting Christ.  You can't win.  You can't win.  You know, everybody loves Christ.  Yep.  I'm like, who fought Christ?  I don't know.  You're the bad guy.  I'm the bad guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Listen, I'm the bad guy.  Hey, he's Jimbo.  You can't mess with Jimbo.  He's got the roll in his pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's got the roll, man.  He's got the roll and Jimbo's got the Bible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So did you hear about the COO of Wikipedia?  No, what happened?  Was a fel shot her ex boyfriend in the chest and was writing bad checks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that was a big story.  We missed that one.  It was on the blog, dvorak.org slash blog.  Look up Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'll find it.  We missed that one.  We missed that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We haven't covered the riser trial either, which is another, I mean, if we really wanted  to be the gossip column, I don't know why Valley Wag doesn't cover the riser trial more.  That's a gossipy story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but this Wikipedia thing is off the charts.  I mean, the person was the COO and was running the books of Wikipedia and had previously  been arrested like a half dozen times or something, once for shooting her boyfriend in the chest  with a shotgun or something.  And then also for passing checks.  And they hired her as a COO and didn't do a background check.  And the woman who's running it, who lives in France, was like, oh, well, we don't do  background checks in France.  I was like, well, dude, wrong answer, man.  We have LeWeb.  Whatever.  It's just like, really, truly incompetent.  To hire a COO with like, and supposedly the stories were in the Washington Post.  So if you Google the person's name, you would have found out about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What does it take to Google a name if you're going to hire somebody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, come on.  I mean, for a COO position, I mean, this is like one of the third, second or third top  position of the company and the nonprofit.  It's nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We also want to wish a happy birthday, 90th birthday today to Arthur C. Clark, the last  of the great triumvirate of sci-fi writers.  In fact, I should have made an Arthur C. Clark or audible pick.  There's some really good Arthur C. Clark stuff on audible.com.  He lives in Sri Lanka.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sri Lanka.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Audible.  I love audible.  90 years old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love Jason.  Thank you for giving, for making up for a last ad on audible.  I appreciate it.  Jason Calacanis is at Mahalo.  M-A-H-O-L-O.  Did I say that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  M-A-H-A-L-O.  I always spell it wrong.  Mahalo.  M-A-H-A-L-O.  Mahalo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Every time I put a link to Victoria, I spell it wrong.  I don't know why that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Veronica, you mean.  Your dyslexia is showing today.  It's a good thing that you listen to audible books and don't read books because audible  books can mispronounce the words or anything.  You just go right into audible.  You browse through.  They got their best of 2007.  Wow, you look at the best of 2007 right on their site.  It's a good year.  I could download five of these right now.  I might download about five of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's some good stuff on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because you go running, you're on a plane.  You could just have this stuff ready to go in your car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't sell them too much.  I think they're undermining our audience.  You could say on the subway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On the subway.  They're going to take their business over to him.  Maybe that's the plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is no him.  But I'm saying if you were on the subway, you could be reading the New York Post or  listening to some Radiohead or whatever, or you could be bettering yourself and becoming  a more worldly person.  Get on some of the classics.  Maybe catch up on some of those science fiction books that you were supposed to read and  did it.  to broaden your horizons and maybe become a little more intelligent and enlightened.  Audible, Audible, Audible.  We love you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Audible.  Audible.com slash twit.  They got two spots in today's show.  Thank you very much, Jason.  Audible.  John C. DeForegg.
