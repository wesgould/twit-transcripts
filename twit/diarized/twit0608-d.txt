Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A cto, I don't think we're missing half of the cabinet positions are unfilled. I don't know  I don't know what's going on, but it is it's pretty clear when you when you  Hear members of congress talk about technology some know some understand. I think ron wyden understands  Uh, there are some members of congress who are pretty savvy  and then uh, you know for better or for worse darrell issa who is  Is fairly tech savvy even though some of his policies I wouldn't agree with  um, but then a lot of them just really it's like they never even  Used a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I I really agree with that. I think the axis isn't right versus left. I think it's informed versus uninformed  As we've started looking into this policy, you know cyber security is national security issues  Nothing to do with republicans or democrats and we are massively vulnerable just because the people making these policies don't understand it  so, um, I think it's very patriotic for people that  Really have a passion for making better policy to step up and uh to you know, do public service great good for you

Transcript:  It's rampant. All right. Brianna is also a developer and a gamer and giant space cat.com  Is her company  A boston independent game studio  That's what we do. So I guess we might as well start with the political  Apologies to those who say I just want to hear about the new samsung galaxy s8. We'll get to that. Yeah, but uh,  I do think it's important. I'm hearing a lot of uh talk from normal people about this as well  Uh congress and that is the house and now the senate  Mostly along party lines approved a new bill that among other effects  It has actually a number of effects, but among other effects overturns a privacy regulation the fcc  implemented october of last year that prevented isps from selling your  information  to marketers, uh should point out  That you know, this is a very new rule. So it's not like we're making a big step backwards  This is like how it was last year. Let's say  Uh isps also include telecommunications companies like verizon  Sprint t-mobile and att they're your isp on your phone  Uh, and so there's some concern that isps  But this bill also does more brianna you probably should we will let you explain this bill prevents as I understand the fcc for making  Any regulations of this kind in future?

Start time: 486.48
End time: 531.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's exactly it and um, you know, it's it's a really disturbing bill  Uh, I think one of the strongest arguments for it is that you know, facebook and google kind of have a duopoly  on using your information to kind of market products to you and  You know their their argument was they wanted you know, verizon and other internet service providers in the mix  being able to get this information but the thing is if I um,  You know choose not to use facebook. I can opt out of that. I can't opt out of you know  Using an internet service provider  So, um, it's a really big violation for privacy and uh, you know  I can't be the only engineer that started looking at vpns this week  It's very disturbing to find out if I use a vpn i'm not protected not fully protected a lot of people

Start time: 531.14
End time: 551.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think there's a little some people are overly concerned if uh,  And and this is maybe fostered a little bit by the tech community the guy who created cards against humanity said oh fine  Then i'm buying a congress's search history and i'm going to publish it  This was never on the table that you could go to your an isp and say I want larry maggot's search history  They're not selling individual  well

Start time: 552.40
End time: 622.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Information, you know yes and no so I mean part of what they what they want to be able to do and what facebook and google  Already do is to target ads. So for example if I get an ad that's aimed at people in  Palo alto who are interested in technology. It's not necessarily that they sold that information but that they've aimed that ad to me  Somebody basically bought my demographic  But again to to repeat what you just said is that not only are facebook and google  Voluntary, you don't have to use either of those products  You can use duck duck go as your search engine if you want  But it's almost like the difference between a store having a you know a camera in the store  Versus the city having a drone following you your isp sees everywhere you go  They see what time in my case they see what time I go to bed  Because I use I use my my my iot system to turn the lights off at night  They're gonna soon be able to see what's going on. Literally. This is scary  I'm about to put in something under my bed, which will measure my wife's and my sleeping patterns  You can't get much more intimate than yeah, but who wants that?  The point is that nobody should have that information. Well, I guess you know  They can start marketing sleeping medication to me or but that's but that's not on the table

Start time: 622.76
End time: 675.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is not the kind of information isp's  Uh plan to sell verizon said that anyway, and I think that if they were to do that then I think we would see some action  um  What what what is mostly and by the way?  They also can't see they can see when you're going to google and facebook  But they can't see what you do with google and facebook because in both cases they're encrypt they're using ssl or tls to encrypt it  And now I kind of understand google has been pushing for https everywhere as has the eff  For some years google even says will rank you higher in search results if you are a secure site  Now maybe it makes a little bit more sense. We we did that with twitter tv  But it's not like I was worried that somebody was gonna you don't even have a login  What are they going to steal?  But now I understand that prevents the internet service provider from seeing what you're doing on that site  They can see that you've gone to google or facebook or twitter  But they can't see what you do on that site if you go to larrysworld.com the second article

Start time: 675.26
End time: 690.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'll see among other things an interview with uh, mignon's cliburn of the fcc with a democrat  But also is she still a commissioner? She's still a commissioner. Yeah, I also have a sidebar on there  Which is um how to protect yourself and of course using encryption sites is one tor browser with another

Start time: 690.86
End time: 697.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not sure i'd want to use a vpn all the time. It's an option  I mean, I don't use it doesn't it slow you down brian. I mean it slows you down a lot. I think

Start time: 698.40
End time: 753.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It does and ours technically an amazing piece this week looking at that protect yourself tor we all love tor  But you know you're locked into a very specific version of firefox. It has you know, vulnerabilities  So there is a way to look at it where that could make you even more unsafe in some ways  So, you know, I leo I I do have to agree with you  I think some of the the rhetoric around this has been a little overheated  But I think what really frustrates me is the pattern because you know now they're going to be collecting this information  In some ways i'm less concerned about verizon having this information to market to me i'm more concerned about them not  You know storing it properly not using proper info sec encryption and then people for nefarious purposes getting obtaining that  That's what i'm worried about because that really could be tremendous damaging to just ordinary americans  And it's it's just another thing that we're losing for our privacy

Start time: 753.98
End time: 827.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I also think that even though this doesn't change  The rules that much I mean given that that's how it was in september 2016. It's just the same as that  But it is more than that a signal  to these isps  That the that congress and and the government doesn't care what they do  And so in a way it's permission verizon got in trouble for the super cookie that they were putting on everybody's browser  If you were a verizon customer verizon was identifying you uniquely to every site you visited  And the site could then go to verizon and say well, who is that?  uh  Verizon got in trouble. They got the fcc went after them. They got a judgment against them a  A slap on the wrist 1.7 million dollar fine  Uh, and they were prevented from doing that that that ended the super cookie, but that's not going to ever happen again  And i think verizon is going to say  It's open season now on our customers. The other thing that bothers me  Maybe erin you want to comment on this is it feels like our congress?  It's got the telecommunications industry is the number one donor to congress by far it's been a lot of money  But by individual congress person they sold pretty cheap in a few thousand dollar contribution and you got that vote  They don't care about consumers

Start time: 828.34
End time: 883.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean what I think is kind of noteworthy about this entire thing is that I agree with briana that some of the  Rhetoric has been a little bit overblown. It seems like some of the headlines i've been reading  It's like people are melting down like they sold you out  but I think it's  important that people are finally getting freaked out about  Their data because there's been so many every time there's a new retailer that gets hacked or yahoo gets hacked  People maybe change their passwords  But they don't really change their behaviors or think that much about their own personal privacy  And they don't really push companies to be more secure  It's it's kind of one of those people shrug and say well  Yeah, I guess we're all kind of vulnerable and we can't protect ourselves  So that's how it goes  And I think the fact that people are starting to pay closer attention to this and realize that they that they need to take action  Is is good?  So the freaking out is maybe needed and I also think that we're going about it's data retention

Start time: 883.76
End time: 923.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean if they're if this is a valuable resource to the isp's and they start warehousing this data  That makes it all the more vulnerable to hackers and also governments and I use governments with an s in the end  plural getting access to this data of ours, so I think it's more than just  Commercial privacy its safety security and protection against government intrusion  That concerns me about this and also why you know, it's it's sort of like the network neutrality debate  I mean, it's true that this law didn't change anything on day one  But what's the point of going in there and killing this particular fcc regulation who benefits?  Besides at and t verizon comcast and the other large well, let me make the argument that that

Start time: 923.82
End time: 979.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The congressmen who and women who voted against it or voted for it?  argue  Brianna you mentioned one argument and an argument horizons brought up which it levels the playing field google and facebook have this data regulated  By the fcc washing your isp, but I I think we've shot that one down  The other argument which is a larger argument and and is a philosophical argument is that the government shouldn't be regulating the internet at all  that the free market should  Control this and it's true if you had a choice of an isp who promised not to do this  Most people would choose that we that's my our isp here doesn't it's sonic net  But uh, my isp at home is comcast. I can't get sonic net at home  And most people in this country don't have that kind of choice, but from a purely  philosophical point of view, I I don't i'm not sure I disagree that  Government regulation the internet is is fraught with peril  And if we could get a free market and real competition going that would be preferable

Start time: 981.14
End time: 995.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's very difficult to do because last month  You know, um, I think I do believe the government has a role to play in facilitating this  I think one of the reasons, you know, we're hesitant to do this is because congress is so inept at

Transcript:  Forming a policy. They don't understand the internet. They shouldn't be regulating the internet, but they're not regulating the internet

Start time: 1000.64
End time: 1020.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're regulating the the virtual monopoly or all or you know duopoly  That is running wires to your house. I mean comcast and at&t they created that duopoly by the way  Yeah, they're the only two providers that I can get where I live is comcast and at&t  So it's not like I get to go through the yellow page and to pick. Oh, i'm going to get this isp  Because they've got great privacy if I could that'd be fine. No problem

Start time: 1021.42
End time: 1073.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I I think i'm gonna yeah, I think I would add this. Um, I think particularly at the infosec  This is not the kind of problem that the marketplace can solve because neither the seller  Nor the buyer is interested in spending the money, you know consumers we can  As technology people we can believe that there's gonna be a magical future where  You know ordinary people care about vpms and stuff. It's not pragmatic and then you know for a company like verizon  It is to their economic benefit to collect as much data as possible  So the only safeguard this pragmatic I can see on privacy is government regulation  And it's it's exactly like you said leo they are these congresspeople their votes are being bought for pittance  And you know if i'm elected i'm not going to take money from these people  I just I couldn't do it ethically and I think um, I think they shouldn't take money either if they're regulating it

Transcript:  of course that was uh  very brief candidacy  Of um, what's his name larry the guy who created the creative commons. Oh larry lesig lesig  Yeah, his very brief candidacy. Unfortunately, he kind of got out of the race too early  What his whole plan was which is crazy?  Uh larry is a a constitutional lawyer. He created the creative commons. He's a brilliant thinker for a long time  He was fighting against drm, but then he realized none of this is going to ever work  Until we get money out of congress and his whole plan was to run for president  Get elected have to choose a really good vice president run for president get elected  Oh completely change reform campaign finance so that there's no private money at all in campaigns  And then resign and let the other guy run the country  I wish larry had won but larry didn't get stand a chance. Uh, here's a full page ad from uh,  The fight for the future.org, which is one of many this was a a group that started with the sopa debates a couple of years ago  Keep our net free.org and save broadband privacy. Dear. Mr. President. You just got spied on big league  You know what it's like you really do don't subject us all to the same bull hockey  This is your chance to prove if you're with the money or with  The people aaron is that really the the choice that congress made with the money or with the people

Start time: 1161.34
End time: 1191.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean I think part of this is that  And this requires congress standing up to these companies and saying no you're a utility. I'm sorry  But that's what you are. That's what you have to be treated by as investors  And that's the obligation that you have to your customers  They do not want to be utilities because because that is not a great business. It's a very low margin boring low growth business to be in  um  And until until that happens they're going to be pushing more and more into the data and content business

Start time: 1192.06
End time: 1247.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, we're going to have that in the next couple of weeks on twitter  Title two will absolutely be one of the top stories because the new chairman of the fcc agit pi has already said  That we're this title two was the way the fcc did regulate net neutrality. The president has also already said he's not in favor of net neutrality  This this rule will be thrown out and it'll be thrown out soon  I don't know if agit pi could do it with a stroke of a pen if the president has to do it if congress has  Congress has to do it, but there's absolute consensus that this regulating  Isp's as utilities is not going to work, which means that's that was the only mechanism that the  FCC had to regulate net neutrality net neutrality is out the window. I think it's safe to say over the next few months  All regulations protecting consumers on the internet are gone  It appears that way should consume but is it a hair on fire moment? I mean should  I hear a lot of people saying i'm gonna i'm gonna use a vpn. I don't

Start time: 1248.50
End time: 1262.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not gonna use a vpn. I don't think the vpn is the solution  I mean, I think if you it's an option that people can have I use them when i'm overseas  For two reasons when i'm on an open access point. I use them when i'm in russia  I use them when i'm in china and I and I hope I don't have to add america

Transcript:  When you're in turkey and you want to use youtube and aragon just banned youtube, which is what happened to me  I needed an isp when i'm in russia and I know for a fact that they spy on foreign visitors  I use it use a vpn  Um, but the point is that we shouldn't have to do that  I mean that that's I think you know the point that uh that briana made and I agree we shouldn't have to resort to extraordinary means

Start time: 1292.30
End time: 1332.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think you should I I hope people will run for office alongside me  But um, you know, I think net neutrality without net neutrality. We really don't live in a free society  You know and i'm i'm not somebody that wants to say this is a hair on fire moment, but uh,  You know like we've seen the way this administration talks about, you know internet issues and they clearly do not even understand the basics  So, um, I think it's a very very serious situation and um, you know, that's a lot of why i'm running for office again  It's not right versus left. It's informed versus uninformed  And I think you'd be very hard pressed to find a journalist that doesn't strongly believe in net neutrality or an engineer

Start time: 1332.52
End time: 1360.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And brian, I also don't think it's regulation versus non-regulation. I mean certain things you don't want congress to regulate like content, right?  Yeah, we don't want congress regulating speech, but there's a difference between  Enforcing privacy regulations, which the federal trade commission supposedly does anyway  Uh, and and other kinds of things like net neutrality is not the same thing as controlling the internet not controlling what you and I can say  Over the internet, so I think we just have to be smart about how we regulate and not have this attitude regulation good regulation bad

Start time: 1361.06
End time: 1427.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just more nuanced than that. You know, there's a there's a twitch broadcaster in germany  That has just germany has required him to get signed up for a broadcast tv license because he's a broadcaster  And that's the kind of regulation that would scare the hell out of me. I don't want the fcc to start regulating podcasting  Yeah  So I think that you can't overreach as well  right, so i'm not i'm i'm mixed I remember we talked to john perry barlow when the eff was  Debating, you know how it wanted to protect net neutrality eff board agreed net neutrality needed to be protected  But a good number of the board members didn't think that government interference was the right way to do this. I  I don't know what the right way is to do this. Um  There if you look at it's look  We fetishize free markets in this country as a religion and I don't think that's necessarily bad  But there are some things free markets don't do well  And that's why we have anti-trust rules any monopoly rules because free markets tend to often  Run into monopolies and as soon as something's a monopoly there is no free market

We're currently getting do you guys remember the mariah botnet last year?  Which took down a huge amount of internet on this coast  Yes, what's really shocking to me is one of the um, the republicans on the um, you know  The technology subcommittee in congress that I may be working with. Uh marcia raybird  She came out and blamed the mariah botnet on sopa  She blamed it on  Poverty  Gizmodo had the headline. This is the kind of idiot that's in charge of you know, regulating the internet  It was beyond fair so I I agree with you leo  We can have a a reasonable conversation about that  But the more my campaign gets down and really studies the sausage being made by the technology subcommittee  It's it's just stunning to me and this is it's not the conversation that they're having  It's just a free-for-all giveaway with the people that donate to their campaigns  And it's is just tremendously disturbing.

I don't think silicon valley is is  I agree with you brianna. We want people to understand technology, but I don't think technologists necessarily are the right people to run the government either  You know, I think there's a technocratic point of view that well  We know how things run and we're going to fix this all and i'm, not sure that's right either politics is  Is a is a lot of there's a lot of art  And a lot of compromise and a lot of negotiation and and technologists are not noticed

Um, I work with plenty of lawyers in my career, but there's um,  You know just having congress so hyper sampled from that group. I think it leads to a suboptimal outcome  So it's not just I want more, you know  Technologists running for congress. I want more georgia dow she'd be a great congresswoman if she weren't canadian. She comes from a therapy background  I want more academics. I just want more  people with different perspectives coming and representing themselves in government because I think um, you know,  Clearly the system we have right now is not working.

Transcript:  Well, no, I think we'll go with the more secure. Um, I think it's a gorgeous phone  I'm a little worried about the um, the less um, the lower battery size in it  Like they did go very conservative with battery tech this way this time understand  I wonder why yeah  I should say the curved display  The samsung galaxy edge is a more beautiful phone  But I think people don't understand that when you're actually using it it picks up glare and it's just very awkward like no

Start time: 2172.88
End time: 2176.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks pretty but it's not practical and if you have a case on your phone you kind of destroy that anyway

Start time: 2176.84
End time: 2229.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean the case, you know the edge cover that so what I was excited because so they're making two models the s8 is  5.8 inches screen size and the s8 plus is  6.2 inches but I was excited because they've gotten rid of the bezel the and I checked the measurements the s  Eight plus the bigger 6.2 inch screen is the same physical size of the phone as an iphone 7 plus which is a five and a half  inch screen because there's no there's you don't have all this wasted space it is weirdly tall  so  LG did this with their new g6 too  They're doing these tall phones so that you can use one hand  If it's too wide and ike actually couldn't do the s the apple 7 plus with one hand  But there were these are narrower taller phones  So, I don't know and they're getting rid of the of the fingerprint reader on the front  They're going to put that on the back right next to the camera so you can smudge the camera the pixel has this

Start time: 2229.70
End time: 2235.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have it on the back. Yeah, the pixel is in the right spot  I like it so I could just like samsung's going to put it up by the camera. Oh, yeah, that's not so good

Start time: 2236.24
End time: 2300.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and then and then  They'll have a capacitive button. Although there's an option. There's apparently something physical under the screen so you can press the screen really hard  There'll be a home button there. That's dopey. I'll turn that off right away. Apparently you can  uh, and then  One more thing that is a little controversial they've added  The iris scanning which is very secure that was in the note seven  I had that for about a week before I had it in but I liked it  It was a little slow you had and you had a position to just write  But it's more it's as accurate as a fingerprint reader because your irises are as unique as your fingerprint maybe even more so  They're going to have the fingerprint  Uh, and then they're also going to have face recognition and all the videos we've seen is like this. It's instant boom  unfortunately  Somebody at the at the at the show on wednesday brought a picture of themselves or actually took a picture of themselves with their phone  This is very this is intrepid journalism and then was able to unlock the s8 with a picture of themselves  On a phone so it means it and even samsung says it's not the most secure. It's not secure at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's some apps that do this on the uh, my banking app usaa uses face recognition  But they say in the process blink now blink you gotta see yeah, they gotta see the movement. Yep  This is a windows machine. This uses windows. Hello and windows and it's  If it's a windows hello face recognition capable machine, they don't just have a regular camera  They have a depth sensing camera like on the connect and that uh can tell if you're you know  If you're a human if you're in three dimensions and they can also the way these face recognitions work  They they measure like distance interpupillary distance and length of the nose  But they can also mention now measure the depth of the eyes, you know  How big your mouth is if your ears are?  In the back of your head in the front and so that's more accurate and probably less, uh, easily spoofed. I would assume

End time: 2386.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So my big question with it is touch widths, you know  This is kind of infamously the issue with samsung phones and what I found really frustrating is you know  Like apple has stolen so many designs from you know samsung  I want to see them do reachability where you double tap and it moves down the screen on um, you know  One of the bigger ones. Oh, I use it all the time. Yeah, I turn that off because it confused really

Start time: 2386.72
End time: 2420.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh my goodness. I even had people call me say, I don't know what happened my screen slipped down  How do I fix that?  Apple does that all the time they add features like that that people forget about or never use  Yeah, you use that huh? I use this. Yeah  Yeah, how about three?  Yeah, it drives me crazy because you know, I want to on my iphone I want to press and hold the icon to erase it  To get it to go jiggle jiggle jiggle  And it never jiggle jiggle jiggles. It always does 3d touch and pops it  It's like you have to do it just right to get the jiggle jiggle jiggle. I hate that  Yeah

Start time: 2421.60
End time: 2457.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like that. I'm starting to sound like rages philbin. I'm sorry  I I do like the 3d touch where you can use as the cursor  Because I said like my iphone 6 plus or 7 plus is like the that's what I do all my email on right?  So I I think that's really you don't use a computer for email  I you know when you're running for office you spend so much time out there going to churches and  Just different events like it's really hard like I have a you know, the standard macbook  You know like the 12 inch one they made I bring it with me  But I do most of my work on my iphone these days.

Wow. I'm so impressed brianna  It's fine. People don't know this running for office is so much fun  You get to talk to people all day long you hear their stories you learn about what their hopes and their dreams are  You learn about their families.

All right  But it was frustrating for me and I I think you know if these if these silicon valley people end up running for office there  I think frankly president trump is starting to get a little like this is not what I thought it was

It's acceptable  That's that's just called salesmanship, right? And he's clearly a great salesman  But it's a little different when you're president united states and you say there were 80 million people in my inauguration  You can't it doesn't it does you can't say that you have to start  Kind of  Hewing the lines a little bit closer to fact

Transcript:  Go ahead briana  Local politics is just a little bit different because I think you know the presidency that's the entire nation  What i'm finding is local politics is a lot more. Um, you're talking to people that need  Very specific things allocated in the budget for their businesses to survive. I'll give you an example. There's a um, uh, uh,  Company out in district eight that's looking at vehicle to vehicle communications, right?  Like obviating crashes by laying vehicles like talk to each other so they don't um, you're getting information  That involves regulatory  Apparatus like making it free for them to do that. So I think um, I I do agree as an engineer  I think it's going to be frustrating in some ways  But I also think like um, I think that this last election has really made a lot of people realize like people had never  Thought they could run before that maybe it's time to get involved there  And you know, I think every day about how I can't let this change me  I can't let this change who I am and what I stand for the biggest  You know tragedy wouldn't be losing a race. It would be letting this process change me losing yourself  Right. So if I go there for two years and I just can't do it and walk away with a clean conscience  I won't run again

Transcript:  All right moving on. Um  Um, actually, let's take a little break because there's there's there's more to talk about in every area of technology  I'm just gonna i'll let you guys have the rundown if there's something you feel like we should talk about i'm gonna let you  you pick  twitter's retiring the egg  Big story breaking news. Yeah  uh  We're not going to solve the uh, the harassment issues the abuse problems  But you'll be glad to know that the new anonymous icon on twitter is no longer an egg. It's a egg-shaped human

Start time: 2933.64
End time: 2959.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They put out a blog talking out their inclusive design decisions behind that with their thoughts no  What they really did?  So look go back to the page there like look at the figure they deliberately designed it  So it doesn't look like a man or a woman and they put a lot of thought into that. So, um, I  I appreciate iconography and I appreciate anyone that puts a lot of thought into that iconography  But it's hard to not feel like twitter is attacking the wrong problem

Start time: 2961.64
End time: 3018.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But at the time the the problem is  Is so complicated for them to solve and i'm not saying that they have done a great job at even attempting it because they've clearly been  So much slower than all of their competitors, but I feel like until they have  Satisfied everyone which may be never any change that they make any product that they make is going to get that exact same reaction  like laughter anger  Making fun of them and also why haven't you fixed the bullying problem?  um, I don't know if they can if they can win they have such core users that  Expect the product to stay the same and be working exactly the the same way  Um that I feel like it's going to be hard for them to expand the product and change in any way  to appeal to a wider audience, which is what they're trying to do while also  uh  Piecing their core audience that doesn't want them to change anything

Transcript:  I've kind of come around a little bit on twitter. They seem to and brana  You'd be a more of an expert on this than me, but they seem to have done a better job of of uh, suspending accounts  Yeah, um, I I it used to take me sometimes a long time to get a account suspended  Um, they they respond a lot faster than they used to they do  Um, they do

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I feel like gender does not get the credit they deserve here  I mean I i've talked to them so often in back channel over the past few years  You have teams of people that are there working their butts off to solve this problem  And it's exactly it's like you guys said like they it doesn't matter what they do  They get critiqued on it  The iconographer the graphic design person designed that egg had nothing to do with twitter's harassment department  And their work is going to get blasted. So twitter is moving faster. They're making good decisions here  It's getting better and I do think they're held to a double standard versus somewhere like reddit  Where if you're getting docs from reddit, there's practically no oversight with that  So, um, I just I wish um, I wish people would give them credit for the work that they're doing because they're really  Making strides. It's part of my work with connect safety actually

Start time: 3090.88
End time: 3138.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  unrelated to the the what they're doing with harassment  They part of twitter's problem for the longest time has been that they were too beholden to their core users and too scared to make  any changes or to improve the product to make it more accessible to outsiders because  That people would freak out and so they would say okay  No, no, let's keep the product exactly as it is  whereas if you look at other social networks like facebook that are constantly rolling things out and just basically ignoring when users push back and complain  And that is how they've been able to attract a bigger audience along the way  I would actually argue that reddit is in the same boat there with twitter where they're afraid to change anything because their core users will  Really become angry and that's why the product is kind of confusing and looks a little bit dated compared to  You know some of their contemporaries as part of my work with connect safely.org

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm on their trust and safety council and anita sarcasian is on a number of the people who have actually been  Victimized by some of this harassment and they take it very seriously  I mean they have a staff of people who actually work really hard to try to up the game when it comes to bullying and harassment  There's pushback. No question about it  There's pushback from the engineers and others in the marketing people in the company  But it's a real struggle and and what people don't realize is when companies are dealing with these issues is that there's sometimes subtlety sometimes  What appears to be a good move from the standpoint of protection brings up issues when it comes to free speech  And there's a lot of tension back and forth irrespective of their economic it's pretty clear if people were forced to use their real identities

Transcript:  Uh that'll wouldn't fix this entirely, but it would certainly  Get rid of mitigate a lot of the problems. I mean facebook doesn't have nearly the problems even google plus  Which used a real name policy for a long time and no longer uses it still remains a little bit better you disagree

Start time: 3192.92

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I will I think you'd I I don't actually think that  The real names makes that much of a difference if you look at facebook live videos  we do a lot of them at fortune and  The kinds of comments that people are willing to make with their real names and photos attached are can be just as horrific  And harassing as what you can find on twitter  the problem is just that you can't make if facebook decides to delete your account or or  Sort of take action against you. You can't really easily make a new  Uh a new profile like you can on twitter

Transcript:  Yeah, I have to agree with you and the uh, you know the academic research absolutely backs that up  We all think anonymity is a really big predictor of this science shows that it's not  so  Uh, I just uh, I also think we tend to talk about it from a very american-centric  viewpoint if you're locking in people's identities think about you know situations like in egypt where twitter  Played a really big part in the um, you know the uprising against the government  You know, there's a downside like engineering is all about trade-offs and every time we talk about one of these policies  There's a trade-off about it. So, you know, we gotta think about it

Start time: 3262.12
End time: 3291.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But so okay, so i've always been coming from and I guess i'm wrong from the point of view  that uh  You know there is the free speech  Argument and the free speech wing of the free speech party which twitter has always claimed to be  It's strike it always struck me that 4chan reddit and twitter  Really became cesspools because of the anonymity there and they're very kind of uh  Dogmatic support for free speech, but but but that's not reflected in the numbers

Start time: 3292.98
End time: 3328.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, the science shows it's not I honestly I think more than um that the really big problem nowadays is bots  Um twitter is overrun with bots frequently from russia  Um, we're seeing very deliberate, uh social manipulation with this  Uh, there are a lot of really great articles out there about how they do this on reddit as well  But there's um, you know nowadays you can  Write bots with these talking points which are kind of simplistic and you can just have them going  And flood people's conversations and really make it seem like there's public pressure for something when there's not so you think bots are

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. What can I say? You can only add seven people. I don't know. That's hysterical a super canoe  I thought it's confusing because  You couldn't really tell on mobile updates if it's a direct message or if someone's responding to you publicly  Uh, you really have to be looking closely and I get I have open dms  I get a lot of spam sent there and I couldn't tell if someone's trying to give me a news tip or if it's just  random teenager

Start time: 3610.24

Start time: 3626.62
End time: 3638.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So a canoe was when you'd have at reply at reply at reply at you know  You have a lot of names, but now that they don't count against 140 characters. There's no limit  To how many names you so a super canoe could have hundreds of that

Start time: 3640.14

End time: 3678.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I I was happy to see them do it. It's a new way to spam  Yeah, it is but they also had the mute conversation feature which they finally added that so, you know  I was added to the super canoes is just click a button and it's gone. I'm i'm happy to see them  Addressing the core usability issue with twitter because it's just it's  Impenetrable for normal people and I just think this is another thing that you know  It puts the replies to any tweet right underneath it and I think it's a big step up

Start time: 3678.90
End time: 3696.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that was one of the reasons that it was impenetrable is because with only 140 characters  You really had to make it  Super succinct. I said right and i'm not I mean i've been on twitter since 2006 and I still  Felt like sometimes I was having a stroke when I was reading twitter. I would I don't understand these words

Start time: 3696.90
End time: 3705.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 3706.14
End time: 3712.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Your first mistake is trying to say something complicated  Yeah, I find it a great discipline though

Start time: 3713.20
End time: 3732.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it is is to take something long. I write I write it long, right?  And then I play with it and I think there is a certain skill to making a coherent  And I always attempt to be coherent like give context. I mean I try to make my responses  Like you could read them and and understand them not like you were having a stroke and what is this word salad?

Start time: 3733.80

End time: 3783.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But actually that's why that's why twitter is wise to be rolling out  aggressively rolling out features that make the  product more usable for the everyday person because right now people want to be on twitter more than ever to see what's going on and try to  like  Be following the day-to-day news, which actually, you know changes by the hour  So it makes sense. Hopefully I don't know. I don't think this was reflected in their year-end numbers, but hopefully next quarter  Um, you know, it will lead to a boost in users or at least engagement for them

Yeah. Anyway, Dana boyd. Let's talk about her article. She's saying the fake news problem is more  nuanced and complicated  right, uh  than people recognize we should first  Uh mention who dana boyd is sure she's at microsoft research for years though.

Start time: 3985.80
End time: 4028.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and and by the way, it goes way back. I mean  The term fake news entered our vocabulary or sometime this fall, but we've had urban myths. We've had urban legend  We've had you remember the story about how the post office was going to charge five cents per email  That was circulated for years bill gates was going to give you money, right?  And then mark zuckerberg wanted me to pay him six bucks a year for a private account  So long before the word fake news came out  I've been writing about these urban myths and and was it some of the times they make up congress people the the uh,  This email scam the the five cent email there was a congress person who was gonna you had to write to he didn't exist  So there's nothing new about these these  There's a little difference. Oh, there's no there's changes. Absolutely

Start time: 4028.86
End time: 4041.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But and also the people who created those fake news stories did it for the walls not for money, right?  Or for political gain exactly they were just messing with you, right? But the difference is people would fall for it and spread it

Start time: 4045.50
End time: 4073.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, exactly and those stories are easily debunked by snopes  Uh or any kind of fact checking website  but what she seems to be talking about is ones where they just really twist the context around or kind of change the  The framing of the story in a way that there's at least a shred of something true in there  So it can't be completely debunked, but it's just the interpretation of it. And that's what will be really hard for  editors or algorithms to police

Transcript:  I think there's a there's a there's a tendency i've noticed in the tech industry that male engineers tend to  Really?  Believe in technical solutions to social problems and a lot of these are human problems  They can only be solved through curation, but I think anyone that's talking about the fake news  Subject and they're not talking about themselves. I think they're really going in the wrong direction  I am vulnerable to this right like a story comes across my feed and it you know has some sexism scandal  Like, you know, I want to click on it, right? I want to believe it and we have to  Take responsibility in ourselves  To kind of take a step back  So what i've tried to do is you know, especially because you're running for office. I talked to conservatives every single day  And you know, I do make it a point to read reputable conservative news sources now  And I will not click on links from certain publications like raw story just because it's it may be sensational, but it's not  quality journalism  So I think that all of us have to realize that social media  really  exacerbates the most  Instinctual parts of our personality it really taps into that and we're really getting into this  world now where people are not subjected to viewpoints on the other side and it's not healthy for me  It's not healthy for anyone

Start time: 4161.94

It doesn't mean you have to  Know for absolute certain that there's no inaccuracies in the story  But if i'm going to even like something I want to know that that there's some credibility behind it  and you're absolutely right that that it's much more subtle than than pure fakeness because people tend to  Get opinion and fact mixed up or they tend to have some some fact and some fiction  So it's harder to kind of say and that's one of the things that facebook is struggling with  And why what they're calling it now is disputed versus fake because it's hard sometimes to know that this is completely fake  and and

Transcript:  So maybe this is just an example of that my wife and I used to get in fights whenever the kids would cry  I'd show up with a band-aid  She'd show up with a couple of arms with hugs, but so it's funny  I mentioned earlier that i'm working on this parents and teachers guide to media literacy  And on wednesday i'm going to be interviewing mark bracket who and and robin i can remember last name who run the gale center for emotional intelligence  And this was a suggestion of a friend of mine said you need to think about emotional intelligence and social emotional learning  As part of the battle against fake news because why is this successful?  It's successful because it stimulates some kind of an emotional response  So is it some sort of introspective understanding of yourself of yourself and what motivates people to react and it's not whether a story is true  Or not. It's how a story affects you my initial propagandists to some degree  My initial reaction is mr. Fix it was to think oh, it's all about media literacy  And then it really went off in my head. It's also about emotional intelligence how we respond if you look at  At the success of any demagogue and I won't mention names, but we know one one particular one  What they're good at is getting people riled up  And and whether they're using truth to rile them up and sometimes that works or mixing truth and fiction  It's all about getting that emotional response. So we have to think that through

Transcript:  I I really it falls into epistemic closure  What's a psychological phenomenon where you have something it feeds into your belief system and confirms it there?  We are all susceptible to that  but I think it's really worth saying if I uh go and make a tweet tonight and I  Tweet a really thoughtful new york times article on like budget negotiations  That's not going to get as much feedback as if I you know talk about some, you know sexist scandal in the um,  In you know in the technology industry and it's just like the very model of social media  Really rewards us going to what you know, my friend georgia dow calls the loudest argument  The human mind is it is attracted to the extreme of any argument?  You know, it's why we see movies like going more violent or more sexy or more explosions  You know, we always want to go further and I think uh social media is just amplifying some of the worst tendencies in human behavior

Transcript:  Did I miss something no, I think that's exactly  Yeah, that's it  She says the puzzles made visible through fake news are hard. They are socially and culturally hard  They force us to contend with how people construct knowledge and ideas  Communicate with others and construct a society  They're also deeply messy revealing the visions and fractures and beliefs and attitudes  And that means they're not technically easy to build or implement if we want technical solutions to complex  Sociotechnical issues we can't simply throw it over the wall and tell companies to fix the broken parts of society that they made  Visible and help magnify. I really like that. It's it's not that these companies invented fake news  They just made it visible and help magnify it  We need to work together and build coalitions of groups who do not share the same political and social ideals  To address the issues we can all agree are broken  I don't know if we have any much agreement these days anymore in in what's broken, right?  Otherwise, all we're going to do is try to wage a cultural war with companies as the intermediary and referee  And that sounds like a dreadful idea. I completely agree with her  I mean she articulated something i've thought for a long time but wasn't able to articulate as clearly as well  So I was very grateful for this article. I think that's exactly right, but you're right. Erin. It doesn't solve it. Does it?

Transcript:  Uh, no  No, I mean, yeah  It makes me think uh back to what I feel like maybe was at the heart of why facebook was so  Redisant to  Take responsibility for the fake news problem, which was the accusations that they were suppressing conservative news outlets  And they had that I guess coalition of conservative voices that came and basically complained  And then you know zuckerberg said don't worry. We're gonna we're gonna make it better  But I sort of wish that that had happened with both sides present  Or at least people from kind of all the stakeholders because maybe that would have uh, you know led to facebook  uh taking more responsibility for this earlier and uh, you know working on the problem before the election

Transcript:  Let me throw a theory at you and see what you guys think of this  uh, you know until  Recently media was controlled by a small group of people right and you and I come the good old days come from that good old days  And uh, there was a there was kind of a lid  Right placed on the power of media. We've seen it and I think some of this is a reaction believe it or not  To world war two and nazism where media was really used effectively  To manipulate a large audience and to really have horrific  effects and I think that the media people who grew up in that era the edward r murrow's of the world were  Really understood that the dangerous power that particularly television  Uh had and kept a lid on it, right?  They were very careful about it  Then what happened when we got into the new internet era was we all got access to media  We got access to twitter and to facebook and to youtube and everybody was creating media  Without any of this knowledge or understanding of the risks that media brings  And so what we've really created in facebook and twitter, particularly youtube somewhat is a megaphone for emotional  You know  Anger and feelings and strife  And these have become really well tuned megaphones for our feelings  And as a result, I mean, yeah, sure. There's a lot of intellectual and but nobody reads that crap  It's all about the as you pointed out brianna the stuff that gets you good  And so we've in effect  And and and I think you know, this is this is the what happened with the internet sad to say  I was really excited about the internet at first because I thought this is going to give everybody a voice  It's the ultimate democratizing medium  But what I forgot was that the kind of voice it gave people ultimately could be very destructive because it's so emotional

I as you know, I work with cbs news and i'm very proud to be associated with this company  Which dates back edward armer the tiffany network, but you know, it's when walter not anymore. Well  Yes, and no, I mean I there is a very very strong premium sure  Is true, you know at fortune and all the media companies a very strong premium on accuracy  I mean you'll be fired for right for knowingly lying or reckless disregard for the truth and an error a mistake is extremely embarrassing  Right and and if you make too many of those you get fired from that as well  And so there is a culture of trying to be accurate. I think in mainspring and it's being buried  It's being buried and it's also being ridiculed and it's being denied. I mean when when when trump goes around calling  Us and I put all of us I I do want to say one thing

Transcript:  It's a mistake to blame trump for this. Maybe this is well, he's articulating it  This is I think this is the consequence perhaps at least short term right now  So but I don't want to blame him for this  He is the beneficiary of something that has been brewing for a long time, right?  Yeah, and it won't just be donald trump. This is going to be all over everywhere. It's gamer gate  It's all the harassment that happens on these sites. It's the bullying. It's the live  Streaming video of people being tortured on facebook  That's what we're getting and I don't think you could say it's the republicans or donald j trump  It is the society we have created with our technology  But what I am saying though is that if we don't if we don't the entire profession of journalism journalism's dead.

Transcript:  I was just going to say I I do think that the left falls into this and I think that you know, there are some  Extreme right-wing outlets like bright part that don't take accuracy very seriously  I've been the subject of plenty of bad articles by these sites and you know, it's easy to pick on that  But the left absolutely has this problem. I can tell you as an absolute fact being a progressive and running for office  Anything I say that is this much moderate or gives a little bit of credence to the other side  I get attacked about that and it is entire society. That's really pushing us to the extremes  I I do have one  Very concrete suggestion that I think would make this better  And what I would like to see facebook and twitter and other social networks do is to rate the quality  Of certain sites and stories when they come out generally speaking if something comes from the wall street journal  I may not like their economic conclusions, but it's going to be well researched  And I would like to see that story come with a ribbon or some sort of um marker  Yeah, that that indicates is quality content. So I would like to see um, you know information from  You know wall street journal new york times la times those kinds of quality  News sources i'd like to see them like elevated in social media  Yeah, I would like to see on the left and the right some of these uh sites that kind of play to our internal biases  In epistemic closure, I would like to see them not get that so it just kind of gives people a baseline

Transcript:  for you know adding a marker to stories that are  trusted and of quality and the reason I think that facebook hasn't done that yet is because  There's this fear. It's kind of like the net neutrality argument like there is there's this fear that there's no room for a company like business insider  or a  end gadget or any sort of new blog to kind of come up and  uh and become trusted, uh, because  the journal and and uh  The new york times and all of the old institutions will just continue to hold on to their power  And facebook wants to be seen as neutral.

That's a microsoft surface studio  I want one of those so badly  But the reason I want it is because it has professional photoshop and illustrator and premier  And apple has really abrogated any kind of responsibility with leading the pro app market on the ipad  And you know, like there's a point where pages and numbers and spreadsheets it just doesn't cut it for pro users  And I just I think they had a really great product with the ipad pro  But they have um, they've not developed any of the software ecosystem around it.

It's got a long way to go. But you know in gsx my game studio  We've got oculus vibe, you know gear vr  We've looked at all of it and I feel strongly microsoft has the best product in that space by a wide margin

Transcript:  Is it because it's the best product or because they went for ar right and all the rest are vr  That's it. That's it. Yeah, and by the way, that's interesting to hear from a game developer  Because vr is a great gaming platform. So is ar  Yeah, not as great. I think ar has more potential in a lot of other realms as well  And when you're gaming, I think you want immersive. I don't think it's a problem. You can't see the world around you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Poor man's ar it's somebody made the case though, you know  Because everybody's waiting for apple to drop the other shoe on ar  And somebody made the case that pokemon go was actually very even though it's not really ar  It was very important in getting people to kind of accustomed to the idea  That they could see the street through their phone and there'd be a pokemon on it  Right. That's a first step in getting a uh, a customer's used to this idea  So here's the question  apple  You know, they're making so much money on the iphone. It's understandable  they might kind of let computing slip a little bit and focus on mobile and  but  Everybody's saying apple's putting all this money into ar that it you know, some say this year  I think the general consensus is next year apple will have a product an augmented reality product can they  Make that magic happen one more time

Start time: 6087.98
End time: 6151.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leo you've got to let me say this people don't talk about this issue with apple developing an ar product  and that is thinking about how  Extremely weak apple's 3d technologies are if you go into the iphone sdk and you look at the things they have  Built for 3d it is baby talk in game developer terms  Um, you know everybody out there is doing serious 3d work on the ipad like um, look at a vainglory  Probably the most gorgeous game on ipad that's made with the proprietary engine  Most people have like my studio goes to unreal because apple's tools are unsatisfactory  And look at their big gambit with metal metal is a great technology  But where's the software actually using it? It doesn't exist  So in the meantime, they've got this technology built on the open gl layer, which is very thick and inefficient  We see a 25 percent decrease in frame rate in using the exact same software on a mac  And then that same mac running windows will get 25 percent better frame rate because apple's implementation of it

Start time: 6151.80
End time: 6156.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Transcript:  So if they're going to be bringing this product out, they're gonna have to really get serious about 3d technologies interesting  I don't like they they blindsided us with swift nobody saw that coming  So maybe they have you know a group of people that are working to really build up apple's 3d technologies  But somebody that ships mobile games on apple devices. There's a reason we use  Uh unreal engines because apple tech doesn't love it everybody uses unreal engine

Uh, it's cross-platform, which is nice  It's cross-platform the reason they've gotten a lot of adoption is it's simpler and uh, they've done a really good job at reaching out to  Universities so a lot of students know how to use it  But you know, we prefer unreal because it's it's better

Start time: 6219.54
End time: 6238.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, maybe apple also suffered  This is an interesting somebody in the chat room suggesting the apple didn't have to worry about a 3d engine because you don't game so much  On a macintosh. Yeah, and so there was no pressure on them  To create something good and that that ended up hurting the tablet as well ios as well because they didn't have to develop these technologies

Start time: 6238.30

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Casual gaming. Yeah, but it is the most popular gaming platform in the world  That's what you develop for exclusively, right? That's true 40 of the profits our industry are on mobile devices  But you know this hurts apple in the long term look at the apple tv  I think it's really hard to look at that, you know product and not see it as a  failure because the the apps on it do not make money for developers and  You know, it's just not a great place for developers to go unless they're porting iphone games over to it. So, you know apple's  You know weak leadership in this area is really coming back to haunt them. I believe interesting now I have to point out android's no better  Uh, that's true.

Yahoo bought it  Which of course is the beginning of the end for many a great site in 2013  Yahoo shut up coming.org down, but that's not the end of the saga  then anny bio  Created a kickstarter campaign to buy it back  And revive upcoming.com.

But I think the bigger issue here is, you know oculus's launch was really  Blown in a way that really jeopardizes the long-term health of that company  And I say that someone that develops with vr oculus touch is the best product on the market for interfacing in vr  It didn't launch with it and launched after the fact if you have games like robo recall which are exceptional in the system  Which have not gotten any attention at all  Um, so you look at this with um, you know just problems recruiting developers  Problems of really getting a solid dev kit out there to people  Problems with you know, really getting a marketplace problems with attracting a user base and it just needs a new direction  So i'm happy to put all of my social differences with him aside and say someone's got to put take responsibility  To this blown launch with this very important product and I clearly think there's new leadership needed there
