Transcript:  A sad note.  We'll start off with a sad note.  The man who invented the at sign, Ray Tomlinson,  passed this weekend.  He was 74.  He had a heart attack.  He was way back at the days of the earliest days  of the internet at Bolt, Baranek, and Newman.  They were the.

Start time: 316.52
End time: 317.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've never heard of that before.  In Cambridge.

Start time: 318.10
End time: 353.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they were the consultant that ARPA went to to help them  create this thing called the internet, BBN.  And he was there.  And he created.  They were looking for a way to indicate email.  And he suggested the at sign, separating the username  from the host name.  You need to do that because you could have duplicate user names  and you could have duplicate host names.  But in theory, you'd have a unique username at host name.  And the at sign is a perfect, beautiful way to do it.

Start time: 353.92
End time: 373.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People who did not live life before the internet  don't realize that it used to be you only  saw the at sign on apples at the supermarket.  It was a price.  $12 at $2 each or something like that.  That was about the only place you ever saw it.  It was an archaic symbol that is now  like super important to everything  we do on the internet.

Start time: 373.84
End time: 381.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's really the only guy up there  on the top row above your numbers  that isn't used for anything.  But email.  It was a perfect choice.

Start time: 381.46
End time: 397.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not dollar sign, not percent.  Well, in fact, I remember I'm trying to remember the lore.  You might remember better, Harry.  But I remember there were others, symbols proposed.  I don't know if it was a fight, but it wasn't an automatic  that the at sign would be selected.  Now it seems like, of course.

Start time: 397.64
End time: 420.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So natural.  And it took a long time before we all knew about it,  of course, because even though he invented in 1971  for the longest time, if you were on America Online,  you could only send email to other people on America Online.  And there was no at sign.  And it wasn't.  Yeah.  There was no need for it because you were on IOL.  So it wasn't until the early 90s that kind  of normal consumers who were not academics  are involved in the government got access to it.

Start time: 420.76
End time: 427.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, MCI mail.  You just had a number.  CompuServe.  CompuServe number.  Who remembers your CompuServe number?

Start time: 431.58
End time: 432.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 435.78
End time: 436.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You remember your password?

Start time: 436.68
End time: 455.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  CompuServe had really good passwords  because they had weird words separated by symbols.  And that was actually, it turns out,  that's a pretty good password.  My one password, the password manager I use,  just added a feature where you can  have a certain number of words in a chain separated  by symbols.  And I thought, oh, great.  CompuServe passwords.  They're back.

Start time: 456.30
End time: 460.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's password padding, basically.  That's what Steve Gibson calls the idea  of bringing that symbol in.

Start time: 461.18
End time: 466.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly.  And they're more memorable that way.  And that's why I can remember my CompuServe password  from 1983 or whenever.

End time: 494.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's interesting.  The ad sign.  You guys aren't dating yourselves or anything.  Yeah, no.  Somebody's got to date us.  Carbon date us.  The ad sign is called the Appenstaatsche in Dutch  for monkey's tail.  In Danish, it's the elephant's trunk or schnabel.  In Finnish, it's the kisant or cat's tail.  German, klammerafa or hanging monkey.

Start time: 494.68
End time: 495.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When was that invented?

Start time: 496.44
End time: 530.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, there's actually some debate over it.  Some think it's a symbol for the amphora, which  was a unit of measurement.  The terracotta jars that were used in the Greek times,  they can trace it back to the 16th century,  a Florentine trader who used the at sign in his books.  Others say the monks did it because they were lazy.  And they were trying to reduce the number of strokes.  So instead of writing out A-T, they  would write A with a little curly Q.  So history doesn't tell us where it began.

Start time: 531.56
End time: 540.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's serendipitous because it has the right meaning,  at, user at host, but also that it wasn't used  or that it wasn't in common.

Start time: 541.28
End time: 542.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No competition, yeah.

Start time: 544.18
End time: 546.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's querty.  Was it always up there?

Start time: 546.76
End time: 550.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it was always on the, I remember it  on my typewriter keyboards.  I had to call my dad.

Start time: 550.22
End time: 552.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He was Smith-Corona.  He worked at the time.

Start time: 552.48
End time: 556.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's right, he's from Smith-Corona.  He didn't just use one.  He worked there.  He was one.

Start time: 557.00
End time: 560.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It gives you hope that the tilde or the care  at may someday become useful.

Start time: 562.16
End time: 576.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm trying to find, I can't, the history of using  the at sign in email.  I remember there were some issues.  I feel like it had a use in you.  There were some lesser uses in Unix or something as a,  oh, I know, maybe it was APL  or one of those weird programming languages.

Start time: 577.00
End time: 611.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, programming languages adopted it too.  Because in the early days of the computer,  they were just looking at the keyboard like,  we need more symbols, right?  Let's use, what can we use this for?  I remember learning BASIC and how the dollar sign to me  came to represent string variables  because AppleSoft BASIC, it was set name string to whatever  and the string was the dollar sign.  So it'll always be that for me.  Every symbol possible that could be used  for a programming language or anything like that  was used in the seventies.  They were like every part of the buffalo, you know?  It's like every part of the keyboard

Start time: 611.22
End time: 632.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  was used by those systems.  Everything but the squeal.  Ray also helped standardize the from field,  the subject field.  You had to have a to field.  He invented email.  He basically made email.  It wasn't just the at sign, it was everything.  So next time you use email, tip an old fashioned  to Ray Tomlinson, the godfather of email,  passed away at the age of 74.

Start time: 635.12
End time: 669.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I found a strange segue from the story of his passing  to the big story that's been the story of the year so far,  which is Apple versus the FBI,  which is I think what a lot of people came to this week  is that this is gonna mandate a certain level  of government development to come up  with their own technological solutions  and that's gonna be an infrastructure  and there's just gonna be huge costs associated  with getting the government up to speed  and it made me think of the investment  that the government made in ARPANET and DARPANET  and that we haven't seen anything of that scale since.

Start time: 670.84
End time: 676.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You really think that that's what is called for  is kind of a moonshot to solve this problem?

Start time: 677.90
End time: 691.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's just put it this way.  I just backed us into it.  Let's start at the beginning and see if we can get there.  That was my, that was, I saw the big picture in it  and then I realized let's do the news and let's get there  because I think that's the opinion  that's gotta come out of this group.

Start time: 691.08
End time: 712.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We don't need to of course go back  through the whole Tawdry story.  We will finally hear the court's decision on the 22nd,  which is two weeks from Tuesday  but it won't be the end of it  because whichever way it goes,  in the Department of Justice's favor or Apple's favor,  there will be an appeal no doubt.  It'll end up with the Supreme Court  if they choose to take the case.

Start time: 713.00
End time: 714.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it goes through the Ninth Circuit first, right?

Start time: 714.76
End time: 744.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's got a ways to go.  It's only with a magistrate right now.  But I think this is the question  that I would say is the real question.  Should there be in our lives somewhere so private  that only we can look at it?  Do we as people deserve to have it?  Focusing on the smartphone maybe is kind of misleading.  Should we as people have somewhere we can put stuff  that nobody, including law enforcement, can look at?

Start time: 745.08
End time: 746.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have that, that's called our brains.

Start time: 746.64
End time: 749.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it already exists as a space that's protected.

Start time: 749.90
End time: 756.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it holds so little in my case.  And it's unfortunately flawed  in its ability to recollect it perfectly.

Start time: 756.18
End time: 758.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, a smartphone is an extension to your brain.

Start time: 758.90
End time: 761.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If this were an extension of the brain,  do you think it deserves that kind of protection?

Start time: 765.08
End time: 784.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Chris Vance, who spoke at the congressional hearings  on behalf of all the state and local DAs,  he said that hundreds of years of jurisprudence  have given us the view that no vessel, no safe, no home  is exempt from a warrant.

Start time: 784.28
End time: 785.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Except your brain.

Start time: 786.12
End time: 786.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Except your brain.

Start time: 787.66
End time: 816.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that's an interesting question.  So nobody's proposing, I hope they don't,  you know what, they're not proposing it  because they don't have the technology.  Let's go forward in time, 20 years,  when the technology exists to read your mind.  And law enforcement says then,  well, there's stuff in there.  If we could read your mind,  we'd know if you were guilty or not.  OJ, if we could read OJ's mind,  we wouldn't have to have a trial.  We just find out.  And then they say to whoever is the apple  of the 22nd century, can you get us in there?

Start time: 818.26
End time: 819.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why is that any different from a polygraph?

Start time: 820.02
End time: 841.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Should they be allowed to do that?  But polygraph's not admissible in court to this day  because it's imperfect.  Well, then that's-  It's imperfect.  Let's say you could do a perfect mind read.  We're talking to the Supreme Court of 2050.  I'd say no.  I think that that's a line too far.

Start time: 841.32
End time: 842.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Self-incrimination, isn't it?

Start time: 843.22
End time: 846.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But that's what the Fifth Amendment  protects you against, right?

Start time: 846.78
End time: 849.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, okay.

Start time: 849.62
End time: 858.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I think that was a good point to make, Harry.  Because if this is an extension of the brain,  the smartphone is an extension of the brain,  should it have those protections?

Start time: 860.32
End time: 868.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Should it be private or not?  Well, arguing against my own case,  I mean, pen and paper have always been extensions  of the brain too.  It's just that it's way harder to lock up pen and paper  than it is-

Start time: 869.40
End time: 876.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, we're here because technology has given us a way  to take the part of our brain, put it somewhere,  and have it be invisible.

Start time: 876.66
End time: 878.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And technology is almost but not quite there.

Start time: 879.10
End time: 919.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It isn't, by the way.  And that's another story here, which is that the FBI,  if they wanted to, probably could hack that 5C.  Jonathan Zdarsky, who is probably,  there's probably no one more expert on iOS forensics,  is of the opinion, yeah, you know what, there's ways,  if they really wanted to.  They don't want to, they want to establish a precedent.  So let's not talk about that 5C.  That's not the important point.  The important point is, do we deserve,  do we need something, except for our brain,  besides our brain, that we can keep to ourselves private,  including keep it away from law enforcement?  And you're right, historically, law enforcement  with appropriate court authority has had access  to everything but our brain.  Is that right?  Is that accurate?

Start time: 920.34
End time: 926.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And our spouses, like you can't,  I mean, in terms of the self-incrimination thing.  Yeah, that's a good point, spouses' brains.

Start time: 926.62
End time: 969.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a really novel argument to suggest,  and I wonder if somebody will argue this at some point,  that this is part of the right to not self-incriminate,  and that the smartphone is an extension of your brain.  I love that!  I love that argument, too.  I'm not sure that it would actually ever work,  but I like the idea, because my wife's iPhone  broke yesterday, and she drove somewhere today  to pick up my son, and she said,  I'm out there and thinking, I'm an adult,  I can do this without a phone,  but we have offloaded so much of this work to our phones.  And so I think that's an interesting argument.  It seems unlikely to me that anybody's ever gonna go for it,  but I agree with that.

Start time: 969.94
End time: 989.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's more of an ethical argument than a legal one.  It is, we're not talking law here,  and of course, that's why the law makes  interesting provisions like the wife,  if you're just my girlfriend, you can incriminate me,  but if you're my wife, you can't.  That's just the law saying, kind of carving out  where those lines are in self-incrimination.  But at the very least.  We're not talking about law, we're talking about ethics,  we're talking about principle.

Start time: 990.06
End time: 1014.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and the existence of a safe space.  The very existence of what somebody called  a warrant-proof place, where there was a piece linked to,  John Gruber linked to it from Daring Fireball,  about this matter, and somebody said,  do we really think we wanna have a place  that's warrant-proof?  And the answer is, that place exists already.  It is in our minds.  It's not a novel concept.  Not everywhere is reachable, or should it be reachable,  by law enforcement.

Start time: 1014.94

Transcript:  I think this is much more interesting conversation  than the nitty-gritty of the decryption  that we've been going through for the last few weeks.  And it's not obvious.  I don't think, you know, you can,  if you're a technologist, people yell at me for saying,  well, there's more to this than just,  yes, we should have encryption.  There's lots to talk about.  And people get mad at me for not just, you know,  defending the right to encryption.  But I do think it's a larger discussion,  and when you kind of eliminate it from this  kind of technical discussion, but say,  is there somewhere else besides your brain  that should be private?  That's a tougher question to answer.

Start time: 1059.54
End time: 1085.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's much more than a receptacle.  It's a transmission device.  It's a knowledge center.  So I think it's much more complicated than that.  If you said I have my personal hard drive,  that is the extension of my memory,  and that is a separate being, it's like, you know,  there's a lot about separation in that  that may play into that metaphor.

Transcript:  Although, I mean, our knowledge base and our brain,  but if we say something, it's admissible, right?  And that's our transmission device.  I can make that argument.  Right, but then you can say that.  They can't force you to give up your password,

Start time: 1096.42
End time: 1127.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but they can force you to give up a hair for a DNA sample  or a fingerprint to unlock your phone.  I think you could make a pretty strong case  that this is separate, this is distinct from your brain.  This is your phone.  It's not your brain.  The fact that you willingly put all your brain stuff  in there doesn't somehow give it some special protection.  It's your own choice.  If you chose to do that,  I would argue that for purposes of law enforcement,  this smartphone should not be somehow specially protected.

Transcript:  Fortunately, encrypting things  that the government can't get to  is not illegal at this point.  The issue is the government wants the manufacturers  of systems that use encryption to have ways to get in  so that it's not just between you and your device,  but that there's a third party involved,  which is the manufacturer or the government.  And that's-

Start time: 1183.26
End time: 1185.48

Transcript:  Well, I mean, I think what would happen  if they made it illegal for Apple to make  an encrypted iPhone that Apple couldn't break into  at the behest of the government  would be that all the people who do have something  that they're plotting, like terrorists and other criminals,  would switch to third-party software  that could be compiled using known encryption  and would be encrypted in a way that Apple couldn't get at.  I mean, they would just move the game somewhere else.  It would be everybody else that's left  with the third-party broken encryption.  If encryption is criminal,

Start time: 1215.44

Most of the time they just tell us their password.  Right?  Crooks, for the most part,  what law enforcement deals with is not such bright crooks.  And if somebody is very sophisticated,  and unfortunately that tends to be terrorists,  you know, the ISIS types,  if they're that sophisticated, it's pretty hard to deal.  Took us how long to get Osama bin Laden  because he was smart enough  to cut himself off from the internet.  Well, that's-  Would only deal with a courier.

Transcript:  And because we made it public  that they were tracking him with his satellite phone,  and so we went dark on satellite phones,  which again has a parallel here,  which is if we say Apple has the, you know, backdoor key,  I said I wasn't gonna say backdoor, I did it.  If Apple has this key,  then that tells terrorists or organized criminals  to go use different platforms, GPG.  Yeah.  I have a question.  I didn't know if you guys could answer this.  So I thought it was really interesting this week,  the conversation about that Apple does have the ability  to absolutely provide single access  to individual devices with keys  that are individual to the devices themselves.  This was Steve Gibson's whole thing  about the individual number is generated by the phone.

Start time: 1325.64
End time: 1354.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  His point was that if Apple made a revised firmware,  it would be signed for that one phone  and that one phone only.  Right.  That the signing that Apple does with firmware entangles,  I think that's the term Apple uses,  their key, their special crypto key  with a unique identifier of the phone  so that that firmware is unique to that phone.  Right.  And so his position was Apple could make a modified firmware  that would only be usable on that 5C.

In fact, it was Jonathan Zdarsky's point  that one way to do this would be to actually physically copy  the contents of the chip on the phone from one,  I'm not sure exactly, I mean, he's smarter than I am,  but I'm not sure exactly how he's proposing to do this.  But that was.

Transcript:  Apple's point was, if they had just let the thing back up,  we could have given you the information.  In fact, I think that's gonna be Apple's strongest defense  in the end is that the FBI screwed up.  It seemed to be in the testimony in Congress  that Congress was upset that the FBI had screwed up.  Apple said, you know.  And that didn't go as well as the FBI thought it was gonna go.  No, it did not.  Some tough questions from Darylissa and others.  But Congress seemed upset that, well, wait a minute,  you're saying you're putting this burden on Apple  because you didn't do the right thing?  Well, that kind of lets Apple off the hook.  It unfortunately also kicks the can down the road  of this big issue.  Should there be, you know, encryption?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, there's the argument that Apple,  if this became standard procedure,  then every law enforcement group around the world  would be going to Apple and asking for Apple engineers  to write software to access Apple hardware.  And at what point do you,  not to make a slippery slope argument,  but how many employees does Apple need to pay  to do the work of law enforcement  in order to be in business selling phones?

End time: 1542.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so let's go back to my original premise  that this is the moonshot.  So Susan Landau, who testified before Congress,  she said the biggest problem with asking Apple  to create their own internal compliance  to unlock the thousands of phones  that are in the judicial backlog  is that anyone who's involved in compliance,  be it ADA compliance, tax compliance,  they know that this becomes the smallest priority  in the company's budgeting.  It's something they have to do.  It has no benefit to the company.  It's just a compulsion.  Therefore, you get low-level employees.  They start-

Start time: 1542.42
End time: 1544.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they're more likely to give you up.

Start time: 1544.74
End time: 1575.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the easiest one for organized crime,  for state-sponsored terrorists,  or for corporate espionage  to get in there and get that key.  What's the moonshot?  They're saying government should do this?  Her point is that this is a cat and mouse game  and that the government has not kept up with the ability  to be able to decrypt these phones on their own  and that their outsourcing of this  and compulsion of an Apple, ultimately a Samsung,  et cetera, et cetera, is a deficiency in their own.

Start time: 1575.90
End time: 1585.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  What I think she's mistaken,  what it sounds like she's saying is,  well, we should build some giant quantum computers  so that we can break encryption.

Start time: 1585.60
End time: 1589.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 1590.68
End time: 1613.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We know we've done that.  Well, sure.  Snowden told us that.  NSA certainly has done that.  I think it's a foolish idea  to think that you can defeat the math.  The math is strong in this one.  And it would be a mistake for the government to say,  well, we're just gonna build faster computers  because we just make longer keys.  That's not a hard thing to beat.  And so that's not the way to go after this.

Start time: 1613.32
End time: 1617.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, we'll combine that with Jonathan Zdarsky's theory  that you could then mirror the image.

Start time: 1617.30
End time: 1660.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have to take advantage of flaws.  The reason that mirror imaging works  is because there is a flawed front door,  which is this four or six digit code.  That's just a bad passcode, that's all.  If you had a strong password, wouldn't matter.  Encryption's encryption.  The math is sound.  And that's what's really challenging for this  because I don't think there's anything the government can do  unless it says it mandates that encryption not be allowed.  It has to do fundamentally what you just said,  Jason Snow, which is make encryption illegal.  And that's not gonna work because encryption's a math.  Right, it's like making math illegal.  We can't make math illegal.  You can't.  So you just make American encryption bad.  How effective is that?

Start time: 1662.50
End time: 1694.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel like I'm playing devil's advocate,  or at least what I'm interested in  because it's become such an echo chamber,  I think, in the tech community of saying,  well, encryption has to be legal, we have to continue this.  So I've been trying to listen this week  to all the different sides of it.  And one of them that I found interesting  was General Keith Anderson.  He was the former NSA director.  He was on Bloomberg.  And his point was, A, look for the technical solution.  I think we've discussed that.  But he said the other option  would be to look for a third party solution.  I think it's a little out there,  but I'm just posing it because I'd like to hear your thoughts.

Start time: 1694.02
End time: 1755.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They don't wanna say the true thing,  which is you need to make encryption illegal.  The government tried to do this before  with very negative effects.  When they said, we cannot export strong encryption,  as a result, we used 40-bit keys, which was weak,  and that was allowed to be exported.  No browser company was gonna make a separate version  of the browser for US and the rest of the world.  So we had 40-bit keys in our browsers.  And to this day, it continues to bite us  because we still support this weak encryption technology  in our browsers.  And we're still trying to get this stuff out of there  because it's such an easy target.  That was a perfect example  of the unintended negative consequence  of making weak encryption.  You just can't do it effectively.  If the question is,  and I think we've come to that point, conclusion,  the question is, should encryption be illegal?  There's no question.  The answer is there's nothing you can do about it.  You can't make it illegal unilaterally.

Start time: 1755.78
End time: 1804.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you're onto something, though,  this idea of almost like an arms race,  more than a moonshot,  that that seems to be where this has to go,  is encryption will improve  and people's counter-encryption efforts will improve.  There's theoretically quantum computers  will at some point be able to decrypt things  at a much higher rate.  There are gonna be security flaws that can be exploited.  But we may all, as a society,  and this may take 20 years for us  to go through all this turmoil.  As a society, we may all finally have to just admit  that technology is going to create  a brand new unreadable space.  It has.  It already has.  That is, yeah, we're already there,  but we'll have to come to grips with that.  That it's like inside of your mind.  True encryption is like that.  You can't court order it open  because there's no magic key to unlock the door.

Start time: 1804.96
End time: 1834.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would submit that the smartest intelligence agencies  in the United States,  and law enforcement office in the United States,  know that.  That's why they said, well, don't worry about it  because we're gonna have the internet of things.  We're gonna have lots of ways to spy on you.  Yes, there's gonna be strong encryption.  You can't stop that, and you shouldn't stop that  because it would weaken us as a country.  It would weaken our safety.  But don't worry, we have plenty of ways we can spy on you.  There's always gonna be zero days, and that's enough.  And I think the most sophisticated law enforcement people  are saying that.

Start time: 1837.92
End time: 1868.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no, it's hugely complicated.  And I think the other question is,  if Apple was able to build a magic back door  that only the government could get into,  only under the proper circumstances,  and there was no way that anybody could leverage that  to get in other than the government  under proper circumstances, would we then be okay with that?  Because Apple's argument, a big part of it,  is if we do create some kind of back door,  then the code will get out there.  The bad guys can use it.  I think that's right.  It's really dangerous.

Start time: 1868.72
End time: 1883.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A back door isn't gonna work.  You either say, you either unilaterally make  encryption illegal, which we know is a bad idea,  or you just live with it.  And I think everybody's gonna come around to live with it  because you have no choice.  But then game it out.

Start time: 1883.64
End time: 1918.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so then encryption stays legal.  You can't compel the companies.  Neither can you nor should you.  Right, well it doesn't even matter if you can  because as you said, it's a hardware issue.  So let's say this is how you compel Apple to do it.  Well, good luck compelling Huawei to do it.  So if you game this out, at the end of the day,  that leaves the federal government with no choice  other than to really find their own way into this.  Find other ways to spy on people.  And that's where I think it is an arms race  and I think it is a moonshot in terms of they  have to build out their infrastructure.

Start time: 1918.14
End time: 1938.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well that arms race is gonna continue.  The zero day exploits, the finding new ways to spy on you,  that's gonna continue.  And maybe that's the moonshot.  I hate to think of that as a moonshot.  That's such a negative moonshot.

Transcript:  If you're running a market  and you've got a limited number of checkers  and you know that the chip thing slows you down  by 30 seconds or a minute,  you could do the calculation at Trader Joe's or something  and say, you know what,  cause what they trade off is on fraud.  They have to own the fraud  if they do a swipe instead of the chip.  That's the reason.  And so they, you could totally make that calculation  and say, it's not worth it to have our lines be that long  in the store.  People are gonna not come in, they're not gonna shop.  We'll just eat the fraud  and just deal with it.  And let people swipe their card.  I think you're right.

You would know that.  Oh, it's, anyway.  Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks.  We find it's easier to make money by doing advertising  than selling our old gear at freshbooks.com.  Actually, this was the only way I could make money  when I was a freelancer.  You have to send out the invoices to get paid.  I learned that lesson.  Oh, you did.  I learned that lesson.  I hate doing invoices, firing up Word and Excel  and getting all the receipts together for your expenses.  I just would put it off and put it off  and then six months later I'd go,  oh, I better get, I haven't received a check.  That's because you haven't sent an invoice, Leo.  And then you send them six invoices  and they were not happy about that.  Fortunately, Amber MacArthur,  I was whining about this on the set  and Amber said, well, why don't you try FreshBooks?  It was, it just started in Toronto.  It was the early 2000s.  And it was so great because all of a sudden  I'm making my invoices online.  I'm emailing them out.  They can pay faster because on every invoice  there's a pay me button and they can use any online service,  online payment service to pay you.  And it's so much easier to keep track.  When come tax time, you've got it all,  it's basically cloud accounting software.  And when you, you'll just be so happy next tax time  because all your cash flows in one place.  You know exactly what invoice was sent,  who paid you, who didn't pay you.  And by the way, they automatically will ding them  and say, hey, you haven't paid in a nice way,  but they'll get you paid.  And you'll know exactly where your income stands.  You could take pictures of your receipts,  not only for expense purposes,  but if you declare them as deductions,  makes it a breeze at tax time.  The FreshBooks app will do that.  You can even set up FreshBooks to import expenses  directly from your bank account.  Best part about FreshBooks is that,  ah, feeling you get when tax time comes around  and you got it, you got, I got this.  You'll be ready because you're gonna sign up right now  at FreshBooks.com slash twit and try it free for 30 days.  See if it works for you, that's all.  Just make sure you mention, this week in tech,  when they say, how did you hear about us,  FreshBooks.com slash twit.  We thank them so much for their support.

End time: 2935.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My iPhone 6, it's the first iPhone I've ever used  with a case.  I was a no case kind of person, and it's too slippery.  It's like a little polished pebble.  And I would like phones that are more grippy,  and I would trade a little bit of weight and thickness  for more battery life, too.  But this is, so I think a variety is a good thing,  and I think that's the nice thing about Apple's,  this rumor about this iPhone SE or whatever,  is that it's not, small phones are old phones.  With this, it'll be like, you can get a good modern iPhone  with Touch ID and with the iPhone 6 internals  in a smaller size if you want it, and I think that's great.

Start time: 2936.20
End time: 2966.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, what's funny is that by all accounts,  the next iPhone 7 will be even thinner  than the current iPhone. That's the rumor.  That they are continuing this bizarre process  of making it thinner still, and that's why they're,  this one I think is gonna be controversial.  You gotta think it's Johnny Ive, right?  It's the, he wants to say every year,  this is the thinnest phone we've ever made.  He wants to say that, and in order to do that though,  he's going to have to remove the ear plug jack.

Start time: 2966.99
End time: 2981.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, that's the thing is, that's not accurate.  The reality is, there are lots of incredibly thin devices,  including Apple's own iPod Touch,  that are much thinner than the current iPhone,  and still has a standard headphone jack.  So they may use that as an excuse,  but if they get rid of the headphone jack,  it's not because of the quest for thinness.

If they do this, there'll be a lightning version.  So they'll just say, well there's a lightning,  it's just a different connector.  Yeah, for those people.  But for anybody who's got third party headphones,  like all the Beats users, speaking of a company  Apple spent a lot of money to buy  that makes custom headphones,  it's gonna be frustrating if they go down that path.  But saying that it's for the quest for thinness,  I think bundles those two things together  in a way that's not real.

Transcript:  Well, that goes back,  he and Steve Jobs were really simpatico on that.  Steve never met a button he didn't want to remove  for a product, and the apotheosis of that  was that iPod shuffle that had no buttons at all,  which was unusable because you had to have a headphone  plugged in and then use the clicker on the headphone cord.  And the next version of that,  they went back to the previous design,  which is one of the only times you've ever seen Apple  basically back off of a product design entirely  and abandon it.  And it was because they, you know,  philosophically, I think Johnny Ive still has this,  like get rid of all the ports,  get rid of all the buttons,  make it as simple like it's a block of aluminum.  That's the ultimate Apple product,  is just an incredibly thin block of aluminum and glass.

My understanding is they need so many people  that they're gonna need to keep the existing campus,  the new campus, and there's talk that they may actually  try to build something else in San Jose, I think,  because they want their people to work together.  That's the other thing is a lot of these places  in Cupertino where they have offices,  it's a floor here and then a couple floors over there,  and they're not as collaborative workspaces  because there's no room.

It's not unlike this,  if you're looking right here at this little auto slider  that you have in front of us here,  it's just constantly on a cable going back and forth.  So the big thing here in the Phantom 4  is that they have collision avoidance  because this is one of the huge elements for the FAA  as they think about the future of drones.

And their vision is that you will be able  to file a drone flight plan  basically by web form or web service.  And you can say, I wanna go here,  here's when I wanna go,  and it will provide you a route  and basically send it to your drone  and say, here's your route.  This is your airspace,  it's about like 100 yards wide,  it lasts for this amount of time.  And it just, it compiles all the drone flight plans  and makes sure that they don't interact.  And if it can't get you from point A to point B,  it'll kick it back and say, how about a different time?  How about a different route?  It's pretty amazing that it makes sense, right?

And any sort of, actually remember,  I had a friend who went to Taiwan and took a video camera  that involved a VCR on a shoulder strap.  And he walked around and just shot what he saw.

A big trough came that took the ground  out from underneath his rotor wash,  and therefore his helicopter dropped  and the wave came right over him.  So now, flash forward to today,  it's been the biggest big wave surfing season in history  at Peahe at Jaws.  There are drones everywhere there,  shooting the most amazing footage,  practically from inside the tube,  following the surfer as he goes through.

And then I realized, I've just seen at least two articles  about near misses with commercial air traffic.  Charles de Gaulle, Air France, very close miss.  And according to The Guardian,  there have been four near miss incidents at UK airports,  including a passenger jet taking off from London Stansted.

That is an absolute near miss.  And you might say, well, that an 18 inch drone,  what could that do to a 777?  It could bring it down.  Pigeon can bring down a plane.

Transcript:  The technologizer, Harry McCracken.  The show today brought to you by Wealthfront.  I think you know that you should be saving money  for the rainy day ahead, whether it's your retirement,  the kids going to college,  maybe you want to get a down payment on a house.  Long-term savings are very important,  but the question is, where do you put that money?  I was just looking at savings account interest rates.  I can't believe how low they are now.  Much less than 1% a year,  often maybe a quarter or a half percent a year.  I got my interest, the reason I was interested in this,  I got my check from my bank for my savings interest,  three cents.  And I thought, you know,  I actually might have lost money  by putting in a savings account.  You might as well put it in a mattress.  Well, Wealthfront has a better way for you to invest.  Now, many people try to invest for themselves.  The problem with that is,  you don't have the time to keep an eye on this 24-7.  You don't have time probably to check it every quarter.  So you're going to hire somebody?  Well, wait a minute.  Investment advisors charge one, two,  sometimes 3% of the money under management every year.  That means you have to make 3% more to break even.  It's tough.  Wealthfront's a great idea,  because you are not using humans, you're using software,  and you're paying one quarter of 1% a year  with no commissions, no hidden fees, very affordable.  And by the way, in my opinion,  investment does a better job than any human can do.  First of all, Wealthfront's put together an advisory board  of some of the best investment people in the world.  200 years of investment experience,  Nobel Prize-winning academic research, best practices,  people like Charles D., Alice Burton Malkiel,  who really literally wrote the books,  the books that I read when I thought  I could do this myself.  Well, what if you took their minds, their brains,  their knowledge, and put it into software  that monitors your investment 24-7?  Can make trades on your...  This is not day trading, this is not flash trading,  but they are constantly monitoring your portfolio,  constantly rebalancing, doing things like tax loss harvesting  to increase your return while minimizing your taxes.  It's all built in.  Really, most portfolios, the estimate is about 90%  of all portfolios are not properly invested for long term.  If you have long-term savings, if you don't, you ought to,  and if you have them, you've got to check out Wealthfront.  You can start as little as 500 bucks,  and this is a nice little treat.  For your first $15,000 of investment at Wealthfront,  no fee at all, not even one quarter of 1%, forever,  but you have to use Wealthfront.com slash twit.  So here's the deal, I don't want you to invest  without reading about it.  Go to the website, Wealthfront.com slash twit.  Read up, reassure yourself, as I have,  that this is a really great service  that really makes sense.  You can even get a free portfolio generated for you  so you'll see what they would invest in  based on your timeframe, your risk tolerance,  things like that.  That's yours free.  Read up and find out, and then you can start  with as little as 500 bucks, and I would,  I strongly suggest you find out about it.  Wealthfront.com slash twit.  Becky Worley's here, Jason Snell, the Technologizer,  Harry McCracken, we're talking about the week's tech news.  So Becky, I've known you for years.

So then Yahoo Tech, that whole vertical died.  And now they came back with the new one,  which, and I had a show,  actually that was my fourth.  I had a show called Upgrade Your Life,  which was so much fun.  And it was kind of a life hacker,  Martha Stewart meets technology,  a little bit of everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All of, almost all the verticals got shelved, right?  Yeah.  And what folded into.  News or.  John and Justin Sam.  Yeah.  That's kind of sad.  I mean, they really put a lot of money and effort.  And I thought, here's the problem.  Yahoo's trying to do what so many have tried  and failed to do before,  which is make tech accessible and interesting  to normal people.  And it turns out really nobody's that interested.

End time: 4480.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's been a little unclear  because they have this investment in Alibaba,  which is.  Didn't they spin that off?  I thought they spun that off.  Oh, they tried to, but couldn't.  So there are times when.

Start time: 4480.64
End time: 4482.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the market cap is exactly 32 billion.

Start time: 4482.64
End time: 4488.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are times where if you do the math,  the rest of Yahoo isn't worth anything  because the market cap is the same  as the investment in Alibaba.

Start time: 4489.20
End time: 4493.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 4493.98
End time: 4497.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rather than spinning off Alibaba,  they're planning to spin off Yahoo.

Start time: 4497.56
End time: 4508.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, I get it.  So the reverse, that's the reverse.  That's the reverse Morris.  And it has a major tax benefit  because they don't have to pay taxes on the asset  of what they're selling to a smaller company.

Start time: 4508.66
End time: 4525.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In fact, wasn't that what happened  was that the board had been assured by,  they thought by the IRS  that there would be no tax consequence  of spinning off Alibaba.  And then the IRS backtracked and said,  well, we can't promise you that.  And the board said, uh-oh, we could sell it,  but we might lose half the profits in taxes.

Start time: 4525.88
End time: 4543.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They spent a year working on the spin out  and then decided not to do it.  And now they're saying either they'll spin off  the rest of Yahoo or they might sell it to one buyer,  such as Time or Verizon, or they might break it up,  or they might just not do anything.  Do any of these changes involve

End time: 4629.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They have that on the roof at Huli.  They have lunch, they have nothing to do.  I think I did that for Ziff Davis for about six months.  Gina Smith and I, in principle, worked for Ziff Davis,  but we had no portfolio.  We got paid well.  It was, I think it was like almost $100,000 a year,  not to do anything.  Wow, that's fabulous.  Sorry, I mean, that's really sad.  Soul-crushing, but-  Well, that's when I started all this other stuff.  And then MGM said,  oh, we want to partner with Ziff Davis to do television,  as if Davis had been apparently very interested  in television.  So they sent me and Gina down to MGM,  but they said, but they pulled me aside and said,  but we're not, we're not going to do anything.  So just go down there and pretend you're working.  So I got a card key to the MGM back lot and got offices.  I don't think I ever went back to that office.  I think I went there once.  Wow.

I mean, by the way, nobody in the real world  probably cares about this.  We only care because Yahoo was Yahoo.  It was acabono.stanford.edu.  It was Jerry and David.  It was one of the very first internet companies.

I'm not wearing pants now.  No.  No?  No, you don't see anything below the waist.  You don't know who needs pants.  Oh, Lord.  You're seeing something below the waist.  But I didn't expect- You'd take the set  that many years ago. Yeah, I didn't expect  you'd be sitting there.  Actually, did you see the launch festival  that Jason announced he's going to be  in a reality TV show?  Not Jason Howell. Jason Calacanis.  Not Jason Howell.  Don't call him Silicon Valley Snooki.  Actually, he really is Snooki.  It's, he apparently, Harvey Weinstein,  who is one of the great movie producers of Hollywood,  takes a, took a shine to Calacanis  and sign him up for a show that's headed to NBC.  It will be, there's Harvey, it will be,  kind of like The Apprentice.  There'll be 12 startups who will compete for funding.  Calacanis fires one each week until the end,  and the winning startup will get a first round of funding  worth maybe a million, two, maybe even three million.  It'll be the, Calacanis already sounding like Donald Trump.  Donald Trump, yeah.  I just aimed the scenario. It'll be the hugest prize  in the history of television.  Hugest.  So I think Jason, Jason, he's gonna be great.  It's gonna be awesome.  And I feel like he's got political aspirations.  I feel like that's the first step to running for something.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by ITProTV.  If you are in IT, you know the most important job  is to keep up to date, because this stuff moves fast.  If you want to get in IT, the most important job  to keep up to date and get the certs,  and that's where ITProTV is awesome.  Whether you're looking to start a career in IT  or you're already in the field, getting those certs,  getting those credentials are the key  to getting a better job, a promotion,  making more money, doing a better job.  ITProTV was founded by IT trainers  who decided that the best way to do this  is like what we do here at Twitch,  to do a channel broadcasting 50 hours a week.  They now have two studios.  They're building a new facility.  Their new setup is going to have five studios.  There's more than 1,000 hours of content and more coming,  all streamed live or on demand worldwide.  You can get on Chromecast, on Roku, on PC, on iOS, on Android.  It's now available on Amazon Fire TV.  They have an Apple TV channel,  so you can turn on ITProTV on your big screen,  have it going in the background,  absorb all this information, get in the car,  listen on the phone as you drive to work,  get out of the car, put it on your PC.  You're going to learn,  and they are adding new courses all the time this month,  Microsoft Server 2016, the MCSE prep course,  Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager,  they've got courses for CCNA, Amazon Web Services,  the Ethical Hacking course is awesome.  There's the Measure Up Practice exams, those are great.  $109 value, you get practice exams,  so you can take the test before you take the test,  and that's built into your subscription, it's free.  They also have virtual machine labs,  which allow you to set up and configure a Windows server,  set up Windows clients, all without having Windows at all.  You can do it on any HTML5 browser,  you can do it on a Chromebook.  And the low monthly subscription price means it's affordable.  It's more affordable, certainly,  than going to a technical school, probably more engaging,  certainly all the content you need.  And it's even less, really,  than buying one of those prep books, those are expensive.  Well, I'm gonna give you a deal to get it down to $40 a month  or $399 for a year.  Here's the deal, go to ITPro.TV, ITPro.TV slash twit.  You're gonna get a free seven day trial,  and when you use the code twit30,  you're gonna get 30% off, not for the first year,  the first month, but forever.

Transcript:  Yeah, that's not surprising.  I think that really is a skill.  Well, everybody knows.  These are the best jobs out there, aren't they, really?  The person who runs the network has all the power.  Self-driving cars, Google has a couple of ones.  They have the Lexus SUV with the lidar spinning  and the cameras, and then they have  those little cute autonomous vehicles.  The cute ones don't have steering wheel,  they don't have pedal, they don't have a brake.  The one that got in an accident was the one with the pedal,  the brake, and a driver.  And it got in kind of a weird situation.  It was in Mountain View, Google campus is there,  and it was driving down a city street.  And normally, if you're gonna make a right turn,  you get in the rightmost lane.  Except that this one had a big pothole in it,  and the car comes up to the pothole,  and it's coned off and it's got sandbags, car's stuck.  It decides it's gotta get merged back into traffic  to make the right turn.  So, turns on its blinker, sees a bus coming,  and then plows into it at two miles an hour.  It hits the bus!  It doesn't just hit the bus, it hits it  in the most vulnerable portion of any bus,  right there in the crotch.  It's one of those...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Double extensible buses hits in the joint.  Yeah, hits it in the joint.  I don't know if there's a lot of damage.  Lot of information, lot of discussion about this.  I don't know if the bus driver was mad.  He said he saw it was a Google autonomous vehicle,  and it's to be presumed that bus drivers  encounter them a lot in Mountain View.  The driver said, Google said,  the car did see the bus, but thought it would let it in.

Start time: 5450.04
End time: 5450.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As did the driver.

Start time: 5451.96
End time: 5499.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the driver said, yeah, I saw it.  I thought, this isn't gonna be a problem,  I'll let the car handle it.  And the bus did not let him in,  and it hit the bus at two miles an hour.  Nobody was hurt.  So this is what's going on.  The Google cars are getting more aggressive, intentionally.  The problem is, and this is a very challenging  computer science problem for an autonomous vehicle.  Humans have all sorts of signals about,  oh, you go, I'll go.  You look the driver in the eye, does he see you?  Is he slowing down?  Okay, it's my turn to go.  There's nothing to look at with an autonomous vehicle.  It may very well be the bus driver thought,  oh, it's stuck.  It's just gonna sit there.  I don't have to let it in.  It's a robot car.  I don't know what the bus driver thought.

Start time: 5499.76
End time: 5509.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have you ever been behind a bus,  next to a bus, in front of a bus?  Bus don't care about you.  We know that the last thing you do is challenge a bus.  No, that's completely right.

Start time: 5509.52
End time: 5532.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But a computer doesn't know that.  And that's basically what Google's press release  about this said, is we're going to take this  as a learning experience about treating buses  and other large vehicles differently than other cars.  Which is like, because I try to put myself  in that situation and that's exactly what I would think  is like, okay, I could risk getting plowed into by a bus  or I could just wait for the bus to go by  because I don't trust any bus.  Listen to this language.

Start time: 5533.38
End time: 5546.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google said it has reviewed this incident and quote,  thousands of variations of it on our simulator in detail.  It may be refinements to our software.  And this is the key.  From now on, our cars will more deeply understand  that buses and other larger vehicles

Start time: 5547.18

Transcript:  And they're already programmed to see things  like traffic cones and know that they should be more careful.  But I guess in this case, they saw the traffic cones  and the sandbags and they thought they knew a way out.  Well, they're also, the cars have been so cautious

Start time: 5574.82
End time: 5579.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And so we talked about this on Twig on Wednesday.  The worst thing that happens in California, we have four way stops,  which have very arcane rules about who goes.  I mean, if everybody arrives at a different time,  it's not a problem. First person goes first.  If you arrive at the same time, then you have to,  then it's more complicated.  But the worst thing that can happen at a four way stop  is a driver who gets there first.  It's his turn who waits and goes, no, no, you.  Yeah.  It's the most annoying, confusing, dangerous thing to do  is to be too passive.  And I think what Google was deciding is these cars are too passive.  And that's not the best way to drive.  You have to have driving turns out to be an interaction  with the other drivers.  And you can't be just kind of, OK, you go.  It's your turn.

Start time: 5627.04

Transcript:  Brad Templeton, who does a lot of work on autonomous vehicles,  wrote a great blog post.  He pointed out that in India,  lanes are just a suggestion.  That most streets don't even have lanes painted in.  And if they do, no one. It's not really.

Start time: 5673.54
End time: 5733.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So in many parts of the world, an autonomous vehicle is going to really have a challenge  because it's going to have to impute human motives.  It's going to have to kind of understand what's going on.  What was that? Do you have that video, Jason?  It's not of the San Francisco street, but of the traffic intersection in India  that we showed.  It gives you an idea of how hard it would be  to learn how to drive unless you'd learned your whole life.  It's almost like you couldn't be fluent.  This is a slightly sped up.  There's no roundabout. There's no markings.  There's no lights.  It's just negotiated.  And it's negotiated in nearly real time.  And by the way, it's not just cars and buses.  There are people crossing the street.  And I don't know.  That was a good one.  Yeah, it's kind of fun to watch because it's like, what?  The bus just went right through it.  That's the third bus that has it doesn't care.  Does not care. Bus don't care.

Start time: 5761.90
End time: 5776.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The human brain is uniquely well suited to this because we're massively parallel.  We also are good at learning autonomous things.  A lot of driving is autonomous, just like walking or running.  If you thought about walking, you couldn't do it.

And even though you don't do anything, we all we all tend to think that  unless you're doing something physical, you're not exhausting yourself.  But the fact is, you're using your brain.  You're on edge. Your brain is burning calories.  When you think a lot like they did a study of like people who are doing  math tests or something like that.  And the fact is, it's real exertion.  And it takes a toll.  And you drive to the store for, you know, for some groceries.  And it's not that big a deal.  But you drive to from San Francisco to L.A.  And you are toast by the time you get to the end of it.  So thanks. Self-driving cars, maybe.  Do you ever have a bad commute?  Like a long. Oh, yeah, I used to drive.  So when I worked at Ziff Davis, actually, I was in Foster City  and I lived in East Bay.  So I had a bridge commute.  I did go through a canyon and a bunch of city streets and over a bridge.  It's the worst.

Or if you're listening to an audiobook or something and then you get out of the car  and you're like, I don't even remember the stop signs or the streetlights,  because I was just sort of focused on what I was listening to.

And we didn't know what it was going to be like.  We hadn't seen any video from it.  And it was a little hirky jerky and weird to see the thing moving by itself.  And it was kind of scary.

And then I also stepped in front of it to see if it would stop, which it did.  But I just remember thinking it was this foreign entity, terrifying.  And then last year at CES, I was in the BMW self-driving car in the back seat  while it drove me driverless.  Nobody in the front seat from point A to point B in their controlled environment.  And the next time I got in a car to drive, I was disappointed.  I was so easily acclimated to the idea of.

I always kind of think about running a company as an employee and trying to make it something like  and the number one thing is control, right, is like autonomy.  And I think there are a lot of people who don't want that responsibility of figuring out  what they're supposed to do and not somebody breathing down their necks, but I don't know.

And I don't sweat a lot of the details of working for, you know, making sure the company  runs because other people sweat that.  But it is kind of an illusion.

And if you run into trouble, somebody else may make decisions that you have no control  over.  And if you work for yourself, at least you know how the company is doing.  If you screw up, it's your fault.  And it's your own fault.

Brand is the key is to develop a brand.  And a lot of newspaper reporters especially aren't allowed a personality or a brand in  public because they are supposed to be objective relayers of information.  We can argue about whether that was accurate or not.  But if you're a big name columnist, you can get away with it.  But if you were just somebody who was grinding on the crime beat and doing a great job at  the paper in Baltimore working on the murder beat, that job goes away.  And what do you do?  Does anybody even know who you are?  And if you're David Simon, you can turn into writing books.  But that's a that's a bit of a crapshoot.  It's like Steelworkers or something like that.  This is a case where you've got people who are going to have to be retrained.  It's really sad.  I think there are jobs for a lot of these people, but they're not journalism jobs, right?  They're going to be corporate communications or PR or teaching or Uber.  But yeah, but it's going to require a change in lifestyle because those those jobs are  gone.

And it's so depressing.  It's basically what can't robots and computers replace us for in terms of jobs?  And this is maybe a 21st century question is what if most of the jobs we do are more  efficiently done by a computer and or a robot?  At what point is there no employment left?

They had a full 360 degree simulator for first responders in active shooter situations.  And you had to figure out which door, as it opened, had the mom holding the baby or the  shooter with the gun.  And I could see those like...  And I mean, just for gaming alone.

And gamers want any edge they can for it to be more immersive.  So I think it'll be a hit there.  I think you're absolutely right though that what happens after that.  How do you get beyond those first obvious VR instances to something that everybody  wants?  People didn't even want to buy 3D glasses to watch 3D TV.

I mean, at the World Congress somebody was doing it with Play-Doh, but this is an inkjet  printer.  They can actually print your fingerprint on a piece of paper and unlock a phone.  This is Michigan State that did the research.  We talk about privacy problems.  Let's take a break.  We want to talk about some more things.  We're almost done.  The bourbon is running out, so are we.  But first a little bit of a word about my favorite bookstore.  It's not a bookstore you can go into and walk around in VR yet, although I wouldn't be surprised  if someday it was.  It's a bookstore you listen to.  It's audible.com.  180,000 titles across all types of literature, fiction, nonfiction, periodicals even, performances,  comedy.  I am a huge Audible fan.  Have been since those days when I had to drive two hours each way to Tech TV.  That's when I first became an Audible subscriber in the year 2000.  And man, I have several hundred books now in my Audible library.  It's one of the things I like about Audible is that those books are yours.  They're in your library, your virtual library, and you can go back and listen to them.  What am I listening to right now?  I got the Alexander Hamilton biography because I'm getting ready to go to see Hamilton by  Ron Chernow.  Really, really good.  Did you listen to the life-changing magic of tidying up by Marie Kondo, Becky?  I feel like you might be a Marie Kondo.

Go to audible.com slash twit two, twit and the number two, and you'll sign up for the  platinum account.  That means two books a month, but your first month's free.  You also get the Daily Digest of the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal.  Cancel any time in the first 30 days, you'll pay nothing, but those books as always are  yours to keep forever.  So pick well, Padawan learner, and get sucked in by Audible because it's a great addiction.  I am.  That's a really good example of driving and not knowing you drove, but what's really interesting  to me is when I, does this happen to you when you're listening to Audible book, if you  relisten to a passage you can remember where you were.

I'm listening to an Audible passage and I'll know, or vice versa, you go to that place  and you hear that passage again.  It's great.  I love Audible.  One of the things I like about Audible is often I can't remember, did I see the movie  or did you just listen to the book?  Because it really comes alive in your head and sometimes it's a better movie frankly  than the movie.
