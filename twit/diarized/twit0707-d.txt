Florence, of course, a host of All About Android.  And you yesterday were at not yesterday.  Wednesday, we're at the Samsung. I was.  Event where they announced the about eight phones and at least a dishwasher.  I don't know what else.  They did it pretty quickly.  They breezed through it and they did something opposite of Apple.  Usually Apple saves the best for last. One more thing, right?  They launched with the phone, the fold.  They also did did something that I don't know.  Maybe this was good, maybe bad. They announced the price.

Start time: 306.14
End time: 308.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then everybody audibly booed in the gas.

Start time: 309.38
End time: 322.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. April 26th, it's the first, actually the second foldable phone after the Royale.  And it is but it's from Samsung, so it'll be nicely made.  It has a Samsung makes a screen.  Did you get to see it?

Start time: 322.90
End time: 329.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I saw it from I saw it in DJ Ko's hands very far away.  But again, that was very far.

Start time: 329.32
End time: 387.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it wasn't in the demo room. Absolutely.  All the other stuff was. In fact, you brought us some Google some buds.  I almost call it Google Buds.  They're Samsung Buds.  Those look pretty sweet.  And those have a wireless charging case, unlike the Apple Air Pods.  Oh, and they have magnets to hold the things in.  So when they announced that the fold was one thousand nine hundred eighty dollars,  there was an audible gasp.  It was a whoa.  But it's not even the most expensive folding phone now today.  Huawei announced the Mate X, which fold. So. So.  You know, the best way to describe it.  Tell me if I'm wrong on this.  But the best way to describe the Galaxy Fold is to take two phones  and put them together.  That's it's going to be thick like that.  And then you then one one side put the screen on one side.  So it's a little small screen, but foreign screen on that.  And then you open it up.  And that's the bigger screen.  But if you do that, you realize that big.  It's kind of squarish big.

Start time: 387.92
End time: 394.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's tablet sized nearly.  Well, nearly some of them go into eight inches.  Some of them go into seven inches.

Start time: 394.34
End time: 401.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's the Galaxy Fold.  But then the Mate X goes the other way.

Start time: 402.56
End time: 405.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it goes like a temple. Oh, it's so weird.

Start time: 406.28
End time: 424.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you see both screens on it.  We've created a mockup to help you understand it.  I don't know how this is better in any way.  Well, it's a little easier.  It's a little confusing because it seems to be made of old iPhones.  But I'll hide that.  I'll hide the Apple logo.  So the screen goes all the way around the outside.

Start time: 425.10
End time: 434.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  But is there a piece cut out of that one, Leo?  Like, because it sort of folds into itself, right?  There's a little line where the cameras are on.  Yeah, it's a trifold. Right. Yeah.

Start time: 436.26
End time: 436.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's kind of weird.

Start time: 438.48
End time: 439.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's weird, but I kind of like it.

Start time: 440.40
End time: 444.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't you worry about the hinge, though?  See where that screen is? Yeah.

Start time: 444.46
End time: 448.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't it going to be...  That's why they're not letting anybody look at it.  Same thing with the Galaxy Fold.

Start time: 449.83
End time: 457.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These are polymer screens, so they're flexible.  But I worry how, you know, you're going to be able to open it 10 times  and then it breaks.

Start time: 457.84
End time: 464.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I'm thinking, too.  Like an old trapper keeper.  Yeah. They were made of plastics.  They would fall apart halfway through the school year.

Start time: 464.56
End time: 466.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  You know, nostalgia is very hot right now for my generation.  You want to sell it to me, right?  We're the spenders right now.

Start time: 477.90
End time: 489.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's I think even your generation  ain't going to spend three thousand.  I didn't mention. We don't have the money.  So the Galaxy Fold's 1980.  The Huawei, what was it?  Twenty six hundred bucks.

Start time: 490.80
End time: 494.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Twenty three hundred for the base model or whatever.  Don't make the American government look at you.

Start time: 495.56
End time: 498.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing.  You won't be able to buy it in the U.S.  So you don't even have to think about it.

Start time: 498.48
End time: 502.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if you happen to bring it over from overseas  or buy it on AliExpress.

Start time: 503.48
End time: 529.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I bought a P20 even though it wasn't sold in the U.S.  I was able to buy it through some sort of online thing.  The carriers won't sell it.  And Huawei doesn't officially sell it in the U.S.  I asked Huawei about that and they said,  if you don't have a carrier deal in the United States,  there's no point in marketing a phone.  You're not going to sell an appreciable number.  It's very true.  Tell that to Google, though. They've done all right.  I guess the Pixel has a Verizon and T-Mobile carrier deal.  So maybe that's OK.

Start time: 530.24
End time: 543.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OnePlus was the one that they tried.  They did the reservation system.  Well, no, they are with T-Mobile now.  And they work on Verizon, which has been great for them.  I mean, that's really helped their.  Yeah, you need you need that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're just podcasters, which is you're a publisher,  which is the is either of these foldable phones.  I think there's more, right? This isn't the only one.  There's going to be a ZTE foldable phone and a TCL.

Start time: 562.04
End time: 567.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 572.22
End time: 580.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Their CEO in a tweet sat there unfolding and folding it.  But that to me, that doesn't really count as even a prototype.

Start time: 580.12
End time: 605.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just it's just for these things are barely prototypes.  The ones that they're announcing.  Well, I mean, you know, at that price and and, you know,  they're not letting the journalists even hold them or take them home or anything.  So to me, it's kind of like, you know, we'll price them so high  that almost nobody buys them or wants to buy them.  We'll make a very small number of these and we'll get our beta testers,  you know, to pay for it, pay for the devices.

Start time: 605.46
End time: 611.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you wouldn't rush out April 26th, isn't that far off?  You wouldn't rush out April 26th by a galaxy fold.

Start time: 611.46
End time: 628.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's kind of crazy.  I mean, glad Savov from The Verge was was discussing like  if this is coming out April and they're not giving it like  they're not letting journalists touch it yet.  What is like what is happening between now and April?  That's going to make these things ready for developers.

Start time: 629.34
End time: 631.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure they're for developers, I think.

Start time: 631.78
End time: 637.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's definitely got a prototypey developer feel to it.  That's what it sounds like.

Start time: 637.74
End time: 655.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like when Project Tango came out, right.  And it was just it was like six hundred dollars.  That was really clunky.  It was. But the idea was to be a reference device.  And this is just Samsung saying, hey, come to us for the reference device.  You don't need to go to Google. We'll do it.  Yeah. And look, Google supports us.

Start time: 656.20
End time: 678.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, the form factor, like it's cool.  Like, I definitely would love to show people this.  But like in day to day use, like, you know, when I'm mobile,  I'm on I'm probably using one hand, I'm walking.  I don't want to unfold it and, you know, fold it back up.  You know, and then I don't know.  It just doesn't this doesn't appeal to me in a way.  It's a spark of joy for you.

Start time: 678.70
End time: 680.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, you're doing Marie Conn.

Start time: 680.84
End time: 684.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know. Yeah, I've really killed that joke, too,  because I've said it too much.

Start time: 684.96
End time: 708.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I have to I have to say.  I know the audible gasp,  but the reason Samsung said several times one thousand nine hundred  eighty dollars is here's a phone that's very distinctive.  If you go to a meeting and you pull it out of your pocket  and you open it up, everybody's going to go, he has the two  thousand dollar phone.  That is the point of it, at least in some markets.  Is that totally agree?

Start time: 709.14
End time: 729.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I feel like it's going to be one of those phones that that is.  It's sort of like a gimmick in some ways, but it is also it's  it's made for a very small group of people.  It's it's the luxury of luxury devices, right?  It's like, yeah, it's it's this crazy phone that that if you pull it  out of your pocket, people will at least for a very short time be impressed.

Start time: 729.86
End time: 746.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean, Apple sold what was that an eighteen thousand dollar  Apple watch when they first came out?  I never saw anyone with a solid gold. Yeah.  But I mean, I was a better friend.  But it's a status symbol.  If you are wearing a solid gold Apple watch, people know.  Oh, he spent 20 grand on that.  Yeah, it's like having a big diamond or something.

Start time: 747.20
End time: 756.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it does look cool, though.  I mean, I feel like I don't know what the sci fi reference is.  Right. But part of the problem is there isn't one.

Start time: 756.76
End time: 767.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, because if you watch the expanse, the phones are like these clear  expandable sort of things versus these like physical clunky.

Start time: 767.46
End time: 768.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And even 2001, they had an iPad.

Start time: 769.90
End time: 771.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. But they didn't fold them.

Start time: 772.30
End time: 793.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think anybody in science fiction  anticipated the idea that the screens would be so flexible.  That's very true. I think that seems a little odd that they can do that.  It does. Isn't there circuitry on the back of it?  Isn't it going to get metal fatigue or something?  The Samsung phones have two batteries.  Even the Huawei looked like it had a wrinkle where the hinge is.

Start time: 795.64
End time: 797.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a little like wobbly. It's wobbly.

Start time: 798.82
End time: 807.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And, you know, where the hinge is, they had the phones on max brightness.  So if there was any darkness, it would kind of blur it out.

Start time: 809.18
End time: 810.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right. I heard about that.

Start time: 810.24
End time: 823.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look at this. Look at this right here. Look at that hinge.  First of all, this is the Huawei hinge, which is kind of funky.  It looks like they're glued in.  And look at that perceptible bulge over the hinge.  Do you want that in your screen? I don't think so.

Start time: 824.32
End time: 826.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So then you have that big chunk on the right, too.

Start time: 827.20
End time: 831.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know what that it looks like the charging port.  Yeah, there's your type C connector.

Start time: 831.60
End time: 835.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is very are they just trying to figure out how to make people buy tablets again?

Start time: 836.98
End time: 839.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is a great question. I think they're desperate.

Start time: 839.38
End time: 845.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're desperate. There's nothing to distinguish.  Any of the current flagship phones are all slabs of black glass. All of them.

Start time: 845.92
End time: 847.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it is innovative still.

Start time: 847.70
End time: 863.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's what I'm saying. They need something that looks different.  And I don't I don't think market research.  I don't I don't think this is driven by research.  And this is what people are demanding.  This is more throw a spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks right or no.  Yes. Yes.

Start time: 863.82
End time: 889.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Eventually, it will lead to other things.  I like to think of the I like to think of this being used for kind of all in one devices,  I think, for like a different kind of market, maybe not necessarily  like the high end market, but a market of people who just would like to have a two in one sort of device,  because maybe that's that is the only thing that's accessible to them.  And they would like to have that sort of portability and that malleability.

Start time: 889.88
End time: 916.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you think it's possible this is for the Asian market?  Because I remember in Japan 20, 15 years ago, long before the iPhone came out,  there were all these interesting oddball folding phones,  lots more capabilities than anything we had in the States.  And I was told at the time, well, the reason is people don't have they don't have the room for personal computers.  So their phone is their computer.  And so they have odd form factors because they're more functional.

Start time: 916.58
End time: 941.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I think about beyond Asia, too.  I think also Latin America and other markets where this could be that maybe we don't fully appreciate this.  So this is going to become the more this becomes commoditized.  I think the more we'll see a market for it.  I think right now it very much is, well, how can developers and I think this is very much an offering for for people who want to explore that market and who are interested in it.

Transcript:  Were there is there you've been, I'm sure, watching Barcelona today.  Were there any other announcements?  Twitter, yes.  Anything else that LG announced a new G8?  LG, I feel bad for LG.  It's not even that also ran.  I mean, they have nice phones.  This is still bad for them.

Start time: 961.34
End time: 986.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They they are the other half of the South Korean tech market.  They have it. They have other Mark.  They have a lot of stuff there.  They own a lot. I mean, they own beauty brands.  They have appliances.  There's LG Beauty.  Yeah, they're there.  The brands have different other names.  But if you look at the umbrella company, they're the ones there's like an LG division.  They own products like Belief is a brand that they own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nokia, which the only claim to fame Nokia had was it made the only decent Windows phones.  And one of the reasons they were so decent is they had a lot of 41 megapixel camera.  They called it Pureview.  Well, they're back.  The new Nokia flagship has spider eyes.

Start time: 1004.64

The other three are monochrome.  When you press the shutter, all five cameras shoot different exposures at the same time.  And then they merge them together.  This is kind of what the pixel does with one lens very quickly into a single ultra detailed shot.  And Nokia says that individual cameras can even shoot multiple exposures on their own  and add even more data to the final image result.  A camera that offers new levels of detail and color.

I always would buy with Samsung early galaxies, I'd buy two batteries  and then I'd go as long as I could with one.  And usually that was most of the day.  And then if I needed to, I got off the airplane and it was dead.  I'd open up the back, put in another battery and I'm good to go.  Yeah, it's true.  That's an easy thing to do.  I don't understand.

But, you know, people have been posting on Twitter  because they have the GS 10s in their hand.  And you can still see that they're doing that thing  where they overprocess over saturate a photo  versus the Pixel 3, which also processes the photo.  But it process it process it.  It's to make it look more realistic.  So it's just to show their side by side processing.  Yeah, I've seen.  It's to make it pop.

Transcript:  Pretty nuts.  All right. Well, there is a lot more new stuff to talk about.  We I got up early this morning.  Early for me is nine a.m.  to cover the Microsoft.  Right.  Lens of a two announcement.  We'll talk about that in a little bit.  There's lots to talk about.  We have a busy news day, but fortunately we have the A team with us.  Florence Ion from All About Android.  Great to have you. Oh, that flow.  I love the earrings. Thank you.  She's wearing red pom pom earrings danglies.  They're really cute.  We also have they look like my poodle.  No, I don't have a poodle.  We also have a poodle tail.  Died red. I have a red poodle.  Seth Weintraub is also here from nine to five and Electrek.  Great to have you, Seth.  I'm going to ask you about electric vehicles in a little bit,  because I'm in the market.  All right. Yeah.  And Ben Brock Johnson.  I'm going to ask you about tiny podcast studios and I'm in the market.  He's a senior producer at WB.  You are radio.  Quick program note, we are doing our survey.  If you haven't done it yet, there's still time, but only a little time left.  Once a year, we ask the audience to fill out a few questions  so we can get to understand and know you better.  And if you haven't done it, no obligation.  But I'd appreciate it if you do it.  Twit.to slash survey 19.  Quip is the first subscription electric toothbrush  accepted by the American Dental Association.  It is a really neat idea.  You know, you can get a quip for twenty five dollars.  They have more expensive ones, but they started twenty five dollars,  which means you can afford an electric toothbrush.  It's great because it's battery powered, which means it's great for travel.  It goes months on one battery, triple A battery.  And it also means it's more compact.  So quip, I love this, comes with a holder which you can mount to your mirror.  The multi-use cover can be a stand.  You could mount it to your mirror, which is what I do.  So you never forget to brush.  But it also could turn around and cover the head.  And then it's it's like the smallest, most compact travel  toothbrush. And because you don't need a charger,  you just put another triple A battery and it's great for traveling.  It's as lightweight as you can get.  I love quip and quip does something else that's very cool.  It's a it's a great electric toothbrush.  I I should mention this, you know, it's got great sonic vibrations  to clean your teeth effectively without pressing too hard.  I think a lot of people electric toothbrushes really push hard.  It's gentle on sensitive gums.  Some electric toothbrushes really are quite abrasive.  I've had my dentist tell me don't push so hard.  They actually had to show me  that you never have that problem with the quip.  It's a nice gentle.  And just like, you know, it's got two minute timer pulses every 30 seconds.  So you make sure you get your whole mouth switch sides and all that.  So that's really good.  The other thing they do that's really great is you also get brush heads  automatically delivered on a dentist recommended schedule every three months.  Just five dollars.  I also get new toothpaste delivered because I like the little the little travel  tubes. And that way, you're not using old brushes.  And three out of four of us use bristles that are old worn out  and ineffective.  That's why quip is one of the first electric toothbrushes accepted by the ADA.  If thousands of verified five star reviews, over 20,000 professionals  backing it. I am a quip quipper for life.  I love quip and starting at just twenty five dollars.  You could do it, too. If you go to get quip dot com slash twit,  we'll even throw in your first refill pack free  when you purchase any quip electric toothbrush.  We have his and her quips.  It's your first refill pack free.  Get quip dot com slash twit.  It's G.E.T. Q.U.I.P. dot com slash twit.  And we thank quip for their support.

Transcript:  So remember four years ago when HoloLens one was announced,  Microsoft showed games, you know, they did Minecraft.  They had spiders from Mars. They had all sorts of stuff.  No games this time.  Microsoft doubled down on industrial applications.  They showed fixing engines, designing theater sets,  practicing a surgery before you actually did it.  They showed new user interface gestures, which I was very impressed with.  We did a live stream of it with Mary Jo Foley.  And while she had, I think, been pre-briefed a lot of it,  it was very impressive.  And the only gaming concession to gaming or even any consumer application at all  was about a three minute visit from Tin Sweeney of Epic,  who said, this is going to be great for games, didn't demo anything and left.

Well, tech really hasn't penetrated yet.  Like this, this is going to help. Yeah.

Start time: 1640.90

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is a little pricey.  So the original HoloLens developer kit,  which has been around for four years, was five thousand dollars.  This is thirty five hundred dollars. It's a lot of money.  But they I think they did offer something that will be compelling  to many businesses.  It's one hundred twenty five dollars a month per seat.  If you commit to three years, which ends up being the same amount.  But I think I think a lot of businesses would prefer that.  They can appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, if you multiply 12 times, 125 times three,  I think it comes out more than more than 35 bucks.  But knowing how business works, I know it would be a lot easier  for us to say 125 bucks a month and 35 hundred bucks out the door.  And I think they also showed a conferencing of weird looking.  We can we can show some video of it if we have it lying around.  But it was very creepy  video conferencing. You'd be wearing this thing.  And they say much more comfortable.  It feels like a hat.  It was true that everybody put it on and just kind of they put it on.  It wasn't a lot of tweaking and adjusting as there used to be with the old HoloLens.  It just worked. It looked like sunglasses up to the brow.  And then it was just this massive thing with a forehead suction cup.  And it goes around your head's battery powered.  I was told about three hours of battery life, which is decent.  There's no tether, you know, carrying around a computer with you,  except that's what the HoloLens is.  In fact, it runs Windows.  And they demonstrated this conferencing.  So the conferees would both be wearing HoloLens.  They can see through the sunglasses part, but they also can see  projected onto their meeting room.  The other conferee, the way the reason it looked creepy is the conferee.  The other people would use a 2D picture.  The HoloLens has time of flight sensors for 3D.  It has the connect sensor on top.  So I guess, yes, they didn't show it working,  but I guess you'd show the 2D picture to the HoloLens  and that would turn it into a 3D avatar view that was creepy as hell.  And then you'd be in the room with other people.  But what's neat is they could you could both be looking at a 3D generated model.  You could send each other images and pictures.  They could have a virtual whiteboard that you'd all be working on.

Transcript:  They said twice as big, but they didn't say twice.  And I don't think it's twice as wide.  I think it's twice as tall.  So that's twice as tall.  That was a big problem with HoloLens one because it was like a mail slot.

Start time: 1810.92
End time: 1881.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I remember trying.  It was like really amazing in the field of view.  And but but it was hard for it to be truly immersive, really.  I mean, I know it's mixed reality, but it it was hard for you to really  kind of dig into it in a way.  And I think that was partially the field of view.  So it was good.  I thought it was good to hear that they had extended that.  And I think I don't know.  I mean, the business move makes a lot of sense to me, right?  That these are these are the company, you know, companies are going to be able  to afford this and can actually find.  I mean, I've talked to companies in Massachusetts that are that are already  using HoloLens, the first version for for things like turbine maintenance.  And I think that it really does have those applications where you can have  somebody who is, you know, who's an engineer and who's trained, but at the same  time may not know everything about this particular engine and run a software  program that helps him or her understand, you know, how to repair something  or how to tweak it, how to change it.  I can see that application being really smart.

Transcript:  It does have an AI engine in in the headset, and it actually did seem to do  a very good job of things like recognizing your hands.  So if your hands get in the field of view of the headset, they are now you're  now seeing a three dimensional version of your hands.  They've got new gestures that I think make a lot of sense.  They had an excellent demo by a millennial showing she played the piano.  She pinched and zoomed.  It really was impressive.  Here's a in their trailer video, an example of a motorcycle mechanic  looking at, you know, the map of what he's going to fix and then seeing what he should do.  And I think this all makes a lot of sense.  That's how we're seeing Google Glass use.  Here's a surgeon practicing open heart surgery before she actually does it.  Yes, please.  Yeah, please. Please practice.  And you can see if you look at it, that looks like a fairly comfortable headset.  I love it that there's no tether.  Clearly, this is a set designer now designing her set in the theater.  But there's no real set.  It's just being superimposed.  This is the new workstation.  Exactly. Yeah.  I mean, there I played with Magic Leap.  I don't think Magic Leap has this  coherent a vision and certainly doesn't have the ecosystem Microsoft offers.  I think this is there right now.

And why not have the best of the best informing the military  as the military does work that is important for  you know, keeping America safe for lack of a better term.  But I do.  It does make me wonder, right, because in theory, this is  this is why people criticize like the military industrial complex, right?  Is is this this situation where  the government is contracting out work to the private industry  and all of these people now have to work on something that maybe helps  kill someone somewhere.  And those people don't get to work on helping the pianist  play the piano or, you know, that set designer do the set designer stuff.  And so I mean, it's a small number of people who sign this this letter,  obviously, but I thought that was an interesting story this week.

Right. I mean, the Windows phone is long gone by now, but I think they've  it's they've been leading in some really interesting areas.  And HoloLens is a great example of that.  Yeah.

And as I said, I played with the Magic Leap, but mostly it's games.  I get some. There are some industrial uses.  Google Glass, by the way, still is used in industrial.  That's true. Ways.  Yep. But nothing like this.  And this is Seth, that 2X  view. And I think it is.  I think it's taller.  I don't think it's wider because it was wide enough.  It was. And what you see, and I should point this out, when you use  one of these devices, when we talk about a field of view, it's not like  the rest of it's black.  It's just that the images that you're seeing with their special camera,  they look like they're full, you know, full screen images fit within that view.  And if you move your head and they go outside the edge of that,  they just disappear.  You still see the world around you, but they just disappear.  You still see the world around you, but they just the objects you're looking at  only appear within that somewhat narrow field of view.  Center of gravity in the middle.  That's a big deal because the imbalanced HoloLens got very tiring very quickly.  Here's Julia Schwartz. She did a great job demoing this.  She's the millennial I was referring to.  And apparently it takes a millennial to really understand how to do this.  You can see the thing, can see her hands, she can move her hands.  And that means a whole world of gestures are available.  It was a little clunky in HoloLens 1.  It took some getting used to.  This is much easier.  See, she can see the edges of where that image is.  She can touch it with her hands.  She can zoom it. She can pinch it.  She can spin it.

Transcript:  Yeah, it's like a thing.  Yeah. The thing that's weird is you're not touching anything.  So while it's reacting to your touch, it's not like your hand stops.  Right. So she showed a little later on.  She showed how they're working on new gestures like pinch gestures  where your fingers tap each other.  And the pinch gesture does give you something to stop your finger.  But she's talking about how you push push buttons are different.  The size of the button determines how you interact with it.  If it's a bigger button, you might punch it.

And I do remember people making the argument that people were actually  going to be wearing these things.  And effectively blinding themselves in public  to the actual real world around them.

But as somebody in the chat room pointed out,  this isn't about seeing each other as much.  It is about seeing a shared knowledge space with objects in it.  So even though this looks kind of weird and jerky and and so forth,  it's really the data that you're sharing and the things you're working on together.  This is Mattel was showing how they might work on toys.  Their their employees are all over the place, but they can work  in a shared space together.  As if they're meeting in the same room.

I, you know, when it first came out, I said, well, I have to see this.  And it was actually a little disturbing because it's like,  you're really there.  It is very real.  Maybe too real.

Transcript:  are like, well, see, this is why Microsoft doesn't care  if Google and Apple are involved, because what they're selling really is Azure services.  This is this hardware is secondary to the whole thing.  It's really all about Azure.  And that was very clear from the beginning of the event on is  it's all about the cloud and selling services through the cloud.  And weirdly, they're based all of the products that they're talking about here.  And here's where he's talking about open and they have an app store.  But anybody else can have an app store.  All the products here are under the Microsoft  Sobre K Dynamics 365, which until now was their CRM ERP platform.  But suddenly it's their augmented reality platform, too.  So they're clearly they see this as a cloud service  that happens to have some hardware.  But it doesn't matter if it's not their hardware.  Here's Tim Sweeney, who reminded me so much of the guy.  I should turn the audio on for this in.  Wait a minute.  So we're starting with the Unreal Engine.  Holland support is up and running now.  He's the geek in that Ready Player One.

And I mean, brought to you by we use Atlassian.  We're an Atlassian house.  So Atlassian, everybody's familiar, I think, probably with Jira,  which is their agile tool, which helps you plan projects,  figure out who's responsible, see what stage the project's in.  It's a very satisfying tool to use when you complete a project.  You move it over to the completed column.  We love Jira and Jira integrates very nicely with Atlassian's Confluence,  which is what we use to document everything.  That's so important.  You can do things, but you need to tell the world,  the other people in the department, plus your stakeholders,  what you've done, how you use it.  Confluence is great for that.  But look how many other applications there are.  There's Bitbucket if you've got code databases to maintain.  There's Jira Service Desk.  There's Trello. They acquired Trello.  It's a fantastic project manager.  They also have Ops Solutions like Ops Genie and Statish Page,  which will help you better detect incidents, coordinate response efforts  to resolve issues faster.  And of course, as always, everything integrates with Jira and Confluence  so you can keep customers and stakeholders up to date.  It's not just for developers.  I think a lot of people think of Jira and they say, oh, it's a developer.  Atlassian's developer tool.  No, no, no.  Atlassian offers an affordable, reliable suite of tools for teams of all sizes,  from DevOps to Agile, IT apps to Ops to ITSM and whatever's next.

Transcript:  I think one of the biggest stories of the week,  maybe it's my imagination, but I think one of the biggest stories  of the week is that Apple is planning to team up with Goldman Sachs  to release a credit card and a credit card that will work with your iPhone.  Seth, for a long time, we've been saying Apple should get in a credit card business.  Is this a surprise to you? Is this a good move?

Start time: 3215.96
End time: 3241.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's not a surprise.  Goldman has a pretty good reputation among the banks.  But, you know, like I'm kind of wondering where they go with it, because,  at the end, this all ends up being in Apple's coffers, right?  Like Apple can team up with any bank and have a credit card,  but it's all coming through the iPhone.

Start time: 3242.12
End time: 3244.34

Start time: 3245.32
End time: 3257.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm kind of curious about that.  I wonder if it's going to be tied to investment accounts or or, you know,  some other play. I don't really understand.  Yeah, I don't understand why Goldman is in it.  I don't understand.

End time: 3283.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't that interesting?  But they have the financial services, obviously, to to do it,  and they have the name to do it.  It makes sense for Apple, which is trying to find new forms of revenue  outside of selling hardware, right?  This is one of those. Absolutely.  That's how you build this service number, which is almost 10 billion dollars  a year already.

Start time: 3286.10
End time: 3305.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  I think, you know, Apple knows it's got the gateway to just about everything  with the phone.  So they're going up and down the value chain,  you know, clipping new new revenue models.  So I don't think that it's surprising at all.  But it'll be interesting to see what angle they take here.

Start time: 3306.40
End time: 3333.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is a Wall Street Journal scoop from Trip Mikkel,  Liz Hoffman and Peter Ruddiger.  They say the card will be rolled out to employees for testing  in the next few weeks, officially launched later this year.  The companies hope to lure card holders by offering them extra features  on Apple's Wallet app, which will let them set spending goals,  track their rewards, manage their balances.  Really, this could be the beginning.  And maybe this makes sense, Seth, of Apple as a bank.

Start time: 3334.76
End time: 3362.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep. It's kind of what it sounds like.  You know, Apple would be the retail end of Goldman Sachs.  Yeah. And, you know, a lot of those services that were just mentioned  are available not through Apple, but through, you know,  an app case. Yeah.  And apps on your phone. Right.  So this would be, I guess, built into your Apple account somehow  or directly into the phone rather than having to have a separate app.  I'm not sure.

I can't remember where I heard this.  Maybe it was in the Big Short or something.  But the best way to make money is not to try to get all the money,  but just to take a little piece of every transaction.  And that's exactly what this is. Right.  If Apple's involved in every financial transaction you make  and gets a few percentage points on that, that's.

Well, yeah, I mean, maybe you get a bank,  maybe get a bank account with your Apple ID, you know, like every single  Apple customer has, you know, a Goldman account.  And, you know, your default credit card is the Apple credit card.  And, you know, all these things kind of come together.

Transcript:  This is Goldman's first credit card, but I didn't know this in 2016.  They launched an online bank, Marcus.  I'd never heard of this.  Marcus, which is still around.  And so there's some thinking that maybe Apple,  which has a loyal following among wealthy, tech savvy young adults,  could drive customers to the Marcus Bank.  Who knows?

How do you how do you like it, Father Robert?  No fee personal loan. I'm looking at their website.  No fee personal loans, high yield online savings.  Wow. APR and a savings account, two point two five percent.  I think I think I've got to I think I might move saving for that next MacBook Pro.  I have an online only bank.  I don't goes to into a bank anymore.  I use USAA, which is a great company.  Well, because they don't have branches, they you can use any ATM

Apparently, Goldman's putting 200 million dollars into  adding customer support call centers, building an internal system to handle payments,  you know, beefing up Marcus.  And this is a major investment, said people familiar with the matter  at a time when the bank is trying to cut costs.  So it's interesting.  I could see Apple maybe saying, well, let's let's partner.  If it goes well, we'll just buy you out.

Transcript:  Anyway, this is something we've talked about many times on Mac  Break Weekly is if you know, if Apple is going to rely on services,  what it really means for Apple, since iPhone sales are down,  you can't count on Mac or iPad sales to buoy you up.  You don't have the next big thing yet.  In fact, the Apple's even saying this on their on their analyst calls.  It's all about services. Yep.  How do you what do you do to replace that kind of revenue,  which is significant?

Transcript:  Banking, that's why Microsoft is doing so well, because they  they kind of floated on those services that were working for them.  And Apple sees that it is thinking ahead.  All right. Well, there's only so much more time we have left  to make money off of all this hardware.  Eventually, eventually it's going to stall a little bit  because everybody will have their hardware and.  Can't you know?  Can't keep upgrading.

Start time: 3668.56
End time: 3681.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, but that's one more reason.  It's one more reason to buy an Apple watch and an iPhone  is because I do all my banking on it. Right.  And I can't do that on my Android phone.  Don't you bet they won't do it on an Android phone.

End time: 3750.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sure you're rooting for him, but still. Absolutely.  He should be writing for nine to five Mac.  Of course. Not this Bloomberg.  Anyway, he's kept his sources.  Apparently, he says Apple plans to come.  This is interesting.  The first thing I'd heard earlier was that Apple wants to encourage  iPad developers to make their apps Mac compatible.  And there's an SDK.  It would require recompiling.  Now, Mark's saying that's this year.  But going forward, by 2021, Apple plans to combine iPhone,  iPad and Macintosh apps.  So there's one platform.  Is that your understanding of this, Seth?

Start time: 3751.50
End time: 3786.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, so combine this with the news  also this week that  Macs are going to Apple chips  going with Intel. Arm based. Yeah. Arm based chips.  I would assume that, you know, Apple 12, 13, 14, whatever.  So you're kind of merging, really, the platforms at this point.  So, you know, to you looking two years out,  you kind of see that the Mac is going to be kind of like an iOS device  at that point. OK, project.  So, you know, and if you're pulling.

Start time: 3786.56

Start time: 3801.48
End time: 3810.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the idea by 2021, when you write that app,  it will work on any of those three platforms.  And you're right, Seth, key to that is putting Mac on arm. Right.

Start time: 3810.90
End time: 3887.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or an Apple's version.  And they're kind of like with Marzipan, they're kind of like,  you know, here's our road map.  Here's our three year plan, you know, to get developers to write  one app for both, you know, like you most developers writing for iOS  because there's, you know, to so many more people on iOS than Mac.  So iOS apps will work on Mac.  And then theoretically, everybody comes over, except maybe like  parallels isn't going to work on  non Intel chips.  And, you know, obviously Adobe's got a lot of work to do  to get their desktop apps, you know, the bigger, more complicated stuff  that's got a lot of legacy  Intel code, it's going to be hard.  But, you know, this is one of those things.  This is like Apple going from PowerPC to Intel.  It's just a transition over a period of time.  And we kind of know like it's not official yet.  We kind of know what that looks like.  You know, with Mark's reporting and others.  You know, it looks like we're about three years away from a, you know,  when it's fully engaged and maybe this year, Tim Cook or somebody else  kind of shows that roadmap a little bit better.  So the developers are really on board.

Start time: 3888.78
End time: 3897.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is going to benefit the rest of us as well, because I am hearing like  Adobe is going to have to go in and do some work.  And we have all these other suites.  But Adobe is working on it.

Start time: 3897.52
End time: 3926.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They already have Photoshop's getting more and more capable.  Lightroom's getting more and more capable, both on iOS.  Adobe announced at their last conference that they were going to make a photo  full Photoshop for iOS.  Truthfully, a lot of the pro apps are Apple's own apps.  Final Cut, Logic, their, you know, pages.  And so I think Apple must have been working on this for some time.  Try, you know, how is it working out for Microsoft?

Start time: 3926.08
End time: 3933.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because this is what I was sort of clumsily referring to before.  But but I wonder how it's working out for Microsoft.

Start time: 3933.20
End time: 4025.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The history of this, you all know the history.  This is terrible.  The idea of cross platform apps is a is littered with strewn bodies.  Remember Java Swing, the idea that you'd write once.  Swing would give you a quote, native UI on every platform.  It was a disaster.  I mean, everybody agrees.  Actually, there's an interesting tie in to this because Linus Torvalds  showed his prickly side this week when he said, you have to be an idiot  to think that ARM is going to make it in the server room, he says,  because developers want their software as a service applications  to run the same platform they developed it on.  They develop it on x86.  They want it to run on x86.  Nobody in his right mind really wants to do cross compiling or,  you know, one size fits all.  You write an application for native.  But this could be where Linus missed the boat, because if all of a sudden  one of the biggest players, Apple.  Goes all ARM.  Maybe ARM servers are suddenly a very, very good idea  for software as a service and web app, progressive web apps and other stuff.  Maybe you are developing native.  But I have to say,  the conventional wisdom has always been you develop the best app  is not the app you develop for both Android and iOS.  It's the app you develop for that platform.  An Apple app or an iPad app  is not as good as, you know, if it's just an iPhone app, it needs to.  You need to develop specifically for that platform.  How do you get around that?

Start time: 4028.44
End time: 4050.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it's a good question.  I guess what they're hoping for in the long term is that, you know,  you're going to be developing on an iOS Mac.  Or an iOS desktop device.  So you're going to be developing iOS on iOS.  And that's got to be the idea.  I don't know.  I don't have any other developing for Android on the Chromebook.

Start time: 4050.28
End time: 4111.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I see the benefit. I do see the benefit for Apple.  Apple does not want to be it does not want to be.  They've had to wait for Intel.  And in fact, if you if you can criticize Apple for its slow development  of a Mac Pro or new iMacs or new Mac mini's, it's because Intel just can't deliver.  So they're sick of that.  Qualcomm and Apple are in huge fight.  Suing each other, owing each other billions.  Just, you know, Apple is and Steve Jobs always said, by the way,  it's his 64th would be in 64th birthday today.  Steve Jobs always said, you want to make the software,  you got to own the hardware, you got to do it both.  And he always wanted a single source, everything he hates the idea.  He hated the idea of going to Intel and buying chips.  So, of course, there's a benefit for Apple.  But the question is, but then is there a benefit for consumers?  You know, and are we going to be as happy?  I know as a Mac user, I'm not I'm not looking forward to using my iPad  for anything I use my Mac for.  I've tried. It's a nightmare.

Transcript:  But no, like I think about the way that I use, you know, I'm an Android  and the way that I use essentially Google Drive, Gmail, all of that stuff.  And it is the experience is fundamentally the same on my PC  as it is on my phone. Right.  And this is kind of in theory, this is what it looks like for the consumer,  like across the board, no matter what you're using. Right.  And to me, that that sounds great being able to,  I don't know, use Adobe products on my phone the same way that I do  or a similar way that I do on my machine.  I mean, so many of us are doing that all the time anyway, as as people  who are working increasingly all the time, we're like trying to like open  the thing on our phone instead of our computer because our computer  is not in front of us. Right.  So in theory, it would be great to be able to have that experience.

And that services aren't going to grow unless you start a bank  offer a credit card and hardware is not going to grow unless you unify  your bestseller iPhone with everything else.

Actually, I saw an article, I don't know if it's in our rundown today,  saying that actually there's been a huge shakeup in Apple's executive  over the last year.  And of course, the most recent is Angela Arens, who was a very talented  executive in charge of retail, leaving after only five years.

I want to make video like I want to make movies like that doesn't seem like  something he would. That's Eddie Q all the way, right?  Right. And and like, you know, I have to say, like I'm a big Apple fan.  I like Eddie Q's stuff  isn't always Apple's best stuff.  And like I have to admit it as well, like every announcement that we cover  that, you know, Apple's getting into this or that or whatever.  I'm like, none of it is interesting to me.  Like it's just, you know, like the app game show.  Like that was like, oh, that was terrible. Just painful.  It was painful. And so I don't know that Apple's going to be  super successful in this area.  You know, I hope I hope they are.  I hope there's some interesting stuff that comes out of this.

Transcript:  We're expecting, at least according to John Patchkowski,  I think German confirmed it.  March 25th, Apple is hoping to roll out this new movie service  and the new news service.  The journal is also reporting that there are some hitches in that get along,  including publishers.  I'm sure the Wall Street Journal is one of them.  New York Times.  I'm certainly another one.  Washington Post, maybe a third that don't like Apple's plan,  which includes a 50 percent of the take.  What the journal is reporting, again, this is not Apple.  This is rumor is that Apple has approached magazines and newspapers saying,  look, here's the deal.  It's going to be 10 bucks a month.  We're keeping five.  We'll take the other five, we'll pull it.  And whoever gets the most views will get the biggest chunk of that.  We'll divide it up based on engagement.  And where's the bonus coming from?  I don't know.  We talked a lot about this on MacBreak Weekly.  I think the consensus was absolutely any national magazine,  magazines have a hard time as it is, any national magazine will probably  welcome the new eyeballs and whatever revenue that they can get out of this.  They're struggling anyway.  It's the local newspapers that are going to say, well, wait a minute,  on the Boston Globe, I have a big Boston audience.  I'm not giving them to you, Apple, because Apple is going to take half the revenue  and they're not going to give me the names of subscribers or any information  about them.  Maybe the national papers like the Times and the Post and the Journal,  it maybe makes sense for it, but doesn't make sense for any regional publisher.  As of Chronicle?  Chronicle, no.

It just feels like they're kind of on the edge at all times.  It almost feels like he keeps them on the edge at all times.  Maybe that's part of his thing.  But it's frustrating as a Tesla fan, Tesla owner, that I have to go around kind of saying,  yes, I know he's insane.  Why do we have to go through all of this?  The cars are quite nice.  They built themselves a really good network of chargers and a Gigafactory that's building  tons of batteries that are helping Puerto Rico and Australia.

Transcript:  You know, that would be appropriate.  That'd be good.  YouTube's had a little trouble of late.  A little, a little, a little, a little bit.  Disney's pulling their ads from YouTube.  Quite a few companies.  Yeah, it's not just Disney.  Not just Disney.  And it all started with a Wired UK report.  It was kind of creepy about now.  So the headline was on YouTube, a network of pedophiles is hiding in plain sight.  The issue is though, there are a lot of videos on YouTube of young children, young children  swimming, dancing, doing yoga.  Opening gifts, opening their toys, showing what they bought.  Sometimes there might be some exposed body parts, underwear.  I think my sense is that these are uploaded by the kids themselves or by family members  completely innocently, right?  But what happens, I guess, man, the internet, I'll tell you, humans are messed up, is pedophiles  find them and then they share them.  And in fact, in the comments, they'll put timestamps for the best juicy parts of the  video.  Plus you're seeing people, kids creating new videos, responding to comments from the pedophiles.  So there's this whole vicious cycle.  And what's worse is their recommendation engine then recommends more of this.  And it was quite a shock to Alfa Romeo, Fiat, Fortnite, Grammarly, L'Oreal, Maybelline,  Peloton, singlemuslims.com and other major banner, major advertisers, including Disney,  that their ads were appearing on these videos in this environment.  The response to this Wired article, which was earlier this week, is a lot of these companies,  a couple of companies said, like Grammarly said, we need to know more.  And a few, not a few companies said, we're not advertising on YouTube.  We're pulling out.  Now, I'm sure YouTube will fix it.

End time: 5567.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good question.  This has been going on for some time.  YouTube apparently said, promised they would fix similar problems two years ago.  It's been YouTube's policy since 2017 to disable comments on videos where users are saying  inappropriate things.

Transcript:  There's there's like I think there's three really interesting things about this piece  to me.  One is that a lot of this stuff is programmatic advertising.  Right.  So.  These guys aren't buying those.

Start time: 5641.28
End time: 5643.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  And I don't blame the companies at all.

Start time: 5644.98
End time: 5689.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you would think that YouTube.  So there has to be a technology solution there.  Right.  There has to be some way for YouTube to think about the way that it sells programmatic advertising,  I guess, or maybe these companies to think about like where they are buying programmatic  advertising.  But also, I think there's this huge problem where and this is a problem on Facebook, too.  This problem of too much content for these tech platforms to like accurately police or  effectively police is a problem across platforms.  Right.  And I think that these companies actually they need to do way more than they're doing.  They need to take a stance.

Start time: 5689.50
End time: 5710.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  None of them are taking a stance.  They're just like, oh, well, we'll just do this for these people.  We'll do this for this people.  And it's frustrating as a consumer because it's like you're letting all of this bad  stuff in.  This is why Twitter is suffering.  This is why Facebook is suffering.  Our social networks are suffering because of this, because the tech companies are not  taking a stance.  How important are comments?

Start time: 5710.14
End time: 5717.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When their answer is we'll tweak the algorithm.  Sure.  Because the algorithm.  We need to do better.  Well, this is what Google and Facebook and others do.

Start time: 5717.30

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They blame the algorithm.

Start time: 5719.23
End time: 5791.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  But the algorithm is programmed by people.  It is fed in by people.  And if you have people who are not thinking about these things in the giant scope, like  Why are we not having sociologists work on these on these tech things to talk about what  might be what might become of these technologies?  We're not looking at these from a societal scope.  We're doing the Facebook move fast and break things thing, which and things are breaking.  And you know, when I was overseas over the holiday, visiting my family in Romania, I  had to keep reminding them like they haven't gotten the full news of how bad.  YouTube is just yet the way that I have being in Silicon Valley, like knowing what's going  on here.  It's hard to say don't leave the kid with YouTube all day on the phone because there  are the algorithm is going to let you down and your kid is going to see something that  is bad, whether it is commentary from other people, whether they are videos that I mean,  surely you've all heard of the weird videos that are being sliced together.  It's there's a lot of programmatic videos for kids.  Yeah, it's just like it's some really creepy, dangerous stuff.

Start time: 5791.04
End time: 5797.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't blame YouTube that much, though.  I mean, how many hours of video are uploaded every second?  I don't know if there's any.

Start time: 5797.88
End time: 5805.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We can't blame them, but they have to.  I mean, you have to think about this when you're creating.  I mean, if it's an issue, you need to fix it.

Transcript:  So do these brands come back?  I mean, YouTube deleted 400 accounts.  They've deleted millions of comments to these brands.  Come back.

Start time: 5828.56
End time: 5829.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sure they come back.

Start time: 5829.70
End time: 5831.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you can't not be on YouTube.

Start time: 5832.26
End time: 5903.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but so YouTube's got a fundamental problem where they they have an algorithm and  it's not catching this stuff.  So they make the algorithm smarter or they make it tighter and maybe they get more false.  You know, they pull some normal stuff out of the comments accidentally.  But the bad folks are going to figure it out and they're going to get worse.  And it's going to be cat and mouse.  And I think YouTube has to kind of change their policy.  And I think this kind of goes for Facebook and Twitter as well, that they have to kind  of tie the identity of the commenter to a real person if this is ever going to go away  and have some sort of responsibility.  Like if this person is posting pedophilia stuff, you can go to his, you know, you know,  who he is.  You can call his police publicly shamed and all the other stuff.  So I don't think it's going to change until that happens.  You know, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube all know that they would lose a lot of engagement if  they did that.  Anonymous commenters are a large part of these platforms, unfortunately.  But I think this doesn't end until that happens.

Start time: 5904.18
End time: 5915.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But what that does is it emphasizes that engagement is phony.  Right.  Because if you're going to lose engagement, if you acquire real names, then this isn't  real engagement.

Start time: 5916.89
End time: 5955.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I understand.  I mean, there are people behind a lot of this, you know, obviously some of its bots, but  there are, you know, sick, demented people, but they still buy like yogurt and they still  buy, you know, shaving cream or whatever.  So like.  They're still there.  It's real engagement.  It's just you don't know who the person is.  And you would think like Google, like, hey, we're building this huge dossier on this  person.  You can sell them much better ads if they sign in to their YouTube account and comment  that way.  You would think that would be a motivation for them.  But I think for them, it's just raw numbers and raw people.

He never reads the comments, doesn't leave comments.  He watches the videos.  The recommendation system is important.  That's another problem YouTube's got to solve.

Is is they there where they're coming from is like, oh, we don't want to make  decisions about free speech, right?  Like we don't want to decide that one thing is is dangerous and the other thing is not.  I don't want to take sides.  And what are the threats?  And that's how they sidestep it.  One of the threats, of course, is regulation, government regulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's something that nobody wants.  But maybe they want some limited government regulation.  They don't want all the states.  But the truth is, I'm not I wouldn't worry about government regulation because that's  the other see me side of this, is that the the government is hand in hand with these  companies because they provide them with valuable surveillance information and which the  governments want.  So it seems to me they're they're unlikely to enforce privacy and other restrictions on these  companies because it's an unholy alliance.

Some people say that the reason the Wall Street Journal is so quick to castigate Google and  Facebook is because they're the biggest threats to the Wall Street Journal's business model.  On the other hand, I think this is very good reporting.  This is Sam, Sam Schechner.  You give apps sensitive personal information.  They tell Facebook.  We all know that the Facebook app on your phone is spying on you.  But did you know that millions of smartphone users are confessing intimate secrets to apps  which then turn around and send it on to Facebook?  Here's a face an app called Flow.  I'm sorry.  Period and ovulation tracker.

Start time: 6527.24
End time: 6555.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's awful because that is extremely personal data.  Even if you don't have a Facebook account.  That's the data of your ovulation that's like incredibly personal to your cycle.  That is not something that I want to have be monetized, especially if that person ends  up not getting pregnant and they've been trying so hard and then that stuff is used to sell  you stuff.

End time: 6597.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  It includes data about the user's device as well as other data.  Flow defines such as the fact that the user may be ovulating.  Then Facebook can often match that data with actual Facebook users.  Facebook lets developers use their own custom events to target ads at their users.

Start time: 6598.08
End time: 6610.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's so awful because if that person can't conceive, they're just being reminded, no,  oh my gosh, that's terrible.  I'm also feeling very because I do have friends who are, again, trying and using this app.

Transcript:  Well, remember that article, this was some years ago and it seemed like science fiction  at the time that Target knew somebody was pregnant before a family did because of her  shopping patterns.  Facebook said some of the data sharing uncovered by the journal's testing appeared to  violate its business terms, which instruct app developers not to send it health,  financial information or other categories of sensitive information.  So this is so Facebook playbook.  Oh, it's doing that?  Oh, that we never heard.  That's sorry.  We're going to fix that right now.  Like that's how Facebook works.  Facebook says it's telling apps to stop sending information and it may take additional  action if the apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I also want to talk to the developers of Flow because I want to know why this is  in the back end of the app.  So they can sell ads.

Start time: 6682.00
End time: 6689.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's a monetization strategy.  It's a more complicated one than just putting ads in Flow.  Instead, they're going to put ads on your Facebook page based on stuff you told.

Start time: 6689.42
End time: 6697.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would rather pay for an app so it doesn't do any of that.  In fact, a lot of the apps now that I use on my Android phone, I would rather pay for  the data to just stay local, backup and restore on my Dropbox.  I'll give you $3 a month and just don't just give it to you.  Just give you the money to use your app.  Just stop sending my data places.

Transcript:  It's a place to go where you are safe from prying eyes and a great night's sleep is one  of life's greatest luxuries, isn't it?  I mean, honestly, how much would you pay for a great night's sleep?  Well, if you go to the mattress store around the corner, you're paying way, way too much.  Actually, this is how Casper got started.  Casper's founders, as with any smart startup, they were looking for inefficiencies in the  marketplace and the biggest inefficiency of all is the mattress business.  Mattress manufacturers sell their mattresses to mattress stores, which then mark them up  100% and more so that you can come in and buy it from them.  That's why mattresses are ridiculously expensive.  Casper said, wait a minute, we can make our great mattresses in the United States.  We can engineer them to really be perfect and just sell them direct to customers and  we would be able to cut the price significantly.  No reseller, no showroom.  We'll just pass the savings on to you.  But then there's a problem because we think and this is the message I want to get out.  We think that you should go to a showroom and lie in a mattress before you buy it.  But in fact, that is not the way to test a mattress.  I've done it many times and always buy the wrong mattress.  It feels different in the showroom somehow.  You are fully clothed.  It's broad daylight and there's some salesperson looking down her nose at you.  You can't really enjoy it.  So what Casper does is they give you, I love this, 100 days in your house, in a real  environment. If at any time in the first 100 days you say this isn't the mattress for me,  you call them up, they will come, they will get it, they will refund you every penny.  No trouble.  I have the original Casper mattress that combines multiple supportive memory foams for a  sleep surface with just the right sink and just the right bounce.  It's kind of magical.  It's firm but soft.  It's hard to describe.  You've got to try it.  And it's breathable.  This is so important.  Sleeping cool is really important to a good night's sleep.  The Casper mattress breathes so you can regulate your temperature throughout the night.  Long lasting comfort and support with an obsessively engineered mattress for an  exceptionally comfortable sleep experience.  I think you'll love Casper.  They uphold the highest environmental production standards.  They're made in the United States.  They come in a surprisingly compact box.  You open it up, there's the mattress.  It smells great.  You don't have to air it out.  I remember buying a mattress from a big company a few years ago and you have to air it out  for three days because it smells so bad.  Not the Casper.  We slept on it immediately that night.  In fact, here's the Casper.  This is a queen in a box that you could easily heft up the stairs yourself.  I sent my son in college when he first started to sleep in the dorms.  He said, this is a disgusting mattress.  We sent him a Casper mattress, a twin.  He was able to bring it upstairs and it was so affordable that after four years, he said,  what do I do with the mattress?  I said, I'll leave it there.  The next guy, I'll appreciate a nice mattress.  You're going to love your Casper.  Free shipping and yes, if you don't like it, free returns in the US and Canada.  You will like it.  I know.

A British parliamentary committee which spent months last year investigating online  political disinformation singled out Facebook for disingenuous and bad faith  responses to democratic concerns about the misuse of people's data.  The committee called for Facebook's use of user data to be investigated by the UK  data watchdog.  In fact, the information commissioner's office suggested Facebook needs to change  its business model, warning the company risks burning user trust for good.  That is a risk, isn't it?  The ICO also called for an ethical pause of social media ads for election  campaigning.  So maybe in the UK, Facebook's going to get its come up.  It's remembered Mark Zuckerberg refused to go and testify to Parliament, although he  is happy apparently to meet behind the scenes with various government officials.

Transcript:  Facebook has killed the Onavo app.  So this was the app they got in trouble with Apple, Apple banned it, then took the  code from the Onavo app, put it in a different app, which they continue to use.  Facebook does did until recently continue to make it available on Android because  Android doesn't have the same controls on the app store.  Yeah.  And confidential emails, according to Computer Weekly, show that Facebook planned  to use its Android app to track the location of its customers and to allow  advertisers to send political advertising and invites to dating sites to people they  thought were single.  Says a confidential documents that were seen by Computer Weekly also reveal plans  by Facebook to pass data on single Facebook users to companies selling data services.  Oh my God.  The documents marked confidential revealed a secret program by Facebook's growth team.  There it is that growth team again to collect and exploit data from customers with  Android mobile phones.

Transcript:  But yeah, $799 and $899.  You get a S10e.  And if you really want, you get a bigger screen, the S10+.  Or if that's a thousand.  But you could start to add things.

And then it turns out you can't get the ceramic back and anything less than 512  gigs of storage for a phone.  And I thought, well, as long as I'm spending $1250,  I might as well spend $1500 and get a terabyte of storage.  Why not?  And 12 gigs of RAM.  But now you're at the fold.  And I'm practically fold priced at this point.
