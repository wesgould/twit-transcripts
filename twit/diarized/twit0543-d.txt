Hi, I'm Leo LaForte and we first of all want to thank you all  for being here for this episode and I presume many other episodes this year. TwiT is the number one  station on the network twiT. The number one show I should say on the network twiT and  it's kind of because it was our first show. It's kind of a special place in my heart. I love doing  it every Sunday afternoon. We're always very grateful that people watch in such great numbers  and we try to do the best job of the week on the twiT show. What we've got today for you is a best  of. We've done this in years past. Jason Howell worked very hard with your input on finding some  of the best clips from 2015. We'll be back next week with a brand new full show for you. But  in the meantime, would you join me in going a little bit through some memories, a little trip  down memory lane. Starting off and you'll see a lot of him in this show because it was kind of his  year with Owen JJ Stone and Jason Snell and me. You may notice a little difference in my appearance  on this clip. Something changed dramatically for me early in the year. Watch also here,  Owen JJ Stone. Oh, doctor from Owen JJ Stone.com. And he's got this for you. He's got some shaving  cream. Actually you're on for, well, you're on because we love you because you're great. But  you're also on to give me some advice because so we did a, you may know we did a 24 hour broadcast,  great success on New Year's Eve to, we call it the 24 hours of 2015. Second year in a row we've done  it in which we say happy new year in every time zone, all 27 time zones in those 24 hours. In fact,  we had callers for many of the time zones. It was great fun. And, but what we did differently this  year was we were raising money for UNICEF. I think a really great cause, the United Nations  Children's Fund helps kids all over the world who need inexpensive things like mosquito nets,  more elaborate things like education helps kids be safe from violence and exploitation. Really  a great cause. Charity Navigator ranks them among its highest charities. That's what we,  we wanted to use it because it was global. So everybody who's watching all over the world  can get behind it. And because it is such a really well run charity, but we, and we had planned,  we thought we'd raise 20,000. That was our goal in the 24 hours because, you know, I just,  I thought, well, this first time we've done it, we have really no idea, but let's say 20,000.  Jeff Jarvis, who's, you know, of course the wonderful host of This Week in Google,  very kindly said, well, let me get things started. I will, I will shave for the first time in 42  years. I will shave my beard if you raise $20,000. Amazingly, we raised $20,000 before noon.  So, so Jeff kindly let me shave him, his beard, which I did a terrible job. He had to go back and  fix it up. But then that, and this is my, I'm saying this as an excuse, cause then I got swept away  and I said, well, if we make first, then Sarah Lane pitched in, she said, if we get to $30,000,  I'll sing, I'll, I'll sing my, the song I hate more than any other song with a passion,  Bare Naked Ladies, One Week. And she did, we, we did, and she did. And that was great. So I got,  I said, I have to, I have to end up, I have to pony up, I have to participate. So I said,  if we make $40,000, I'll shave my head. And if we make $50,000, I'll, and this, I thought,  there's never going to happen. This is safe. I will get a tattoo. And you see, those of you  watching a video, I'm padding, the padded part of my anatomy. That's where the tattoo went.  So yeah, we got $40,000 and ladies and gentlemen, there's nothing left up top.  And, and we also got 15,000, $50,000. In fact, we ended up, in fact, you can still, you can put us  over, I think we're well over 70 now. If you go to unicefusa.org slash twit, we're at 61,000,  but there's more than 10,000 from our auction. So we're well over 70. I'd love to get even higher.  We're going to keep that site open if you'd like to help out unicefusa.org slash twit. So I had to,  actually, initially we had my, I had my head clipped and a number of people said, you know,

I'll just grow, I'll grow used to it. I did,  I was freezing last night. I realized that you need a cap. Do you wear a night cap?  Yeah, I have hats. I have to wear a hat. Yeah. And when you go outside- I don't wear a night cap.  I'm going to wear a night cap, dude. And I think frankly now this is for the first time ever,  this pork pie hat looks good. This was, this was, you know, this is the Breaking Bad look. I need to  grow goatee. So now I decided I'm not going to shave either. I'm just going to get, as long as  I'm scritchy, I'm going to let all be, I'm going to let it all grow out. See, we'll have a race.  See what grows faster.

Well, they did a Walkman. We  had it for review on Before You Buy this year that does HD tracks, which is nice. It does the high res  music. I don't know what this does.

Yeah, I don't know what  the point is. My phone plays music. Every phone plays music. Right. That's what happened to the  iPod. Exactly. So what is the point of this and why did you do it? I'd rather you bring out a  tape deck and do something nostalgic for me as opposed to that. What's funny is that Sony does

Start time: 870.62
End time: 874.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

End time: 887.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, actually, I don't have it.  It's not on TV here.  So it's more muddling along with the game.

End time: 897.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Can we point a camera at the- we kind of figured,  because I got to do this without violating NFL rules,  but I think we could feed you our video and then you'd really be distracted.

End time: 924.56

End time: 933.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  You know what?  You got Aaron Rodgers.  He's got a great two-minute drill.  I think it's not over till the linebacker sings.

Start time: 934.06
End time: 939.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I looked at the times actually, and I think I must have miscalculated the time zone,  because I was sure it'd be well over by now, but that's fine.

Start time: 941.54
End time: 945.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Well, you're not watching.  What are you watching?  Like a text feed?  Are you somebody texting you the score?

Start time: 945.68
End time: 948.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I mean, you could follow the game cast.

Start time: 948.32
End time: 1030.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, in NFL.com, they have kind of a thing.  I'll give you a play-by-play.  No, I mean, it's my...  So now a big guy in a black outfit.  As he's...  It looks like he's wearing tights, I have to say, and he's running.  He's kicking the ball.  It looks like it was...  He kicked it all the way down to the other end.  So that's good, right?  And then a guy's running with it, but they...  Oh my God, they're hurting him.  And then...  That's why we are running.  So Aaron Rodgers has 12 game-winning drives and 37 opportunities.  He's 32% for this particular situation.  But I tell you, there are not many quarterbacks in the NFL you'd rather have there.  I'll tell you what, Ben, you keep watching the game.  There we go.  There we go.  We have the footage now.  I dialed in a feed direct from the game.  Number one is running around.  He's running.  Really exciting game.  Number two is in a fist fight, it looks like, but he's falling down now.  And now number one's running around in a circle.  He's actually deciding to go back the other way.  The most crazy game.  And number two is again falling down.  That's terrible.  Number one's just running back and forth and forth and back.  It's terrible.  I think that's Russell Wilson, isn't it?  Oh, just the humanity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the Tecmo Bowl.  And you, Bo Jackson, you basically see if you can run the entire quarter.  Oh, that's interesting.  Really?  This is an old classic.  Is it Atari?  Sega?  What is that?  No, this is Nintendo.  Nintendo.  Nintendo.  Nintendo.  Yeah.

Start time: 1052.48
End time: 1056.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yeah.  Tecmo.  So the idea is you just keep running until they tackle you.

Start time: 1056.68
End time: 1064.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Bo Jackson was basically unstoppable in this game.  And so, yeah, the goal was to do a running play on the first play and then see if you  could run out the entire quarter.

Start time: 1066.34
End time: 1075.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  And I guess this is a speed run because, yeah, Bo Jackson, touchdown.  There you go.  Bo knows football and baseball.

He put a little green film over a flashlight and go in and look through my notebook and  my journal and be reading in the middle of the night like I didn't see him doing it.  I'm going to be spying on her so bad, she's going to wish NSA would come in here and slow me down.  She'll say whatever you want.  My daughter's in jujitsu.  She's a striker.  She's a basketball.  When she goes out on a date, talking about Mr. Stone bring back a 930.  You won't come on when she wants to.  She's an international spy.  And then she will break your neck.  I'm going to be all up in her grill.  So I'm not worried about safety.  Because these other kids we got to worry about on the 3DSs and the computers the parents don't pay.  It's all about parents paying attention and I'll be paying attention.  I agree with you.

Transcript:  And you'll be wearing those shades.  We'll have more of the best of 2015 on This Week in Tech.  I hope you're enjoying the show.  I hope you had a great holiday season.  Your Hanukkah, your Christmas, your Kwanzaa, your winter solstice.  I hope you have a great new year as well.  And we're going to kick off the new year next week with brand new shows.  But we have some more highlights from the year past in just a bit.  But first I want to thank Squarespace for being such a great sponsor.  Not just for 2015 but frankly for many years on the network.  And I'm glad too.  This was the year that I'm finally listening to my own ads after doing them for years.  We've used Squarespace for many things including our Inside Twit blog forever.  But I had never moved my personal website to Squarespace because I thought,  oh I got to know how WordPress works and other blogging platforms.  Finally I just got tired.  I just got tired of the constant security updates.  It turned out I was spending more time on my blog updating it than I was putting content in.  So this is it.  This is my new Squarespace site at leoville.com.  And I took advantage of a Squarespace feature I love which is the cover page.  I have a slideshow on the cover page.  And I've been adding to it over time.  That's Christopher Michael picture if you're watching the video.  Here are me and Jeff and Gina at Google I.O. a couple of years ago.  Wedding pictures are there too.  And I love that cover page feature.  But I also have my blog there, my photo blog.  Squarespace is a great way to share your life, to share your business,  to put up an online store.  And in every case it just looks gorgeous because Squarespace is designed so you can  build it beautiful.  You can reflect your personal aesthetic.  You're going to start with these professionally designed templates.  I almost hate to use the word templates because really what these are is just starting points  for you.  They have design features.  They all have e-commerce built in.  And every one of them uses state of the art web technology.  Things like mobile responsive design so your site looks great no matter what size screen it's on.  These are things that would be very hard to do yourself.  Squarespace makes it easy.  And of course if you want to get geeky there are hundreds of options.  Customizable settings, fonts, colors, page configurations.  Even a developer platform where you can do your own HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the like.  So Squarespace is kind of the best of both worlds.  A great site for somebody like me just wants to put up content.  A great site for web developers who want to do more, control more.  And you always get such a great looking site that's totally unique.  And that's important too.  That's why I don't like using the word template.  This is not a cookie cutter.  This is a...  There's sites...  Every site looks different.  Every site looks great.  And in no case can you say, oh yeah that's obviously a Squarespace site.  It's obviously your site.  That's what you want.  Power your business with e-commerce from Squarespace.  Squarespace commerce is the only platform that lets you create, manage and brand your store  in a beautiful way.  It doesn't look like a cookie cutter store.  It looks like your site.  Basic plan available, advanced plan too with additional features like shipping.  Plus incredible 24-7 customer support.  If you're a musician, a restaurant, a business, they've got a template for you.  Squarespace.  Look, it's easy.  Just go to squarespace.com and get started.  It costs you nothing.  The free trial doesn't even require a credit card.  So you can really see what's there.  You can even import some of your own content to make sure that site's going to look like you want.  If you decide to buy all I ask is to use a promo code TWIT.  You'll get 10% off and Squarespace will love us a little bit more.  We like that too.  Squarespace.com.  10% off when you use the offer code TWIT, but try it free right now.  Squarespace.  It's the best place to build it.  Beautiful.  I love Squarespace.  Let's continue on.  Some of the best stuff.  This was one that got me a little bit of trouble.  Steve Kovac, Jason Snell, Ben Thompson.  Ben and I got a little fight because I happen to like Android better than iPhone.  In fact, I even said something I might regret later that it's objectively better.  Watch.  Apple probably also gets a pass from journalists who are unwilling to  say be too strongly critical of it because you don't want to look like an idiot when the thing  sells so well.

Start time: 1542.42
End time: 1563.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's not getting a pass though.  That's being totally rational.  The reality is that I think I was on before the iPhone Leo.  I think you were being super skeptical of the sales.  I'm the idiot who keeps saying that.  Right.  Fortunately, most of the time you don't have people like me coming out and reminding you of it.  Yeah.

Start time: 1564.30
End time: 1583.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  No, I don't mind because I honestly don't think that the iPhone is a better device than,  for instance, the Galaxy S6 Edge.  Knocks the iPhone all over the place in so many ways, but that doesn't have anything to do with  why people buy the iPhone apparently.  The same thing with a watch.

Start time: 1584.42

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  If you look at the two and you didn't, if you came from Mars and you didn't know any of the  history and you looked at it, you say, well, I don't understand why people are buying iPhones.  Why would you buy an iPhone?  That thing is constipated as hell.  It's not.  You got to grid icons.  It's horrible.

Start time: 1620.72
End time: 1640.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The problem with this perspective, Leo, is the implication of that is that there's a lot  of people who are dumb in the world.  I'm not saying dumb.  You are, though, because you're saying obviously this is better.  Why do these tens of millions, hundreds of millions of idiots  keep buying an inferior product that costs more?

Start time: 1641.56
End time: 1668.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Like, well, I'm not saying that because that's pretty, that's an insulting thing to say.  Well, yeah, you're not saying I'm saying people are much more polite.  They're not stupid.  They're for whatever reason they're buying into.  Look at people bought windows for years, even though it was a horrible operating system.  But that's what you bought.  That's what everybody bought.  You buy a PC, you're going to buy windows.  You buy a phone, you're going to buy an iPhone.  It's just the default.  It's not that they're dumb.  It's they don't have time to figure out which is better.  They go with the default.

Start time: 1669.50
End time: 1674.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No offense to Jason, but you were dumb to buy a Mac in the 90s.  Maybe in the 90s.

Transcript:  There was a bad, no, I agree, OS 9 and so forth.  Those were dark times.  Or even the odds.

Start time: 1678.86
End time: 1759.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, like the reality is until the internet came along and most of our applications moved  to the internet, there was just lots of stuff you literally could not do on a Mac.  And user experience aside.  And that was changed with the internet, which made it,  which removed that kind of like gate.  There's two different things when it comes to features.  Some stuff is like it's a reason to buy.  And then there's stuff that's a reason not to buy.  And the reason not to buy, if you have it there, it's devastating.  Like Windows Phone, for example.  Not having a competitive set of apps.  And even if the apps you do have, they're all inferior.  That's a reason to not buy.  It doesn't matter how good the user experience is, or how delightful it is to use,  or even if you use all Microsoft services.  You're not going to even consider it because there's a gate there.  And that was the same thing when it came to the Mac.  And to say that people were buying Windows because they were cheap.  I think that's insulting to people.  The reality is most people aren't tech people.  They're not sitting around weighing this stuff.  They have stuff they want to get done.  And people, and in my experience, anecdotally, but normal people who aren't technical at all,  consistently find it's easier to go about their day and it's less frustrating.  And they can do what they want to do more easily and consistently on an iPhone.

Start time: 1761.08
End time: 1777.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I agree with you in the 90s.  That isn't true, though, after, say, 2005, 2004.  But there's a lot of momentum and people continue to buy Windows  and it's still a 95% operating system.  That's my point.  No, you're right.  In the 90s, there was no question.  I'm not talking about the 90s.

Start time: 1779.25
End time: 1783.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Fair enough.  You're the one that brought up the analogy.

Start time: 1784.36
End time: 1798.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Well, but you're the one who said it was the 90s.  I'm saying, let's say, 10 years ago, 2005,  Windows sold out of momentum more than anything else.  Windows Vista or Windows XP sold out of momentum compared to a Mac more than anything else.

Start time: 1799.04
End time: 1809.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I mean, 50% of the market, sorry, I feel like I'm being rough on you,  but 50% of the market is the enterprise market, which again,  there remains very good reasons to buy Windows.  I agree.

Start time: 1809.40
End time: 1812.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  In enterprise, absolutely.  I agree 100%.  I'm not talking about enterprise.

Start time: 1814.22
End time: 1824.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In the consumer market in the US,  Apple is up to, I don't know the exact numbers, but it's not far from 50%.  It's getting there.  Like they are crushing.

Start time: 1824.66
End time: 1829.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  The momentum doesn't last forever.  We live in a world with friction.  We're not in space.

Start time: 1830.84
End time: 1837.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The problem again with analogy is the momentum is in favor of the iPhone.  So I mean, I feel like more people are getting dumb over time.

Start time: 1837.34
End time: 1847.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Does that mean it's better?  Well, I think it's a silly argument.  You like what you like.  But I think just because something sells well doesn't make it better.

Start time: 1847.60
End time: 1911.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I think that's true.  Again, I think objectively you could see that there are, for different people,  different operating systems and platforms could be of value to them.  And I don't think an alien that came down from outer space would  necessarily look at the Android ecosystem and say that is clearly better.  I think that it would depend on what that alien's personal preferences were  and how they wanted to use their phone.  Because I look at Android.  Also, we've got to say the difference between a platform and a product.  I think you could argue that the Galaxy S6 is one of the few,  and in fact, as Ben mentioned, Samsung changing its approach and pulling lots of  features out of the Galaxy in order to create a product that by all accounts is way closer to  what Apple has been doing with hardware and that people really like it.  But a lot of these products aren't there.  A lot of the Android experiences aren't that good.  And so it's not just the operating system platform, it's also the hardware.  And Apple has excelled at that for quite a while now.  And only now are we seeing some Android phones that can match it.

Transcript:  The first screensavers wasn't the first screensavers.  First, what we called it the revenge of the screensavers, I think you may remember.  But the first one was just us sitting around after a Mac world at a brew pub chatting.  And you saw that picture, Jason, because somebody tweeted the picture to  David Prager of the group.  Now you may notice there's one person missing from that group, missing here today.  That's Kevin Rose, who was going to be here, had to get on a plane, couldn't make it.  He has sent a video greeting, which we'll play a little bit later.  But look how fresh-faced Kevin looks.  He looks so young there.  Roger Chang.  That's Patrick Norton's hair sticking out.  That's where you left it.  You might want to check.  The still lovely Sarah Norton to your left, David Prager and me.  I had a recorder and I was very spontaneous.  I didn't plan it.  I said, hey, let's just talk.  We talked for 20 minutes.  30,000 people downloaded that episode.  And I thought, boy, it'd be great if we could...

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  But you were all in different places and it wasn't...  Kevin was in LA and just it wasn't practicable to do a show.  And then I think it was on the radio show a couple months later.  Somebody called him via Skype.  I said, wow, that sounds good.  What if a light went off, we could do a show and everybody be on Skype.  So it was April.  It was in April of 2005 that I said, let's just try this.  We'll call it...  We didn't have a name.  The revenge of the screensavers.  I have a list of things you...  You weren't here, John, but you came soon after.  But I thought...  I was snubbed.  You, Patrick, decided you were leaving Sprint for Verizon.  Who's your carrier now?

Transcript:  Because you're going to keep us on the straight.  Oh, yeah, that's what I'll do.  Oh, yeah.  Some great moments from 2015 on Twitter.  It doesn't make sense to do reruns and podcasts because you can go back and watch any show.  But I like the idea of picking out some great highlights of moments that were really exceptional.  This.  At least for me.  And I think for a lot of people watching was a surprising moment that where we got really deep.  Now, this was the return of Jason Calacanis.  As you know, he and I had a little bit falling out of feud.  And for a couple of years, we didn't have him on the show.  I felt bad about that because I've always loved Jason.  I've always thought he was a great guy.  So I contacted him.  I said, come back on the show.  And we had a wonderful episode.  That whole episode five oh eight is fantastic.  But it was after the show ended.  The things really got good.  And so this is, I think, a great moment with Jason Calacanis and Georgia Dow and Harry McCracken.  Owen, JJ Stone's here again, too.  And me talking about life.  Watch.  I'm really glad that Goldie that you could talk about.  I think that that's fantastic because I didn't know him.  I didn't either.

And he was that guy who just went about in a quiet way and was a mensch.  You know, and we could all take a lesson.  Everybody take a note.  Like bigger ears.

I could be doing better.  I was telling you about how that Elon Musk changed my world earlier this week.  You talking about somebody that you care about makes me think about the things that I do  well and the things I should do better.  And I got to go hug my kid this week.

Transcript:  Life is very perplexing, you know, and we got to have the Padre on, but, you know,  it's very perplexing when the best person you know goes first.  And that's the thing I've been just personally struggling with over the last 48 hours.  It's just like, why?  Well, yeah, it's just like, you know what, if I was talking to another friend,  we play cards with David Sacks and we were just lamenting how like, God, if you if you  took this list of like the great guys, we'd all put him number one.  Wow.  And we would be like, I told David, I was like, you and I would be like number seven,  eight, nine on the list.  Like, we should go first.  Like we missed last.  Why does the guy who's the best go first?  It doesn't make any sense.  And then you think, oh, gosh, the poor kids are going to have to grow up hearing these  stories about how great their dad was.  And, you know, there's something horrible and tragic, obviously.  But then it's also something great that his legacy, I think, is being captured.  You said even the Facebook page was very powerful.  I've spent at least an hour a day reading stuff on the Facebook page or two hours a  day.

And tremendous, tremendous guy.  This is hard to hard to comprehend when I think, you know, you think about the unfairness  of death, right?  And this is something that I don't know any of us will ever be able to comprehend.  And after 9-11, I had this like very like existential crisis being a New Yorker and  having been there of like, why did these people die?  And how is it fair that these people die?  And what does it mean?  You know, and you don't ever get over it, but I think you can change the way you live  and you can change the way you you treat the people around you, you know, and a lot of  you people know me because I'm a public person.  I haven't always been the best person.  I haven't always been nice to people in my writing.  I've been kind of a little bit of a brawler in my life.  And, you know, it's like I've been reassessing that over the last couple of years and trying  to be a better person and better to other people.  Right?  Yeah.  What will be your legacy?

Start time: 2540.15

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I also think-  That's the one lesson that you can take from from that is that like, like our time is really  precious here and relatively fleeting and you don't know what cards you're going to be dealt.  You can only say, how am I going to deal with the cards that I get?  And it's a really hard thing to deal with.  Our culture does not deal exceptionally well with death.  We don't have really great means of helping people through it.  So, you know, it's nice Facebook and memorializing and talking about it is really helpful for  everyone.

You have a limited amount of time.  Yep.  And choose to do with it what you will.  But just know that it's limited.  Yeah.  You know, I have this really deep conversation with my wife.

People that were multi-billionaires that ran huge companies.  And the one thing I took from it is that they were on the last part of their life  and they didn't talk about their companies or how much stuff they had or how successful they were.  All they said is, I wish I could spend it with those that I love for a little longer.

Uncle Jason's talking about not being such a great guy and all that kind of stuff sometimes  and trying to be better.  You know, I met Jason a long time ago and I met him at a couple of events and never really  talked to him just in passing.  Hello, whatever.  You know, I'm down here.  He's up here.  And one day I go and get on a flight and they're like, oh, do you want to upgrade to first class?  It's 25 bucks.  I said, sure.  I sit down.  Jason's down next to me and he's like, oh, doctor.  And I'm like, oh, Jason remembers my name.  Like, hey, what's up?  Talk to him for 20 minutes.  He tweets out my website.  He shuts my website down.  He says, he says, oh, he's like, I see these interviews with people.  I come by the studio sometime and sure enough, he answered my email.  I came by the studio, have my little crappy equipment.  He's like, don't worry about it.  I'll videotape everything.  I format it.  I'll send it over to you.  Had a nice afternoon with the guy.  Let me get stuck in his Tesla.  And I've seen him once or twice before.  But in my mind, I defend Jason all the time because when people say, oh, Jason's this  and that, I'm like, you don't know him.  You see someone on the internet and you think that you know somebody and maybe he had a  problem with this person or this person didn't like him.  You don't know him.  And again, for somebody like me, I'm not important, quote unquote.  I'm not special.  You took the time out to talk to me and I'm a regular dude.  So you don't know somebody until you get to know them.  And just being online and reading a tweet does not make you an official not on anybody.  So I've always loved your uncle Jason.  He's like, I love Leo.  Yes, you're a hard headed person.  Uncle Leo's hard headed.  But I'm just saying when family comes together, we break it down.

You can't find the one you want or you can't remember, oh yeah, it was a photo of so-and-so  or maybe it was in Paris or maybe, at least this gives you the ability to kind of go through them  without taking hours to try and find a single photo or tag a photo.

As I mentioned, a brand new show next week.  Don't worry.  We only do this once a year.  But I think it's fun to kind of do this.  And boy, big kudos and thanks to our editors and to especially Jason Howell,  who was for the whole year my technical director and managing editor for the show.  Jason put together a bunch of great shows, but he also did this best of.  And I think he picked some wonderful clips.  Thanks also to your input on our best of page.  Jason is leaving the show.  He's got his own show now.  We've created a new TNT.  Our Tech News Today show is now hosted by Jason Howell and by Megan Moroney  at 4 p.m. Pacific, 7 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday.  So your tech news is now in the afternoon.  But I think that's a better time because we'll get the whole day's tech events  and we can get that show out in plenty of time for you to download for your drive in the morning.  So I'm excited about the new TNT.  And I know you're going to love what Jason and Megan do with the show.  Jason will continue with all about Android and Android App Arena.  We wish him the best.  I thank him for a couple of great years on TNT.  Jason Kleanthus will be replacing him.  F'ing Dunn, who we met first in the chat room and came up here to work with us a couple of months ago.  He's going to be taking over Twitch starting next week.  Before we get to another clip, in fact, the next clip is a fun trip down memory lane for me.  And I'll be talking about the one time I got an Emmy Award,  the one and only time I got an Emmy Award.  But first, let's talk about Wealthfront.  What a great idea Wealthfront is.  Wealthfront reinvents how you invest.  And it does it in the computer age, the modern age.  This is 21st century investing built for the way we need to invest.  Look, you've got to be saving for retirement.  The government not going to take care of you.  I mean, have you seen what you get in Social Security now?  There's not enough to live on, I don't think.  Or maybe you want to buy a house or you want to put your kids through college.  We all need to save money for the future.  But you don't want to just put in a savings account or a certificate of deposit.  That's not a sensible way to do it.  You need to invest to maximize your returns.  But are you going to be paying attention to your investments, rebalancing, rejiggering it?  That's a lot of work.  And most of the time, at least in my case, I would just blow it off for years at a time.  Well, all right.  You got a better idea?  Go to a traditional investment advisor.  Problem with that is he's going to take huge chunks of your returns.  Between 1% and 3% of what you got under management,  not to mention the hidden fees for transactions and changes.  That means you have to earn that much more.  Bad idea.  How about Wealthfront?  Wealthfront is a way to grow your investment as fast as possible  with a management fee that is extraordinarily low.  One quarter of 1% a year.  And never any commissions or hidden fees.  That's it.  That's less than five bucks a month for a $30,000 account.  And it's not just annual management.  This is doing stuff no human advisor could do.  This is monitoring your investment 24-7.  Reinvesting, rebalancing, tax lost harvesting, indexing and optimizing your after-tax returns.  Stuff that is very sophisticated.  It's based on some of the best investment advisors in the world.  Basically, Wealthfront has taken their genius and built it into the software  to optimize your investment for the best risk-adjusted return net of taxes and fees.  We've heard from so many Twitch fans who have used Wealthfront.  I get emails all the time from people saying,  we love how we get diversified portfolios.  We can kind of buy into and participate in the hot companies like Facebook and Apple and Amazon  and all commission free.  One quarter of 1% a year.  No wonder they've grown over 20 times in the last two years.  They've got $2.6 billion in client assets being under management.  I think this is brilliant and I want you to try it out.  There's a couple of ways you can do that.  Of course, as always, I highly recommend you go to Wealthfront.com  and read up about what they're doing.  I think you'll be very excited.  I was.  But you can also get a free portfolio from them personalized just for you.  When you go to Wealthfront.com slash twit,  you'll answer a couple of questions about risk aversion, your time frame, that kind of thing.  And then they'll give you a free portfolio.  They say this is what we would invest based on what you told us.  But there's one more thing that you got to know about just for twit listeners.  If you sign up, and by the way, you could start for as little as $500.  That's the minimum investment.  It's not a lot.  500 bucks.  And you know, I tell my son this.  I said, he says, but that guy can't, that's not, I can't retire on that.  I say, son, Henry, if you put away 100 bucks a month, that's all.  Every year, because you're starting young, it will grow.  You won't believe how much it'll grow by.  That's the key.  And your first $15,000, entirely free of charge for life.  That is a good deal.  Not one quarter of 1%, zero for life.  Join this.  So many twit fans now have seen huge success with Wealthfront.  Really is a great idea.  Wealthfront.com slash twit.  Wealthfront.com slash twit.  One of the things that, you know, I mentioned I won an Emmy a long, long time ago  as one of the very first virtual characters to appear on national television, real-time animation.  It was on a show I did for MSNBC back in the mid-90s.  I was a character called Dev Null.  Soledad O'Brien interviewed me.  And it was a use of technology that is fascinating using expensive silicon graphics computers,  but that can now be done almost 20 years later with off-the-shelf PC technology.  Greg Panos is an expert in this technology.  He stopped by to tell me what the latest is to talk about Dev Null and something called Baby X Watch.  An old friend is here.  Not really a tech journalist, but a guy who certainly knows a lot about  what's going on in technology, Greg Panos.  Nice to see you.  I've told the story many times about running into you at CES a few years ago.  And you said, you know, we could do Dev Null, the virtual reality character I used to inhabit  on the site in the mid-90s.  We could do that on a PC today.

Transcript:  We called it Performance Animation, and it was really hard to get people in the industry  to adopt it because a lot of vendors were trying to sell motion capture hardware.  So they would always refer to it as motion capture, which is really not a live performance.  You perform live, and then it's recorded and tweaked.  But Performance Animation, you set it up, and then you just perform,  and the character is performed and animated live.  It was a real-time virtual character.  Yeah, real-time.  It's a lot harder to do.

Start time: 3543.40

Transcript:  That's why MSNBC wanted it, is because Soledad O'Brien could sit at the coffee bar,  which was real.  She was real, as far as I know.  And she would sit at the coffee bar, stare at a dot.  But she could hear me.  She had an earpiece in, so I'd talk to her.  But instead of seeing the dot, the viewers at home would see a virtual character,  instead of an O, animate.  There he is.  The most annoying.  That is good.  I take credit for it being annoying.  And the technology was a little primitive, but it worked.  And the thing is, it worked in real time.  So you didn't go back and spend days, weeks, months, years animating Dev Null.  Right.

Is that her voice?  It has a voice model in there as well.  So she's saying, Dada.  Yeah, and if he stares at the camera and starts smiling and saying hi and paying attention,  then she'll start smiling.  That's so creepy.  That's really creepy.  I am so creeped out right now.  It's just the beginning.  Well, I know.  They use the word avatar to describe a virtual character, but it's a very generalized term.  I created a term years ago called a persona form, which is one that's supposed to be very,  very photorealistic of an individual.  This would be a construct that you digitize yourself throughout your lifetime, and you  edit to one unified database and then you leave it behind.  When you die, you can exist.  There will be a platform that will be able to run one of these constructs,  and it'll be able to be a virtual storytelling machine of you in your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right, they actually structured the bone models and set up all the rigging in advance  and then they have a facial animation coding system which drives the model.  And then the AI drives the facial coding system.  So its behavior is aligned much more with a perceptual sense of what's going on in the  real world and then the animation is driven by typical rules that normally apply to our  own bone structure in the face.

Transcript:  Every time she comes on here, she tells way too many inside stories about our past history.  We'll continue on with some of the best of 2015 on This Week in Tech.  Hope you're enjoying the show today.  Coming up in just a little bit, we're going to talk about,  I think, one of the biggest stories of 2015, virtual reality.  But first, let me tell you about something that's going to save your business.  Fresh books.  Save my life as a freelancer.  Because the worst thing when you're a freelancer is that end of the month thing  where you got to fire up Excel, fire up Word, create invoices,  go back through your receipts, gather them all together.  It's just the paperwork.  It's annoying.  That's not why you got into business.  It's not why you do what you do for paperwork.  I was complaining on the set of Call for Help up in Toronto about this one day.  In fact, I was telling the story of how I had forgotten to bill Rogers for six months  and how upset they were to get a bill for six months worth of invoices.  And Amber said, don't you know about FreshBooks?  I said, what?  She said, oh, Leo.  This was in 2004.  Now that five million people use FreshBooks.  But at the time, it was brand new to me.  FreshBooks makes it easy to create and send professional,  beautiful invoices in minutes.  It was so easy.  I invoiced immediately, automatically at the end of the month.  It you can do stuff now that you couldn't do when I first signed up.  Things like take pictures of receipts with the FreshBooks app  and just put them in there for your expenses.  The handles currency is great.  I was billing in Canadian dollars and US dollars.  So I had to figure that all out.  FreshBooks made it easy.  Track your time almost instantly.  Now they have some new features like you can request a deposit  ahead of time in FreshBooks so that you get paid up front  for out-of-pocket costs.  No more do you have to pay ahead and let them reimburse you.  I love that.  They now have a card reader.  So if you provide services or you sell stuff and you send invoices out,  now you can actually present your FreshBooks invoice right from the app,  plug in the reader, and they can pay you with their credit card instantly.  It's chip or swipe.  So it does both.  It's EMV chip card enabled.  Of course, it has to be state of the art.  And wherever your business takes you now,  you can quickly and securely get paid from your iPhone in minutes.  This is awesome.  The FreshBooks card reader.  So what I like about FreshBooks, they just get better and better and better.  Don't wait.  Do it right now.  30 days free when you go to freshbooks.com slash twit.  And when they say, how did you hear it about us?  Don't forget to say this week in tech, Betty.  This week in tech.  That's how I heard about you.  FreshBooks, try it free for 30 days.  If you're a freelancer or a small business, this will save your life.  It saved mine.  I love them.  FreshBooks.com slash twit.  VR, big story.  Episode 521, Mark Millian, Nathan Oliveras Giles, and oh, doctor.  We're in-house to talk about it and to kind of school me in the whole thing.  I'm excited about VR.  I'm big time excited.  I am.  I am.  I kind of came around.  I was more, I was saying AR is going to be the thing, the HoloLens style thing where you  impose images on a real world.  But now having used VR a little bit with the Galaxy Gear VR, I actually bought the thing with my  Galaxy S6 and watching movies and stuff.  The cardboard?  No, no, no.  I have it.  Or the white, the white.  You strap it on and you put your phone in it.

Oculus is using, I didn't know this, but the Note was the engine for the Oculus.  So it's not like they ported it.  That's actually how it works.  And cardboard.  Did you do the virtual press conference that OnePlus did for the announcement of the OnePlus 2?  I did do that.  How was that?  It was cool.  So you put on cardboard and you're looking around?  Yeah.

It still feels like you're just watching kind of a 360 degree video.  Yeah.  Doesn't quite feel like you're there, but it's cool.  And if nothing else, I just like the idea that here's another company kind of saying,  yeah, VR is a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like everybody's talking about it and everybody's jumping into the field.  I don't feel like anything is useful or really working yet.  Oh, I don't know.  Have you played with it?  Have you used it?  I've only used it one time and it made me sick,  but obviously all that stuff's been fixed apparently.

Start time: 4737.70
End time: 4822.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  No, no.  It still makes people sick.  In fact, on my Gear VR, when you download apps, they actually have a nausea rating on it.  On how, like, okay, for most people, no, this is going to make you sick.  Seriously, because I get a little queasy.  What I find is I get more queasy if I'm moving around.  If I'm sitting still, it's because my body thinks that I'm, you know,  my eyes are saying I'm moving and my body's not or vice versa.  Yeah.  I think that's what causes it.  So when I'm sitting down and like there's a Cirque du Soleil video  and the performers are all around you and so you can look behind you.  And if you look at them, they act as if they suddenly are performing for you.  They're looking right at that, whatever that is, that ball camera.  Position.  And it's really cool.  Now, Nokia announced a new one called Ozo this week that is a ball camera  that's coming out in the fall.  Of course, GoPro has one.  That they're made with Google.  Google Jump technology.  The Ozo's interesting because it does a live version of low stream, low bit rate live version.  And then you can also save it and do a on demand version after the fact.  And I'm told by people who played with it that the audio is spectacular.  They have microphones all over it.  And that's something that I think is going to be a big improvement is that when you turn your head,  now I can hear what's over here or now I can hear what's over here.  I can hear.

Start time: 4822.88

Transcript:  It fits in very well.  They have controls.  There's a back button, a touch button.  You can hear.  There's headphones you can put on.  And it works.  You know what?  I've used it a lot.  No, not for adult stuff.  But I've used it for...  There's a limited amount of content.  It's kind of like when HD came out.  But there's enough content that you really like.  This Cirque du Soleil thing.  There are games.  There's a really fun game where...  And I haven't played it yet.  I've downloaded it.  I'm trying to get people to play it with me.  Where you, as the victim, you're disassembling a bomb.  Disassembling a bomb.  But you don't have the manual.  Your friends who are not wearing the helmet have the manual.  But they can't see what you're seeing.  So you're saying, well, should I cut the red wire?  And they're going, well, let me look.  And there's a paper manual.  And they're going, well, let me look.  That's cool.  Isn't that fun?  Yeah.  I think that's a great idea.  So I think we're starting to see some very interesting uses for this.  It is immersive.  It's not perfect yet.  Far from it.  In fact, I can see there's a screen door effect.  I can see the pixels and everything.

And now, the GoPro is probably a few thousand bucks.  The Ozo was about 5,000 bucks.  This is relatively affordable.  You can make these videos and you can put them on YouTube now.  YouTube works with cardboard.  So if you have cardboard, which is inexpensive, you can really do this.  I feel like we're very close.  I don't know.  I just feel like in the next...  I'll check out to 2016 July and we'll see.  When I say close, I mean the time frame is like five years.  Yeah, that sounds reasonable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_23
Transcript:  We have zero problem with that.  So it's the perfect place to start.  So and since some of these headsets are going to work with established game consoles, you have content there.  You can port it over.  It's kind of a shorter jump than, OK, well, what's broadcast news going to look like?  What's a feature film going to look like?  What's sitting in watching?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I could see it be very easy to make movies this way, by the way, because this the you just you have a single camera that's recording all around you.  And you just tell your actors you're on camera anywhere in the sphere.  So perform that your act as if this is a real room with almost like theater.  Right. And I can imagine watching a movie where I can look at you kind of do that on a big screen anyway.  Look around. Imagine, you know, somebody starts talking, you look over here, they're having a fight.  Well, wait a minute, the guy's got a gun over here.  I mean, that would be very exciting.

So is it programmatic?  So it's actually it will change what happens.  That's interesting.  I mean, I haven't seen it.  It was in L.A. I didn't get to go down for the premiere.  Wish I would have.  But I can't wait to try it out.  And it's going to be on Oculus when it comes out next spring.

Transcript:  Hopefully, what will be so cool that will get us to spend, you know, whatever money it is to buy  these headsets will be something we haven't even thought of because right now a lot of the stuff  we're talking about is what we know movies to be and then imagining that to be in a virtual reality  headset.  It's like, do I want to wear that thing on my face for two and a half hours?  Do I not?  Right?  So hopefully there's something else.  Maybe it's a half hour.  Maybe it's half hour, but maybe it won't be in the theater.

Transcript:  Well, it's confusing because you read these statistics ESPN, which is traditionally the  cable channel people will pay the most for.  They make the most money, something like $6.25 per subscriber for them to make less is a big deal.  But then you also hear statistics.  People are watching more broadcast television than ever before.  So I don't know which is true, but obviously media stocks really took a hit.  Walt Disney, 21st Century Fox and Viacom.  Although the CEO of Cablevision said not so fast.  It's not it's not that bad.  We don't see, he told the Wall Street Journal, we don't see a landslide of cord cutting  in the near term.  James Dolan.  Of course, he's talking to investors.  So he's trying to shore up the stock.  He says, I don't think the sky is falling quite yet.  Nevertheless, Cablevision shares fell 2.7% on Friday and 5% over the two days.

Transcript:  Leo, the key way to think about any of these changes is we are beginning to see  a whole generation think about television, not as television, but something on demand.  And then you have a generation behind them who think of video only in terms of devices,  which they can hold in their hand and they can touch.  I think that's exactly right.  And so 10 years forward, these guys may stem the losses for a little while,  do some financial engineering.  10 years down the line, the behavior of the consumer is very different.  It's not cord cutting.  It just is a different behavior.

We don't know what the consumers of tomorrow are going to adapt to these things or not.  I don't know.  I am really interested in trying to figure out how people consume television in next five years  to actually make a reasonable call on what the future looks like.  But this one thing is for sure, the way things work, that's gone.  60 billion or 600 billion in their market cap, that's just irrelevant.  These companies have been sitting and doing absolutely nothing.  And that's why they are beginning to suffer.

Transcript:  There's been some really great stories about MLB, which was one of the first leaders,  I think, in getting to the online space.  So the MLB TV people, Major League Baseball, were really trying to offer some kind of online  experience early on.  They knew that they had a worldwide audience of people watching baseball who couldn't always  watch it because they didn't have US network television.  So in the early days of MLB TV, it was awful.  It was like watching a pixelated video game frame by frame.  It was terrible.  But they stuck with it and they developed it out.  And we're an MLB household, so we use it quite frequently.  At three in the morning, unfortunately.  We have actually, I have to start the game because I'm allowed to see the final scores.  So I'm in charge of starting the game.  I see.  But yeah, after the fact.  But what happened was HBO hired some people from MLB who had worked on that product.  HBO now was based on MLB.  Yeah, exactly.  And they said, we really need somebody who has expertise.  And nobody had any expertise.

Transcript:  Yet I think the real problem is exactly his own points.  And I look at, I have two kids, 23 and 21.  The 23-year-old will watch Netflix.  We'll watch, she'll sit down in front of a TV set.  She was not, she's a cord cutter in that sense.  She's not watching live programming.  She's watching on-demand programming off the internet.  The 21-year-old won't do that.  He watches YouTube.  And that's it.  And I feel like that's really...  I mean, you're missing the boat if you're thinking, oh, the next thing is over the top.  As I think you nailed it, which is TV watching itself has changed completely.  And people are using mobile devices.  They're not watching TV.  They're consuming content in some completely different way.

Transcript:  Absolutely.  I think great storytelling is great storytelling.  Whether you tell them through, you know, you tell them as a poem or you tell them as a movie  or as a running TV series, great stories are great stories.  There will be far, the focus has to be on finding that interesting thing that people are glued to.  But most of the viewing is going to be fractional.  So the economics of the industry changes not from mass audience, which is like mass audience,  put lots of television, charge lots of money and go home.  Whereas fractional is everything is just, you know, up for grabs.  Maybe we need to be thinking really, really hard about paid content, subscription models,  which are entirely different than what they are today.  I think Netflix works because it is actually an interesting business model,  not because it has the best content.  It's like they figured out that for $10 a month, people are okay putting up with,  a lot of average content as long as they find something to see on a daily basis.

In fact, you're seeing really the opposite when you think about the fact that these  HBO shows like Game of Thrones or True Detective really are 30- or 40-hour movies.

Transcript:  When you start to look at some of the TV shows that are coming out exclusive on Vimeo and YouTube,  I think they're breaking away from the idea of having a format at all.  They say, let us tell the story in the amount of time that we need.  Shows like High Maintenance, for example, which is on Vimeo.  And there's a few others that have very short programs.  I think that's a good experimental way to go, but I think we also have to remember that  we've been programmed to consume content in certain blocks.  A half-hour show is usually actually somewhere between 22 and 26 minutes in the US because  of commercial breaks.  And if you watch on Netflix, you'll watch those 22 minutes straight through.  And then there's a difference between an hour-long show on network, which is usually about 46 minutes,  and an hour-long HBO show, which is actually more like 58, 59 minutes.  I think we're acclimated to watching in those breaks and that writers start to get used to  writing in those breaks.  So you have 14 minutes until your plot twist and you have eight minutes of resolution.  I think we have some forms that are more ingrained in our behavior for consuming media than we  realize.  And I would say the same thing about movies, too.  So you know that the movie studios are pushing for a certain amount of time on a movie because  they know that the consumer going to the theater wants a certain length of an experience to  feel like they're getting their money's worth.  So writers are taught to pace their stories based on that block of time that they're given.  So I think some of those issues are going to be harder to overcome in new media.  I think new media helps them a lot.  But I think getting used to the idea that we, the consumer, want to have certain things  happen in our story in the plotting and the pacing just because we've been accustomed  to that's the way that a story is told.

This is very similar to our conversation about messaging earlier, which is essentially that  we're moving into a fragmented world where there are lots of different flavors and you  pick the flavor that suits you.

I think New York Times has done a good job so far,  but I see that they're starting to go down this path.  It's stumbling.  Yeah, that they're starting to miss out who they really are  and why we are willing to pay for them.  I think that's the other thing.  The thing which we have never talked about  or people don't talk about is how storytelling  will actually be different going forward  because the technology is different, right?  Jill was talking about 26-minute blocks or 58-minute blocks,  but think about it this way.  Today, we can stop and have a video sync to another screen  at any time.  So we don't watch...  I have not sat down and watched a single movie end to end.  I just maybe watched 10 minutes there and 15 minutes there.  No, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's where the storytelling is different.  That's where the idea of what is video content is different.  The idea of television, as we know it, doesn't make any sense  because we are in full control of how we experience it, right?  How we experience it defines what is going to happen to the medium,  and it is not going to be a mass medium as a result of that.  And I think most of the television industry  misses the point about that, completely misses the point.  Like, we are in charge.  Like, we mean the end customer is in charge of the video.  Is in charge of how.  That's the beauty.  I think people talk about cord cutting.  DVR was the most disruptive thing that happened to television.

Well, you know, if there's a thread in the through line through all of this,  it's that the technology is completely disruptive.  And what's really interesting is human behavior is as much disrupted  as the business models.  Business models have to accommodate these new human behaviors.  And it's a moving target.  I watch my kids.  I love using my kids as an example, but I watch them go from…  When we were teenagers, we were on the phone while we did our homework.  I watched my daughter be on instant messenger while I was doing…  She was doing her homework with music playing to watching my son  be on a multiple conference call with Skype while he's doing his homework.  And that's in a couple of years.  It's changing so rapidly.  I don't blame NBC and Viacom and ESPN Disney for having some trouble  figuring out what the hell we want and where it's all going.

Transcript:  We're gonna take a break, come back with a few more memories from 2015.  But first, a word from Citrix GoToMeeting.  Look, if you're in business, you have to have meetings.  Meetings are really vital.  They break through.  They kind of cut the Gordian knot of confusion.  We kind of have a rule that if more than three emails are exchanged on any topic,  we say, that's it.  No more emails.  Let's talk.  Meetings are a great place to brainstorm, to get work done if they're managed properly.  But part of the problem nowadays is teams are distributed all over.  And so are your clients, right?  That means a lot of travel if you want to meet.  Or it means Citrix GoToMeeting.  Eliminate the travel.  Meet more efficiently.  Get more done.  Co-workers love it, but clients love it too because you're not taking up their time.  If you have a sales presentation, you want a system that's going to make it easy for them  to see what you're doing.  A system that lets you look at them and them look at you.  That's really important.  We're human beings.  We need to see each other's faces.  GoToMeeting does that.  The HD quality webcam makes it seem like you're in the room.  You share your screen so they could see your PowerPoint.  You could collaborate on documents together.  You get feedback in real time.  And it is super easy.  You don't want to make a client jump through hoops to be in your meeting,  to be in your sales pitch.  With GoToMeeting, they get an invitation in the email.  It gets added to the calendar.  They click a link.  The software is automatically instantly installed.  They're ready to go.  No fuss, no muss.  And here's the great part.  You can not only meet from a computer, but your tablet, your smartphone.  I can present from an iPad anywhere in the world.  With GoToMeeting, everybody sees what you're seeing.  So you're on the same page and you see each other face to face.  So you get that real personal contact.  This is the solution.  You may have tried others.  I want you to try GoToMeeting today.

It wasn't a big story in the sense that it wasn't a terrorist attack.  It wasn't the World Cup.  It wasn't a story like that.  But it was a story that really captured people's interest and imagination.  And we spent a lot of time talking about, of course,  Ahmed and his clock, the high school student,  who was busted for a clock that looked like a bomb.  O and JJ Stone's back.  Oh, Dr. Larry Magid from CBS.  Aaron Griffith.  Here's the story of Ahmed and the clock.  Little 14-year-old Ahmed brings a clock.  Actually, what he does, we found out, is he takes apart a clock,  a clock that was very popular, like Radio Shack in the 80s.  Takes it apart, jiggers it around with it,  brings it into school to show his engineering teacher.  He's brand new.  He's a freshman, brand new at this high school.  He kind of, you know, wants to establish himself.  The engineering teacher looks at it, says,  that's very nice, put it away and do not show anybody your clock.  Unfortunately, the clock makes some noise.  In another class, the teacher says, what's that?  He's got it in a case, a metal case.  He opens it up.  Teacher freaks out.  Principal comes, grabs the kid, brings him back.  They call the police assigned to that school,  because the school has, you know, official police officers.  The police come, they question him, which by the way,  is not legal procedure without his parents present.  Handcuff him and take him in.  His parents are called before he has to serve any time  in a jail cell or anything, he's taken home.  Very controversial and became a cause celebre.  Even the president said, hey, Ahmed, cool clock, come to the White House.  Right.  One of the reasons it's a hot button is because Irving Texas  is not exactly a bastion of tolerance.  The, I think it was the mayor of Irving Texas  made a pretty, you know, scandalous anti-Islam, anti-Muslim speech.  So I think there's a little bit of sensitivity there.  It was clearly not a bomb.  The kid never said it was a bomb.  The kid repeatedly said it was a clock.  And in fact, one of the police officers,  perhaps foolishly said, well, it looks like a movie bomb to me.  Because of course, in the movies, they always have a big clock on the bomb  so that the hero can disarm the bomb with 007 seconds left.  But in fact, if you were going to make a bomb, a couple of things.  First, you probably wouldn't put a big clock on it.  Second, you might put some explosives in it.  There were, it was obvious, no explosives in the bomb.  I loved the fact that after this story came out,  somebody reminded me that in the Walter Isaacson biography of Steve Jobs,  Wozniak tells a story of doing almost exactly the same thing in high school.  He took a metronome.  He liked how it went click, click, click.  It was an electronic metronome.  He put it in a locker and he wired it up so that if you open the locker,  it would speed up.  Click, click, click, click, click, click.  And he stripped the labels off of a couple of batteries  because he knew he's a smart guy.  A bomb requires explosives to look like explosives.  He made something that really looked like a bomb,  got called in the principal's office and couldn't help but laugh when the principal said,  is this a bomb?  He said, no, it's not a bomb.  He spent a night in juvie.  Of course, it's Woz.  So he taught the other inmates how to strip the wires from the electrical lighting  and wire it to the bars on the windows so it would zap anybody who touched them.  Woz went on to fame and fortune.  I think Ahmed might too.

Not only was it not a bomb, but the clock didn't clock.  Did it not work, really?  Let's just start with, no, apparently the clock didn't clock.  I didn't read that part.  Until time.  The clock wasn't fully functional.  It wasn't working properly.  On top of the fact that he made the clocks.  Aaron, I don't think your mic's on.

Transcript:  First of all, the fact the way that they treated this child was wrong.  Once you even realized it wasn't a bomb, you still questioned him without his parents there  or a lawyer there, and he repeatedly asked for somebody to call my parents.  They didn't.  Secondly, somebody posted up, okay, so Wysniak actually made a bomb.  He goes to juvie.  That's the proper thing to do.  Whatever.  But somebody else posted a thing where there were like seven other kids that did the exact  same thing in other schools across the country.  And some of them, somebody even thought it was a bomb.  They won't call the cops when they called their parents.  Whatever.  It was quelled in like five minutes.

I mean, this is unevenly enforced across the nation.  It's sad because in the post-9-11 world, people are scared.  I have to think it has little to do with the fact that the kid has  apparently an Arabic sounding name.  Yes.  Right?

Transcript:  I don't blame the teacher for being concerned.  But once the police showed up and determined it wasn't a bomb, it seemed to me it should  have been over.  And second of all, if they had to take him out of the classroom, why do you put  handcuffs on a skinny little 14-year-old kid?  I mean, that's just ridiculous to begin with.  But the teacher, I think, maybe had a cause to at least want to look into this to make  sure it was OK, but then move on.  But the cops, I think, way overreacted.

Start time: 7123.22

Transcript:  If you need to put handcuffs on the kid, then that whole school needs to be evacuated.  You don't stand around getting pictures taken in the office.  Because if you really think that it's about to the point where this kid needs to be locked up,  that school should be a ghost town ASAP.  But they stood around talking, yipping and yapping, asking the same questions  over and over again.  Knowing it wasn't a threat, but treating it like it was a threat.  It was just poorly handled.  So whether it was race or not, he gets free gadgets and toys out of it.  He gets to go some cool places.  He's not going back to school.  You made a celebrity and you guys look like idiots in our school system.  It's just sad.  It's so annoying that I got to see this kid get all this stuff because he made a broken  clock and that is a big deal.  It shouldn't even be a big deal.  Yeah.  Right.

Transcript:  Well, I think part of the president's point is to encourage kids to be makers and to tinker  and to do things like that.  That's cool.  Whether this kid is exceptional as people are making him out to be and whether he deserves  a job in Silicon Valley or a free ticket to MIT, I don't know.  I mean, it seems to me he ought to be competing for those spots like the rest of the kids  do.  But we basically made a martyr out of him for a moment and then he became a celebrity.  So good for him.

Transcript:  Well, he's certainly getting more benefit out of it than he's getting the momentary  embarrassment and pain of being arrested.  He's been invited to the White House.  He will be going.  He received a message of support from Hillary Clinton and offered to stop by Facebook to  meet Mark Zuckerberg, an invitation to be an intern on Twitter and I think even MIT  got involved.  Some have said, though, and the New York Post is a bastion of journalistic sensibility.  Kyle Smith writing, how Ahmed's clock became a false convenient tale of racism.  There's been a backlash.  And, you know, a couple of points we'll kind of lay to rest here.  People pointing out, in fact, we had the guy on the new screensavers yesterday works at  Make magazine who was the first to observe, oh, that isn't like a homemade clock.  That's a disassembled clock that you could buy at Radio Shack in the 80s.  I even had one.  It was a Micronta clock, I think.  That doesn't mean he's not a maker.  That's how makers start.  That's how you start.  You take apart stuff.  You assemble it.  Richard Dawkins, of all people, weighed in saying, yeah, I think the guy was trying to  go viral, that this was an intentional viral thing.  He knew what the response would be.  I don't know if I buy that either.

And you figure the best way to get to the president is to get a Muslim on his side.  He'd be sure to have a clock with him that time.  And then you get him to visit Facebook.  He shows down Facebook.  He shows down Twitter.  He shows down the White House.  Propaganda, man.  The world is out there.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Did he?  I mean, a couple of questions.  First of all, if he never ever, if he always said, it's a clock, it's a clock, it's a clock,  surely teachers must have looked at this.  And apparently, the teachers are.  What is, okay, there's literacy if you don't know words,  numeracy if you don't know numbers.  What is it if you don't understand technology at all?  Technology literacy.  Technology illiterate.  Because they looked at this and even thought it might be a bomb when there's,  you know, the first thing that comes to my mind,  where's the explosive?  Right?  There's nothing that could blow up.  So what it shows is that unfortunately, he's got teachers  who don't understand that this is what the inside of a clock looks like.  They've never gone inside anything.

You know, there's outrage,  and then there's outrage to the outrage.  And then there are truth, then there are truthers that come out.  And they have the, he wasn't a model citizen.  He didn't make the clock.  His parents made it or whatever.  And it's the same pattern.  And people on both sides of the argument  just reinforce their own beliefs.  And it's just a reflection of the filter bubble  that we have on the internet.  I just Googled this as we were talking about it.  And the top stories now,  because the original outrage has kind of died down  because it happened earlier in the week.  And the top stories now are all sort of like right-wing truthers  that are like, Ahmed didn't make the clock.  And this is just another sort of like liberal uprising.  All of this stuff.  And it's just sort of frustrating to watch play out  because as soon as it happened, I was just like, oh, brother, here goes.  Yep.  Everybody's got to get their clicks.  And it doesn't feel like anyone really learned anything.  It doesn't feel like this is not going to happen again now as a result of this.

Like, okay, as a school, you were scared.  Okay, do your job, file a procedure and end it.  But taking it to the umpteenth degree is the problem.  I've had kids get arrested in my school for all kinds of stuff.  I've had a kid in my high school who had a gun.  And guess what?  The cops came there, arrested them.  It was over in 30 seconds.  I had another kid who had a pocket comb knife.  They realized it wasn't a knife.  The cops left.  Everybody was fine.  There was never a big deal about it.  But when you take it and you handcuff the kid, once you already know the problem is over,  like those are the things where it's like, well, now we got Facebook.  And there's a Facebook mom group that says, not my child, never again.  And they've got like a billion people to go.  Like you said, the way it plays out is just like, who needs their clicks?  Then it becomes national news.  Yeah.  I need clicks for it.  I need clicks against it.  I need clicks in the middle.  I need clicks for the clicks that you got earlier.  So let's get these clicks.

She had a picture in the hospital, and she looked bad.  There weren't any likes, but she had like 130 comments, people saying,  wish you well, all that kind of stuff.  I feel like how is it going to still promote something when it's diluted?  So if like 30 people want to go and say it's funny,  or 30 people want to be angry at it and say, oh, I'm against Donald Trump,  how is it going to get that congruency of either it's got a lot of comments  or it's got a lot of likes?

And the new one, the idea would be...  This new iteration, the idea would be there wouldn't be so many comments,  but there would be reactions that were like,  condolences, feel better, we're sorry, or a variety of reactions like that.  Another layer.  If you use Slack, they're doing this now where you can react with like lots of different emojis.  I like comments a lot more than I like likes.
