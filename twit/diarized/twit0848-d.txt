Speaker: SPEAKER_05

There's no genders  There's I mean, it's uh, it's a kind of a very direct language  So it's easy to speak poorly. Let's put it that way except for the tones

Start time: 405.70
End time: 504.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is great and i'm gonna i'm gonna call on your legal services immediately  because uh  As last week I got I missed the kind of the big story of the year, which is facebook renaming itself to  meta  Which i've been informed by the way is is death in hebrew  So maybe not the best choice. There is also a small I think it's a chicago company  That's suing them now because they say well, we're called meta  But I did uh, and thanks to john who downloaded the 32 page trademark application  for meta  and if you just look  Look at the red part here. This is so  Correct me if i'm wrong evan, but when you apply for a trademark you say in what category right?  so I have a trademark I think in for twit and like news and uh, and uh,  Television and radio and internet streaming things like that, right? Which that makes sense, right?  I don't have a trademark for popsicles named twit somebody could come along and have twit popsicles. That wouldn't be trademark infringement  We're in different categories  Facebook apparently does not want anybody to  To use the name meta  for anything  This is the description of their class  Well, it just goes on and on and on this is the part the part in red  It's it's it's it's it's like periodicals electronic publications currency virtual currency  downloadable software for creating  Selling and managing blockchain based tokens. It's for authenticating user access to computers  It's is this normal that you would claim this much territory with a trademark

Start time: 506.08
End time: 555.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not real this is this is  Pretty extensive here. I mean a couple things going on  I mean you put it when you file a trademark application first you  Designate whether you've actually put it into use yet or whether there's an intent to use and so  Facebook or meta  Has has filed an intent to use application here putting it in a number of classes. One of them is class nine, which is  Downloadable software software that actually goes into the user's environment. There's also  Classes within this application. I think class 41 class 42 more of the hosted  services kind of things but leo is your  Very aptly pointing out there is just I mean thousands of descriptions  It's it's exhaustive it's it's ad nausea, you know nauseating personal

Start time: 556.42
End time: 570.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Listen personal coaching services in the fields of sports exercise health and fitness  Phone I mean, come on you can't have it. So what happens now?  Does the uspto look at this and go slow down big boy or yeah, it'll sit first of all

Start time: 570.92
End time: 685.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It'll sit on the desk so to speak of a bureaucrat in alexandria, virginia for three or four months probably  Then what the examiner the trademark examiner will do is look at it  First they'll do a search to see what other pending applications or registered marks are already out there  And this is a separate issue to see what might be likely to conflict or what this might likely conflict with  Is already on the register. So it could be that there will be some issues  The examiner may issue an office action saying there is a likelihood of confusion. So we're going to deny  Registration of this mark on that basis too similar to something that's already on there  Now one of the things that's going to keep the examiner very busy is looking through all of these descriptions to see if they are  Accurate there are certain ways you actually have to  Your certain nomenclature certain linguistic structures you have to use to describe  The the goods and services in the application  So there may be problems right away and the examiner might come back  Perhaps in connection with the refusal on the basis of likelihood of confusion and say well, this is too vague. This is  You know, this is this this needs some kind of clarification  so getting to the point of what's going on here why meta has done this is  in the  The trademark prosecution process, you know the the the part of getting the application through to registration you can always  Narrow your description of goods and services you can always strike but you can't add to it  So it's good to start big  It's incumbent upon them to be as broad as possible and then you know  You can take away as the market or you know as the the intention becomes more clear  But in any event, this is uh, I mean I don't recall seeing anything like this at least among serious actors  You'll see people who don't know exactly what they're doing

Start time: 685.62
End time: 726.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But ostensibly and I just did a search on test the trademark database for meta and there are 1900  1696 records with meta including the meta mafia  arranging and conducting e-sports competitions. I'm sure that e-sports is in the  Claim from uh from meta so trademark. Yeah, so I you know  Is it typical for a company just to say I remember with iphone apple had a number of other companies that use that  And of course in the end what happens the company sue then apple writes them a check and they go away change their names or whatever  Is it typical for a company just to say screw it? We're going to do this  And let's see what happens

Start time: 727.24
End time: 733.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know that that's always the smartest thing. It depends on what kind of power you're bringing to the the situation  What kind of resources you have?

Start time: 734.16
End time: 739.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure facebook's one of those companies that has probably a building just for the lawyers. I would expect right?

Start time: 740.38
End time: 745.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and an army of outside council really skilled outside lawyers as well. Yeah, so I you know

Start time: 748.06
End time: 752.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a little hostile but I could see how facebook probably is stomping on some other people's trade

Start time: 753.28
End time: 782.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, I mean the typical approach is to carefully consider  This is under the category of trademark clearance  The company's going to launch a new brand a new product under a new mark  You look and see what else is out there and you make decisions  Whether to go forward based on how likely you are to conflict but clearly here  This is a special case a special circumstance where we know that there are enough resources behind the momentum that  Meta will have still hard to get used to calling them that you know to to figure out how to get this done and clear the

Start time: 782.44
End time: 813.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Clear the path one way or the other. There's a company in arizona called meta pc. There's a chicago-based company meta  Company in fact meta company wrote a long  Open letter and he said in october we had a phone call with facebook's attorneys october 20th. We declined their low offer  So  eight days later  Facebook filed for the trademark. Oh, and do you are you aware?  I imagine facebook went to a branding company to come up with this name, right?

Start time: 814.84
End time: 875.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This was a very tight process from everything i've i've read and and heard  You know it was really as with many things at uh at the company formerly known as facebook. It was a mark zuckerberg production  He wanted to do this  Um, so it happened and it happened very quickly. I wouldn't be surprised actually if there were some you know blowback  As a result of the haste, but you know, this is the guy who came up with the slogan move fast and break things, right?  The one  the thing that really strikes me is that  You know zuckerberg wants to use meta to actually  Brand things so for example oculus the brand is going away as a vr brand and it's going to be replaced by meta  And that's very different from what google did with alphabet where alphabet is basically something that comes up, you know  Annoyingly when you're writing about the stock or quarterly earnings and then you never think about alphabet  Except in that corporate context meta is different. It's not just the company name. It's going to be product names, too

Start time: 876.10
End time: 879.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's not going to be oculus by meta. It's not going to be facebook by meta

Start time: 879.94
End time: 912.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or is it it is it is going to be there are if you if you fire up your instagram app right now  You'll see it says instagram by by meta where it used to say instagram by fb, right?  And so they've already made that switch and sometimes it's going to be a product by meta and sometimes they're actually going to use from  From what I understand from  The company's announcement. They're actually going to use the meta name  Portal, I believe is a product that they made rebrand from facebook portal to  Meta portal or portal by metal. Yeah, so

Start time: 913.52
End time: 930.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so  when google  Adopted alphabet google didn't go away. It be alphabet became the shell company for a number of  companies including google  Is that how facebook is doing this i'm unclear evan  Do you have a better idea of what the corporate structure is?

Start time: 931.30
End time: 973.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't have the insight into it that owen is describing that he has but he's in he's pointing to a really important distinction here between  What is a trade name or a business name?  Which really doesn't have much of a public interface  connected to  The provision of goods or services on the other side is trademark use  Which is what the consuming public sees and that thing that that symbol that word that logo  That they associate with the source of particular goods and services  So owen based on what you're saying, it sounds like the intention is to use it more in a trademark sense  Attaching it to goods and services rather than just a just a corporate name  But leo to answer the real question you asked. I don't know about the actual structure

Start time: 973.96
End time: 989.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It says instagram from meta instead of instagram from from facebook  Um, and that would make sense if that's the name of the company i'm not a facebook user  When I go to facebook louise  Go on facebook. Does it say meta.com or no? It still says facebook, right?

Start time: 990.82
End time: 1007.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so weird. Uh, yeah, it's still facebook. I mean I think uh,  I think my question is sort of like how much is this about  facebook's name, right? How much is this about like  damage control versus  Like, you know sort of sorting out a corporate entity

Start time: 1008.78
End time: 1027.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But how stupid do they think congress the courts and the department of justice are it's like yeah, we get it  You're you're the same company. We're still going after you  It's the public. I guess they're trying to  Confuse but it doesn't I don't think we're stupid either  Everybody knows what meta is still facebook

Start time: 1028.76
End time: 1055.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right, and and just like in colloquial context like no one says like  Alphabet is being sued  You know, it's still like google and pretty much  You know most of the circumstances so like I mean evan you would know better  But like is there like some legal benefit to having some sort of differentiation?  So like the name of the company is not the same name as like one of your signature products, right?  Like is that is there some reason you would want to do that?  aside from like reputational one

Start time: 1056.44
End time: 1099.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I can't think of a reason why you would why why the name would  Matter too much. I mean clearly you want to set up different entities so that you're managing  Liability so that the assets of one entity aren't on the hook for what what one of its affiliates may be doing here  I just get the sense that that this  Sitting all of the the cynicism aside not that any of us would be cynical, right?  But sitting aside a little bit of this. Oh, you know, what's mark zuckerberg doing?  Um, you know, I if we take it at face value isn't this to sort of signal isn't this sort of be a harbinger or an entry into?  The greater importance of the metaverse. Yeah  Is it that in and of itself? I mean and he had that goofy

Start time: 1101.20
End time: 1154.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pictures of him posing with himself in the metaverse and all that. Uh, yeah  I guess you know usually uh the way a company  Repositions itself as they come out with a product to reflect that new positioning  This is very silicon valley you print the t-shirt and then you invent the product  um, I I you know, I guess you could say oculus is kind of a metaverse and they have  a weird social a network inside of oculus that is  Unsettling at to say the least  I don't know. That's technically it's called the meta platforms incorporated  Yeah, so that's implies that meta is a uh  umbrella  Organization over a number of platforms including instagram whatsapp  the blue facebook  And uh oculus, I guess and then it's all meta

Start time: 1157.30
End time: 1167.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One thing that fascinated me leo is the idea that they're going to have a meta account system  So in other words, you're going to have a meta.com account. This is something that oculus users really hated

Start time: 1167.82
End time: 1172.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did I stopped using the oculus because of it. I didn't write because oculus forced, uh

Start time: 1172.90
End time: 1195.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Forced users to use facebook as the login. So they're going to sub that in with  Meta as the login, but it's really unclear how that  How that is actually going to work in practice  But I think the idea is that you do not have to sign up for facebook the social network to get an account on  on these  Uh, you get a medic that makes sense

Start time: 1196.68
End time: 1198.08

Transcript:  Go ahead. Sorry. Go ahead. It wasn't there a time when when google required you to have a google plus account to use youtube

Start time: 1207.28
End time: 1236.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I remember that was no fun. Not just a time you still do have to have a google account. In fact, uh,  Well google plus I remember yeah, right, but but still google is google. We've now seen the unredacted. Uh, uh,  Attorneys general claims against google. We saw those a couple of weeks ago  And it was very clear that this whole thing to get everybody to log into google services once  Whether it's through chrome or through a google service and then keep logged in was just a much better way of gathering  Information about everything you do online

Start time: 1238.58
End time: 1250.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so there's I mean clearly the facebook has the same interest  Uh and and having a meta login just would make it easier to follow you everywhere you go in the in the world of meta

Start time: 1251.32
End time: 1288.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Um, you know, there's one final trademark point to that. We got to at least touch on it  It's probably pretty minor and the big thing before we move on from this  There's this idea that a trademark you can't have trademark rights in the word  That's merely descriptive of the of the goods or services and it can't you know, it  it is descriptive if it describes some characteristic of the of the product and so  There is at least some nod to me made to the fact that the word meta is merely  Descriptive of those services in as much as they pertain to the the metaverse right now it can acquire this  distinctiveness over time but just in order to be comprehensive on our trademarks. Yeah, and certainly it if you look at the

Transcript:  Application it does include virtual reality game computer hardware augmented reality game computer hardware mixed reality game computer hardware  Virtual reality computer hardware. It's I mean there's all of that's in here, but also a lot of crypto  And you know remember that facebook attempted to create this libra coin  I don't know what the status is of libra facebook was kind of embarrassed out of it  But I could see a um  There's clearly in this application a desire to create a meta  coinage a meta cryptocurrency  and uh meta dollars, of course, why not

Start time: 1324.26
End time: 1343.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh leo, that's that's actually a fascinating side note to all of this  Uh facebook very quietly as part of the meta reorg took its financial, uh arm facebook financial  And rebranded it novv, which was the name of its crypto wallet. So novv is now facebook pay  Anything you do with facebook and money

Transcript:  Should is it is it just that snarky paranoia that you talked about evan or is it really something we should be worried about i'm  Facebook makes me nervous in their ambition. Is that just paranoia louise or is is there something really to worry about?

Start time: 1359.80
End time: 1400.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I think that there's something to worry about right but I do worry about um  Sort of like facebook ubiquity, I guess because like they are such a name  And they have such a bad reputation now that I worry sometimes like  That there are more nefarious things that are happening with companies that are not household names, I guess  um, but I think that there's you know, good reason to be worried and I think um, if anything the last  I guess more than a month now, right? Like the facebook papers have sort of shown us that like  They knew that there was cause for concern too, right? Like it's sort of the outside voices  I think that yeah, there's you should be nervous and you should be skeptical, but I think also like  Also be conscious of making sure that you know, there's still some air left in the room for other things to be worried about

Start time: 1401.46
End time: 1427.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, there's plenty to worry about i'm worried about everything but I have to say  That if the intention of renaming themselves was to calm people down it did the exact opposite to me  Especially when you look at this trademark, it looks as if they facebook has grand ambitions well beyond the social network  Uh, and that they're kind of establishing that whole idea  In the renaming or maybe i'm just again just being a little bit paranoid

Start time: 1427.44
End time: 1432.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, I think it's legitimate to think that but I wouldn't let the trademark application in and of itself

Start time: 1432.32
End time: 1476.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know pour too much fuel on that. That's that's why you're honest is to calm me down  Talk me off the ledge  Whatever I can do  I appreciate it. Um  Here's the picture of mark with his uh, trying on uh zuck outfits  I don't know why mark doesn't understand how creepy this appears to people in the real world  um  That's the maybe in a way that's what worries me the most is that mark seems to be in a different universe  He's he he doesn't seem to have a sense of  How off-putting and scary this is for people and how people are really worried about facebook's  Invasion of their privacy. Uh, he just says it's good if you connect. It's good. It's good. It's good

Start time: 1477.32
End time: 1507.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think these companies have really strange internal cultures and sometimes if you've been like sort of like lost in the sauce for too long  Like I I think that the presentation probably would have gone over a lot better internally is what i'm saying  Because I think that there's sort of a weird especially among people who are like evangelists like internally and have been there for a long time  I think that like some of these things that we might see as like really weird or choo-choo  Are not so and then like all the sudden zuckerberg even though he does this all the time  But I think then gets in front of the whole world and is like right you guys you're into this right and we're all like no

Start time: 1508.08
End time: 1544.14

I think google goes through the same thing because it's such an insular  Uh environment when you're working at these companies that you forget how normal people in fact in general you could say that about silicon valley  That you forget how normal people think about this stuff  as engineers and technologists and enthusiasts  Even I have this problem. I go. Oh, this is great a folding phone  And uh normal people go  what  No  So no, so I think that is a big problem in these companies and I think it's a problem in silicon valley in general  Which is one of the reasons more diversity in silicon valley is probably a good thing

We have a molecule in three molecules in the house  Molecule is the future of clean air. It is not a filter system that you're kind of used to  It is an air  Literally an air purifier not just an innovation on the existing hepa filters, but a scientific breakthrough in air purification  In and this really important, uh, not just because of covid but in any office this office we have sealed windows  Indoor air can be five times worse than outdoor air according to the epa  So having a molecule in here is so important to me molecules core technology. They call it pico p e co  photo electrochemical oxidation  Doesn't just trap pollutants. It actually destroys them and even smaller pollutants that a filter could capture viruses  Bacteria mold even volatile organic compounds and if and if you're curious if you go to the molecule webpage  You can read the research where they show that the molecule reduces  vocs like formaldehyde  Things that you you you can't see you can't smell you can't trap with a filter, but you can stop with pico  Molecule air purifiers are designed to help protect homes businesses even medical spaces they by destroying  pollutants and providing clean air  In fact molecules pico technology meets the performance requirements in fda guidance  For use in help reducing the risk of exposure to covid in healthcare settings  uh the molecule air pro rx  Is a 510k class 2 medical device  Cleared by the fda for medical purposes to destroy bacteria and viruses in the air a lot of dentist's offices and medical offices have them  There are a variety of molecules though  You may not need the rx version the molecule air mini for smaller rooms like a bedroom up to 250 square feet  There's the molecule air. That's what we have in here  For rooms up to 600 square feet actually we have in here the new molecule air pro as well  For a thousand square feet. So really the whole studio has clean air. There's even the molecule air mini plus  Which helps protect small rooms with a particle sensor an auto protect mode which adjusts the fan speed based on the sensor  I love it. Our molecule is in the bedroom and I have it set so it comes on you can leave it on all the time  That's probably the best way to use it, but I don't want to have that light in the bedroom  So I have it comes on in the morning and I can just tell it's just  Burning up all the stuff. It's trapped overnight. It's very cool  Right now you can save up to 120 dollars on molecule air purifiers by visiting molecule.com. There's actually two filters  There's a there's a filter at the bottom  The cap that gets like the the larger particles and then it draws the air up through it's a cylinder. It's beautiful  Where there is a converter a catalyst?  That then traps these smaller molecules and destroys them with light  I forgot to mention it  But mike elgin carries a molecule with him as they travel around  And you need it in mexico in oaxaca because there's so many  wood fire kitchens  The the there's a lot of smoke  And it's really I we kind of wish we'd brought our molecule myself  There's a lot of smoke from the wood fires for a limited time save up to 120 dollars  On molecule air purifiers visit molecule m o l e  k u l e  Molecule.com  And use the promo code twit. You also get free shipping and of course a 30 day at-home trial on your order  So there's no risk and if you are at all interested  It's really worth going to the website and looking at the reports the papers the research the white papers  The description of that technology works. I think is any geek would be very interested in this. It really is  cool offer code twit t w i t  Molecule.com we thank them for their support of this week in tech and for  the clean air  In the studio and I could tell you when the fires were happening. That was a blessing man. That was that was a stinky  Stinking situation.

Oh, yeah, if everybody knows how to code well  step three profit  Right exactly they he said he was on cnn on sunday. He said when I talk about blockchain and bitcoins  young people on the street, this does not sound like an accurate  Anecdote I get but i'm gonna  Young people on the street stopped and asked me  What is that? Mr. Mayor?  He said and then they then then of course, uh,  They asked him. Well, can you explain what it is? He said well, I know it's a challenge even for experts  Yes  He says bitcoin means a new this is a quote new way of paying for goods and services throughout the entire globe  And that's what we must do open our schools to teach the technology and teach this new way of thinking

Transcript:  So I I actually looked into this leo, um, and by the way eric adams  Said he was going to take three paychecks in bitcoin because he was trying to one up the mayor of miami  Oh, it's all about that. Yeah, who said he was going to take a paycheck in bitcoin. Yeah, so it turns out in florida  There's a law that if you don't pay an employee in cash  If you if you use like some kind of coupon or script and the value of that coupon drops in value in the next 30 days  That you have to make the employee whole so there's a chance that you know, oh my god  Francis soares might you know might be able to double dip like get paid in bitcoin and then  If the price of bitcoin drops you might be able to you know, get a you know  Get a sweetener from the city of miami  I don't know that that you know  That has ever been applied to cryptocurrency, but I did find that law on the books in florida very interesting  And you know the whole idea like how are you going to graft bitcoin onto a payroll system?  there is a company that does this called bitpay and  That though is mostly designed around the idea that you've got like  Contractors overseas and you want to pay them in bitcoin, right? Not not something that's going to go through  A regular american payroll system and like what are they going to do take take some satoshis out to?  pay for the social security and medicare withholding like  And then what is the u.s.

He wants to explore setting up a new york city cryptocurrency  Currency  So it's not it's not just bitcoin he loves it all it's all going to be good  I think it's good to teach kids stem  I think that's a good thing  I don't know if they really need to know uh about bitcoin. Maybe I guess blockchain maybe

I mean what politician is going to pass up the opportunity for some some spectacle here  It's good to see this friendly ribbing, you know between yeah mayor  Or mayor elect adams and mayor sores, you know  You can expect that and and there's probably some truths to be extracted from that  You know that anecdote of him walking on the street kids asking about I don't know. What is that? Mr. Mayor? What is bitcoin?  Right, right. I mean clearly  You know, I I think reasonable person could could suggest that it's good to learn about blockchain technology  There's plenty of sure minerals there and so you could learn about economics if you learn about uh

Start time: 2534.32
End time: 2638.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I know that surrounds the whole discussion when we bring this up  Uh, I and i'll be fair. There've been a lot of  People who've said a well, you know, one ever talks about how much the banking system costs environmentally  But there is an environmental cost of visa mastercard and and and the banking system because they all are based on computers. It all uses  Uh, you know resources and we don't ever even make that calculation  So maybe it's unfair to bitcoin to say how expensive it is environmentally and also there is maybe not so much  Uh with bitcoin, but certainly with other cryptocurrencies like ethereum a move towards more environmentally  uh friendly  Technologies like proof of stake instead of proof of work. So I I think people are aware of it  I don't know how fair it is to to paint bitcoin as the environmental evil when  You know, we're also  Doing all sorts of other things that might be equally evil and we just accept them because it's always been that way  You know, there is an interesting side light  On the house  Infrastructure bill which just passed it does have a crypto tax  provision and a reporting provision  That says you have to report if you uh, and and the crypto folks were a little upset about this if uh,  Let's see. Let me  it  We've always said if the in the cash transaction this has been for 40 years is over  $10,000 the law says that the recipient bank or whatever has to verify a bunch of personal information  And notify the government  Apparently now they're going to have to do the same thing with crypto  The crypto industry did not like this  But they were not able to get rid of it so the the president is now it's on his desk for signature

I presume of a value of ten thousand dollars or more  A violation of this by the way is a felony  Uh, and some have said and maybe i'll defer to our attorney on the panel that uh,  When applied to cryptocurrencies and other dishes this digital assets like nfts the law could be nearly impossible to comply with  So that's something scary for people who are dealing in crypto  I guess it's really going to depend on how the treasury decides to enforce this and what enforcement they

Transcript:  um, yeah, like is this a case of um, the crypto community is sort of like trying to read the tea leaves in  like, you know regulation that's just sort of unclear at this stage, right because I know there's been a lot of sort of like  um understandable to some extent but I know that there's been sort of a lot of hysteria in the crypto community about like some of these

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and also specifically like it's one thing where when you know, literally the treasury or like literally congress is looking at crypto, right versus  They're trying to regulate like some aspect of the financial industry and the crypto community is like well  This is applied to us like we're screwed right and it's not it's not clear to me that they're necessarily even like the target of this  right

Start time: 2731.66
End time: 2787.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um, well, I think it's also reasonable for governments to say well  Look if the mayor of new york's gonna get paid in crypto, we need to be able to take taxes  I mean, it's right, right. It's not unreasonable if we're starting to you know  crypto starts being used as a payment system and I think a lot of  Crypto-fanatics would like to say no. No, this is like barter. This should be completely independent of any financial system and certainly not taxable  Well bad news. I think you know, it's already taxable and I think it's gonna get worse. Their real concern was what is a broker?  And because brokers have this obligation to report  Uh, who is that? Does that everybody?  All brokers have to report transactions  Uh over I guess ten thousand dollars. So anyway, that is the law but how the treasury enforces it is is really going to be the  The question anything to add to that. I mean, uh, I don't this is not strictly in your  Ball ballpark evan, but uh, you are at least  You did pass the bar

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right, right. Yeah, I would I would you know, the first thing I would do would be call a tax attorney  Or an accountant, you know to get to get on these things  But you know to sort of underscore a couple of the things that you said leo  I mean this seems to to really be an attack at one of the fundamental  You know talking points about cryptocurrency in general. It's decentralized nature  It's anonymity the ability to do these transactions without easily being traced and and uh,  You're figuring out who that is  But at the same time I don't know that we should be surprised at all that the irs or that there would be legislation that  Would at least appear and I haven't read the bill and I know that that's one of the things about it that it's this  Gargantuan thing is kind of big. Yeah  Yeah, but I mean should we be surprised at a philosophical, you know, sort of abstract level that a progressive administration would  pass  um  Would sign a bill that was passed by a congress comprised how it is that's going to give more power  To the the taxing authorities like this. So i'm just really speaking in the abstract  Yeah, it's a question mark

Start time: 2854.96
End time: 2898.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  uh, but leo  I think what it what it highlights is that we still don't know  from the u.s. Government  What crypto is like now? We've got some you know, some tax rules here that suggest crypto should be taxed like securities because  You're talking about tax and capital gains  But there are other parts of the government that think crypto is  cryptocurrencies are currencies and that you know, is it a currency is it securities is it  property  You know throw nfts in there  I think we still need a lot more regulatory clarity from you know  From the highest levels of government what crypto is  Because otherwise you're going to have piecemeal regulations that don't fit together

Yeah  But but as soon as it starts becoming there's the government's involved  Uh, and and not just our government governments all over the world and and the world bank  And they're talking about stable coin and uh, and as you said, uh  We've even got countries using bitcoin now is their currency. It's it starts to worry me that it's going to be a little  unstable for a while

Transcript:  I think it is but I also think that it's pretty clear that  Governments are moving towards some form of digital money, right?  And like everyone every country is going to want to have some form of digital money like it doesn't have to be  Ethereum right or it doesn't have to be bitcoin or something like that  But I think that we're sort of moving to like a completely digitized financial system and that countries are going to like  Sort of get with the picture. I think eventually what what what will it mean for?  60 million dollar nfts  I don't know  But I think that like I have faith that like sort of governments are going to get with it because they have to and there are  Some benefits of this technology for them, right?  Um, so I think that I think but I do think it'll be like continuing to be a little crazy for a few years  Um, and it's funny to like watch the trends right like a few years ago was all about coin  Initial coin offerings, right and now it's sort of like gone to like digital assets like nfts

Transcript:  I think it was also a regulatory thing, right?  Really do yeah  Yeah  You couldn't really do an ico in the u.s  Anymore and then you couldn't do them in a lot of like there's only a few countries like these prominent sort of countries where there are  Large blockchain communities where you can really do an ico anymore. Yeah  So sort of a cat and mouse game

Transcript:  My question is is how big does the rug pull scenario get like, you know, let's say el salvador is talking about issuing its own  Cryptocurrency, so let's say you've got some small  Authoritarian  Government of a country and they issue a national  Cryptocurrency and then they do a rug pull and like the president is like, you know  President is in their private jet off  Off somewhere and you know, like the the gdp of that country is gone poof

Start time: 3194.78

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean that's happened before right like to some extent, right?  I think it was a few years ago in cyprus that all of a sudden everyone woke up one day and the government just gave  Everyone's bank account a little haircut, right? If you like had your money in the national bank  It was like, oh, we're gonna just take off 10% of that real quick, right? So like I think that's already sort of possible  but  Uh, you know, there are a lot of reasons why you might not want to but yeah  I do think a rug pull from a government is amazing and terrifying. Um, and also i'm curious about like  Sort of organized crime. I mean they're ready is that right? But like, you know  Instead of doing ransomware are these people going to move into shit coins, right? Is that going to be?  more of a problem like

Transcript:  Yeah, it's crazy  I actually I should have mentioned this this goes back now to february of this year, but there was an article  I don't think it was widely read  And medium by a guy named evan hatch  uh, it was a tribute ostensibly to a guy named lenn sassiman who uh,  Died 10 years ago committed suicide 10 years ago was an original cypher punk and very involved  In a lot of the early research on crypto his death was  Almost exactly two months after satoshi nakamoto's last communication and in this article again came out in february  Evan goes comes a little bit short of saying he was satoshi nakamoto  But boy, he sure gives some very strong evidence that if anybody was it was this guy  He certainly had the knowledge. He had worked on many of the early  technologies that  bitcoin  uh came out of  uh initially pgp he worked at pgp and then later on anonymous remailers, which is really uh the kind of the  ancestor to cryptocurrencies  um, it's a anyway  I don't know. I wouldn't say pitch an article to new york newsweek magazine about this, but I suspect that actually we do know  Uh who satoshi nakamoto was or one of the people who was very much involved in this and he passed away 10 years ago  Which would explain why?  The literally billions of dollars in bitcoin held by that account has never been cashed in I think it's a huge amount of money

It's 64 billion dollars  Actually, it's more than that on the based on the latest rise in value in bitcoin  It's a huge amount of untouched bitcoin  And I think it was in fact, i'm i'm gonna put my money on it being this guy linds assaman  Who is now gone 10 years, but who was a cypherpunk very involved  In all of this stuff. It had the skills the knowledge  To do this and was very much all about personal liberties privacy  Uh, he was he was you know fighting against government surveillance  Uh, he was the kind mentally and the kind of guy who would create a cryptocurrency and he had the chops  To do it, which is kind of very interesting. Anyway, I just wouldn't he think it was crazy then to have government run  You know centralized. Absolutely. That was exactly what they were trying to get around

Yeah, there's so much that's paradoxical about all this  I mean there's the idea of of that sort of sort of becoming the norm and  And and you know leo a few minutes ago you asked, you know, is this this  Is this craziness going to to persist and I mean certainly I think it's just it's gonna get worse nature  It's gonna get worse. Yeah, it's got and with with new opportunities and the growing complexity of things and there's a little bit of  of it's interesting going back to the  the uh, the squid coin situation there was a in in one of the  Articles in the rundown was this guy in shanghai who lost 28 grand  I think it's just interesting how  There's a there's a certain correlation certain certain I was saying it was it was poetic  That is the squid coin that that happened with  relating to the subject matter of squid game where people are really in desperate financial situations doing erratic things so  Yeah, there's there's as long as humans have a certain desire and avarice. It's going to going to be this way

Transcript:  Uh speaking of desire and avarice it's time for me to take a break  But we will come back great panel. Nice to have you back louise matzakis  uh now freelancer  Uh, so what should people just call you and have you write articles for them? I think that's a good idea  Please I would appreciate that l matsakis on twitter l m l m a t s a  k i  S o and thomas senior editor over at protocol, which is a great relatively new publication  Doing really i'm just really impressed with protocol doing really good work. Yeah, and of course our friend megan maroney is over there as well  And speaking of friends longtime co-host at twill this week in law evan brown  Uh attorney at law in technology and intellectual property our show today brought to you by e-set  uh, i i uh  I for the longest time I would come into work and russell our it guy be there and I'd be like a scene out of  Marathon mass here. We are we safe. Are we safe russell? I'm so worried about getting hacked about  fishing attacks  Lately we've been getting a lot of emails from people sending saying thank you for the 500  The invoice is here. We appreciate it hoping that we'll call and say what are you talking about and then pay it  Uh, they're constantly attacking and this is why when I ask russell are we safe and he says we're safe  I say how he says we use e-set the global leaders in cyber  security  E-set we know we hear from them all the time because they are leaders in security research  Three times a year. They put out their e-set threat report. This is actually and you've heard steve gibson quoted and others  It's a 40 page report you can get it right now if you go to we live security  Dot com search for threat report. You'll find it fascinating stats and actionable insights on topics like  Info stealers ransomware stalkerware more the kinds of phishing attacks. I was just talking about  Uh, this is why we're really happy. We use e-set, you know our editors  They do all of our editing using adobe premiere  on lovely dell precision workstations running  windows 8.1  We don't want to upgrade them to a later version of windows because it's a nice stable environment  But how do they stay safe?  We put e-set on those machines and the thing about e-set that i've always loved is it's lightweight  It doesn't use a lot of resources whether your cpu or memory so you get protection  Top notch protection without slowing down and that's something the editors really appreciate. It's faster and more precise than typical  endpoint protection  Because of something called e-set's dynamic threat defense or edtd what they do this is so smart  When a when an email comes in with an attachment they use cloud-based  Sandboxing technology to isolate and detect never before seen threats  So this is really important because the threats are constantly changing. You can't just scan for known threats. You've got to proactively  Find these threats and detect kind of malicious software  That's what edtd does it it looks at documents at scripts and installers executables, of course  Runs them in the cloud not on your systems not on your network  It puts them up in the cloud runs them and analyzes them in this safe sandboxed environment  So they get code analysis and deep inspection. They use machine learning in memory. They actually look at the memory analysis. They use ai  They're looking for behavior  based  Malware, they look at behaviors and they can allow or block a file in minutes  So before those files even touch your servers, but they touch your computers  E-set has scanned them and approved them or you never see it at all  And this is amazing speed with no demand on system resources  That's what something endpoint detection just can't do  No one wants their organization to be patient zero at a cyber attack  We never saw this one before but hey, you got it congratulations if you want  You don't want to be that guy you want if you're looking for world-class ransomware protection  You're going to want e-set's dynamic threat defense and it comes of course with e-set protect complete  That's what we use it includes endpoint security you get a full disk encryption too with a really good encryptions technology  Advanced security for microsoft 365 we use that  Lisa loves her excel so  They have native protection, but there are gaps and that's why e-set is so important right now  E-set protect complete is 20 off. You can try it before you buy it  Get your free e-set business trial and an interactive demo go to business.eset.com  To it we use it. It works. I don't know how we've we've I feel like we've skated by  Never had a problem with malware. I guess I can thank russell and I can thank he said you can't have russell  But you can have e-set protect complete 20 off with our limited time offer go to business.eset.com  slash  Twit russell not available  He's mine damn it  But I oh I swear the poor guy constantly go are we safe are we safe are we safe?  Yes, we are. Thanks. Thanks to e-set. We really appreciate him  Let us continue on  Oh  Yeah, pappy cappy just read the article I was talking about about lenz assam and  and  There is actually a tribute to him embedded in the bitcoin blockchain permanently  Another reason they're kind of it's interesting. It's interesting. I don't know. I wouldn't  I don't know. Nobody's making any claims  Let's talk about chip shortage because uh, it's far from over  Over  Now they're saying not next year  But the year after before this starts  to ease up  wall street journal saying 2023  Louise is this a china problem? Uh, is it a u.s problem? What's going on?

End time: 3910.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a good question. Um, so I think that there are a lot of issues here  Um, one of them is also just like more demand than we expected right like people bought a lot more cars  They bought a lot more computers. They bought a lot more other sorts of electronics during the pandemic than was sort of projected, right?  And also what you see with chip development in general is that it's the cyclical process that takes a while right?  Like so we develop new chips. Um, we figure out how to manufacture them on a big scale  We put all those chips in electronics  Uh, then we put all this money back into rnd, um, and that process happens again, right and uh over time  We've seen sort of the you know pace at which chips, uh improve  Uh, you know has sort of been like the axis is shaped like this, right? It's been like going, you know  And that might be slowing down. Um, so there are a lot of things happening in the chip market is really complicated  But yeah, there definitely is part of this which is like supply chain problems because of factories  in asia  So yeah, I think that that's part of it, but it's a really complicated market and I think  Supply chain is really complicated and we're seeing slowdowns everywhere with all sorts of things and I think it's really sort of exposing for people  Um that the magic of how they get that amazon package the next day is a really complicated  Chain of events right and that's true for chips and that's true for basically everything else  It's always sort of unsettling though, right when you realize like oh I can't get the new iphone because like that's something we sort of expected

Transcript:  Well, and apple's always been the poster boy for how to do this, right?  They went to tsmc and basically bought up all their production  And actually this I think has been part of the problem  I've heard as well companies like ford car companies apple and others hoarding chips  Uh, especially these legacy nodes chips not the not the you know, the a15 or the m1 but but the little  You know doohickeys that do things like acceleration and gps  Uh, those are traditional chips others are vying for those chips  So these companies are buying them in great numbers and hoarding them before they're even using them  Which in right makes it worse for everybody else as well

Oh no. Yeah  I mean, I don't know about like, you know some of these smoking devices. Um, it's just so  You know, it's become so ubiquitous that we don't realize like how many things that's gonna affect  I think cars is really big  I think sort of for your average person because of course your car has computer chips in it, right?

He says i'm a 20-year truck driver. I'll tell you why  America's shipping crisis will not end and he points out that it's it's not  It's not boats lined up at the container ports in los angeles and long beach  It's that you don't have enough  Crane operators to offload the boats. You don't have enough trucks to take what's offloaded  Um, he says there's a huge crisis in truck drivers and this is this then ties into this  The big what do they call it the grand resignation that's happening in america where after covid people are not going back to work  They're saying I don't want that crappy job  anymore  And this guy's describing, you know, if you're not a union driver  It's a nightmare. You could spend a  a day waiting for a container to be unloaded and you don't get paid by the hour you're getting paid by the  delivery  And so you're making pennies an hour  Because of the short staffing and the slow offloading and so forth  So there is a complex chain of problems

Start time: 4110.40
End time: 4135.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and that issue that you're describing like it didn't used to be that way, right?  Like we turned a lot of truckers in this country into independent contractors and it was like, uh,  Here's how you can get rich. You can buy a truck and become an independent trucking contractor  And it caused a lot of problems clearly right like it made the job a lot harder. It put people in debt  Um, and now with these shipping delays, they're not getting paid right? It's like what's the incentive to do that job, right? Um, right

Transcript:  He says this is the new normal all brought to you by the experts running our supply chain  Uh, but it but it also these experts it made sense  When demand was consistent and you and supply was consistent you could do just in time shipping just in time manufacturing  But it all collapses  If there's a hiccup at any point cove it started it but then in in the light of covet there was greater demand that caused bigger problems  So it's a whole bunch of things  It's a mess and it's not going to go away maybe not even till 2024  According to the wall street journal. There are things you can order things now. You won't get until  2024 which is kind of  mind-boggling

I said, oh, yeah, we're getting that  So we could review it and then then our head editor  Anthony who's using an old intel old two-year-old intel macbook  He needs a new one. This would be a perfect perfect replacement  Uh, it was supposed to come on monday  And I don't know what happened the fedex guy just didn't even attempt to deliver it  They just returned it. They said, uh, we don't know where this is  Even even though we get to live fedex deliveries every day here  For some reason so I called apple. They said oh, it's too late. It's been returned for a refund  We'll we'll refund you in a bit. I don't know when we'll see we'll see when we get the money back  So I said, well, can I order again? They said yeah, you'll get it  You probably get it before the end of the year. Maybe maybe right around christmas time  It's like well, so that's not a funny story.

I I don't want to  Bring you down  But I just want to point out that in every case when they talk about a metaverse in science fiction  Whether it's snow crash or neuromancer or ready player one. It's as an escape to a horrible  corporate dystopia  That real life is so miserable that people want to put on the glasses and go play  In the in the metaverse  So maybe mark zuckerberg has his finger on the pulse of the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Welcome to dystopia. Yeah. Yeah. Oh and i'm so glad he used the word rippling because that's how I was thinking about rippling  Rippling chaos is the term you use I was thinking about the rippling effect. I mean  particularly with the chip shortage it really  Expands out to affect so much more than just goods but it really starts to affect innovation as well  I mean look at what cold water this is for, you know, i-o the development of iot technologies innovation  You know and hardware there and then of course the innovation in the the software and the networking and everything else that goes around that  so  rippling is a  very accurate way of thinking about these effects  Particularly when it's something as as critical as as a chip shortage here and there is a cryptocurrency named ripple

We just now  Uh set our clocks back this morning at 2 a.m  Uh, I think we're the one of the last countries to do that  I don't know why we still do that all the evidence all the research shows. It's both psychologically and physiologically harmful  It doesn't save energy. It's got no real purpose  It's just one of those things. It's hard to change  I was talking about this with my wife this morning. She says well, I don't think we should change to standard time  I think we should just make daylight saving time permanent which seems to be a popular  Thing but that would require I don't know what that would require that would because that's your time zone  You can  It's basically saying well, we don't want to be in this time zone  We want to be in a different time zone. I don't think you I don't know who's in charge of time zones  But can you just say though we decided we want to be in the time zone one over. I don't think you can do that  Can you?

Yeah, they don't do it  Only about 70 countries still observe daylight saving time, by the way, it's not a majority  uh  so

It's coordinated universal time  And in no language on the earth is it utc but they just decided because nobody is sufficiently confused  We're going to call a utc even though that acronym doesn't work in any language  at all  So, um, I don't the only good thing about this is thanks to technology. I don't have to set as many clocks  Do you do you guys did you have to ebbing wander around the house and set the clocks just the old school ones?  Yeah, we have a cuckoo clock  And I don't want to wind it backwards so I just stopped it for now  That was the hardest one  But it is nice because all you know your phone all the devices you use these days to tell the time  All of them know right and just fix themselves automatically even my car knows what time it is  My body doesn't I woke up at 5 a.m. Yeah, it's bad for your  Physiology and your psychology there are more car crashes on the monday after  I think it's worse going to daylight saving time because you're losing an hour  At least we're getting an hour  No, autosync says utc is the french way. It's not the french way is uh,  Well, anyway, go look it up in wikipedia.

Transcript:  You left off the makes sense they cut off his makes sense  I didn't I wasn't there for steve's epic rant against microsoft, but I hear it was a hum dinga  If you haven't watched security now yet, you might want to watch it  So what did I take to mexico with me besides my outrageous mexican shirt that says oaxaca  My cowboy hat boots and bolo tie. I took express vpn our sponsor for this segment of this week in tech  Going online without express vpn  Is like using the bathroom and not closing the door  Okay, that's not an image I want to have in my mind but in a way it is true because  You are literally in public  When you're going out on the internet your internet service provider sees every single website you visit and we now know  From research which just recently came out that all the major isp's the ftc didn't want to name names  But all the major isps are collecting much more than just the websites  And they are it's absolutely legal for them to sell that on to marketers ad companies  Anybody who the highest bidder who then use your data to target you?  Close the door and be a little more private. That's why I use express vpn  Now I was using it for security as much as privacy. There's really three reasons express vpn is a great choice security for sure  All your data coming from your computer is encrypted all the way out to the express vpn server  That means no man in the middle. Nobody can see what you're doing. Even when you're an exposed in an open wi-fi network  You're safe. So that's great. It's an encrypted tunnel a secure encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet  Not only does that protect you against bad guys  It means your online activity is invisible to your carrier your internet service provider anybody who wants to snoop on you  They don't know what you're doing and when you would emerge on the internet you emerge with an express vpn ip address  An ip address shared by other express vpn users. So you're you're just  anonymous  It's it's also  I have to say a great way to watch video  When I was in mexico netflix wouldn't let me  Uh watch the movies I downloaded they say they're not available in this country  One button express vpn yes, I can watch it. It's a great way to eliminate those kind of regional content protection  so privacy  security  Content it's also super fast super secure but super fast and that's why I really like express vpn  They invest in infrastructure so that they do have enough bandwidth. Sometimes people say I don't use a vpn. It slows me down  Not express vpn. You can actually put it on your router protect your whole household and no one will notice  It's easy to put on any device. They've got it for everything including smart tvs ios android windows mac linux  You fire up the app you click one button and you're protected  Uh, and I tell you that kind of protection  Is worth its weight in gold, but it's not going to cost you that much less than seven bucks a month  When you use our special offer and I think it's important to pay for a vpn because you want to incent them not to cop  You know spy on you not to you know to provide enough bandwidth to constantly rotate the ip addresses all of the things that a good  Vpn does and of course those regular audits to prove that they do live up to their privacy policy  They never log you their trusted server technology keeps them from being able to log you secure your online activity by visiting express vpn.com  slash twitter  express vpn dot com slash twi  You'll get an extra three months free when you sign up for a year, that's the best deal big discount express vpn  dot com  Slash to what we thank you so much for the support and for keeping us safe  As we travel  Down to mexico. That was a lot of fun. I want to by the way, thank  Uh mike elgin who's on this show frequently and you all know him. We he worked here for some time as our news director  his wife amira we did the  And I want to give him a plug their gastronomad adventures  Mike had been talking about doing this for a long time. He they've lived all over the world and they  They've had houses in many many countries and they decided to use their connections and their knowledge to take people on  Experiences if you go to gastronomad.net  They do experiences all over the world the provance is coming up prosecco. They're going to do morocco  We did the oaxaca experience through the day with the day of the dead. That was just incredible  Amira knows everybody we saw that we ate the best food went to the best restaurants met the best chefs  We had a cooking class that was unbelievable involved catching our own grasshoppers  Because that's a big part  Oaxacan cuisine is roasted grasshoppers. They were actually quite tasty  Uh, they're going to do mexico city. They're going to do prosecco  I think prosecco is the next one if you want to know more it was a lot of fun and i'm not  I paid my way  They didn't give me a freebie.

I can't I gotta get back on the road  They don't want to live anywhere  Uh, but they've but when they do live they've lived over the last say 10 15 years  They've lived probably a year in oaxaca a year in morocco. They've lived in these places  Um, so they really know them but they don't want to they're footloose and fancy free  It's kind of a kind of neat. I think they're back in the u.s  Right now mike's helping his son kevin with a chatterbox. They're doing a big event  And then I think they go back out on the road. So  Yeah, it's really uh, it's really cool. I had a lot of fun brought the pixel six with me. Thank you. Uh, jason  Jason howell let me  Borrow his google loaner google approved it  Uh until because mine came the day after I left so I have now I have my pixel six and I gave jason back his  but I uh, I wanted to try  Uh photography with a pixel six because they're really selling  photography  And um, I have mixed feelings about this any of you have any of you tried the the pixel six. Are you familiar with it?  No, nobody  I'll show you so one of the things they're really  Uh promoting is night mode right this these night photography so because it was day of the dead  We went to a graveyard this graveyard is lit only by candles and you can see some distant lights  This is actually the the raw version of this  and then this is the  you know the  Computationally enhanced and I have to say does a really good job, especially if nobody's moving  which in a graveyard is not so hard, but uh,  I did like the night vision, but I have to say and and I think ant prude has said this  As well, let me find see if I can find a good example  It does a lot of processing  And in some cases the images that you get off the pixel six are  Kind of I feel like a little over processed

Start time: 5560.96
End time: 5587.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They they look like they're oil paintings instead of do you have to like hold it too like with the night mode because the thing  That's so annoying about the newer iphones is like sometimes  Like you accept that the lighting is not good, but you like are trying to get that picture, right?  But but you you whip it out and if you have it at night mode it need the exposure needs to be longer  Right and then so you're just sort of like holding it there for a while and sometimes then like it gets blurry or like  It's just not a super  user friendly experience

Start time: 5587.80
End time: 5944.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They they do know you you you do want to hold it steady and if people are moving in it  They're going to maybe be a little blurry  Um, but they what they're doing is they're taking multiple images  I don't know if it's in the pixel six if it's still this is a pixel six pro if it's still nine images  It was nine images in early versions of the pixel  It's like an ai right that it's and then they do they kind of do hdr. You know, uh, where they take multiple exposures at different  F stops and merge them together, but then a lot of it is ai  Boy, i'm sorry. I'm going I have so many pictures. I'm trying to find the one  That I will illustrate this the best I have a picture of lisa out in the agave  fields somewhere around here  Um, and and it's it's it smushes it a little bit now. You only notice that if you pixel peep  If you really um you zoom in so this is a good example and this image it looks pretty good  And it is an hdr image because I can tell you not that it was dark  It was daylight but the clouds and everything get great sky detail even though that's much brighter  Than the shadows in front of me, but you can see detail in all of it. But if you if you zoom in  I don't know if I can actually do this. Let me see here if I zoom in on lisa. I don't know if I can get  Close enough  Instead of doing what it's what I would expect which is pixelated like this  I'm not going to be able to it gets it gets uh painterly it looks like an oil painting  I don't know if I can quite  Show you yeah  It's not it's not doing it for me  Um, if you if you do it on maybe this will maybe this will show it a little bit  Yeah, it's a little bit so look at her hand. It's a little bit  smeary  Instead of pixelated the ai is trying to uh guess  pixels  And as a result it's not perfect so I don't I think honestly  It you know everything everybody says about it is right it's an amazing camera  But it doesn't replace a good camera. It's great for like instagram facebook  Posts where you're not going to look at the pixels  Pixel peep this this is a good example because you can see this is the raw and you can see what the original photo  Had and then what it did to her face  It makes it kind of like a painting  It's hard to describe so aunt prudes kind of said that with his hands on photography  I just want to kind of reiterate that he's right. There's a lot of computational photography  And it is maybe not quite as pleasing maybe as the iphone 13  I wouldn't I I was going to say oh, this is the best camera ever. I was thinking that from  You know what people have said about it. It's pretty amazing  But it's computational and it's very much not  As natural as you might expect and I think in some ways the iphone does a better job  They're all good given you know  Given the fact that it's this little sensor  Portable device in your pocket. Let's not be  Unreasonable  Faulty drm breaks dozens of games on alder lake these new intel cpus look very good  The benchmarks are really impressive  Especially because intel is under assault from apple right now with the m1 pro and the m1 max alder lake their next generation which  Is is out but probably won't start appearing in computers till early next year is very impressive. However  However, it does break drm which you know  So  Drm is a problem  Um and apparently about 50 games. We just won't run  on alder lake machines  Partly because of maybe there's big little design kind of like what apple's doing  intel  Is pushing out a fix as is microsoft  Intel has a list of 22 games that don't work either on 10 or 11  29 more that don't work under 10, but will work if you go to 11  And a intel says a mid november os update should fix the issue for 11 of those games  For the rest intel has to work with the game developers and their copy protection damn that copy protection  um, so if you're having trouble  I guess the general advice is don't be the first to use a brand new chip  Apple if you go ahead if you can even get a brand new chip if you could get one don't use it  Yeah, I don't know how all these people know it doesn't work. I didn't even know you could  Get an alder lake system. I guess they can  Apple has kind of  Taking a  A shot at the right to repair move, but this is from our good friends that I fix it former sponsor  They call it a screen repair trap  And they say it could change the repair industry forever apparently in the iphone 13  If you get third-party screen replacement  The iphone disables its face id functionality completely we have confirmed this  Says i fix it repeatedly in our lab testing with many different phones  On ios 15 and 15 one  Others numerous repair professionals have said this  Uh i fix it says a dark day for fixers both diy and professional  One of the most common phone repairs that and by the way  It's common because everybody drops these slippery little things that could be done with hand tools now requires a microscope  And you're going to lose face id  Comments thoughts apple's been historically kind of  Fighting the right to repair movement. I think you should I mean it's third-party

Transcript:  Isn't this just a continuation of the way they've been all along right making it difficult to get into things and you know  One thing one kind of window into this is the way the dmca digital millennium millennium copyright  Heck has you know the anti-circumvention provisions and then every three years  There there's this process to identify certain exemptions to that things that you can  Circumvent and it won't be a violation of the anti-circumvention provisions  And I think if you look at the general trend those exemptions have gotten more robust over the years since  I guess 2001 was the first year where there were exemptions because it's every three years  um for for that and  There's that which is I think encouraging but it also just seems like the general  principle of  Uh, the right to repair is in line with the way our sentiments ought to be in terms of consumer protection  The more sophisticated these devices get the the easier it is to be locked out  And so I just hope we see a more general trend toward  uh regulation  Uh that is actually liberating to the consumer and and allows there to be more and I think we

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's remain optimistic that that will happen apple has always said. Oh, no, no, no  We're in favor of people repairing their phones, but we're just all about security  Ifixit says it's hard to understand as a security measure because the face id illuminator is entirely separate from the screen  Uh, you can if you are willing to go through  some hoops  Join apple's uh independent repair network  Which then gives you it's very much like john dear it gives you the ability to do the repair and then  reauthorize face id  through apple  You have to log in to repair the repair log the repair to apple's cloud servers  You have to sync the serial numbers of the phone and screen apple can approve or deny each individual repair and then  Having if they approve it, uh, your face id will work  This is a lot like what john dear does you can get a third party?  repair job on your tractor  But unless you have the special john dear software to authorize it  You can't use it  And uh, I have to say I don't think this is about security  I think apple is pretty clearly and this certainly is the point of view of ifixit  Established that they just don't want you repairing your phones. They want to they want to do it. They don't want I think it's just

Transcript:  Yeah, and I just think it's really concerning. Um, especially just with the ubiquity of smartphones now like, you know, I  Had my car breakdown in the middle of rural virginia, right and I was able to find uh, you know  Really kind of scary but it was a it was a shock, right?  they were able to look at the car and at least like establish what was wrong with it and it was a  scary experience, but  I wasn't inhibited by my car manufacturer, right?  And I think that that's so important like there's so many parts of the country where it is a feat to get to an apple store  Right. It might even even be a feat to get to one of these licensed repair technicians and it's such a disservice to your  Customers to make it super difficult. It's bad for the environment because a lot of people look at this and say  Oh my god, it's just so expensive. I don't want to pay that price  I'm just gonna get a new iphone right like if it's gonna cost me a third  or even half of a new iphone to get my face id and screen repaired might as well just like get a new phone and like  Try and recycle the one that I have right and that is sort of the incentive that amazon  amazon that uh apple is aligned to right and I think that's part of the problem they'll say like that's not what we're trying  To do right but that's clearly better for their bottom line because one of these existential risks that apple is facing is that  Remember like, you know in  2013 or so, you know your friend would get the new iphone and you would sort of crowd around them and be like wow  Like they have the new iphone like my i feel so out of date  And that's not really the case anymore. Right? It's sort of slowed down the amount of technological improvement between like, you know  The 12 and the 13 or whatever  Is a lot less. So I think that apple's incentivized to you know, make sure you get a new phone  And one way to do that is to ensure that it's harder to fix it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a  There see apple seems to be very willing  To do things that are clearly for their bottom line and then justify it with some  highfalutin  philosophical  Justification oh  This this repair thing is not for us. It's not that we want to make money on repairs  We just want to keep our users secure  Uh, greg federegui gave a speech this week in in portugal at the web summit  In which he said side loading because remember  Congress the eu and the doj all are you know, and the courts are all looking, you know at apple's  uh  App store and saying, you know, in fact in some cases, uh, I think south korea  They're saying you have to allow other third-party app stores on the iphone federegui  Invokes this whole idea of security to protect their business interests and apple  I think that's a very bad road to go down. He says side talk about overwrought  sideloading is a cyber criminals best friend and requiring that on the iphone would be a gold rush for the malware industry  That one provision in the dma  He's talking about the digital markets act in the eu could force every iphone user into a landscape of professional  con artists trying constantly to fool them  Okay tone it down a little bit craig and I understand that  To some degree that you know, that's accurate  It is a little more risky to side load google's allowed that forever and they have all sorts of warnings saying, you know  It's risky. It's so forth  Trust your users a little bit more  But I think you've got to stop using this kind of rhetoric to justify what is clearly just I want to make more money  We want to make more money. We don't want a third-party problem

Transcript:  Right, like that's part of the problem is that like it's often somewhat true, right?  Like for a while there was this argument that was like, oh well, there's less scams  There's less, um like malware on the apple store because like we're investing in this like really rigorous approval process  Which like you know other companies like google don't have or like that was the argument for a long time or you know  I can sort of see the like really dystopian case someone buys your cracked iphone on ebay  And then they restore phase id and then they steal all of your information, right?  Like I can see these scenarios they're talking about and there's some like kernel of truth there  And so it makes it really hard to argue with

Transcript:  It was really like for me what really like solidified it for me how ridiculous this was was watching it happen on a state level  Because we saw this sort of begin before like congress started paying attention. It was happening sort of state by state  and the apple lobbyists would go in and they would literally like take some like state lawmakers and they would like  Show them. I think one of the stories that came out a few years ago  Lee i'm sure you could find this really quickly on the internet. I think it was in vice  um  They like said that you were to like hurt your fingers on the glass  Like these arguments were just like really silly that like people are going to get hurt if we allow this  Like like physically hurt and it's like this is ridiculous, you know, like like most people are not going to try and do it themselves  I think it's great. By the way, I think what iFix is doing is amazing  You should try and do it yourself if you can but a lot of people you know to evan's point are going to go  To these small businesses  Um, you know my boyfriend and I were in shenzhen and there was a little stall exactly like that picture and I think it took  10 15 minutes. It's easy. Um  Yeah, it's really not that bad and it was great I think it costs like I don't know like 20 usd or something  And then we were on our way

Transcript:  I think there's also a case to be made that it's good for the environment. It's good for humans  It's good because make these phones more repairable  I just brought the we've talked a lot about at the framework laptop because I wanted to support this idea of making something that you could open  repair replace  Upgrade yourself  You could do that with a phone  uh, it's  I think that it's apple's decision to make these disposable devices  And charge more than a thousand dollars and every few years  um  It became agreed and I I think you could make it more repairable and you should encourage that

Start time: 6647.76
End time: 6668.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the problem is that that's what the wealth is built on right and like now you see apple like sort of making this very  conscientious decision to sort of shift to services right to shift to like their new gaming product to ship to like apple new  Subscriptions because I think that they realize that that the consumer wants that the consumer does not want to buy a thousand dollar phone  And then need to buy another one in 18 months. I think we're seeing sort of a revolt to that

Start time: 6668.60
End time: 6684.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It does feel like apple's doing this though because they would like you to buy a new phone instead of getting it fixed, right?

I mean, I think I  I have no regrets. It was definitely a look but um  But now you go in there and like they there's a lot more freedom  There's a lot more I think it's also like changing cultures about like tattoos and piercings  but I but I noticed on like their little bulletin board it was like  um  you know if you if you refer someone you get like several hundred dollars or something and you see sort of like  A lot more of these companies are trying to accommodate workers. I think it's great  I mean, I think that like there's a better appreciation of labor now because you know, the attitude was definitely  You like you should be so grateful to be here, right? And I think that now there's a lot  You know, this is a transaction between two people and the worker also has power. Um, I think is you know  What this moment is showing us, um, and i'm all for it

Start time: 7110.42
End time: 7156.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wonder I wonder how much it has to do with the fact that you know  The last two years will just round up and and say that it has had so much to sort of give us  Uh subject matter to think existentially, you know where it could be getting ill, uh losing a job  I agree losing a losing a source of income having a loved one ill things going on political  And so it's it's been the natural impulse of thoughtful people to  Re-evaluate, uh their purpose and that's sort of driving a deeper desire deeper  You know guided by a deeper understanding to do something meaningful  Seems like we've always given lip service to that  But the context of the last 18 months two years has really been more of a catalyst to actually make it happen  In principle not just not just talk about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you know, I think the you know to to tie to tech I think that yes, please great resignation has been otherwise i'm in trouble  No, no, no, but  You know, I think a lot of this has been happening in tech a lot of it has to do with uh, you know remote work  and like the idea that like  You can now get a job not from like this set of companies in a specific  Geography, but like any company in the world is now bidding for your services  If you know if you're a software engineer or a marketer or you know  Have have in-demand skills. Um  It's it's also global. Uh in china, it's called the lie flat movement. Oh, so  um, you know, which is what it sounds like like I am just going to  Lie down on the floor and like not work  um because  You know  Because in china, especially tech workers are exhausted. There's this  996 system meeting work from 9 a.m. To 9 p.m. Six days a week  Which uh, actually the the government there the chinese government has been cracking down on it as a labor abuse  but yeah, I think I think that it's  Um, it's worldwide. That's probably what's what's most fascinating and that's probably you know, as evan points out it  It has a lot to do with the pandemic that we're all experiencing at the same time. That's kind of making this question like  You know  Why am I working? How much risk am I taking on by working? Um, you know, it's really changed its calculations

End time: 7279.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, I think it's worth noting though that like the lying flat movement is also like even bigger than just the pandemic, right?  I think it's like to your point leo about like no offense what your generation may be sold some of my generation  Um, because I think it's also about like just not wanting to participate in this rat race at all, right?

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean it's interesting to your point i want about like the backlash of some of this from the government some of the companies  Um, I thought it was interesting that I think it was like within 24 hours at least 48 hours of sort of this like big shake  Up, um at bite dance the owner of tik tok  Um, you know the ceo sort of like receding and it seems like one of the very last  You know things that sort of came down before this big executive shake-up is that they actually ended working that way  So now the hours are much more sort of like normal working hours. So they ended  um  The expectation that you would work nine to nine six days a week and now I think let me see what the hours are now  but it's like  Uh, they shorten them to like, you know more normal work hours  And I do wonder if that's also part about like retention right and like being able to keep people in an environment where workers are  Like hey, wait a minute. I have a little bit more bargaining power here than I used to

Start time: 7330.86
End time: 7379.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's also the case that during covet you saw these billionaire moguls become even more rich  Uh, you know, it was a big windfall for people like elon musk and jeff bezos  And I have to say there is the other tech angle is that this maybe all began with tech workers, particularly engineers  who  Realized they were so valuable to the company that they didn't have to put up with crap  That they could say no, we're not going to do that and the company would have to say oh  Because it you guys are valuable without you're much more valuable  Because there's a scarcity of talent  Uh, it's not it's not a friction-free market  Costs us a lot to get new people to train them up to give them stock options  I think that also is part of it.

Transcript:  Yeah for those just listening for some reason unknown there's a kid hanging upside down in a swing and  Running his hair through a mud puddle as he swings back and forth. No one knows why  It's just it's just part of the fun. It's a really deep metaphor  There's also another way to get ad free versions of the shows we've we've also turned on subscriptions on apple's  iTunes as you may know they have their own it's audio only they have their own subscription platform 2.99  If you just want one show this show or security now, whatever just one show you can subscribe to that for 2.99 a month  We do this show and everybody's invited to watch us do it live  We have a live feed every sunday afternoon 2 30 pacific  5 30 eastern  21 30. Oh, no, I have to change that don't I because uh, it's bringing in a 20 30 utc  I think that's right. The math always throws me every six twice twice a year. I gotta figure that all out again  If you want to watch this live, there's a live stream audio or video at twit tv slash live  You can chat with us for free absolutely free in our chat room irc.twit.tv  Always great people in there. Of course  There's a great discord chat going on too and it has one thing  That the the irc chat does not animated gifs and and that makes  And that makes all all the difference  Uh after the fact shows all of our shows are available whether you want to go to our website twitter tv  There's a youtube channel for every show  You can watch the video there  Of course the easiest way to get a subscribe in your favorite podcast player. And if you do  Would you do us a favor tell the world about twit leave us a five-star review. Let the world know  About the goodness that is this week in tech. I think  the longest running  continuously running  Tech podcast or at least one of them. We've been doing this since april 2005. That's a good long time to be doing a show  Thanks for being here. I'm gonna say it again  For the what is this 848th time another twit is in the can have a great week. We'll see you next week
