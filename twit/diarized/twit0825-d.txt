Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no.  Because I live in Park Slope.  So it's just from one side of Brooklyn to the other.  But also I do the electric city bikes.  So it's actually cool.

End time: 323.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's an exceedingly pleasant commute because once you get across, go on us and  whatever, the whole rest of the way is just along the waterfront right on the East  River.  So, you know, skyline.  And it's protected, right?  Exactly.  Right.  That's my whole thing is I try to I find all these routes where it's least on the  road as possible.  Right.

End time: 346.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's one all along Prospect Park.  There's one all along the waterfront here.  They're they don't really connect well enough.  Like that's what they really should plan out.  So you could go everywhere.  Yeah.  Right.  There's always like a gap somewhere where it's like, OK, I'm on Vanderbilt and I've  got to deal with buses or whatever.  Yikes.  As long as you can minimize.

Transcript:  What do I count?  How do I count?  Yeah, it's funny because here in Petaluma, you take your life in your hands to get on  a bike.  There's no there's no safe spots, no havens in the countryside.  What should we start with?  Amazon buys MGM for eight point five billion dollars.  They got James Bond.

Start time: 373.96
End time: 427.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  I will give you full credit.  So, A, it has to get by regulation regulators, right?  Which seems like it might be a little challenging.  They make the content, they distribute the content.  Should they be allowed to do both?  But there is an interesting sidebar to this.  Not only they didn't get a lot of the musicals, but they did get James Bond.  But there's also MGM TV, which owns, besides The Handmaid's Tale and Fargo, The Apprentice.  And apparently owns all the tapes of The Apprentice.  So there has now been some spec...  Oh, there's now been some speculation if Jeff Bezos, who's kind of been the hereditary  enemy of a man named Donald Trump, might do something with those videos in the vaults.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I hope he's too busy.  You know, there may be stuff that's somewhat incriminating, who knows?  But it doesn't matter because if you have all the behind the scenes material of anything,  you can make anybody look like an idiot.  Trust me, I know.  So I wouldn't credit anything you saw out of this.  There's always been this thought that, you know, I bet they edited out all the parts  where the Donald is screaming at people and using racial epithets, and maybe they did.  But even if they didn't, you could still make him look like a fool.  So I don't know.  Yeah, I hope Jeff's a little more busy than that.  But we shall see.

Start time: 493.84
End time: 510.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, doesn't it feel to you like Jeff, at least in recent years, is more interested  in the Hollywood stuff anyway?  Like he...  I feel like handing things over to Jassy is the day to day so that he can continue his  Hollywood mogul lifestyle, you know?

Transcript:  He's a helicopter pilot.  He's taken back to the skies again in helicopters despite being in that terrible accident in  the early 2000s where he almost died in one.  He's got a lot of things in his place.

Start time: 530.36
End time: 545.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You'll never get me a helicopter.  Helicopter though, I have to say it's generally rich people that die in helicopter accidents.  I'm just noticing.  So I'm not wealthy enough to take a helicopter anywhere.  Do they still offer for a while?  Uber was offering helicopter rides to the Manhattan from the airport.

Start time: 545.64
End time: 567.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, wait, hold on.  I know this is a local story again, but it is currently cheaper to take...  I think it's Blade or whatever, the non-Uber one, from JFK take their helicopter from JFK  to Manhattan than it is to take an Uber from JFK to Manhattan because all the Uber surge  pricing has been insane lately.  Wow.  Uber and Uber prices.

Start time: 567.88

Transcript:  They've lost a lot of drivers.

Start time: 570.84
End time: 584.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they've lost a lot of drivers and they've been raising prices because they need to someday  maybe make money.  And at least in Brooklyn and New York, it is like 30 bucks to go a couple of miles.  Is that the same where you guys live?  Is it the same Petaluma?

Start time: 585.69

End time: 592.74

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My daughter spends about a thousand bucks a month on Lyft.  I don't know if that's your main or not.  Yeah, I think Lyft is kind of the same.  Probably cheaper than your car insurance.  That is exactly why she takes Lyft because I'm not buying her another car and paying  for the car insurance.  So she likes Lyft.  I guess if you wear a mask, it's okay.  I don't know.  It makes me nervous.  Yeah.  Taxis are cheaper though.  Aren't taxis cheaper in New York though than Uber?

Start time: 621.36
End time: 625.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, taxis are a lot cheaper now.  I have downloaded taxi apps.

Start time: 626.94
End time: 631.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Taxi makes money.  Uber loses money on every ride, so I don't understand how this all works.

Start time: 632.32
End time: 653.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's some new co-op thing that I just downloaded recently.  People have been saying this should happen for years.  Co-op ride.  I haven't had a chance to try it because again, I haven't done an Uber or Lyft in a year or  two.  I feel like, Paris, have you been in New York as long as I have?  I feel like it took Uber such a long time to get popular here because taxis were always  cheaper.

Start time: 656.06
End time: 686.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the thing that eventually tipped the needle is the convenience of being able  to hail it anywhere or in different boroughs where maybe taxis weren't coming as often.  But now it's kind of starting to tilt its way back a little bit.  Obviously, Uber and Lyft are still really dominant forms of transportation, but the  prices I've seen, I don't know, complaints on the Reddit New York City forums or from  random people on Twitter, just that the prices for both of the apps have gone so high that  people are going back to taxis.

Start time: 686.64
End time: 698.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the New York Times from yesterday.  Prepare to pay more for Uber and Lyft rides.  Companies say they're charging extra because they don't have enough drivers to match the  rebounding demand.  So they lost drivers during pandemic?

Start time: 700.06
End time: 703.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think a lot of people didn't feel comfortable driving.

Start time: 706.00
End time: 719.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The surge is how much?  According to the Times, they're saying 37% higher in March than it was a year ago.  In April, the cost was up 40% year over year.  Some surges as much as 50%.

Start time: 722.10
End time: 759.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's capped at 10 times whatever the base fare is.  10 times?  Yeah, that's a thousand percent.  Holy cow.  It used to be more, but a few years ago they capped it at 10x.  Most surges are not the full, the maximum amount, but it's still pretty substantial.  It can be really substantial, especially if it's during rush hour or bad weather on a  rainy day when people don't want to be standing outside waiting for a car, trying to hail  a cab.  The surge prices for Uber and Lyft can be really high.

Start time: 761.10
End time: 773.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right now, for instance, I'm in Brooklyn and to get an Uber to drive me three miles  to one World Trade Center would be $30 for an UberX, just the basic one.  Wow.

Start time: 773.72
End time: 825.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You could probably walk it faster too.  Probably.  Not now maybe because of Memorial Day, but most of the time.  So it's funny because this pandemic, another blessing from the pandemic, we haven't had  to talk about Uber and Lyft much in the last year.  I guess we'll be talking about them again.  What is, you know, in California they passed Prop 22, which said that, you know, these  people are employees.  I'm sure Uber is fighting that in court, but I imagine coast to coast there's movements  in that direction.  Uber already loses something like 40% on every ride because they have to pay the employees,  the contract employees.  Having to give them benefits too probably would make it even more expensive.  I wonder if Uber is even tenable.  Sam, is Uber designed around self-driving vehicles, not around drivers?

Start time: 826.52
End time: 940.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was not originally.  I mean, when they started it in 2009, 2010, you know, whenever it really got kicked off  in San Francisco, the whole premise of self-driving vehicles was still so far off into the future.  Nobody was really seeing it at that point as a realistic near-term proposition.  It wasn't until about 2014 or so after Google started, you know, posting videos of their  prototype vehicles running around and, you know, others started jumping into the space  that, you know, that was around the time that Travis Kalanick came out and said, you know,  this is an existential threat to our business.  But the problem for a company like Uber or Lyft is automated vehicles don't necessarily  make their business any better because today, you know, they don't own any of those assets.  They don't own the vehicles.  They don't have to insure them or put fuel in them or maintain them.  They just, they're just paying the drivers.  And you know, if they try to have their own fleet of automated vehicles, their own fleet  of robotaxis, now they've got all those assets, you know, they're going to be spending many  billions of dollars a year on buying and maintaining and fueling vehicles.  And you know, there's other kinds of costs.  There's new costs that are associated with it.  So just eliminating the cost of drivers does not necessarily get them to profitability.  So you know, I think, and this is why Uber sold off their ATG group, their advanced technology  group and Lyft sold off their level five group that was developing automated vehicles.  And they're just going to partner with the companies that are developing this technology  and the automakers and say, bring your vehicles to our platform, just like drivers bring their  vehicles to the platform today.  And I'm not sure if the economics necessarily get any better for Uber and Lyft in that kind  of scenario.

Start time: 940.98
End time: 962.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Last quarter, Uber lost $108 million, but it would have been a lot more if they hadn't  sold the advanced technology group for $1.6 billion.  It would have been significantly larger.  They've never made any money.  You really have to, I mean, they're basically funded by the investors who keep pumping money  into Uber.  You really have to wonder how long they can keep this up.

Start time: 964.30
End time: 991.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They actually have done better, especially over the past year.  They've had a lot of growth in the delivery business, Uber Eats and the other delivery  stuff.  Yeah, the Eats stuff.  Which led them to buy Postmates.  Right, right.  And so between Uber and DoorDash now, they're kind of the two big dominant players in deliveries  now.  And the economics of that actually work out a lot better for them than ride hailing.

Start time: 992.50
End time: 1017.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In the past four weeks, more than 100,000 drivers have returned to the Uber platform,  according to the New York Times.  That's because they put 200, remember, this is a company that lost $100 million last quarter.  They put $250 million, they called it stimulus spending into the effort to recruit drivers.  Lyft spent $100 million.  I just, this is the Paris, this is the modern world.  You make, you spend money and then lose money.

Transcript:  I don't understand this at all.

Start time: 1023.52
End time: 1082.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well the other fundamental problem with their business, because it's largely unregulated,  Well I think that's changing, by the way.  Well, but the nature of what they do, having a dispatch platform, is there's not a real  high barrier to entry for that.  So pretty much anybody can replicate what they have done, and it's just a matter of  attracting drivers.  So because you don't, because it's asset light, you can come in, you can build the dispatch  platform and start recruiting drivers.  And if you're willing to undercut, if you've got enough cash that you can undercut the  pricing.  So there's always a race to the bottom on the pricing for the consumer side.  And there's no, for consumers there's no network effect because there's no switching cost to  go from Uber to Lyft or to any other service.  So they have to keep their prices artificially low.  Or taxis or city bikes.

Transcript:  The Times quotes a hospitality worker in New York who used to pay $20 for Uber rides to  Brooklyn from Queens.  The fare is now $38.  A trip to the Bronx, $45.  Ms. Sanchez recently realized airfares were nearly the same price as her Uber rides.  When she found a $60 round-trip flight to Miami, she booked that.  If my choice is to go to the Bronx or Miami, I'm going to Miami, she said.  Seems reasonable.

Transcript:  The chat room is saying, Fauxpas in the chat room is saying, Paris, that this is the Amazon  model.  Amazon historically didn't make money.  They invested it back into the business, built the fulfillment centers, and now they're extremely  profitable.  Can you compare this to Amazon, you think, Paris?

Start time: 1132.84
End time: 1190.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I think it's a little different for the reasons we just discussed about Amazon  part of what eventually ended up working at scale was their physical assets, their fulfillment  center network, the way that their system worked in the physical world.  Uber and Lyft really don't have that.  I mean, they are incredibly asset lightened.  The only thing they have is this technology platform that allows them to connect to a  supply of drivers that can easily evaporate as we're seeing right now and cause all of  these issues in regards to accessibility and kind of keeping the cost down for customers,  at least.  I think it's also worth mentioning that Amazon is kind of having its own version of this  issue in regards to Amazon flex drivers and the delivery drivers that they use in states  like California as well, given that AB5 is currently under question for them.

Transcript:  I've also been hearing a lot of people say recently that, you know, we talk about bubbles  and things like that in the tech economy all the time, but what if for the last decade  or so there was a bubble in the labor market that allowed all of these gig economy startups  to happen?  And that now if you do go into a roaring 20s period where, again, maybe people can be choosy  about the jobs they take, maybe there is inflationary pressure, increasing wages and things like  that, that suddenly these gig economy models don't work out, maybe at all?

Start time: 1244.98
End time: 1275.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a really good point.  You know, both my kids graduated from college in the last few years and both of them entered  what is essentially a gig economy.  When I got out of college, you had recruitment, you had people on campus trying to recruit  you.  The idea was you get a job, you have a job for life, you retire with a gold watch.  That has really changed and is now the expectation of a lot of young people that you're not going  to ever have a lifetime job.  You might not even have a job job.  You might just have a bunch of gigs.

Transcript:  I think it is.  And I think until wages actually start rising so that people want, I mean, we've seen this  in restaurants in recent months as well.  Restaurants are having a hard time finding people to come back to work because they pay  so poorly.  In most of the country, the base wage for restaurant workers is well below the regular  minimum wage.  It's like two or three dollars an hour.  And then most of their income comes from tips, which is a crazy system.  And until wages actually start rising, then people will come back into the workforce.  Who wants to work for wages where you can't make a living?

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, in some places you're earning four dollars an hour as a waitress or waiter  or another tipped employee.  And if you don't have enough people coming in and choosing to tip you, you end up making  very, very little for your time on the job.

Transcript:  I mean, what we're maybe seeing the beginning of the vanguard of is what we're describing  is that Uber and Lyft are having to shove money at people to get drivers onto the job.  Amazon is having to increase their hourly wages.  So what if we are seeing the tip of the spear in terms of, well, this next decade is going  to be about you're not going to find a lot of people that are going to do a door dash  thing or do any of these gig economy things because maybe there are better jobs out there.  Maybe tech is sort of the canary in the coal mine for this.  That we are going to see the wages increase.  There are better jobs available to people, whereas in the teens, the job market was so  weak that people had to take these side games.

Start time: 1442.06
End time: 1484.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Too much.  And actually, I was looking back as I started my career 50 years ago, working at McDonald's  in Santa Cruz.  And the minimum wage then, I don't know what it was.  I was making, I think, $3.50 an hour.  But $3.50 an hour in the early 70s was more than $15 an hour today.  I think if I did the math right.  So even though it seemed like a very small amount of money, it actually wasn't bad pay.  It was more than people working at McDonald's make today in real dollars.  No wonder they have to give them an iPhone.  But it seems like a scam.  It's like the same thing as Uber and Lyft offering cash bonuses to sign up in the long  run if the job's not tenable.  Those Amazon ads.

It's grueling.  It's really dangerous.  I mean, they did it because...  Especially with the holidays, you have to work with 13-hour shifts.  Yeah.  I mean, they were getting a ton of overtime, so they made decent money, but it's really  challenging.  And you've heard the stories about people not having enough break time.  They've got to pee in their water bottles and things like that.  And now, I think one of the stories on the rundown is about these little pods they're  putting into the warehouses now, which seems kind of ridiculous.

Transcript:  So there is a lawsuit.  Attorney General of the District of Columbia is suing Amazon on antitrust grounds.  Oddly, he says that Amazon's overcharging, and then the Biden White House says Amazon  is undercharging.  So that's confusing.

Start time: 1686.70
End time: 1711.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, no, specifically what the D.C. Attorney General is accusing Amazon of is that there  is this provision or was in Amazon kind of terms of service for sellers, the companies  that are selling things in Amazon, where you can't list a product on Amazon unless...  If you have a product listed on Amazon, you can't sell it for less on any other website,  even if it's your own website.

Start time: 1711.46

Start time: 1741.66
End time: 1787.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apparently somebody told Amazon this was illegal, so they stopped doing it in 2019.  They called it price parity provision.  I could see how somebody maybe like me, not schooled in the ins and outs of antitrust  law might say, when advertisers give a coupon code to our audience, we try to tell them,  okay, but don't offer a cheaper code anywhere else because people just use that.  And then you'll think that they're not seeing the ad.  We can't stop them.  We don't put a provision in our contracts like that.  I can understand how a business in a naive way might say, well, that's a good thing both  for us and for the customer.  The customer knows when they buy it on Amazon, they're getting the lowest price out there  or at least nothing.

Start time: 1787.14
End time: 1845.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's, Leo, that's how this thinking of antitrust right now is evolving or has  been evolving in recent years where the yardstick was always like, well, it's not raising prices.  It's cheaper for consumers, so consumers are benefiting.  But the problem is, and this is the thinking that has evolved and I'm not in this field,  so I might butcher this, but when you have these platforms that are also serving as the  marketplaces, then you can't just use the measurement of lower prices as the harm because  there's also harm being done to the overall marketplace itself, as Paris is saying, that  where it is harming the consumer, even if we use price as a mechanism, that you can't  get it cheaper elsewhere because what's happening is that you, Leo, selling your twit t-shirt,  you're going to the Amazon marketplace to get scale and maybe have some logistics help  and stuff like that, but it would be cheaper for you to just sell it on your own website  too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's just like people like Amazon when it sells books in the Kindle store versus selling  them on Apple's platform.  In fact, it's not at all unusual.  Spotify charges 30% less if you buy a subscription from Spotify than from Apple because they're  paying the Apple VIG, so in effect, the customer pays the Apple VIG.  So it would be like Apple saying to Spotify, yeah, but you can't charge less on your website.

Start time: 1888.49
End time: 1893.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 1894.39
End time: 1936.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  By the way, Amazon's response, the DC Attorney General has it exactly backwards.  Sellers set their own prices for products they offer in our store.  Nobody said they didn't.  Amazon takes pride in the fact that we offer low prices across the broadest selection and  like any store, we reserve the right not to highlight offers.  By the way, this is how Amazon changed it in 2019.  There are sanctions imposed if you offer at a lower price.  And basically what Amazon's saying is we don't highlight offers to customers that are not  priced competitively.  So if I'm selling an air conditioner at my website for 150 bucks, but I'm selling it  for 190 bucks on Amazon, they won't highlight it anymore.  They don't prevent me from doing it.

Start time: 1959.72
End time: 1999.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Amazon says the relief the Attorney General seeks would force Amazon to feature higher  prices to customers that $195 air conditioner, oddly going against the core objectives of  antitrust law.  So I think you're exactly as you said, Brian, this is perhaps a re-understanding revision  of what antitrust means.  Historically antitrust could be to promote competition between companies or as it has  traditionally been in the United States or as it's traditionally been in Europe, as I  understand to promote competition for consumers, price competition for consumers.

Start time: 2000.20
End time: 2007.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the other way around.  It's the other way around.  Price competition for consumers here.  And then promoting competition in Europe.

Start time: 2008.24
End time: 2017.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that either way, the ultimate goal is to encourage competition, innovation, and ultimately  that benefits consumers.

Start time: 2019.34
End time: 2061.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, except I think in the long term, the approach of promoting competition, having  a vibrant marketplace long term is going to be better for consumers if you have multiple  players that are competing.  Whereas if you allow one company to have a race to the bottom here, they happen to be  the one that's got enough resources to survive that race to the bottom and they drive everybody  else out of business, then you end up with a monopoly situation.  And while the lower prices may be great temporarily, long term they're probably not going to stay  that way once they drive all their competitors out of the market.  Right.

Start time: 2061.80
End time: 2094.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's the same thing we were just talking about with Uber and Lyft almost.  I mean, their whole business model is predicated in the fact that we want to capture all the  market share with our lower artificially deflated costs and then raise them up so that we can  make a profit.  But in Amazon's case, it's such a large company that it is subsidizing the cost of its products.  We're talking about first party brands with AWS and other profit making arms.  And eventually, you'd assume would kind of bring all these parts of the business into  alignment to all be profit generating in and of themselves.

Start time: 2094.92

It's hard to explain why a zero rating Netflix on your T-Mobile account is bad for the country  when it's so good for me as a consumer.  I don't have to pay for bandwidth for Netflix.  What's wrong with that?  And we've tried to jump through these hoops explaining, well, then the next Netflix doesn't  start because they have a disadvantage.  But I don't think you could.  Consumers just go, oh, screw that.  I don't want to pay for Netflix.  I don't want to.  I like Amazon.  I don't want to have to.  I like Uber unless they do surge pricing, then I don't like Uber anymore.

Transcript:  These things can evolve to in the sense that here's a perfect example using Amazon actually.  But for how many years was sales tax not collected on e-commerce because the government did a  forward thinking thing, which was like, this is a nascent industry.  Let's support it as much as we can.  Now that e-commerce has become such a large percentage of all commerce, that's gone because  it served its purpose and it doesn't need to continue in perpetuity.  That was a change that was harmful to consumers if you're a heavy e-commerce user, but then  probably better for the overall economy?

Transcript:  Well speaking of, you know the whole reason why Bezos abandoned that anti-sales tax thing  was because there was a larger thing that he was going after, which was they couldn't  put fulfillment centers and the employees couldn't even travel to states.  They weren't collecting sales tax.  So in aid of the larger land grab of building out everything, they're like, all right, we'll  drop fighting this and sure, sales tax everywhere, but we can put warehouses and fulfillment  centers everywhere now too.

Transcript:  Maybe that's what I did wrong.  Amazon Devices, which says Dan Gooden, will soon automatically share your internet with  neighbors.  This is controversial and I am in the minority.  Having looked at Amazon's white paper, in fact having had our security guy Steve Gibson  did a whole show on it late last year, I was impressed with Amazon's effort to make it  secure and effort to make it private.  As far as I could tell, it looks pretty darn good.  There is a community benefit to Sidewalk because it's a low speed network.  It's sharing your internet, but it's not sharing a lot of your internet.  It's like 80 kilobits at most.  Lost dogs can be seen anywhere in your general vicinity.  It just seems like this is a good thing.  Dan, I think, is scaring people and says, well there might be a problem.  There have historically been problems with IoT devices and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.  Does that mean we should never do any IoT, Wi-Fi or Bluetooth devices?  There could be a problem.  I don't think that's fair.  He also shows you how to turn it off, which admittedly Amazon kind of buries three levels.

They understand that people are going to get scared by articles like this and people saying,  oh, you don't want Amazon to have a network.  But I think there's a huge benefit.  Tile is going to use this.  It's the only way Tile can compete against Apple's AirTags because Apple's AirTags use  iPhones to do the network.  Everybody with an iPhone is creating a network for AirTags.  How else is Tile to compete?  They are going to tie in a sidewalk which will give them roughly a similar footprint.  Maybe not as big but a good footprint.  That's a benefit to the public and sometimes the public doesn't know what's good for them.  I can't believe I said that.

You get money.  It's in a cryptocurrency, but you can convert it to dollars for not proof of work, which is how Bitcoin works,  or proof of stake, which is how the future imaginary cryptocurrencies will work, but through proof of coverage.  When somebody uses, and it's low raw, just like Sidewalk, somebody uses your long range, slow, wide area network for,  she lives on an island, so she thinks ships are using it for location and data of some kind.  You get a small amount of money, and she's gotten a lot of money.

Transcript:  Right, but that was the point, is that you would just hang one of these in your window,  and then in a place like here where it could be used by the Amazon delivery truck,  or the smart dog collar that goes by, or whatever.  It seems like we would be a high traffic area for that to happen.  So I really considered it, and now I regret not pulling the trigger on it.

It doesn't use much power at all, because the way it mines it is by proof of coverage, not by proof of work.  So you're not doing-  That's great.  Yes, it's an environmentally friendly cryptocurrency.  Now how much would you pay?  I don't know.  My Fios is pretty steep.  You have Fios, right?  This would pay for your Fios.

Transcript:  I don't know.  That's a white paper right there.  Mark Benioff is an investor.  Does that help?  Not really.  No?  Google Ventures has invested.  I just think it's very interesting.  There's a lot of benefit to creating- and it doesn't have to be a high speed network.  We're not talking that you can- we're not doing what Xfinity and Cox do, which is take over your-  By the way, they're doing it to create a Wi-Fi network, taking over your router.  Most people, that's on by default.  If you get an Xfinity router, a Comcast router, or I can't remember who else.  I think Spectrum's doing it, maybe Cox.  If you get one of their routers, it automatically creates this guest network that people can use if they're subscribers.  That's all to the benefit of those companies.  This is not quite like that.  This is really- I think Amazon's benefit probably is something like delivery trucks.  They would love to know where the delivery trucks are, but they have GPS in those trucks, so that can't be it.

Start time: 3336.90

Transcript:  There's actually already a technology for that, for what they call V to X vehicle to everything communications.  They've been working on this for quite some time, where you've got vehicle to vehicle, vehicle to infrastructure, vehicle to pedestrian.  Originally, they were going to do it with something called DSRC, which was a flavor of Wi-Fi.  They've now switched over to cellular V to X, which is basically using LTE or 5G.  It branches off from that because it doesn't actually have to go through the cell network.  It can broadcast directly to other nodes around you.  For example, when you're driving down the road, if your wheel starts slipping, and if you hit a patch of ice, and your wheel slips and your stability control turns on,  it will broadcast a message to other vehicles around you that, hey, there's a patch of ice here.  They're doing this now.  Argo AI, which is a partner of Ford, developing their automated driving system, is doing this in Miami now.  They've put up, because all the sensors on these automated vehicles are limited to line of sight.  They can't see through buildings or through other vehicles.  At certain intersections where there's limited visibility, they've put up sensor pods over the middle of the intersection with CV to X radios that will look down the cross street.  If there's a vehicle coming that might be a hazard to the AV, it will broadcast that and say, hey, there's a car coming at high speed at this intersection.  Be aware so the automated vehicle could slow down before it gets there.  MotionL is also doing this in Las Vegas now.  Most of the Chinese AV companies are also doing this in China, where they're further along with CV to X than we are here.

The messaging standard, there's what they call a basic safety messages standard.  They're very small messages.  They take very little bandwidth.  So you can broadcast a lot of messages in an area, and it doesn't take much at all.  If you go further forward and you want to start maybe sharing sensor data between vehicles, then you're going to need more.  But for a lot of the initial stuff, you don't need very much bandwidth at all.

At the same time, I also think that some of that tarnishes some of the good things these companies are doing,  like maybe even Sidewalk, where I think there's things we're not going to get because of just this,  I hate to use the phrase moral panic, that's what Jeff Jarvis uses,  but this kind of fear of technology.  There's two things going on.  They're making too much money and they have too much power and we're going to cut them down to size.  And I feel like that could be risky too.

Transcript:  The same argument can be made breaking up Ma Bell, even though they all reconstructed themselves into Verizon and AT&T,  and so it's kind of a moot point.  But there was a 20 to 25 year period where all of these companies allowed this explosion of innovation that allowed the whole mobile everything industry to form.  And also there's that famous example that the day that AT&T got broken up, if you were a shareholder,  if you just held on to all of those companies that got spun off because you would get the shares in the new companies, you made a killing.  So it's not bad for investors sometimes, antitrust stuff.  It's not bad for companies sometimes.  It's not bad for consumers.

We have so many more methods of communication now than we did then.  Yes, we're limited in the number of wireless carriers that we have access to,  but we've got options from just talking on the phone to all kinds of different messaging services,  including you've got everything like Signal and Telegram and iMessage and Skype and Zoom and everything else we use.

That was, I think, a fairly reasonable lawsuit.  The documents were hidden but a judge has ordered them to be unredacted in response  to a request by trade groups Digital Content Next and News Media Alliance, which argued  it was in the public interest to know that Google was using its legal resources to suppress  scrutiny of its data collection practices.  The unsealed documents are definitely a smoking gun, including email from users.  Here's one of the documents.  So there's no way to give a third party app your location and not Google, one employee  said adding, this doesn't sound like something we'd want on the front page of the New York  Times.  This is the smoking gun.  When Google tested versions of its Android operating system that made privacy settings  easier to find, guess what?  Users took advantage of them.  Google viewed that as a problem, according to the documents.  To solve that problem, Google then sought to bury those settings deeper within the  settings menu, just like Amazon did with the sidewalk.

Transcript:  I mean, the thing that's so wild about these sort of techniques is it's not one off cases  like Google.  These are the sort of decisions and practices that are almost standard in the tech industry  for a lot of companies.  I remember in like 2019 or something, I ended up writing an article for Wired, which I was  working at the time about a Facebook feature.  I realized I went on vacation one day and I redownloaded Instagram.  I realized I kept getting notifications for my Facebook account on the Instagram app,  which is wild.  And I looked in the settings and there was a button that said unlink Facebook and I had  it turned off.  And so I messaged PR Facebook and I was like, oh, you know, it's odd.  Does the unlink Facebook button and Instagram?  Is that not unlink Facebook?  And they're like, no, not that it doesn't unlink Facebook.  You can never unlink Facebook even if you turn the unlink Facebook button, you know,  on or off.

Transcript:  Tweet, I got your Bitcoin right here.  Yeah, I wish you did.  The great Jim Cutler, our VO guy.  So now I know who has my Bitcoin.  That's a good thing.  Our show today brought to you by Melissa, my favorite.  Go ahead, fill in the blank.  You know, it's my favorite address.  Experts, if you've ever forgotten to check the date on a cart and a milk in your fridge,  like milk, your customer data is also going bad every day.  In fact, up to 30% of customer data goes bad every year.  Now, that's a problem.  If you're sending catalogs to the wrong address, bills to the wrong address, brochures to the  wrong address, emailing the wrong people, calling the wrong people, Melissa, make sure  your data is accurate and current so you reach the right customers.  You waste less time contacting the wrong people.  You offend fewer people.  Their tools have helped businesses maintain fresh data.  For a long time, 35 years now, over 10,000 businesses use the address experts to keep  their data clean.  You can not only verify addresses, but you can also verify emails, phone numbers, even  names in real time with Melissa.  Melissa's global address verification service has addresses for over 240 countries and territories.  And you can, I mean, there's a variety of ways to use it.  There's on-prem, there's an API, there's a SaaS, there's even FTP upload and download.  But if you want, if you're using the real time Melissa, you can actually verify these  addresses at the point of entry so you don't even start with a bad address.  And how many times you know this happens.  You fumble finger your street address, you get the wrong number in there, or a customer  service rep gets your name spelled wrong.  You don't want that.  You could validate existing customer data.  You could find new customers.  You can correct addresses as they're entered.  And by the way, if you're worried about duplication with Melissa's data matching, you can eliminate  clutter and duplicates too, increase the accuracy of your database, reduce postage  and mailing costs, get the information that completes your customer profiles too.  Public demographic information like property data, marital status, social media handles,  really get to know your customers.  Melissa's flexible deployment options offer different platforms to suit any preference,  business size and budget.  As I mentioned on-prem, there's a web service, there's SaaS, there's secure FTP processing.  And I want to emphasize because I know you care a lot about the privacy of your data.  So does Melissa.  That's why they continually undergo independent security audits because they're committed  to the security privacy of your data and to compliance.  You have to be compliant with SOC 2 or HIPAA or GDPR.  They are, so you don't have to worry.  By the way, congratulations.  Melissa was just named a leader in address verification by G2 Crowd in that Spring 2021  report.  Melissa's also been a great partner for communities and qualifying essential workers during the  pandemic.  It's still going on.  If your organization qualifies, you get six months of free service.  Just apply at the website, melissa.com.  So bottom line, don't put up with sour customer data.  Try Melissa's APIs and their developer portal right now.  It's easy to log on, sign up and start playing in the API sandbox 24 seven.  In fact, just to get you started, 1000 records cleaned for free at melissa.com slash twit.  M-E-L-I-S-S-A, melissa.com slash twit.  We thank them so much for their support of This Week in Tech.  Thank you for supporting us by using that address as well.  Melissa.com slash twit.  This is a, we'll get to some of those other stories I mentioned, but I do want to get  this one in.  This is actually really good news.  A court has ruled, the European Court of Human Rights has ruled that the UK spy agency GCHQ  methods for bulk interception of online communications violated the right to privacy and violated  the data collection laws, a landmark victory, according to one of the applicants.  The judges found the bulk interception regime reached the right to freedom of expression  and contained insufficient protections for confidential journalistic material.  However, we're not going to do anything about it.  The decision to operate a bulk interception regime did not of itself violate the European  Convention on Human Rights.  You know, I don't know if you could find GCHQ.  It's just, it's nice to know that somebody cares.  It's widely rumored the NSA has been doing the same thing for years.  So this is the snoo, this might be, and I hope it is a beginning of a way to challenge  the snoopers charter.  And Liberty says, Liberty, one of the plaintiffs says that this would allow its challenge to  the IPA to proceed in UK courts.  So the UK has actually really been aggressive in this kind of widespread snooping, as has,  I suspect the US, but I'm glad that this court ruled that way.  Florida has passed and the governor, Rick DeSantis, has signed into law the Stop Social  Media Censorship Act, which is really pretty much targeted at Twitter and Facebook for  blocking President Trump.  It's probably unenforceable.  Experts say it violates not only Section 230, but it also the First Amendment, might have  heard of that.  It also violates the constitutional restriction on states regulating interstate commerce.  According to the bill, social media sites will be fined a quarter million dollars for  every day after two weeks that a statewide political candidate is banned.  I wonder who that might be.  Here's some good news, unless you're an amusement park in Florida.  So there's that.

But that's so also dumb because it's like you don't think these other people have enough  money that if you really held their feet to the fire, they wouldn't be able to buy...  What is it?

They're going to, I think, have it.  It'll be taken down.  And I don't think...  I think they knew that.  I think DeSantis knew it.  I think the legislature knew it.

You got to this is this is actually a big deal, the electric Ford F-150, because this  is this is the most popular truck in America.  I think it is.

Transcript:  The F-series is the most popular vehicle of any kind in America.  Wow.  It has been for like 40 years.  It was they sell Ford sells more F-series than anything any other type of vehicle.  In fact, they say that the F-series alone, if you if if that was a separate business  by itself, that would be a $42 billion a year business in revenue, which is a lot of companies.

Transcript:  So making an all electric version of it, is this Ford doing what the government wants  it to do?  Or do they see this as a way to transition?  I see GM says we're going electric.  Volkswagen says we're going electric is how much of that is because they think there's  demand for it.  It doesn't seem like there's a lot of consumer demand for it.  I'll be honest, especially among the truck driving public.

Start time: 5209.49
End time: 5306.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, we don't know what we don't really know what the demand is from the truck driving  public because there's never been an electric truck in a volume before.  So it is an experiment in a way.  Yeah.  To that end, in the first week, Ford had something like 70,000 reservations for the F-150 Lightning.  So yeah, I mean, it is partly driven by regulation.  But it's also they're seeing where the market is going.  Increasingly, the market, it's slow, but it's creeping up.  EV sales are creeping up steadily.  And especially this year, we're going to get a whole bunch of new EVs coming into the market.  Right now, there's about 20 EVs available in the US market.  And the number of market segments they're in is fairly limited.  But what we're starting to see is more EVs coming into the segments where most people  are actually buying vehicles like compact and mid-sized crossovers and trucks, of course.  Rivian's going to start deliveries.  They've said they're going to start deliveries of their truck in July.  The GMC Hummer EV is coming out later this fall.  The F-150 next spring.  At some point, possibly the Cybertruck from Tesla.  And also Chevrolet has said they're going to do an electric version of the Silverado  Where the lightning is different from a lot of those others, except for maybe the Silverado,  is Ford's really targeting its core customers, the most hardcore customers they have for  that truck, which is their commercial customers.

Start time: 5307.58
End time: 5333.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's interesting because we usually think of the truck driving individual as somebody  who's not going to be interested in an electric vehicle.  Perhaps they're rural, there's no charging stations.  They're rolling coal.  They like the idea of smoke coming out of the bag for whatever reason.  But commercial, they may be a little bit more sensitive to pricing and they may be a little  easier for them to put in electric charging stations.

Start time: 5334.74
End time: 5376.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cheaper maintenance costs if you have a fleet of these things.  The other thing, right, so again, this is not my space, but when I did the segment on  it last week, that was the thing that impressed me about it is that, so the headline was that,  it's got a battery that could keep your house charged if you had a blackout for three days.  But the other thing is, is there's something like seven electrical ports all over the thing.  Number one, if you're running a business that has a fleet of 30 of these things and  you're going to job sites and construction sites, not only over the course of the life  of the vehicle maybe is there less maintenance costs, but also that's useful if you can go  to a job site and plug in all sorts of tools and things like that into this thing.

Start time: 5378.34
End time: 5448.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's one of the key things that Ford is promoting.  Last year when they launched the hybrid version of the F-150, they launched this pro-power  on board where the electric motor that's in there becomes a generator.  Because for a lot of those commercial customers, a lot of times they're hauling along a gas  generator in the bed of the truck.  So that's one more piece of gear that they've got to haul along.  They've got to bring gas for that.  Those things generally are polluting more than the engines in modern vehicles.  So now you've got this source of electricity that's, in the case of the Lightning, you've  got a lot of juice available.  They did a demo.  You can get up to 9.6 kilowatts out of this thing from 11 outlets, including a 240 volt  outlet.  So they had a demo running when I was there showing a whole bunch of shop lights, a cement  mixer, an air compressor, a miter saw, a bunch of other tools all running at the same time  drawing off of this thing.  Which is for a contractor working at a job site or recharging their tools, that's a  really important feature to have for those kinds of customers.

Start time: 5449.30
End time: 5464.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like that would be a really important feature also for long haul commercial truck  drivers.  Who is having to live within the vehicle for weeks at a time, could have that extra output  available would be invaluable.

Start time: 5465.53
End time: 5500.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, absolutely.  The challenge with long haul trucking though is the battery size you need for a long haul  truck is so large that it starts to eat into the payload capability of the truck.  Long haul trucking, they make their revenue based on how many pounds of freight they're  carrying.  If you've got a 10,000 pound battery that you're hauling along, that's about 8,000  pounds more than a diesel power train.  So that's 8,000 pounds less payload you can carry.  So the economics there are still not as big yet.

Start time: 5502.38
End time: 5517.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess the question I had was what's the saturation like of charging stations in America  right now outside of metropolitan areas, especially with this Ford F-150 truck, appealing to rural  customers, would that be harder?

Start time: 5519.22
End time: 5596.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's growing.  There's over 100,000 public charging stations now in the U.S. and part of the Biden infrastructure  plan, they want to add another 500,000 by the end of the decade.  There's probably going to be more than that by the end of this decade.  For a lot of the commercial customers, a lot of times these trucks will either be operating  in a local area, they're not operating long distances.  For the rural customers, maybe for somebody working on a farm where they can charge at  home, if they're driving around on the farm, then this truck could certainly be worthwhile  for them.  A lot of the commercial customers in urban and suburban areas, they're driving no more  than I think from their telemetry data, Ford said that 95% of the users are driving less  than 175 miles a day.  Even in a truck?  Yeah, even in a truck.  So a lot of these carpenters, electricians, landscapers, and so they're returning to the  same base every night where they can plug in and charge or in many cases, returning  take-home vehicles that the workers are using.

Transcript:  We charge ours with solar panels, so it's actually very economical once you pay for  the solar panels.  I could see that even in a farm in a rural area, put in some solar panels and you charge  your own truck, in the long run you're going to save money.  Plus, it's got some real benefits.  You've got a lot of power in that thing.  They said 300 miles with a thousand pound load.

Start time: 5621.38
End time: 5675.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's got a 2,000 pound payload capability, so with half of that it can still go over  300 miles.  One of the interesting things that Ford recently launched on their regular F-150s is onboard  scales.  So they've actually got sensors underneath the bed of the truck, between the frame and  that as you load up the truck with stuff, you can actually know how much stuff you're  putting in there.  And then the range estimation system actually takes that into account.  So when you've put 500 or 1,000 or 2,000 pounds in the truck, it will automatically adjust  your range estimate so you have a more accurate range estimation.  Or if you hook up a trailer, they've got a smart trailer hitch, same thing.  It'll tell you what your real range is more likely to be.  That's pretty cool.

Transcript:  Is it possible though if this truck is a flop that they could set back the EV industry?

Start time: 5683.82
End time: 5736.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's certainly possible.  I don't think it will be.  I think it'll sell pretty well because as Brian mentioned, operating costs are a big  factor for commercial customers because they tend to drive a lot more miles and it's a  much bigger proportion of their total expense.  The service and fuel is a much bigger part of the total cost of ownership.  And when you go electric, if it fits within your operating use case, then you can save  a hell of a lot of money.  And Ford is pricing this thing very aggressively.  The base work truck version starts at $40,000 for a four-wheel drive crew cab.  The equivalent gasoline version of that is actually $2,500 more and that's before any  tax incentives.  You could potentially get one of these in the low $30,000 range.

Start time: 5737.78
End time: 5744.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's interesting.  Are they absorbing the costs?  The battery alone is a huge expense on these things, isn't it?

Start time: 5745.80
End time: 5756.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there's been a lot of progress on battery costs, bringing battery costs down.  So they're actually expecting this thing to be profitable.

Start time: 5758.29
End time: 5791.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo, you said at the beginning that are they doing this because the government is telling  them to do?  I lived in Detroit for a period of time and Sam and I off air were talking about somebody  in the industry that we both know.  My sense from the people that I still know in Detroit, in the auto industry, they're  not doing this because of any pressure.  Everybody drank the Kool-Aid in the last decade or so and every single one of them.  Sam, I'm kind of asking you this.  The industry believes that this is the future.  They're skating to where they think the puck is going, right?

Start time: 5793.10
End time: 5859.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  The progress that's been made on batteries, improving the battery capabilities and reducing  the battery cost has gotten to the point where they now think that part of the reason why  they were slow to adopt this is because there wasn't enough consumer demand and the cost  was too high and they couldn't make a business case for it.  But now that's flipped around.  They're at the point where they're starting to be able to make these things profitably.  In some cases like the F-150, they also use, there's a lot of shared componentry with the  regular F-150 so they've got a lot of scale right off the bat.  They really do believe that there's a solid business case for these things and so they're  going all in on electric.  Almost every major automaker is going down this path and including getting into building  their own batteries.  Instead of buying them from suppliers, building their own batteries in-house.  Ford's doing it, GM's doing it, Volkswagen's doing it, Stellantis is doing it.  Most of the major automakers are going down this path.

Transcript:  It's funny, I guess I'm a, so on the one hand I love electric vehicles.  I like driving them and I've owned a number of them.  We have a Bolt, we have a Mustang from Ford, we have a, I had a Tesla.  So I like them personally but I also feel like there's a very strong anti-EV sentiment  in the country and there's a lot of skepticism about EVs and it seems to me that the biggest  segment of skeptics is the truck driving public.  So I'll be watching with great interest.  I have to say it does seem like, I mean you're starting to see more and more charging stations.  Our little town here in Petaluma became the first in the nation to ban new construction  of gas stations, which I think is probably a good thing.  And I noticed that every single office park in our neighborhood is putting in chargers.  So when you get to work you can charge your vehicle.  I see more and more of those.  So maybe the world is changing.  I just, I feel skeptical.  I like it but I feel like this is not right.

End time: 5975.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that the case?  Yeah, China and Europe both are where the big EV growth has been.  But Leo, you were mentioning there's still a lot of people that don't like EVs and that's  true.  There is a certain portion of the population that thinks it's a terrible idea.  But I think for a lot of people they make a lot of sense and especially for businesses.  And this is why Ford, they started with the Mach-E to generate some excitement.  But their next two EVs are an electric version of the Transit van and an electric version  of the F-150.  Because they know that businesses look at this from a very different perspective than  consumers do.

Start time: 5975.82

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A lot of attention paid to the low maintenance costs.  But really electric motors require very little maintenance.  And in fact these electric cars are much less complex than ICE vehicles, internal combustion  engines.  So really they are much better from the point of view of maintenance.

Start time: 5990.86
End time: 6013.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it also a generational thing where they've done the consumer polling and stuff like this  and they're like, well, by the way, the Gen Zs and beyond, they're going to buy, they  want electric vehicles.  So this is again like any other company where it's like, well, we're making these decisions  because we want to get the 18 to 35 year olds.  Is that part of the thinking too?

Start time: 6014.18
End time: 6038.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is definitely part of the thinking.  They're looking at the changing market demographics and all these other factors.  There's a fairly long lead time to develop a new vehicle.  So the things they're doing now, they're planning for the next five and 10 years.  And that's part of what I do in my day job is forecasting this stuff and working with  companies to help them figure out their strategies.

Transcript:  I get regular emails from listeners and viewers who say, oh Leo, you think electric cars are  more eco-friendly, but they're not.  What about lithium mining and recycling batteries?  What about the power you're using because it comes from a coal fired plant?  I get that constantly.  I think there's a very strong drumbeat of people saying EVs are not as eco-friendly  as they pretend to be.  What's the truth on that?

Start time: 6067.48
End time: 6090.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does take more energy to produce an EV than it does to produce an internal combustion  vehicle. But over its lifespan, if you look at the full life cycle from raw materials  to completely end of life, the overall emissions are significantly lower, even with coal fired  power. And coal fired power is significantly in decline.

Start time: 6091.06
End time: 6108.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. But let's say fossil fuel powered plants, which are still the majority.  Even natural gas.  But even they're putting scrubbers on those stacks.  They can do a lot to reduce emissions from those plants at one single source than the  tailpipes of a hundred thousand cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the other thing about recycling, they're also making a lot of progress on battery  And as the number of EVs available that are in use goes up, there's also opportunities for second  life uses of those batteries.  So once maybe the batteries only got 65, 70 percent of its original capacity left, you take it out of  a car, you stick it in a rack and use it for stationary storage at those DC fast charging  stations. You put in stationary storage there so you don't need as much incoming electrical  capacity. And you charge up those batteries slowly and then you charge the vehicles fast from the  batteries or for grid balancing.  There's all kinds of ways you can use those.  And then recycling.  VW has a pilot battery recycling plant in Germany right now that they're able to recover 95  percent of the key raw materials, the cobalt, the lithium, the manganese, the aluminum from those  cells. And they basically just drop the entire battery module into what looks like a giant paper  shredder and it shreds it down into little strips.  And then they process that and they can get back most of those raw materials, which is going to be key to  making this transition.  Because we don't have enough processing capacity for all the raw materials yet.

Start time: 6204.86

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And this isn't going to happen overnight.  People are saying if everybody had electric vehicle, we'd have to fire up those coal power plants  again. But this isn't going to happen overnight.  This is going to be a transition.  And I think it's going to start with fleets, frankly, and places where it makes sense.  Yeah. From the information, SolarWinds hackers launching new attacks.  Actually, it's coming from Microsoft.  We'll talk about that in just a little bit with our guests from the information Paris.  Martin, no. See, I'm really making it harder and harder for the information to buy ads on Twitter.  Aren't I? They just know.  It's true. You're just cheating yourself out of money.

You know, it's funny, in the 90s, your business had to have, if you were going to be modern, you had to have an email address, right?  By the 2000s, you had to have a website.  By 2010, you had to have a Twitter account or a Facebook account.  In 2021, I'm telling you, your business needs to be texting.  You need Podium.  It's the easiest, fastest, simplest way to add texting to your communications with your customers.  And by the way, and I'll say it for myself, customers prefer texts to emails or phone calls.  It's just the easiest way to stay in touch.  Podium is a messaging platform that will power your business.  It helps you reach your customers where they want to be reached.  Business messaging with Podium can be used to gain reviews, to collect payments, to communicate with customers, to offer them coupons, to welcome them back, to invite them back, to capture leads and all from one inbox, which is really great.  Your employees will love that.  Podium helps you adapt to the changing world of communications.  It's constantly changing.  And I will say, and I don't know if I'm an early adopter.  I think I'm not.  I think this is pretty much universal.  If I found out a business can text, I'm going to use that.  It's just easier for me.  I'd much prefer to make an appointment with my hairdresser to give a review to my dentist when it comes through a text.  In fact, it happened to me the other day.  I left the dentist's office and they said, hey, leave us a review.  And because the link was right there, it was very easy.  I did it.  Podium is really great for local businesses, for small businesses, for tennis offices and stores and salons.  With Podium reviews, you can easily text customers to get them to leave an online review.  And that'll really help in so many ways.  With search results, it'll drive customers.  98% of text messages are open.  That's compared to 20% of emails.  That's in fact exactly how South Tampa Family and Cosmetic Dentistry used it.  Dr. Wyatt down there said they were able to generate 1,200 reviews with Podium.  And by the way, must be pretty good.  They got 4.9 stars.  Dr. Wyatt said the number of walk-ins as a result of our reviews has skyrocketed.  Before, we were seeing maybe 50 to 100 new patients a month.  Now we're seeing closer to 200 a month.  You could do it.  Generate leads.  And America's CarMart generated 21,000 leads using WebChat right on their website.  It's another way you can use Podium.  Before Podium, they said we had a Contact Us form.  It could be days before anybody got back to that customer because, well, frankly, it was complicated.  Our response time is cut down to minutes.  It's one of the nice things about Podium.  Podium WebChat lets website visitors text with your team right from your home page.  There's video chat too, Podium video chat.  You get paid fast over text with Podium payments.  And of course, it all comes together with Podium inbox, which keeps leads warm and lets you  easily respond to feedback all in one place.

SolarWinds back in the news.  I thought we beat this one.  SolarWinds hackers launching new attacks, according to Microsoft.  This we know that SolarWinds is Russian state sponsored hackers.  They broke into a lot of public and private sector organizations last year.  Now, according to Microsoft, they're going after international development, humanitarian  and human rights organizations.  Fishing emails.  They've sent out to 3,000 people at 150 organizations.  They contain links.  Once clicked, it would enable hackers to steal data and infect other computers.  Nobelium is at work again.  That's the tool.  Or actually, that's the Russian state sponsored hacking group.

So we don't know all the booby traps and sort of hidey holes that they could like.  They just they just turned this one on, but this could go on for years.

They're a political action arm of the Putin government at the height of the COVID pandemic.  Strontium related sponsored hacking groups targeted health care organizations involved  with vaccines.  In 2019, they targeted sporting and anti-doping organizations.  Remember, Russia was getting a lot of heat for in fact, their their national teams were  banned in some events because of doping.  They've been targeting elections in the US and elsewhere.  Microsoft says this is an example of how cyber attacks have become a tool of choice for a  growing number of nation states to accomplish a wide variety of political objectives.

And the analogy that he used, he's like, this is the perfect put on history hat.  This is the perfect analogy is to actual piracy back in the day.  Right.  Like Queen Elizabeth would allow right.  People to ride on the boats.  Right.  That's right.  And you had plausible deniability, but they're freebooters.  But then if you like rob the Spanish galleon fleet, Queen Elizabeth wouldn't be mad at  you. You know, yeah, that's a really good point.  So he's like, this is the direct analogy where and he's like, you know, this because  basically we know that the word went out that you guys can do all of this dirt on your own  account as long as when we ask you to do a favor for us, that favor gets done.  And one of the reasons that they know that is and several security experts said this,  like if you put those Cyrillic alphabet, if you install that on your because they were  told not to Russian keyboards.  Yeah, they were they were told you cannot hack anybody internally.  So when they go out and they look for targets, if you have a Cyrillic alphabet loaded on  your computer, they they keep on moving because they don't want to attack anybody

But the ransomware that was used against the colonial pipeline, folks and another ransomware  apparently looks for the installed international keyboard, the virtual keyboard for a  variety of Russian aligned states.  And some some can some think it's just a way of avoiding scrutiny by the police.  But I think you're closer to the fact that that's just like a little hint, you know,  like we're we're the good guys.  Don't mess with us.  Yeah. Brian Krebs, I think, had that story.  And the people who discovered it said, don't don't assume that this will work forever.  But it couldn't hurt.  Yeah. Install the Russian keyboard.  Why not? Why not?  Isn't that hysterical?  Let's see. I mean, I was just trying to find that.  Yeah, here it is. There's a list on Krebs on security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this goes back to where we're talking at the top of the show about antitrust action,  something that the House Judiciary Committee  zeroed in on quite a bit in their report on Amazon is the practice  that part of Amazon's big ad sales is two sellers wanting to promote their own products  and get them higher up in the page than Amazon products,  which even in a lot of cases, Amazon ends up putting their own product  next to the buy button for these promoted products.  But it is a big booming part of Amazon's business.

Start time: 7394.62
End time: 7414.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And if Amazon is already charging the VIG just to use the platform  and then now there's the tax for the ads, then again, in theory,  even if you do go back to the old, well, this is bad for consumers because of prices.  Well, that's a price.  That's a cost that's being passed on to consumers just to make sure that you can be found.  Right. The biggest platform.
