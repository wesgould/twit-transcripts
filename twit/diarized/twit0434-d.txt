Transcript:  the excellent point I think that really that the the new creative form is not  movies David Chase wanted to make movies and he felt like it was a failure that  he was writing for TV but if you think about it the Sopranos gave him a chance  to develop that family over six years in ways that no movie you know two-hour  movie and they would never have allowed film as a director medium and TV as a  writers medium yeah and so it very much like a chapter he called it chapters in  a novel or maybe it was the wire it was David Simon who said each episode of the  wires like chapters in a novel and many of the writers were novelists in the in  the writers room at the wire yeah and it really does and that's I you know I feel  I feel a little bit guilty about the way I binge watch these TV shows and how  much devotion we give to shows like Breaking Bad but I asked people binge  read novels I like reading I like that I like that literary reform I like the  idea of taking characters and taking them on a longer journey than two hours  can allow and lately movies have I've been less interested in movies because  they have to have this kind of set piece plot and shorthand for all the characters

Transcript:  obviously have a blacklist. What I didn't, Elgin's piece actually discussed it. Mike Elgin brought this up. He never gave us any proof.  No he's got zero proof what's at all but we know there's one because you've been  blacklisted I've been blacklisted since the 80s. His motto's been blacklisted. Right but you know he but so he did a lot of  supposition and when he wrote this piece but it was very entertaining but the  thing that I thought was interesting because I you sense these that everything  he says is absolutely correct but the one thing I really stuck out was once  you're on the blacklist you can't get off it. Yeah who you gonna call? You just can't get off it. Ghostbusters.  Blacklist remediator. Reputation defender.com. You can't do it you because I've been on the  blacklist since. What did you do to get on the blacklist? I wrote yeah when Steve Jobs quit Apple.  Get rid of him. God bless him. No no I was worse than that. I was writing  the Insight Track and InfoWorld at the time and it said Steve Jobs good riddance.

Start time: 4162.18
End time: 4197.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes but here's the problem. Apple promotes itself as this great open liberal creative.  All the creatives come here you know we're doing all this great design and all these things and  then this blacklist doesn't really fit in. It's kind of Nixonian isn't it? It's bull crap because  the blacklist is all Apple's about. All they care about is the blacklist. If you really think about  it why would the blacklist exist at all if this wasn't a focus? It is a focus and  a blacklist of people for all kinds of things. That's the reason they never had porn on  anything because they essentially blacklisted it. You know the words you use. It's a blacklist oriented company.

End time: 4225.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unless they're focused on it. I think what you're really saying is that Steve Jobs is a  flawed human being and one of the things that's very true about Steve is that he held a grudge  and the corporate DNA that he passed along and I think this could change under Tim Cook. Tim Cook  does not seem like the kind of guy who holds a grudge. No no he seems exactly like the kind of guy. They are slowly changing things.

Transcript:  Oh yeah or he's a second tier apologist. Well I have been on and off of Apple's good list too and  companies you know here's this shock and here's the problem I have with Mike's column on Cult of Mac  he makes it seem like he's shocked shocked that there's gambling going on in this establishment  and let's be clear big companies want good PR and they don't always pick the people who are going to  guarantee a good review but it is a mix of people who they like people who are going to give them  good coverage and people who reach an audience that they want to reach and it's a combination of that.  Verge has been on and off the list. Macworld's been on and off the list. It happens because it's  PR. They're not doing this out of some sense of duty to the public. They're doing it to promote  their products and they're going to make their decisions and that's Apple does you know that's  why they're not saints. If the argument is Apple puts themselves out as this wonderful company  that's just trying to help humanity it's a profit seeking big corporation. That's who they are.  That was part of the marketing. And there's nothing wrong with that but that is who they are and  they're going to make those decisions based on what's right for their company not because

Start time: 4322.42

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I would say every other company is the case and he puts the spectrum that leads from Apple to  Google as the polls and I don't think that's accurate. You think Google does the same thing?  I think every major tech company does the same thing. They may not do it in the same way as Apple  and I think it's true that Apple has in the past held a grudge with some people but I've seen it.  I've seen it with Microsoft. I've seen it with Google. I've seen it with Adobe.

It was a list of no do not talk or deal  with this person. I called him out on it because Balmer I know Balmer is a as a friend and I sent  him this stuff and he never reached we didn't want to talk about it. Every company does this. I think  Jason.

If you're going to have all these journalistic considerations  about ethics in particular and you are favored by a company and given free goods and given free trips  and given all these things and you write favorable reviews which you will do with Apple otherwise  you get on the blacklist how is this even remotely ethical?

He doesn't do this anymore but you get the distinct impression that Pogue  is just really goes out of his way to say good things and in exchange for getting future access.  This is like the same thing happens in Washington with the press corps. I like it to belway  journalism exactly. That's absolutely true. If you say anything bad about the president you will  not get back into that room and that's normal. Yeah it's normal. It's pathetic. That's the key

I don't  know what the financials have been on Grantland, but it's a great site. What is Grantland? Grantland  is Bill Simmons' website. It's ESPN's prestige writing site.

To John's point, video, how is Yahoo  going to deploy video? They don't have a YouTube of their own. There is Yahoo video, but it's not  the same. This is what they're trying to do. I can't imagine she's going to do a show. I'd imagine  there are going to be little bits that are going to get embedded here and there. Yahoo is investing

They can get Katie Couric doing maybe a daily or weekly web show plus some big  interviews that helps drive that audience. It's not going to pay out. It's going to cost a fortune

I think Katie Couric's the wrong,  well, is it the wrong or the right message for the, so Yahoo presumably like everybody else  who's doing online content wants to kind of become, compete with mainstream media. In other words,  get the eyeballs for advertising. It's all about advertising. The toughest eyeballs of all are the  18 to 25 demographic that doesn't watch TV and doesn't watch Katie Couric and seems to be Katie  Couric's the wrong person to attract them.

Can you, can you tap into an audience that's not the 15 to 25,  but maybe is 25 to 40, a more female audience than is a traditional web audience and which arguably  is the Yahoo audience, right?

Do the math in your head and we'll talk about it in a second. First,  I want to talk about backup and I want to talk about Carbonite.com. Crypto Locker. Very scary.  It's going around the Swansea Police Department. Swansea, Massachusetts pays  $300 to these bad guys because they encrypted the hard drives, right?  What did they click on? This is the Crypto Locker virus.  You get an email that says, click on me. No, it says, it attached is a zip file containing a PDF  of like an all points bulletin from, you know, a crook that was, you know, or whatever it is.  A lot of times it's like a wire transfer from your bank and you open it and what's inside is a PDF.exe  but a lot of times in Windows you don't see that extra .exe, right? So you click on the PDF  and then it goes out and uses strong encryption, RSA encryption to encrypt all your documents.  And then it puts up a message on your screen that says, you have 72 hours to send us a Bitcoin.  Actually, they cut it now because of the price of Bitcoin. Half a Bitcoin. Half a Bitcoin.  And we'll send you the key. Swansea, every police department in the world has said,  do not send the money. You're just encouraging this. Can you cut bitcoins in half? Oh yeah. Oh,  no. Infinite. Wow. We'll talk about that. So if this, but what it tells me about the Swansea  police department. Well, tell me about the Swansea police department is mind blown,  that they didn't have a backup, that they paid these guys money. They didn't have a backup of

You can find out Mac or PC what you  get. You get automatic continuous backup to the internet encrypted. So it's safe. It is unlimited  data. $59.99 a year for everything on that Mac or PC. They also have plans for small businesses,  for network attached storage, for external drives. So go and look at the plans,  pick the one you want. The beauty part is flat fee means you never have to worry about how much data  you've got in the carbonite cloud. By the way, that data is always accessible. I think this is  really important with a backup plan that you can go and see the backup and download files, make sure  it's all there and all okay. You not only can you download files, log into your carbonite account  on any computer or use their free apps. You can email those files to somebody. You can look at  the files. You can use them. Carbonite is amazing. I want you to try it free 15 days. Use the offer  code twit. If you decide to buy, you'll get two free months when you purchase 14 months for the  price of 12. Do not be the Swansea police department. Back it up. Do it right with carbonite.  I love this. This is from John McMahon, who's a software engineer. His blog is P-E-M-U-G-N-G.  Forget it. Pamunka.

Transcript:  Well, he's actually doing the A6, which was, according to the Nontex and Geekbench, 322  mega flops. If you go to the 5S, it's actually like twice that good, right? So he's using this  mega flops number as your baseline. The Burrows, the two dual core Burrows D825 computer,  which was made in 1962, could do, you need 4.6 million of them to do 322 mega flops.  There weren't that many in the entire world. So it wasn't then. This was a point,  this top end supercomputer in 1962 was the IBM 7090.1 mega flops. 0.1 million or 100,000  floating point operations per second. In 1960, there were about 6,000 of those.  So he basically, it goes back and forth. He thinks that at some point between,  and it's hard to know exactly without a lot more information, but some point after the mini skirt,  1964, and before Laugh-In 1968, the IBM 7090 was the first to do that.  1968, the world had as much computing power as one iPhone 5.  So he also says that means- And the point of this is?  Just as fascinating. The average startup in Silicon Valley is carrying the equivalent power  of all the PDP 11 sold in 1970s. Wow.  I just think that's fascinating. I mean, it's just an interesting stat.  It's used to play Angry Birds. Well, it may be not used for anything, seriously.

Transcript:  Can I- Say that again?  I'm going- Yeah, bring that up again and then I have an anecdote which I'll bring up,  which I commonly bring up, which was that during the era of Napster, I might as well do it now,  more- the CD sales were increasing while Napster was in play and then when they put the kibosh  on Napster, the CD sales began to fail and nobody wants to admit that this sort of thing  actually, the freedom of people exchanging music-  Sells music.

In long tail,  catalog stuff was as much as 30% more revenue because people discover songs, right?  Yeah. You find out, oh, this is a good song, I never heard it before.  She says, I find the removal of DRM increases digital sales by 10%. People want unprotected  music. Older albums see sales increase by 41%. Best selling albums, hardly any benefit.

Transcript:  And in fairness to the labels, which I'm loathe to defend, but I mean this is fairly counterintuitive,  right? Like, it would have been hard to make the case to labels 10 years ago that if they  just got rid of all DRM, then sales would have taken.

It is, I would say uncharitably that it's what would happen if a movie studio came up with a  digital medium for, for videos, but I don't have to be uncharitable. That's what it is.  It is the worst.  It is the worst. It is for people who are more concerned about DRM than anything else.  And it's terrible. And so I totally believe this about music.  And I do think that video would be in a much better place and people would be much more  comfortable buying online videos if they knew that they could put them anywhere.  And right now you can't.
