And we are gathered in the newly air conditioned twit cottage with John C. Dvorak.  I really couldn't make John come here anymore in the heat.  And then he says it's blowing on me.  It's cold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I came up here because it's like a hundred.  It's a hundred.  Yeah, it's great.  It's a hundred.  And you like that?  You know what's really cool about this kind of hot temperature that anyone who has ever  ridden a motorcycle knows this.  Normally you're going to motorcycle and kind of cool off.  But every once in a while you get to a temperature that's hotter than the cool off temperatures.  And so you're like in a convection oven.  So the faster you go on the bike, the hotter and more miserable you get.  That doesn't sound like fun.  That's what it's like out here right now.  That's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Brian Brushwood who has taught me how to eat fire is also here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they're daring me to try to teach John in the chat room.  Do you have your implements?  You know, they're out in the car.  We might be able to work something out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John, you want to eat fire?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wouldn't mind learning how to do that.  It's not hard and it's fun.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know how much fun it would be.  It's great.  You just get chest poison.  It's awesome.  With all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The good news is the air conditioner leaks a little bit so you could just stand under  it.  And if, you know, we didn't start the fire, but the air conditioner put it out.  How about that?  So we have a number of stories, not very many, frankly, because I was lazy this week.  This is my last show before I head to China.  Yeah.  I should mention next week, John will host.  He's going to take over the show.  And if you watch live on live.twit.tv, John will be here early about two in the afternoon  Pacific 5 p.m. Eastern.  And he's going to do about an hour of wine before twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do about an hour of wine and we're going to have a great show afterwards.  It's going to be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think we have Becky Warley coming up to join you for twit.  And you can invite, of course, anybody else you want.  But I think we should get Jason on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You want really?  That would be kind of actually, you know, Jason can't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I asked Jason if he wanted to do either the fifth or the 12th.  And at the same time as I asked you, and he said he's in the World Series of Poker on  the fifth.  And he may, if he continues to succeed, be playing on the 12th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, maybe he should be tweeting us.  He should tweet from the table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think he was doing that.  He's talking about some of the preliminary games he's been playing.  It's like he's doing pretty well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I see him tweeting from the table and then seeing his seeing what he looks like with  broken fingers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You were tweeting.  There are probably some things that are just not allowed.  You could tweet almost anywhere.  I have a jury summons the day I come back from China.  And I was thinking maybe I should tell the judge, your honor, I'd like to live blog while  I'm here in the trial.  Possibly go wrong.  What could possibly go wrong?  It sounds brilliant.  You'll love that.  This was the week, a sad week for celebrities because, well, first, who's first?  Ed McMahon.  Ed McMahon.  No, no, no.  But David Carradine was a couple of weeks ago.  So he was the kind of the warm up.  He was the warm up.  He was the precursor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Poor David.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Dom DeLuis, B. Arthur.  Dom DeLuis, B. Arthur, then Ed McMahon and then in fast succession, the beautiful Farrah  Fawcett.  Totally overshadowed.  Three minutes after she dies, Michael Jackson goes.  And of course that, yeah, she lost all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he was the happiest guy in the world?  Who?  Sanford, the governor from South Carolina.  Yes, the big winner here.  He's the big winner.  All the cameras were taken off him immediately.  Oh, he loves that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When we did the site on MSNBC, Princess Diana died.  Which killed?  It killed the site.  Yeah.  Because MSNBC went to wall to wall Diana coverage and it was so successful.  They said, why are we doing this stupid stuff for?  Let's just keep.  Right.  Maybe if more celebrities die, we can have ratings.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Speaking of the ultimate celebrity, the ultimate pitch man, Billy Mays.  And then today, Billy Mays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very sad.  There is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, that is a true story about the MSNBC.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They canceled the site and that was it forever.  Yeah.  I know exactly when the site was canceled.  They didn't cancel.  They put us on, quote, hiatus and then it's never brought us back.  Yeah, that's what hiatus means.  Hiatus means you're canceled.  So there's a site, BillyTweets.com.  And I don't know if it's for Billy Mays or for Michael Jackson.  Click the green play button to begin, it says here.  Uh oh.  What could go wrong?  I don't even see a green play button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you already clicked it.  I don't know what it looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a.  Well, maybe just click the, or maybe it's not the bottom.  This is one of those sites that has the play button so small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Refresh it, it jumps and it goes away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That looks good.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You can't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a winner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  BillyTweets is, oh well.  Not functioning.  Never mind.  Oh good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, at least you got something out of it.  I think that's probably a mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And our tech angle is complete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  A Twitter tribute to Michael Jackson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, please.  Okay, that's enough.  I think we've seen enough.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So how did you find out that Michael Jackson passed away, Brian Brushwood?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  On Twitter.  On the internet, right?  Well, and what's great is it used to be, I used to be so mad because the way I'd find  out celebrities died was you had to figure it out because you'd look on Google News and  it would say something vague like, Billy Mays was a great man.  You're like, well, what does that mean?  Did he die or something?  And then you have to intuit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was one of the first of the five Twitterers that nailed this one, by the way.  Which one?  Michael?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Michael Jackson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's plenty to go.  You were reading TMZ and you said, hey, this is a big story.  Yeah.  You were reading TMZ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, actually, Eric called me up and told me he was reading TMZ.  That's what I found interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got a text message from my 14 year old son and a phone call from my 17 year old daughter  that Michael Jackson had died.  They didn't even remember him.  And all they would remember of him is the freaky years.  Yeah.  But I guess they knew that this was a big deal.  He was the Elvis of this generation.  This is as big as Elvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  I mean, it's the same kind of thing.  I mean, you know, it seems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's really weird is the minute Billy Mays passed away, everybody forgot about Michael  Jackson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it is amongst us, amongst the techies.  I don't think this is all they're talking about on Twitter is Billy Mays.  Well, I think that's the techies again.  I don't think it's the general public.  I think they're still I think you're going to see Michael Jackson specials for the next  two or three days on all these shows.  You can see any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's already the top like seven of the top 10 on iTunes are Michael Jackson singles.  He owns iTunes all of a sudden.  Not singles to albums as well.  I think he suggested that I may in fact be a scam.  I don't know.  That would be a good one.  I'm Michael Jackson.  He wakes up.  He's like, no more debt for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you.  I'm back.  No, he's not going to be back.  No, it's true.  But that was everybody.  I agree.  What was it?  An idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was really interesting to watch the split between the people who were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I still don't think that Andy Kaufman's dead, but that's just I think we're pretty I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that's done.  He's not coming back.  He's not coming back.  We shouldn't joke about this.  This is serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What was interesting, though, is to see the split between between people who were like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you know, very deeply moved like, oh, no, I'm such a fan, blah, blah, blah.  And then other people like I remember one of the guys from Dad Labs, he just tweeted  out, dude, dangled his kid off a balcony.  Yeah.  He'd also.  There was a split.  There were the people who remembered him as a pederast, as a child molester who said,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well, what do you why would you mourn the loss of this guy?  And yet I mourn it because I'll never forget 1983 watching Apollo.  You're too young.  But I remember you must have been like 10 or 11.  Yeah, for me, it was Thriller because I was in elementary school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was before Thriller.  Well, no, I guess it was roughly the same time frame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it was the 25th anniversary of Motown at the Apollo Theatre.  Jackson comes out, does Billie Jean.  So I guess it was Thriller.  Yeah.  And that's the first time we saw the moonwalk.  He threw his hat.  It was electrified.  And that's what I remember.  I don't remember.  Everyone's doing the moonwalk after that or trying to write.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, how many shabby moonwalks do we all have to endure?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Do you know how to do as part of your scam school?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you know how to do a moonwalk?  I know how to make other people try to do moonwalks and laugh at them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you see that Jackson had a patent on the moonwalk?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, he had a patent on shoes that had a special grip on the bottom that you would slot into  an attachment on the stage that would allow you to kind of slide up to it, be suddenly  gripped, and be able to lean all the way forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know why he didn't sell many of those?  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If he had had Billy Mays, you can grip yourself to the stage and fall all the way forward.  Look at this.  It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're getting there.  He never stopped shouting.  You haven't nailed it yet.  I think that's pretty good.  It's close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I sound just like Billy Mays.  It's amazing.  So let's get to some real news stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, is it true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the plan is on Monday to celebrate Billy Mays.  Everybody's going to type in all caps for the entire day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everybody should type in all caps all day on Monday.  It's Billy Mays Day.  They say wear blue.  Wear blue and type in caps.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's getting better.  It's growing on me.  Your Billy Mays is getting better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't stop this, obviously.  All right.  Pick a story.  Any story, John.  Well, let's do Guy Kawasaki since we talked about Twitter.  Guy Kaka...  Guy Kaka-waki?  Guy Kaka-stop.  Guy Kaka-story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have not had a single drop of liquor.  I want to tell everybody no wine.  Maybe that's the problem.  I thought it was sugar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, his Twitter account was hijacked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, everybody eat for a moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't surprise me with...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that was fascinating.  Let's see what other stories we got.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  How scary is it?  How often we give our Twitter information to all these sketchy...  Did they say how he got hijacked?  Had he fallen for a scam?  They assume that's what it had to be, that he gave his info to some Trojan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twitter has been nonstop and of course because it's a target.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think that that shrimp looks like it's safe to eat?  Yeah, I hope it's safe to eat.  It looks delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would you like some?  No.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  God, no.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I shouldn't be eating while I'm doing the show, but I didn't have lunch yet.  That's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're going to China.  You're going to be eating a lot.  I don't care.  I know.  China...  What kind of food?  You've been to China.  Oh, yeah.  What kind of food do they have?  They got...  Let me think.  Wait a minute.  If I go to China and I say...  You will not get egg foo young or chop suey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and actually, yeah, there's that whole Ted talk about how what we think of as Chinese  food is totally bogus.  They go around...  In fact, she went around handing out fortune cookies and they were like, what the hell  is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well actually, fortune cookies were invented in San Francisco.  But the fact of the matter is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I go to Chinatown in China and have fortune cookies?  No.  Chinatown in China?  Is there an American town in China?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The joke of Chinese food in the United States is that it actually is Chinese food from 1850.  Oh, that's interesting.  Because all his coolies came over to build the railroads and such and they did...  And Chinese food is a living cuisine like French cuisine, Italian cuisine.  It changes.  And so from 1850, yeah, they probably had an egg foo young or something like that.  But that's frozen in time in the USA.  And then you go to China, it's like, holy crap, this is something.  This is nothing like Chinese food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So but remember there was a Szechuan fan and a Hunan fan that swept through at least the  Bay Area.  I don't know if it swept through all of America.  But that would be more current Chinese food or no?  In those areas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  The regionals are pretty...  So where have you been?  I've been to Beijing, outside of Beijing.  I've been to Szechuan.  I've been to Xiamen.  I've been to Shanghai.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've been there a lot.  You've been all over.  Were these junkets?  So you went to tech companies mostly or did you actually get to see...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In Xiamen, I went to...  There's an art dealer that I had to visit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you get little Japanese, Chinese lions that go on either side of your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He makes copies of monnaies and things like that.  Oh, he's a copier.  Outstanding, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  So I never thought I would be the one to tell Devorah to get back to the...  Can we talk about tech, please?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, man.  So Guy Kawasaki's Twitter got hacked.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know that there's much to say about it outside of I think it's kind of crazy that  we're still just blindly giving out our logins to every...  I think you said that.  Every set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I tell you what I would really love to talk about is Amazon stepping up and laying the  smackdown on the state of North Carolina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this a wild story?  So North Carolina is not the only state.  A number of states have proposed taxing.  You'd think, of course, they're going for taxing the purchases, sales tax off of Amazon.  And that's certainly one of the things they want to get.  But what they're talking about is taxing...  They're not being taxed enough in this country.  Right.  Tax protester John C. Devorah, ladies and gentlemen.  I'm happy to play my taxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, we pay over 55% of our income in taxes in one way or another.  Wow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I believe that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Should I be outraged by that?  If you're happy with that, that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, am I getting my money's worth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, let's see.  We're paying that kind of money and the state of California is what?  Twenty billion in debt?  California not doing so good.  And we have a 10% personal income tax in California plus property tax plus 10% sales tax and we're  in debt.  How does that work?  Where's the money going?  That's a good question.  It's going into somebody's pockets.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Why are we so broke?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, apparently Amazon is upset because the state of North Carolina is considering  hasn't been...  It's expected to be passed any day now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hasn't been passed.  Not anymore.  I guarantee it's not going to happen now.  Here's the way it works.  In 1992, US Supreme Court ruled in the Quill decision that it was unconstitutional for  a state to make another company that has no warehouses, no presence in their state.  They don't do business in the state.  Right.  They can't tell Amazon because Amazon's not located in North Carolina to withhold state  taxes and pay it in.  Now, strangely, everyone who buys on Amazon actually does owe sales tax to the state of  North Carolina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're supposed to.  In California, there's a line on our state tax return that says, did you buy anything  online?  How much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And pay the sales tax.  Right.  Only they call it a use tax.  And so rather than trying to harp on their own citizens and enforce the law as it's written,  what they would love to do is trick Amazon into doing all the dirty work for them.  But they can't do that because they don't have any warehouses, no business there.  But then they say, aha, some people are part of their affiliate program that they get paid.  So that's a presence in our state.  And so now we want you to withhold all the sales tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the way that Amazon responds is to close the affiliate program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, to shut down, to say, you're all fired.  You're all out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't make a huge amount of money, but we make maybe eight or nine hundred.  How much do we make on our affiliate program, Colleen?  Maybe a thousand a month, something like that.  It's not an insignificant amount of money.  And I think there are people who probably...  I've never made a nickel.  Well you got a link to your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, is that how it works?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you go to twit.tv slash picks, we have the twit picks.  Whenever we talk about a product, Colleen picks one a day and puts it up on the site.  Not all of them are Amazon, but when they are, we use our affiliate code.  Why not?  And it can be a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, here's the thing is if you're somebody who is working out of North Carolina  and the letter, if you know, the letter's interesting, is like, hey, sorry, you're fired.  Let me read it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We are writing from the Amazon Associates program to notify you that your associates  account has been closed as of June 26th.  This is a direct result of the unconstitutional tax collection scheme expected to be passed  any day now by the North Carolina state legislature and signed by the governor.  As a result, we will no longer pay any referral fees for customers referred to Amazon.com  or Endless.com after June 26th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is so brilliant because it does two things.  First of all, it completely pisses everyone off.  And second of all, it takes away the prize to where now even if they pass it, what are  they going to get?  We don't do business.  Yeah, because we don't do any...  It's a win-win.  Referral.  By the way, I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bezos is a genius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wanted to find out the story because I was trying to get the real story on whether or  not you were supposed to pay your own taxes because that's what I had always heard.  So I Googled sales tax online and I found an article that says, get ready to pay taxes  on online purchases.  The free ride's over.  And it was...  The date line was October 2003.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it went out before then.  I mean, I've been seeing this email year in, year out since the internet's been around.  In the event North Carolina repeals its tax collection scheme, we would certainly be  happy to reopen our associates program to North Carolina residents.  We've enjoyed working with you and we wish you all the best in your future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can assure you there's a ton of...  Because North Carolina is kind of a hippie state.  Are they pissed?  There's a ton of people that are affiliated with people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's interesting, according to Web 771, Amazon tried to do the same thing in New York,  but kind of at the last moment decided not to.  New York's too big a state and now they're paying sales tax.  You pay sales tax if you buy in New York, according to our chatter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well this has to be some kind of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  North Carolina's small enough that they probably could pull this in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well yeah, and if it works here, then they got a chance to keep fighting it as state  by state doesn't.  But if it doesn't work here, yeah, it's all over.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's an interesting thing for the...  It doesn't apply to companies without the affiliate program though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and that's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've been trying to tax...  Everybody wants to tax everybody.  I mean, it's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well really, let me be fair.  Let me say...  You're not being fair already.  I'm going to be fair.  If I'm a bookstore down the street, I have to pay sales taxes.  I have to collect sales taxes, I should say.  And you know why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because you have plumbing, you have streets in front of your store, you have sidewalks  that need to be maintained.  Amazon uses...  You have people that need to be protected by the police in case somebody robs your store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're saying because they don't do business, there's no reason for them to help the state  collect sales tax.  The more offer the less.  That sales tax is owed.  It's not like I'm paying sales tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's just it.  I don't think it should be owed.  I think as far as I'm concerned, unless the store's doing business and they got the protection  of the police, they got a fire department, that's where the taxes go.  So I'm Amazon, some other state.  I'm giving you money for what?  You're not protecting me.  You got no police in front of my store.  You got no sidewalk.  You got no streets.  You're not maintaining anything.  I'm already paying the state that I'm in.  Why do I have to pay you too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you're not paying though.  That's the point is if I buy a book from Amazon, I pay no sales tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm paying corporate taxes and all the other little things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But doesn't it put brick and mortar stores at a disadvantage?  Isn't it putting mom and pop stores out of business because Amazon is 10% cheaper just  because you don't have to pay sales tax?  Even if there is a sales tax, they're cheaper.  So they're doubly cheaper.  So how am I supposed to survive as a mom and pop store?  It drives business out of the state.  It means everybody goes out of state.  No, everybody goes online.  But that's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, maybe they're taxing too much in the first place.  Let's take a look at the little mom and pop store.  They're being taxed to death by their local governments.  They're being, especially in California, being taxed to death by the state.  They got an onerous sales tax.  Now it's around 10%.  Maybe if we gave them a break here instead of trying to drive them out of business, maybe  we should blame the government instead of blaming some company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, actually, you've got a good point.  I mean, it is going to drive business out of the state.  It's probably a contrarian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why Oakland's going bankrupt.  They've driven all the small industry that's in Oakland out of Oakland.  Now it's just nothing but just, you know, residential.  And they got no money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was just in New Hampshire.  No sales tax at all in New Hampshire.  That's pretty weird.  How do they survive?  Well, one of the things they do is if you are an idiot who climbs up a tree and gets  stuck and they come and rescue you, they charge you.  Yeah, they send you a bill.  Good.  It's like, what are you going to say?  Oh, no, no, thanks.  I'm fine.  Good. Charge them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Making sure that she gets off to her flight and OK and everything else.  She's not here, but she's somewhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Is that?  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think that's Billy Mays' son.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of my followers says, of course, I'm following this person back, says,  I forgot who he was anyway, says, hey, it was about Billy Mays.  And my response was no.  Then I happened to look to the right and saw that the number one hashtag was  RIP Billy Mays.  He died.  And it was reported by none other than his son.  And at his Twitter page called, he looks just like his dad, the young young  Billy Mays, I don't think this is true.  I don't buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I tell you, well, apparently he's like swollen to 4000 followers.  I mean, I'm not.  And again, this is the terrible person thinking scam here.  But it seems to me like that would be an effective way to get an awful lot of  Twitter followers very quickly.  Absolutely.  He's like this guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess he could have a he could have a grown son.  Yeah, but I still look I mean, look at this.  Wait a minute. Now, let's let's look at the picture.  I think he's painted the beard on.  I don't think that I don't know.  Is that is that it's a throw?  Give me like he's a Linux guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's a Linux guy.  Let's see. Maybe this really is.  How far do they go?  It only goes back like seven hours.  See what his oldest he's up to eight thousand now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, man, somebody was watching somebody caught the first draft of this and  immediately ran with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, there's a real Billy wrong.  And the real Billy Mays was his was the real Billy Mays.  So I don't you know, it could be his dad.  It could be somebody who was pretending to be Billy Mays.  Somebody named Billy Mays who said he was the young Billy Mays.  Yeah, or it could be a lot of other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just go to the real divorce and see if I've been hijacked.  The real divorce.  This is kind of sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is Billy Mays' Twitter account.  And that's his last tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's dreadful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's where he has close call landing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, they think that might be what what caused the problem.  He says he had a close call wedding in Tampa.  The tires blew out on landing stuck in the plane on the runway.  You can always count on us air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it's it's morbid stuff like this.  It drives. I had to wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It says getting ready to fly back to Tampa from Philly.  Monday is the big day. Hip replacement number three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, that's bad. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, so maybe that's a little depressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it actually kind of makes it kind of make some sense  that he wouldn't have a seat belt on if he's going to get his hip.  Maybe his hip was like, you know, killing him or something.  He couldn't put a belt on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So and then maybe he bumped his head.  This is this is the theory.  Boy, this is ridiculous.  Now we're just a bunch of schlumpers.  What does the real Dvorak say?  Now, Curry seems to be missing. He didn't die, did he?  Adam Curry is past.  Wait, I want to Twitter that.  Wait, wait, wait a minute.  I want to be the first to Twitter that he hasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He didn't show up.  He was we were going to do the show this.  How do you bump his head?  What are you giving poor Adam a bad time?  No, it's my I got the green logo, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do. And it says green, which is in case people do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a little concrete in case people are colorblind.  They would be able to see that it was green by reading.  Are you mocking? No, I am not.  That's the joke of it.  I just thought it would be kind of a cool logo.  But then people think that I'm just sarcastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going blue for Billy Mays.  I think we should go blue for Billy.  Is blue the color of Oxyclean?  You use Oxyclean.

And the most Iran had been at was five percent.  Yeah. And they were doing five thousand tweets.  Right. I know.  And what's funny is they're talking about what a triumph this is.  I'm like, guys, this is not something you should be terribly proud of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, odds that Billy Mays beat Michael Jackson.  Oh, very low. You think? Very low.  I don't think so. Not a lot of tweeting over in Billy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no, there is a lot, but not to Jackson was out of control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it let me just see if Billy is a trending topic.  Oh, I'm sure it is. Yeah. Oh, yeah. RIP Billy Mays.  Good Lord. There's only one Michael Jackson on all the trending topics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, you know, we speculated last week that it probably was Apple that  we never did find out that probably was Apple that leaked this story.  But now a week later, it's Apple, right? Yeah.  Wall Street Journal got it from Apple, obviously. Sure.  Yeah, there's just no question.  And couldn't be better timing.  Talk about Governor Sanford.  I mean, Apple skated on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they. Oh, by the way, got a got a got a new liver.  And the first words out of his mouth are we sold a million iPhones.  Like literally, he gives a press release.  That was his first statement.

Transcript:  Check this out. Remember, Jim. I know Jim. Yeah. Yeah.  He's a does. I've been on CNBC with him. Yeah.  He's a nice guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I have to say, he's a little bit in Apple's pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, he's a total Apple pocket guy. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if I like him, it's kind of you kind of have the feeling like they  something that, you know, Katie Cotton from Apple, the PR woman, calls him up,  says, Jim, why don't you come over?  We'll have lunch at the cafeteria on Monday.  And they're having lunch. Oh, look, Jim.  Oh, hello, Steve. Steve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good to see you. What a cool winky nigg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What an amazing. Who would have thought it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But here's here's what totally shocked me.  I didn't know, but they've been doing liver transplants for almost 40 years.  They do like seven thousand a year and 90 percent of them take.  And in the cases that they don't take, they just line you up  and give you a different liver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The liver is amazing.  It's the only thing only we have that regenerates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dr. Mom, who knows a lot about this.  She's been our consultant all along on this, says there's no reason  he can't be back his work as long as he wants,  just as long as he keeps to his medication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I couldn't believe it.  They I went I saw I went to some guide that says,  so you're getting a liver transplant.  And they said pretty much after the transplant a week, as little as a week,  you could be out of discharge from the hospital.  A week to three weeks, they say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, so where's the photos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we have we have one photo right here.  No, the photos of Steve Jobs.

Transcript:  I'm going to make this my desktop wallpaper.  Oh, my God. It's got Farrah Fawcett, Ed McMahon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're going to put a link to support this is from the ghostbusters behind.  You got to put a link for Chan dot org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Billy Mays, David Carradine and Mikey.  There was a busy day in the back.  The Darth Vader that we got made a great picture.  That's my wallpaper right now.  Right. Clicking on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm still telling you, there's one to go.  One more pitch man.  Oh, John has a theory. OK, so tell explain this theory.  The theory is that they come in threes, all these these celebrity deaths.  And everyone says, well, you know, the number doesn't add up, but it does add up.  If you think of Carradine, Foss, Farrah Fawcett and Michael Jackson,  his three celebrities and Ed McMahon, who began as a pitch man,  not unlike Billy Mays and ended as an end and ended as a pitch man selling stuff.  You know, the home sweepstakes or those publishers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just recently, the give him your gold. Right.  The gold guy. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So he's a pitch man.  Billy Mays is a pitch man.  And so we got one more pitch man to go. That's the theory.  So there's a bunch of them lined up.  I mean, there's a lot of old pitch men out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hi, I'm Leo Laporte for GoToMeetIt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are we going to skip the ads for the rest of the podcast?  I'm going to China. I mean, anything can happen over in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, I'm flying an Airbus A330-300.  Do you remember the last time you heard about that?  Yeah, that's the one that just blew up Air France in the midair. Thank you.  The latest on that, by the way, I don't think they're going to find the black boxes  because they get 30 days before the beacon dies.  They heard the beacon. Beacon. Beacon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They heard the beacon.  Yeah, they heard the beacon maybe two or three days ago.  They still haven't found it, though. It's very deep there.  Yeah, well, I can get it.  Maybe they don't want to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, anyway, is this like an episode of No Agenda?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you'd listen once in a while.  Maybe they don't want to.  The truth has been revealed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe there's a conspiracy.  It's the Illuminati. Air France doesn't want to get it.  So they think, though, the hypothesis, you know,  and absent the black boxes, they can't really be sure, is that  it was the computer systems that failed.  They got in turbulence. They were in a thunderstorm.  They're flying very high.  If you get too high a speed in that situation, you can have real problems,  too low a speed, also real problems.  They believe it's a fly by wire jet.  They believe that the that the automated systems failed.  The plane got going too fast and started breaking up.  And then from all the evidence from what they what they've heard  and what they think happened, this is this is the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's possible. I mean, something happened.  So I'm flying over the Pacific in about which is a long haul.  It's a hell of a long haul.  But where you fly out of SFO to Tokyo, to Narita.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, what do you mean?  What are you doing here? What should be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, you should do the flight to make is for anyone out there  wants to go to China, get into Vancouver, Canada, take the Air Canada  jumper over to Shanghai.  It's like seven hours because all of it's almost all over land.  It's a really nice flight.  It's filled with course with every Chinese.  I hate Air Canada, though.  Well, they have some other carriers that go from Vancouver to Shanghai.  It's a really nice flight. It's a good flight.  Short. Your flight is a long haul.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's taking me 12 hours to get to Narita.  That's a long way. Four hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. You're be on the plane forever.  You just take a quick flight up to Vancouver.  How could it only be seven hours?  It's like seven, eight hours max to Shanghai.  Because they're both way up.  Yeah, when you're both up close, you know, here's your globe.  It goes up. They're real close together.  And then you just fly to Shanghai.  You're in Beijing.  Shanghai to Beijing would be another couple of maybe two and a half hours.  Yeah, that's a good mistake.  But you want to stop in Shanghai.  It's the greatest city in the world.  Is it really? Oh, man.  What makes Shanghai so cool?  It's just it's modern. It's jumping.  It's got the best restaurants.  More exciting than Hong Kong now.  Oh, there's no comparison. Hong Kong is like a it's like Zurich.  It's a very banking oriented, very expensive.  Shanghai is one tenth the price of everything.  Oh, no comparison.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm not to go back to Shanghai.  Is there a Linux users group in Shanghai?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you better. I'm sure there is.  And they all have throat beards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Throat beards.  Is that the hallmark of the Linux?  So, guys, somebody said the chat room.  So so good news.  How about this Hulu ad revenues for premium content?  Like the Simpsons. This is exciting me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very exciting. For the first time, you pay more for an ad on Hulu  than you do for an ad on TV.  So if you want to buy the Simpsons on TV, it's cheaper than buying it on Hulu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is how it should have been from the beginning.  It's a very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. But it's good news for my is it cheaper overall or just cheaper  in the CPM basis? CPM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, of course, because far fewer people are watching the Simpsons on Hulu.  Yeah, but this one, they're more valuable, right?  They're more valuable because there's fewer ads.  They're it's a destination program.  If you're watching the Simpsons on Hulu, you went there to see that.  Right. And if nothing else, you're not asleep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The metrics, the metrics are so much more reliable.  You know, I was a Nielsen family and totally gamed the system.  This is you. Wait a minute. Let's hear about this.  Yeah, they they made us a Nielsen family.  This happened. Who's my family, my wife and I, our kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so why don't you like bound not to talk about this for seven years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, well, what I meant was my neighbor,  Ryan Rushwood, he was he was a Nielsen family.  And this happened right after the adult swim fiasco with the Aquatine  Hunger Force in Boston, where they where they thought they were terrorist weapons  and then they right. It was just promotional stuff.  At these guys. Yeah. Right.  And so I was so mad at that that I just put that all I did.  All I watched all week was Aquatine Hunger Force every night from nine to 10  for nine to 10. So you got a diary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. You didn't get a people meter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's that's the you had no box.  Just a no, no, no, no.  They just picked it and send us postcards and say, here's a buck.  Why don't you do this? And we filled out the thing.  This is what this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why precisely why they moved to automated systems like the people meter.  In fact, they're doing it in radio now.  Because you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But even then, you still have inconsistencies  because based on sample size and demographic and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that was the problem with tech TV is that we had such a small audience  that literally I'm not kidding, literally five people in the sample  were watching tech TV.  So if one person got sick, went on vacation, we lost 20 percent  in our ratings numbers.  It's not a good system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that was people.  Well, it's not a good system with highly targeted audiences.  Like it is. It isn't.  And it's good for like the major networks.  Yes, for the big boys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, five people go on vacation.  It doesn't kill science ratings.  If five people go on vacation that what happened to watch tech TV,  there's nobody watching.  You get that asterisk.  Yeah. So television programs such as Simpsons and CSI are for the first time  commanding higher advertising rates, not just hulu.com, a TV.com.  The premium rates are mainly for shows that rank among the most watched by Nielsen.  So you have to do well on TV first.  And then you're going to get the premium rates on the Web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the other the other.  I mean, there's a few reasons why it's why it should be more expensive.  First of all, you get better metrics.  You know that, you know, who's watching and how often.  And they're actually watching the ads, unlike on regular TV.  You don't know if somebody's getting up, going to the bathroom at 15 seconds.  You don't have enough time to do that when you're watching stuff on hulu.  You just sit through it. I do most of the time.  And also, you know that they're not  Tivoing to jump forward through through anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Primetime audience shrank three point six percent last season.  So they're looking for ways to make up that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's really well, because the programming sucks.  What's on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Simpsons and CSI.  It's about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think this although I like NCIS a lot, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that the one with Jeff Goldblum?  No, no, that's really that he died long order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's long order special.  Special no, no, no, no criminal intent.  I can't follow all these acronyms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's worse than the computer industry.  How many CSI's are there? CSI's of 45.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's 45. There's CSI Boston, CSI New York, CSI Chicago.  There's CSI Las Vegas. There's CSI New Orleans.  There's CSI Omaha. There's CSI Seattle.  There's CSI San Francisco. I can go on.  So get this. Marketers typically pay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  CPM's that's cost per thousand viewers 20 to 40 dollars  for a prime time ad.  I can't believe that. That's less than us. Yeah.  On The Simpsons, they're paying 60 dollars CPM's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's still less than online online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you've been able to demonstrate value.  I mean, there's a reason you're able to.  We're charging more than prime time TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but we have like a really targeted audience.  There's no Linux users and they all gave throatbears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's a very desirable demographic.  No, people wouldn't come back.  We've had most of our sponsors been on for more than a year.  Yeah, people wouldn't come back if it didn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's certainly been long enough that they know  that they're seeing a return on their investment for certain.  But what's interesting is, OK, so here's my question.  So let's say this is good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And maybe it's sorry, I have to make a correction.  It's neck beards.  Yeah, what would you call it? Throatbeard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like like throatbeard.  I like throatbeard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Neckbeards. I am so sorry.  I know what you meant.  I kind of like throatbeard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm kind of liking it, too.

Transcript:  Here's what terrifies me, though, is let's say Hulu gets more and more successful  because you got to remember also that the average Hulu program  has 37 seconds of ads on it compared to they have these three  90 second breaks on broadcast television.  What if Hulu gets popular enough that instead of these little 15,  30 second ads once every 10 minutes, then it doesn't work.  They start they start.  And it is worse than doing like TiVo because now you're stuck  watching 90 seconds of ads and you can't skip past it.  I mean, you're getting it on demand like TiVo, but you know,  you know where you skip.  You know how you skip past it? How? Pirate Bay.  Exactly. I mean, I'm told.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a real competition.  You did eat the shrimp. Yeah, it was good.

Transcript:  They're going to do a pitchman marathon on Wednesday, by the way.  Are they really? Yeah. Wow.  That's I don't even know about this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's funny is my pitchman's awesome.  It's it's Billy Mays and his British counterpart.  I forget their names, but  what's funny is when you just said that, I thought, well, that's morbid.  But I don't think it's any more morbid than the fact that that  Michael Jackson's tearing it up on the charts right now.  I mean, obviously people want to know it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's good business. Good for business.  Oh, brother. We're going to raise our rates when I kick

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and have a trip marathon marathon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We got we got two and one shows. I could just run them forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could. You could be just like Charles Schultz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what you could do is you could actually just run  your entire career over again, just from running straight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got it all in hard drive on that shelf, baby.  That shelf is gold right there. Holy cow.  Yeah. You didn't believe me. Wow.  Yeah. That's terabytes worth of video.  So so Windows seven.  Yeah. The prices are out.  Microsoft is not really cutting prices if you buy in the store  after it comes out October 22nd.  But if you buy now and I did, you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. But you bought now. Yeah. 50 bucks.  Yeah. But that's the home crap edition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, what edition do you want, the ultimate edition?  Are you what? Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you go for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What did you get?  Not just what did I get? I got nothing.  I got nothing. What did you get for Vista Ultimate?  Nothing. What did I get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. What more did you get in Vista Ultimate?  I don't know, because I never had the other ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what? I have both.  I have ultimate and I'll tell you what you got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have no idea. Dream scene, which allows the desk to go to the desktop.  The desktop video you got.  There was I mean, it was crap. Bitlocker.  Do you use Bitlocker? What is I don't know what it is.  That's right. You don't use it. You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd know it if I had song Smith.  That's what ultimate should have.  That's the one that plays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, seriously, ultimate was a complete failure in Vista.  A lot of people spend a hundred bucks more for ultimate and got nothing.  I mean, what you got was ridiculous.  I don't think ultimate's the way to go to seven.  I think the kind of the default version will be Windows Home Premium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I got a list here on my blog, Devork.org slash blog.  If you want to have a drink. Wow. He hasn't done that in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've got a lemon.  There's a thing on here that shows that it's got the table.  Go bring it up. You'll see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. Devork.org slash blog.  Is that the what is the address again?  Devork.org. Let me just type that.  Or G V.O.R.A.K.  A.K. dot O.R.G. slash B.L.O.G.  And and then what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, then you got to find it.  I have to scroll to I think you have to go.  Is that you have to go back a page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. So my question is, is that pricing?  Just the preorder or that's Waxman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's Waxman. Wow. He's attractive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have they have they determined the final retail prices yet?  Because I know there's some talk about that.  Windows should. Yes, they have.  They're going to drop it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not much like five percent, 10 percent.  And it's actually very disappointing.  The only deal is you're going to get is if if you if you purchase now  you at Amazon or Best Buy, a number of other retailers, you get a pretty good break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's just the upgrade edition, right?  It's not a full install. You have to be using Vista or XP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it is, you know, there's right at the bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The bottom click pic to him begin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, my gosh. That's that's a you stole this from PC magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We didn't steal it.  Borrowed it. Link to PC World.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a link linked.  So here's the deal.  Good Lord.  So there's all. Here's what's more.  You get an ultimate.  You get app locker, bit locker, branch cache, direct access,  a subsystem for Unix based applications, the multilingual user pack  and a virtual hard disk.  Oh, thank goodness.  I've been waiting for that.  Oh, yeah, you could boot from a virtual hard drive.  That's a good thing. Now, that is a good thing.  So but but on the Windows home professional, you don't get those.  Would you get everything else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, Windows home or home premium home professional.  So did you get the home?  Not professional. No, no, no.  Pre-premium is OK.  Oh, what else did I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, home basic is what you got.  No, I didn't get basic.  You get home premium for 50 bucks.  You are I'm not going to get the encrypting file system, the location

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of where it's called TrueCrypt.  TrueCrypt free, free, better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remote desktop host.  Go to my PC. Go to assist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go to go to my presentation mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't even know what that is.  Windows server domains.  That's for business.  Don't need that Windows XP mode.  And that's the one thing you might want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ha ha ha XP mode.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ha ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He sits back so small and satisfied.  There it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've got you, LaPorte.  XP mode. You're not getting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Check and Mesa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely. You're screwed.  You don't have XP mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where are you without your XP?  This is there's a certain delicious irony in Microsoft charging extra  so that you can run XP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Speaking of charging extra, there's a there's a lot of talk.  Like I had I had a Apple fanboy claim that  Snow Leopard and Windows 7 were roughly equivalent generational leaps forward  and that Windows 7 should be 30 bucks the way Snow Leopard.  I'm with them. I agree with them.  Yeah. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, Paul and I on Windows Weekly talked a lot about this.  And we I think we came down to the full version of Windows 7 should be 79 bucks, 89  bucks. It should not be as it is.  It's one hundred ninety nine dollars. It just shouldn't be that expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So when you get the upgrade edition, that means every time from now on,  every time I want to wipe my hard drive and start again, I have to first install  Vista and then install the upgrade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is unclear. But but in the past, you've been able to take your XP disk,  stick it in and it'll check it and then take it out.  You don't have to have it installed.  But Microsoft has not said yet whether that will be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although that'll be interesting if this rumor about the USB drives is true.  I wonder how that handles. You may you may just have to type in.  So what's that? What's that story? Tell us about that.  Well, apparently you could get Windows 7 rumor, a rumor.  Yes. The rumor is you can install on a thumb drive, which is really exciting  because finally I can put an expensive piece of software in an even more awkward  format than a CD so I can lose it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I you know why you want it on a thumb drive.  And the truth is you could do this yourself, but you want it for netbooks  and other devices that don't have CD, ROMs or spindles, you know.  And it's great. You know, I've installed Windows 7 on almost all my netbooks.  It's not a hard thing to do to put it on a thumb drive.  But most normal users are not going to want to do that.  You have to run some special software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, the weird thing, it actually it actually makes me excited for the day  when I could just finally have a subscription and it'd be like like with  Steam the way it is with video games where it manages everything.  And I never have to worry about anything.  And I just get online.  Microsoft would love to do that because they could charge you yearly.  Well, weirdly, I think I'm actually OK with doing it now.  I mean, I'm not not as that being the only choice, but I lose stuff.  I lose stuff a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like disks. Yeah.  I'm sorry that stopped us cold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. He lost his thumb drive in his pants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that a thumb drive?  Is that a thumb drive in your pants?  Is that really a thumb drive?  You haven't seen me. All right.  We're going to take a little break here so you can absorb the implications  of all that Brian Brushwood has just said for a visit to audible.com.  Audible, of course, are fine.  Sponsor the folks that do all those great audio books.  We're now, I think, up to sixty thousand audio books.  And you can get two of them for free.  Go to audible.com slash twit to your notable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, love audible.  In fact, I actually a friend of mine, I made a bunch of recommendations  and I got them started on audible.  And I've got my recommendation for a book all lined up when you're ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do? Yeah.  Well, that's fantastic. Thank you, Brian.  Well, let me just quickly mention that when you sign up for the platinum account,  which is what this twit to URL does audible.com slash twit to the platinum  account is a two book a month account.  That's what I pay for because I go through two books a month.  I really like that.  I just got five books on China to listen to on the plane and in China.  I'm really looking forward. Yeah.  A couple of biographies of Mao, one by one short one by Jonathan Spence,  who was my professor at Yale and a long definitive one  that just came out a couple of years ago.  It's like the book about Mao, a short history of China  and a history of the Long March, which I'm really interested in.  But that's probably not what you want to recommend.  I bet you want to recommend.  I hate people kick, kick loose from the jerks at work and get what you want.  Is that your book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, strangely, it's not.  All my book.  You may feel that way after you hear my recommendation.  What is it?  It's George R.R.  Martin's Song of Ice and Fire.  You love it. Got all five of them.  The guy who reads it is amazing.  Last time I was talking up Frank Mueller, who's who's since passed away.  But but Roy Dautrice reads the first three books in this series.  And this is going to take up both your books,  because you know how crazy long it is, right?  It's like 30 or 40 hours.  But you know, you know that it's going to.  And the first book is called Game of Thrones.  And they've sold the license.  They're already shooting it for HBO.  It's going to be.  It's got to be a miniseries because you couldn't do it in two hours.  Book will be a season.  So the first game of Thrones season one, they've already cast  Tyrion Lannister. It's going to be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My aching heart.  This is a this was a sword and laser pick.  Veronica and Tom picked this.  You know who loved this book?  I had it on my iPod and Roz, who's rowing across the Pacific.  She said, I never listen to this kind of book.  I don't like fantasy at all.  She listened to it.  And she said, can you get the rest of them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I tell you, it's infectious because it starts off, you know, I'm not a  I'm not a wizards and dragons kind of guy.  So good. But the intrigue and the politics and the way he writes about  just something as simple as food is phenomenal.  And Roy Dautrice right up there with Frank Mueller, as far as I play

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a little bit of Roy reading, this is George R.R.  Martin, a game of Thrones, the first book of the song of ice  and fire series, there's quite a few of these on.  This must be a quiet part of the book here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is when one of the characters is sleeping.  Fix it in post. We'll be fine.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What the hell is going on here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is Leo before a trip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Senioritis, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ah, who cares?  I don't know. It's not nothing's coming out.  Ah, you know, you could just go to the website and listen there.  One of the nice things about Audible, they do have this preview thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The button you could maybe try one of the other books.  I don't know if it's just no, no, no, it's this computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have problems with it.  It's a USB thing.  You just don't want to know.  Anyway, a song of ice and fire.  There are, I think, five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there are four.  The fifth one's about to come out and there are people howling at him,  because if you go to his blog, he talks about the NFL and doing a pizza  pub crawl and people are just like, why are you not finishing the series?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Get to work. Get to work. We got it.  So I'm very excited.  I have all four.  This is and I have listened to the first and I can't wait to hear the rest.  Good pick. Game of Thrones, A Song of Ice and Fire.  You can get this book with two credits because it's such a long book.  How many hours is it? 33 hours. Is that all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought it was way more.  It feels like much more.  It feels interminable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a recommendation.  I've never heard one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it was. I mean, it feels like death.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no. I've never had such a good book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You want long books on Audible.  Yeah, because you feel down in an airplane, right?  So you can nod off.  That's the beauty of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can nod off, wake up and you haven't really missed that much.  No, you still heard it. You still heard it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's in your head somewhere.  That's the way it was with Atlas Shrugged.  At some point, I would just kind of let it let the words wash over me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think shrugged is the word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that is a long book.  And you're right. You didn't really miss anything.  Three quarters of the middle.  This is this is worth listening to every word audible dot com slash twit to.  You get your two credits and you might want to apply them to this.  Excellent choice. George RR Martin's a game of thrones.  Thank you, Brian. A really, really good pick.  So let's see what else we got here on the twit bookmark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pass the lemonade over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is great stuff. This is the Odwalla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not a big fan of Odwalla.  You're not. Remember, we are a small little company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a word. They were in Santa Cruz.  Well, then they got bought by some monster conglomerate.  You know why, though?  They had that big pasteurization and they killed some kid. Yeah.  So they really couldn't go on as a tiny juicer out of Santa Cruz.  They needed to start pasteurizing.  But we used to have Odwalla dollars. Remember at the site?  No. Did you did you ever come by the site?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You did. I was on your show a couple of times.  I was on a show for them. The site was a show.  No, remember when we did the site?  The site was a show, but had segments.  You had this. I remember you at the table and I was arguing with you  and you said, AOL is never going to be worth a powder.  And the stock went from ten bucks to a thousand dollars a share.  I was right in the long. Eventually, you were right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the show where I said Microsoft Internet Explorer one is out.  Netscape. Sell your Netscape.  It's over for Netscape.  Microsoft has entered the fray.  And apparently Mark Andreessen had a conniption, came running down the hall  at Netscape said, Who the hell is this lay on the board?  I got your name.  No. Why is it?  But I was right again on that one and not right away again.  Twice in the lifetime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was on that thing a lot with you twice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. Anyway, so they had actually this turned out very poorly,  but they didn't want to give us free beverages.  So they would give they first they gave free Odwalla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's expensive mug you have.  It's a twit mug. It's not expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, you could buy these at the twit store.  I love my twit mug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the only mug I use at home.  You have a twit mug.  You gave it to me on my premiere visit.  You didn't steal my salad, did you?  No, no. I heard about the great salad caper of 2009.  I'm never going to forget it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whoever you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm surprised somebody hasn't put jump the shark into the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's any minute now. Any minute now.  So what's left?  The sad story. You know, finish your story.  So they were giving away free Odwalla's.  They had a refrigerator.  The site was an MSNBC production with Ziff Davis.  And they thought they had a lot of money.  So they had, you know, free coffee because we had that wonderful  espresso machine from Cafe Trieste that I actually went to Cafe Trieste  and learned how to use.  And they had free Odwalla drinks.  But then they got they got these were very expensive and they were wiped out.  You know, every guy would come and be gone by the end of the day.  I would take him home.  So they had to do Odwalla dollars.  They give you like wooden nickels and they dole them out to you to get your.  I remember that.  Yeah. You know, you weren't an employee.  You just visited.  I got paid. Really?  They paid you. Yeah.  That's that doesn't seem like what what NBC's policy would be to pay  contributors got paid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hmm. I usually don't.  Well, it's a known fact.  You don't like to work for free.  Yes. It's a waste of time.  Why work for free?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what I'm doing for free?  You're going to China.  Well, no, I'm paying for that one.  But I'm going to Dubai in October for Ted X Dubai.  October 10th, 10 10 0 9.

Transcript:  That's all there is. It's just sand.  It's unbelievable.  Well, you've been you got to go.  Everybody's got to go to Dubai once.  It's a long haul.  You think the trip to China is miserable?

Transcript:  I told him I want business classed on Emirates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a nice ride. Yeah.  I've been on Emirates. Yeah.  I thought that would be, you know, that's my contingency.  So here's my Emirates story.  I just a little off topic. Really?  But so what else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have we been on topic on this show at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, and I'm the one that's always I'm the one that's charged  with keeping us on topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I for some reason, you have picked a poor representative, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So so I go on Emirates and they they've so they bring out this.  We're number one in the business in the Travelers magazine.  And so they bring out all these magazines and they say, OK, here it is.  Here's the survey. We want you to fill it out right now.  You cannot get off the plane until you fill this thing out.  And make sure to check that you think we're excellent.  And they have all these check.  They're holding you hostage. Yeah.  And then they make everybody fill this thing out and they take them  and they mail them in for you.  And then they become number one. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's hilarious. So David Schmidt has done the math.  He probably used Wolfram Alpha for this.  SFO to Narita to Beijing is 6462 miles.  SFO to Vancouver to Shanghai to Peking is seven thousand miles.  So I am actually saving four hundred thirty eight miles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's possible I'm wrong then. OK.  What about what's the distance to Dubai via London, which is a trip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In perspective, the chat room keeps reminding you that Roz is rowing it.  So yeah, she's rowing. It could be worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I told her I'm waving as I pass.  Did you see they're going to make a movie out of Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it's funny is when I read that, because it said status of Facebook movie,  I thought that the whole movie would be just reading Facebook status.  Brian got a bit part in these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This would be you should be in this.  They want to use the kid Michael Sarah, who's you know, he's in all of those  arrested development. Yeah, he's great.  Love him.  And they want to use him to play Mark Zuckerberg.  David Fincher is, quote, in advanced talks to direct that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That shocked me. I'm a huge fan of David Fincher's stuff.  What was his last one? It was Benjamin Button.  It wasn't such a good movie.  Yeah, I didn't see it.  But I loved Fight Club and Seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Brilliant. Yeah, seven. Brilliant. Yeah.  But Benjamin Button. OK.  No, I couldn't watch it.  It was well, you saw Forrest Gump, right?  Yeah. Same movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was not a great movie, Benjamin Button.  And it was a little weird.  At first, I thought it was his makeup.

Transcript:  You did. Well, it was like giving a monkey something to do during the radio show.  Hong Kong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it was it was over the top.  It was fun. I loved it.  It didn't bother me.  It must have bothered somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because the show just I would play them.  But, you know, this I'm not getting any audio out of this machine, unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So how about the super intelligent ads that know what all your friends like?  This kind of annoys me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And something Facebook's done for a long time.  Is it will look at see what you've done and then make an ad for that on your friends page.  So it looks like you're recommending a product.  It's very well, it's sneaky and it's very sketchy, but it works.  You know, I see a picture of John on my Facebook page saying, you know, I use OxyClean.  I'm going to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're not. That's how much sway John has.  I'm going to say, John, you are you you're looking for detergent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that what you're up to?  I mean, I've been trying to figure out what detergent to buy.  But now that John's uses OxyClean, I think I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually I actually clicked a banner ad and bought something on Facebook the other day.  Really? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the only thing the only ads I see on Facebook and MySpace are ads for Big Lebowski  T-shirts because, you know, you list your favorite movies and stuff.  And that's interesting.  So it shows you something.  Yeah, all the ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It keeps showing me this ad for Obama's watch.  So I bought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What? What do you mean?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It was his watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not his actual watch.  The same kind of watch that he wears.  What does he wear?  It's this I'm not wearing it right now.  I think this is pathetic, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what watch does he wear?  It's I can't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What a fanboy you are.  Oh, it's engraved on the back.  It says this is his watch.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that sad?  Hilarious. It is.  Well, I know Seth's a wicker.  I have a plate.  No, I don't.  Did you get an Obama plate?  I didn't get the plate commemorative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We do have but I didn't buy it, but we do have mugs.  Mugs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to know what watch he uses.  Somebody in the chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm looking at Facebook and the ads no longer there, I guess,  because they know I bought it.  It's a you're the one guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's that's that's clever, though.  It's like the ad's smart enough to be like, all right, he bought it.  Quit showing him the ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're very this is where they're going to make money.  I don't know if they're making money yet, but I think it's Obama's watch dot com.  Let me see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It turns out it's Obama watch dot com, which is it's a watch.  That's what somebody just put down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Obama watch dot com.  I think it is.  Don't type it up and see what we get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, in a weird way, this would be a welcome change  if the ads were a little bit smarter, because it seems like you can always  tell exactly why they're popping up.  I took I was out jogging and I ran across the Golden Gate Cemetery  and took a picture of it and said, hey, this is kind of cool  picture of the Golden Gate Cemetery.  Everyone who went there from Twitter saw this all giant ads saying,  get a certificate of a doctorate in bereavement.  Because I guess I had the word cemetery in there.  So not not apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We just crashed Obama watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, this is presidential watch company and authorized your gray retailer.  This is fantastic.  Barack Obama's watch dot net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought Obama was against all this kind of commercialization.  He's not doing it.  Yes, you can.  Something to do with it.  No, it doesn't have. He's the president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, he's the president.  They could do anything they know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's something that's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And actually, because there was some talk like somebody used a clip  of President Clinton denying the sexual liaison and there it is.  And they they they can't use that.  Well, they took heat from it, but then they ignored it and kept doing it.  By the way, I love the headline on this website.  Yes, you can wear the same watch.  Yes, you can.  The same watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I am.  Anyway, so  they somehow watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm looking at this watch.  What's it's a watch.  It's crappy watch.  Is it a crap? It's a crap.  It's a crappy watch.  You have it. Did you get it?  I got it. And you think it's a crappy watch?  It's not great.  It's not great.  So you're not endorsing the watch and you're reluctantly not endorsing it from the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  sound. No, I want it's the same watch as he's wearing.  I feel bad that our president was wearing a crappy watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You disagree with one thing with Obama.  You think you should be wearing a Rolex or something?  Yeah, shouldn't he? Or a digital watch?  It would be inappropriate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he's a geek.  He should probably wear a digital watch with a calculator.  With a calculator. Yeah.  With a stylus inside. Yeah.  No, it's an OK watch.  It's not a great watch.  I mean, I got it for Father's Day, so I don't want to say too much.  That you bought it.  Well, that's how it works in our family.  I was lying in bed.  Yeah, I was lying in bed.  I said, oh, look, Obama's watch.  She said, do you like it?  I said, yes. She said, buy it for yourself.  I said, I'll buy it and I'll give it.  You can give it to me for Father's Day.  So I had it shipped to Jennifer.  She wrapped it and then gave it to me.  She does that for Mother's Day, too.  I give her clothes, jewelry, cars.  It's not really working out for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you got a crappy watch.  It's all you got on the deal.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, and it's got on the back, it says, this is the watch that the president wears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Huh. Well, who makes this watch?  Jorg Gray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jorg Gray? Yeah, Jorg Gray.  And see, it's got the nice engraving and it's a serial number.  And I'm such a sucker.  It's got three buttons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's good. Do they work?  Yeah, they kind of work.  Pieces of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, they all do something.  It's good for timing a tea.  Get a little tea timer on it.  Oh, OK. I think Obama's a tea drinker.  How much does this watch cost?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like 300 bucks. Holy crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not expensive for a watch.  There's nothing for a watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can go to Canal Street and buy Rolexes that are really good, actually.  And they're like, you know, the good Rolex.  I wouldn't wear a Rolex because somebody would cut your arm off for that.  You wear the silver one.  Why is that? Because then no one will cut your arm off.  They only want the gold.  Yeah. Nobody wants a silver Rolex.  They're not going to steal for it.  Really? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Silver or stainless?  Stainless. Yeah.  No, I like stainless. Yeah.  I like titanium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, next topic.  I think that's it.  No, brother.  So we covered nothing today.  This was terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You feel like we did.  But in fact, if you look back on it, we covered quite a bit.  Steve Jobs liver. Yeah.  Billy Mays beard.  The Facebook movie.  Facebook movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We covered beards.  The price for Windows 7 Linux in China.  We covered a ton of stuff.  Oh, you know, the only things left is Yahoo.  Oh, Carol Bart's. We were going to mention every to me.  Yahoo. It's like the mental Rolodex just comes up with thirty one dollars a share.  Every time I think I know.  Every time I think of Yahoo, I think of thirty one dollars a share.  What is it? What is their share price?  Fifteen and three quarters now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's got to hurt.  So that's the Carol Bart's, who is the new CEO of Yahoo,  is speaking at the shareholders meeting.  She was hardcore, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody stood up.  Somebody stood up and asked, what are you doing to about China's unfair  freedom of speech policies and stuff?  And her response was Yahoo was not incorporated to fix China.  Yeah. Next question. Next question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good for her.  Yeah, she's right.  I mean, but did you feel like they have some corporate obligation?  They do. They do.  I think so.  Google, Google has been in trouble in China for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't mention the G word, because that's the other thing she said.  She said she said that they shouldn't compare Yahoo to Google  because Google is just pure search and it's not fair.  Yahoo. Oh, yeah, they're just search.  Yeah. Yahoo. This is her words.  Yahoo is more of an online home for people trying to make sense  of the world around them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Please. So, yes, close at 1574.  Let's take a look. Just as we're bringing this up,  let's take a look at the key statistics here off the Yahoo site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A shareholder complainer complained about Yahoo posting too many entertainment  stories in the front page.  She said, if I see another Britney Spears thing, I'm going to throw up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, if she was thinking when they asked the question about China,  she should have just said, we're sending Leo over.  Yeah. Case closed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo's going. He'll take care of it.  So looking at this, the peg for Yahoo is 265.  What's the peg?  The price earnings growth ratio, growth ratio.  And that should be one.  One would be one would be ideal.  And two higher is worse.  Yeah. So in other words, you could if you if you was going to be that.  In other words, the stock is kind of selling twice as much for what it should be  selling for twice as much as two and a half times.  Yeah, two and a half.  I mean, if you based on the peg, unless they can unless you're some kind  of a crazy company that can change your sales figures like overnight.  And I don't see that with Yahoo.  So I'm not I wouldn't I don't know.  I just don't have it's a dim view I have.  That's what I'm trying to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But seriously, how hard must it be to get up for the third year in the row  after declining shares and explain how this time is going to be different?  And I mean, she's the new CEO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So she hasn't had explained this before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, she's at least organizational.  That's the problem with the company.  Yeah, she might help. It's been and she's sure she's sure.  There's probably a lot of money they could be making.  Well, I mean, obviously, by the peg, they should be making that they're  just letting slide because they don't they're not organized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Maybe that's all it is.  Just a structural could be could be.  And she's certainly got the moxie.  She's kind of the Annie Oakley of CEOs.  The moxie. I love that word.  That's a moxie.  She says, we're going to get our mojo back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, what a voice.  I think that should be your Carol Bart's voice.  She got to smoke a few packs  and she says, we're going to get our mojo back.  Next question.  And we're going to make a movie about the Facebook.  We're going to Salem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  No, you don't wear a watch.  Nobody wears watches because everybody's got the time all the time.

Transcript:  Oh, the pocket watches, the phone. Yeah.  Yeah. We all have pocket watches now.  That's a good point.  I have the weather, too.

Transcript:  I mean, when you say, you know, which which one do you have?  Oh, I have a iPhone or an iPhone.  I mean, nobody follows it.
