Great to see you. Welcome.  Thank you. Molly Wood is also here, your cohort from Buzz Out Loud. Hi Molly. Hello, good to be here.

Transcript:  Thanks for coming. We've never been on twit together before. What?  Is that true? No, we were sort of on twit SES. SES, you were together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's only ever on the road sharing a microphone. Right. It's like our same thing on that one.  It's our traveling road show. But you were right on that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, we do try to separate you. We don't want to make it the Buzz Out Loud  twit. But it's good to have you both. Also, Sarah Lane is here. Hi Sarah.  Hi. Great to see you. Great to be here.  Yeah, talk right into the microphone. Great to be here.  I know you're a treacherous little ball of steel. Hello.  But you have to work the mic still. OK.  And look it. Look it. Robert Scobel is wearing his tattoo shirt.  It looks like you're the illustrated man. That is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Your wrists are very wrinkly. I sat down and I was like, dude, nobody told me Scobel had sleeves.  How did I not notice that before? And they're literally sleeves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a tattoo parlor here on 6th Street that spells tattoo with one O.  And I thought, boy, that's not really a good advertisement for a tattoo parlor.  You can't even spell the word tattoo. You really don't want to go in there and get, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Permanent. Maybe it's a tattoo removal place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My Mather loves me. You know, that's not going to work.  There's Dr. Kiki. Hey, Dr. Kiki. Hi, Leo.  So you all are here. Why? What is going on?  Is this some event in town? There's some event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It seems to be kind of big. Woke up in Texas.  I know. Austin South by Southwest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but you got to sleep in Texas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're here for me. We're going to have meat.  Barbecue is very big.  I was going to we're going to have a little party at a Brazilian place after this.  But I heard that this is a barbecue town.  Scobel said we should have gone to a barbecue place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe we can have Brazilian barbecue. It is Brazilian barbecue.  There we go. Then I discovered yesterday that you can actually get meat drunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I think I actually have a little meat hangover today.  I was swaying. I'm not going to lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you're OK. So there are a lot of different interpretations of meat drunk.  So what you're saying is you got drunk on me.  I'm not touching that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What? You know, I didn't.  Never mind.  I'll just be right here with the coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So how does that feel when you're drunk on meat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was really I was swaying and slightly delirious.  My body weight in barbecue yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, that's quite a bit. That's like half a steer.  Were you at the Dignation Party? Thanks, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's actually what I meant.  Yeah, half a steer.  OK. It wasn't a whole steer.  What's a steer like about a ton? Super.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Were you at the Dignation Party?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, because I couldn't be lifted for crowd surfing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because because if you were, I would say you weren't stoned on meat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was a wild party.  That was a very wild party at Stubbs Barbecue, another barbecue place.  In fact, I did have a little Stubbs barbecue because Tony Shay of Zappos  has a party bus that was stocked with barbecue from Stubbs.  That was fun. Did you go?  Yeah, yeah. It's the happiness bus or something.  You're a VHP, a very happy person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. You've been on you've been on the bus.  Was it enjoyable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What happens on the bus stays on the bus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me put it this way.  It's a bus that comes with its own bartender.  Robert warned me, well, not me, but his entire Twitter following  about over consumption of alcohol here at South by Southwest.  You're not drinking at South by Southwest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I've had half of a beer so far. Wow.  Why is that?  Because I went a little crazy last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we've just learned you can get meat drunk.  So maybe a little later on, you'd like to try that.  And after you get meat drunk, you can you can crowd surf.  That's a thrill and a half. That was really fun.  I got to do that at the Dignation Party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you didn't break anything bodily or equipment wise?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, how did it go?  Nor did I get groped.  I thought I might get groped, but I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People were respectful overall with the lifting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think when there's that many hands on your butt, you really can't call it groped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So somebody said somebody said out in the hallway that they touched your butt  and they don't want to do it again.  I was flexing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Clenching, is that the word?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now the rumors of your buns of steel will go far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you couldn't say it's groping your butt anymore.  You could then you could say the floor gropes your butt when you lie down.  I mean, it's really like a kind of a wavy mattress.  Was it your first time?  Why? You've done this?  No, I'm asking if it's your first time.  Yes, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I for you know, unless you're really a party girl, girls don't really go in for crowd surfing.  No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Then you will get groped.  I was I was talking with people about it last night and saying, well,  who would who would actually do this?  And like all the girls I asked for.  No, no, don't think so, especially not with the dig boy crowd.  Yeah. No, absolutely not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There were a large number of women in the dig audience.  There were quite a few quite a few girls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think more than I've ever noticed at a live show.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  South by Southwest is nice because it's not a bunch of fat overweight guys like me.  It's it's and Robert, it's there's a lot of women.  There's it's a social it's really a social media conference more than anything else.  This is my first time here.  Is this is this a feel like a typical South by Southwest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's far, far more busier.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fifty percent.  Supposedly, this is the first year that interactive registration exceeded music,  which is I mean, it started as a music conference festival.  So unbelievable.  Get right up to the mic because we are these.  Fifty percent more interactive folks here than last year.  Wow. I mean, if you walk down Sixth Street after 8 p.m.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, two years ago, there was only one or two parties that had lines.  Every party has lines now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember being here when I lived here in 1993 and the music was it.  There was the film conference, which meant you could go to the Doby Theater  and see a bunch of films you wouldn't be able to normally see.  And there was really no problem getting into any of them.  And then there was the CD-ROM conference, the multimedia called it  South by Southwest Multimedia.  And it was a bunch of CD-ROM authors in the convention center for a couple of days.  And now to have it actually out draw the music is is pretty mind blowing.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think social media will go the way of CD-ROMs?  Is this a flash in the pan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's going to be a step towards  what you know, whatever comes next, the semantic web and other things.  I mean, people are naturally social and so social, social, social ability,  social ability. I can't say the word.  Just make up a word here.  Yeah, that's going to be a huge part of everything on the web going forward.  So it's not going to go away.  It'll just be folded in to the origami of the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, the social media part of it feels like a little bit of a bubble right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, everybody you meet is a social media expert, a consultant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have friends like no offense to the audience.  We don't talk to me if you're a guru.  Like really social media guru. Come on.  There are a lot of that's a job.  It's a job like that's a bubble.  If that's a job, this is a bubble.  No, but there was that PR guy who wrote the big article.  What are you talking about? That's my job.  I really I like I really like your sleeves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sponsored by Rackspace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not just, you know, a few people's job.  It's not a specialized thing.  Now it sort of feels like everyone is just like, well, I'm on Twitter.  So boom, guru. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you don't know what to put in your card, you put that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have 500 followers on social media.  Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there is some stuff that is not a bubble.  I mean, it feels to me, maybe you guys would like to correct me on this,  but it feels to me that there's this real creative surge  that is kind of the culmination of inexpensive digital hardware  and content creation tools and this incredible distribution media of the Internet.  And everybody here seems to be starting a company  or creating a website or a blog or podcast.  There's a lot of creativity here.  And I think that's why it's bigger is because there are more people doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there's also a lot of of criticism as well, though.  People coming in who have been going to South by Southwest.  This is my first year as well.  So I don't have anything to compare it to.  But a lot of criticism as to, oh, well, you know, the the panel sessions  aren't as creative as they used to be.  There are a lot of people who are the the web posers.  You know, people aren't this isn't the thing that people aren't  maybe getting what they thought they would get out of it.  I don't know if what everyone else is thinking about that, like what you guys are thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of my staff went to a panel on what was it called, Lisa, how to do things for less.  And they were showing how to use Google Maps.  It's like anybody who's here, I think, knows how to use Google Maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't have to waste all that money on paper maps.  You can do things for less.  Well, you know, it's funny that I used to do panels here every year.  And then we started doing Buzz out loud instead.  But whenever I was doing the panels, there was always this long explanation  from South by Southwest about what makes a good panel, including stay on topic.  Actually talk about what you described and and, you know, they can only do so much.  They can't force people to do it.  And it's a big problem.  People drift from the thing that they thought they wanted to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are also a lot of panels.  I mean, there are so many options.  There's that's frustrating.  And that's always bothered me because I have to choose and I don't necessarily  know what we're getting beforehand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Keep in mind, a lot of people want to do a panel so they get in for free.  And so it's a big competition to become a panelist.  And me, I don't want to work.  So there are also some bad panels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'm not going to add any specific panels.  I've been to a couple of panels where it's like it was all I could do  is just stay off my iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was at a god awful panel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And some panels end up turning into marketing for for a company.  So you go in thinking that you're going to get information out and you find out  learning about, oh, this company is not I don't just you just don't want to be there  after a while because you're being sold to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was I went to the Mark Cuban versus Avner Ronan panel.  He's the boxy guy and Mark Cuban, of course, the guy who started broadcast.com  sold it to Yahoo for a billion dollars.  And it was just it was so annoying because the panel.  Yeah. Well, the first thing Mark Cuban says is how much money did you make, Avi?  And then, well, we don't have a revenue model.  Well, I was profitable from day one.  And it was just really it was very annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What was everyone else getting out of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, nothing. I was getting nothing.  But fortunately, the fire alarm went off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm sure it was an accident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. They claim that something went wrong with a water pump.  But they evacuated the entire convention center.  And I'm wondering how many people actually went back to that panel afterwards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a good excuse to get out.  It was a reason to get out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Actually, one of the things that's cooking underneath the surface here  is the future of TV.  We haven't seen a lot of it come out yet.  Like I was sitting next to the head engineer for Comcast, who's building  a social TV system where you check in on TV shows and tell your friends,  hey, I'm watching Los Rojo.  That makes a lot of sense.  And that's coming out in a month or two.  And but there are several of those that are cooking here that, you know,  if you get in the right party or the right dinner, you'll hear about them.  But they're not out yet.  Sort of like Foursquare last year, I kept hearing about this Foursquare thing.  But AT&T last year was down, so I couldn't even try it out.  It came out here last year, right?  That's where they where they released it.  And but I didn't have an opportunity to really use it with anybody last year.  And this year, it's everywhere, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We just saw last week articles from the awards show saying  their ratings are up significantly and they think  I don't know if this is true that it's because of social media,  because of people tweeting, I'm watching the Grammys and that kind of group tweeting.  Do you think that that's true?  Does that make sense?  I think so. You watch more.  I certainly was more interested in the Grammys because I was watching people  diss them. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's the nice thing about something like Twitter is that all of a sudden  people start making these references to something funny that just happened  and you want to be part of it. Yes.  He's on the TV so you can join the conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That actually is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I bet it's working for movies, too.  I feel like there's a lot more pressure now.  Like if there's a big movie that's coming out that has a lot of geek interest,  I feel like I need to see it immediately because otherwise  I'm going to be behind the Twitter curve and I'm going to get spoiled.  And, you know, it's like it's this whole kind of new level of social peer pressure  that I think is definitely I'm sure it's helping TV.  Although I did see then NBC try to congratulate themselves on their time delay  by saying that because they had the time delay, social media could sort of pimp  the Olympics for them. And I was like, no, no, no, no.  Misread. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, no, no, no.  All the anger was coming from social media about the Olympics.  That's where it all came from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're saying the live things are getting a bigger ratings.  But what about delayed?  What about things like Lost or?  Well, certainly Lost does.  I mean, everybody I knew the ratings bumps on those two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know. But I'm watching 24 because all my friends kept talking about.  And it got me interested in the show. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder if this is the new way, whereas before it used to be the television  that the family sat down in front of where you all had this shared experience.  And now because of social media, when our media is splintering  in all these different directions, maybe the social media will start  bringing those shared experiences back in.  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  AT&T did keep the network up this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I've had no problem. Yeah.  It's working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is this is actually the talk about differences between Southwest, Southwest.  This is the first South by Southwest where most of the major stuff  I want to use is working. Yeah.  You know, remember the last three years, Twitter has been down every every time  when we come here. Twitter was down yesterday, though.  It wasn't down for me.  It was up and down.  But, you know, it's mostly up.  Four Square and GoWall are both most.  I haven't had a single error message on those services.  And that's remarkable.  And when Twitter came out here in 2007, by the way,  it was after your show that got it got hot. Really?  I think I have some credit for that.  I totally think so, because everybody who was coming to South  by Southwest heard about it on your show and started using it,  going into the show and started talking about it. Yeah.  But it was down all the time.  I was sitting next to Evan in 2007 going, why isn't your service up?  You know, and this year it's up. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and AT&T really staked a lot on it.  We were talking about the Sun Buzz Out Loud today.  It's like they really realized that they could not afford just PR wise,  like another geek apocalypse like they had last year.  You cannot have everybody who's on the cutting edge of smartphone purchasing  and being online on a smartphone device talking about how crappy AT&T is.  So they really doubled down on it and it's paying off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They did.  One of the execs pointed to all the portable towers.  One of the parties was that and they put a lot of portable towers  and a lot of brand new antenna technology and brand new software  for the network and brand new trunk lines that they brought into the town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's that's great for PR and it'll keep them from getting some bad press.  But it doesn't fix the problems elsewhere because they can't bring in portable  towers every single place that they have issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  True. And in fact, the same executive said, see those antennas, they're six foot.  And in San Francisco, we're only allowed to use two or three foot antennas.  And we can get six times more capacity on these six foot antennas.  But the city doesn't let us put them in.  So, you know, the geeks need to help us out and help  get cities to put more networking infrastructure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now they tell us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Like, what do I have to talk to?  No, really, I mean, the six foot tower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  To be fair to AT&T and I bashed AT&T consistently for a year  because every event I go to, this is the first major event that it stayed up.  At CES, I was walking around with three cell phones and only Verizon was up. Right.  The growth in the iPhone and the new smartphone device  and the data usage that we all exhibit on these phones is many,  many times higher than they ever predicted.  Even Apple. I have a friend who runs the Apple  application team, the app team.  He says, take when we initially pitched it to the execs to add an app store.  We thought we would sell X and they've sold 100 times X.  The number of device things that we do with these iPhones is way off  the charts for what they were expecting.  And so I kind of a little bit of three years now.  True, true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, there still are studies that say there are five billion dollars  behind an infrastructure investment behind Verizon.  That's what it would cost them just to catch up to Verizon.  That's not true. That's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If you if you took that on the Internet, if you took it,  well, it's not true.  There's a lot of things on the Internet that you shouldn't believe.  Yeah. If you took every iPhone user and put them on Verizon,  Verizon would go down instantly.  Verizon's networks could not keep up with iPhone users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is there any truth to what I've read, some theories, too,  that the way the iPhone maintains a connection actually exacerbates  the issue, particularly for iPhone users?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There probably is something to that.  The usage model of the iPhone is completely I look I look at how people use phones.  We use data on these things so much more than other phone users.  And by the way, that if you talk to Google executives,  the third stats show that is true even on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But all the studies say that the data is not AT&T's problem,  that the voice network is what's so fragile.  And that's where they haven't invested in the infrastructure the way that Verizon has that.  You know, that you're right.  You're right. If you migrated everybody over all the ones to Verizon,  they would have problems, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I was taken out on a tower.  There's one fiber optic to the tower.  So if you're if you're saturating that that link into the tower or whatever, it's gone.  There's only so many connections that it can keep.  It's a wife. It's a wife.  I probably we have these problems with Wi-Fi at every conference, right?  It's expensive and difficult to deal with a lot of people who are all using their devices  and all using a lot of data at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So was there an app that won in the way that Foursquare won last year or Twitter won in 2007?  Was there a killer app?  Was GoWalla killer app for GoWalla?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's interesting. I've gone from 100 friends on GoWalla to just about 1700 right now.  That means I had to catch up with you.  So GoWalla has certainly come on strong, but I have seven thousand friends on Foursquare.  So I still think Foursquare is the winner right now.  But GoWalla sure sure made a good push this week.  There was no standout, though, on the top by this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It seemed going in like the idea was that sticky bits might be the thing to make some waves  because of the QR codes that could be slapped anywhere and you could tag that.  But it's too it's too much interaction.  You have to walk you have to see a QR code.  You have to walk up. You have to launch your app.  You have to scan it.  Yeah, I mean, yeah, already steps already.  I'm tired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Actually, actually, the big fail, the big the big fail this year was they just added this QR code to the badges.  And if you try to use it, the iPhone app works great.  It recognizes the code instantly.  Right. But then it asks you to sign in and I can never get it to sign in.  It the service is way too slow and it doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Plus, walk it up to somebody like, oh, hey, do you mind if I scan your badge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, you know what?  If it had worked, a lot of us have been comparing if it had worked and it was easy to get into,  we would have done it. But it doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what you need is more like a layer augmented reality browser that you could hold up to somebody's badge  and instantly see the information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, tomorrow I'm actually going to be wearing a TV t shirt with a code on it that is augmented.  I saw that at the end of that for the Gilmore gang.  Yeah, that's bizarre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's tattoos that do that, too.  Yeah. Yeah.  All right. Well, we're going to do a commercial.  Maybe we could rotate some people out because there's so many people here we'd like to see.  Robert Scoble, great to great to see you.  So nice to have you here.  And we'll see you for me a little later on.  We'll get you meet drunk.  OK. OK. Dr. Kiki, too.  We're going to send you away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can I tell people I'm having I have a panel tomorrow?  Yes. What's your panel?  We're speaking tomorrow here on Open Science.  It's a panel with Ariel Waldman, Natalie Villalobos, Jesse Cohen Sharp from NASA and Tantech Chalik.  And we're going to be talking about opening up science, open science, collaborate, cooperate and communicate.  And I think it's going to be a lot of fun.  It's going to I think we have a lot of good things to say.  Yeah, Tantech's panels are always good, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kiki is also the host of This Week in Science, a great radio show for science lovers in our own show on the network,  Dr. Kiki Science Hour, which is every Thursday on the network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Science Thursdays.  Yeah, it is. Maxwell's House, Maxwell's House from two to three.  Dr. Kiki Science Hour from three to four.  And coming in April, Ross Rose, which we're going to be taking a scientific ecological slant on this year from like 4.  Thirty five, something like that.  We're at just Science Thursdays.  It's going crazy.  Science. Yeah, science drunk.  That's what it is.  That's the panel I want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The science behind drugs, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There probably is one, actually.  Thank you so much for having me.  You can go talk to her about that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. Thank you, Kiki.  Thank you, Robert.  We're going to invite some more panelists in here.  You're listening to This Week in Tech, a special edition from South by Southwest.  We want to thank our friends at Citrix for providing the wherewithal to make this happen and invite you to try their go to meeting product.  Now, Citrix, of course, is a very well known name and enterprise for remote access.  They practically invented the category.  Microsoft licensed their technology for remote desktop and they've made it easy to use, which is where the go to meeting product really just shines.  Imagine that instead of traveling across the country to meet with a client or across town to collaborate with a colleague, you could just fire up the go to meeting software.  Takes about a second to start a meeting.  You can either set it up ahead of time or even literally while you're on the phone call with somebody say, hey, go to go to meeting dot com.  Click the join a meeting button. Here's the meeting ID.  Now suddenly they're seeing your computer on their desktop.  They see your presentation, your spreadsheets, you collaborate on documents together.  I've used it to rehearse speeches.  It's just really great.  I'm sure panelists here at South by Southwest are using go to meeting to plan their panels.  It's the way you can collaborate with anyone anywhere without ever leaving your desktop.  Now you can try it free for 30 days.  Go to go to meeting dot com slash twit and an unlimited 30 day trial offer is waiting there for you.  Go to meeting dot com slash twit.  We invite you to try go to meeting.  We thank Citrix for their help in making twit possible.  Jeff Jarvis has joined us.  Hi, Jeff.  Good to see you.  You and Jake were at the Dignation.  It was a magnificent moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, what's great thing, Tulio, was that here were two of the kids.  You really made their careers and you said it was the first time you were on Dignation.  Yeah.  Right.  So that was really kind of a goose bump moment itself.  And then for you to find a new youth was fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't take credit for Alex, but I do take a little bit of credit for Kevin Ross.  His mom and dad came up to me.  It was really neat.  And his dad said, I don't remember something like, you know, your son, my son really got his start with you.  And it was really sweet to see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  His first screensavers.  He was the dark tipper then.  He had figured out some thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a flaw in Microsoft Windows.  It was a it was code that allowed you to broadcast a network message.  I am.  It was not quite I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was it was within Windows.  Messenger.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he was real nervous and he had a chalkboard and it was like, and you would say, yeah, I'd love to find first.  That was the that's the monster you create.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd love to find that and put that on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is that there is I think Patrick Norton's first appearance on a call for help and he's visibly shaking.  It's actually really kind of cute.  So, Jeff, you were at Dana Boyd's keynote.  I thought that was in fact, there's quite a bit of coverage of it today.  She talked about privacy and the kind of the disconnect between how maybe you and I view privacy and how the younger generation views privacy and and whether there is privacy even you can even talk about privacy on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what she was arguing was that if you look at the continuum from privacy to publicity that companies come along and make assumptions.  She was arguing that people want things to be public, which they don't necessarily want to be public.  And and fine.  And I agree with Dana heartily about this.  The issue is not privacy.  The issue is control.  I need control of my data and what happens to it.  And that's absolutely true.  But what she didn't talk about that I always wish people like you and I, Leo are public to a fault, didn't talk about the benefits of publicness that we learn from young people today.  And there's always that edge case.  There's this horrible case of a young woman who had an abusive father who started her Facebook page and didn't know when she had OK that things were public.  OK, that's bad.  And that's our edge cases.  And I think that we're letting that rule us in the lowest common denominator.  Think about this. The thing you asked for before the break, that thing that's going to let you picture the badge or the person is, of course, not to plug twig, but it's Google goggles.  Right.  And very soon you're going to be able to see this augmented reality where I can see something about all these people out here.  Right.  Right.  Just directly from my machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And she'll see people's names superimposed, their birth dates, their embarrassing photo, their embarrassing crowd surfing photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  And and so that's not that software that freaks people.  But was that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So we did we did a story on Buzz out loud recently about some software that does that.  You point your phone at someone.  I mean, it's an opt in and they have to be using the software as well.  The goggles are goggles.  Turn off face recognition.  And then somebody else has done it.  Yeah.  And it's possible.  And it pops up all their social information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So is that an argument saying, oh, my God, you've now made something public?  Well, no, it's already on the Internet.  It brought it to us easier.  It's going to freak the public, you know, the privacy advocates.  And we end up with this discussion over and over and over again.  Dana is brilliant.  And she's quite right about control.  And she's right to argue that we have to be careful about the implications of what we  do and we have to be very careful about educating people about what they're doing.  Having said that, let's have our party.  Right.  Let's have our festival.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we were talking about this a little today in relation to Netflix, who's canceled  their contest because of the FTC saying, hey, you know, this data can be used to  discover things about people that they would rather have private.  And so because of concerns about that regulation, they pulled the contest.  And this is just movie information.  And there are definitely edge cases there.  Right.  But for the most part, people probably wouldn't mind having their movie choices made  public in lawyers, lawyers, lawyers.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and we were saying that in a world where Facebook exists, it's totally bizarre  that Netflix would get sued for, you know, for maybe revealing how many times you  rented like some really crappy movie.  Like it just doesn't seem like, you know, relative to the information that that you  may not know you're revealing, because what this comes down to the control thing, it  comes down to opt in.  If I am opted into revealing more information than I want to, that's not  acceptable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or if you knew if Netflix knew what they knew today about the power and value of  that data analyzed by outsiders, they would have changed their terms of use long,  long, long ago to say you're opted in and here's a method where you can opt out.  Otherwise this data and aggregate is ours.  But they didn't do that probably.  And so that's where they're stuck now.  And we're going to see the TOS be the battlefield.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But isn't the problem with opting people in?  I mean, that's what Facebook does.  It gets them in trouble all the time.  And it should be, it should be opt in.  You should have the the.  The.  I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Facebook is a social thing.  And if the default becomes people, people want to befriend me and they tell them, but  I can't see anything about them.  That's not very friendly.  I'm not doing it.  Sorry.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Misanthropes want to use Facebook too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I know I have one.  Maybe you could have a trial period.  Maybe there could be like a preview, right?  Like instead of Facebook opting you into showing everyone everything, like when they  roll out those new privacy features and they roll in that, if you haven't changed  your default privacy and they opted you into showing all of your photos, all of your  wall posts, all of your information to everyone on the Internet, like there was a middle  step.  There could be a preview so that if somebody tries to friend you, there's a preview of  their basic information, maybe who they work for and what they, you know, because I do  often want to know that.  But I think that there was a way to solve that technologically without opting into  without opting in all of the Facebook users to really a remarkable overshare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Boyd also, though, pointed out that there's a generational gap in this, that Jeff and  I, our generation is everything's private unless we opt into publicity.  And younger people, she said, and she's done a lot of studies of this, think everything's  public, but they want to be able to say what's private.  Is that right?  Right.  It's the default is different.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's also true culture to culture.  I go to Germany a lot and they're crazy about privacy.  But then I go to a sauna in Germany and it's coed and naked.  And that's opt in.  But that's why.  And they care.  They care.  They care about the privacy of everything except the private parts.  Right.  So the privacy of their private parts doesn't matter.  Right.  But to us, that seems kind of loony.  But everybody's different in that way.  And it's hard to come up with structures here.  But I think that that the risk we have here is that we're going to have this magnificent  new social connected world and we're going to let these edge cases make a shut down into  our cocoons again.  That'd be a tragedy, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think there will be a middle ground.  One of the things we're talking about lunch today, actually, is, you know, this idea that  South by Southwest knows where you are.  So we're talking about Foursquare and Gawalla and that a lot of us that there, you know,  there were three women at the table and we were all saying, like, yeah, I'm totally not  comfortable with it.  Like, I don't I don't want to use Foursquare because I'm afraid I'm going to turn out a  bunch of stuff that I don't know how to turn off.  And, you know, like my stance on it is I'm not going to giving anyone my coordinates  unless I need a helicopter to come and rescue me.  Like, it's just and I think that there is not.  No, I don't use it.  And I think that it's partly we talked about the possibility that to a certain extent,  there's a gender element, too.  There may be an age element and then there's also a gender element.  Like, I am way less comfortable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, she does not want to publicize where she is.  No.  How about you, Sarah?  Do you feel like that's scary?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm just really careful about who, you know, because it's a it's a two way street  on Gawalla and Foursquare.  You know, people aren't following you like they are on Twitter.  You have to be friends jointly.  You and I both have to decide.  Yes, we both want to maybe come to each other's restaurant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I never even bothered finding that out.  I just thought, well, I'll just say where I am or that or text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll text you.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you have to be mutually following to see.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I have to, you know, I'm just really careful about who I I what I tell myself is  whoever I say is my friend in Foursquare is somebody that I would like to show up at  the bar that I check into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Good rule.  You know, because they may because I'm offering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I'm kind of offering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think that's really what the debate about is about, which is levels of control.  It's not about private versus public.  It's about how much do you want to make public and to whom?  Because there are certain people that I do want to make it public to.  And that's what Foursquare is about.  You know, you're doing it when you do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's really the big issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes.  Yeah.  Is something being turned on that you didn't know was turned on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, in defense of Facebook in that switch, and I don't know the details very much.  And my son was talking about Jake was last night, but they were actually giving you  more controls when I did that.  This whole argument that they made everything public to everyone isn't quite the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They gave you more controls, but all of it.  They made everything more granular.  And if you had not made any changes to your default privacy settings, all of those  granular privacy settings defaulted to everyone.  So things that were previously available only to your friends, because that was the  default setting, suddenly became available to everyone.  And then a lot of people, I mean, believe me, I have found out a lot of things from  people's photos because they don't know that like you've got to change the settings,  not just for the photos that you upload, but also your mobile uploads.  Like those might still be available to everyone.  Like this set is a separate setting.  So the settings are actually so granular now that there's a lot of stuff that you  might not even realize is still available to everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's interesting because Mark Zuckerberg himself got bit by this.  When that change happened, all of his photos suddenly became public.  He said, oh, that's no problem.  Except I noticed he pulled quite a few of them back after that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He didn't want to end up like the life lock guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did he get hacked?  The life lock guy?  Oh, several times.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is my social.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Like looking at strangers photos on Facebook is a good way to spend a Friday night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's so sad.  See, if you guys use Foursquare, you wouldn't have to be alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, what's too far for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ah, that's a good question.  I don't know.  I haven't, I mean, I mean, I allowed people to follow my body parts last night at  Dignation.  I don't know.  You're probably asking the wrong person.  Exactly.  We're, we're having fun.  This is our Twitter special from South by Southwest, which has been a really amazing  event so far.  Jeff Jarvis is here.  He's one of the hosts of our show this week in Google, which is heard Saturday  afternoons on the Twitter network.  And of course, you can subscribe to that in iTunes.  We actually have a theory that people, because it's a Saturday show, maybe as many  people, it's actually a very well listened to show, but maybe not as many people are  listening to it as subscribing to it because it comes out Saturday.  So we're thinking maybe people have lives.  They have lives.  Maybe we should just push it out Monday instead.  Anyway, we're going to take a look at that.  But I'd love to hear what you think about that.  Also with Sarah Lane, the great Sarah Lane, who is of course, a former host of this  week and fun, but a longtime tech TV producer and host on G4 Tech TV as well.  Molly Wood from Buzz Out Loud, Tom Merritt from Buzz Out Loud also, and Molly's new  rant column, which is cnet.com slash Molly dash rants.  I memorized that.  I know.  Well, that's what I do on a Friday night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's an annoying URL.  So thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you ran into the about the URL yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That might be a good rant.  I'm doing Acta next and then I'll get to the act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't get me started.  One of the other things Dana Boyd said in her speech was that even though Buzz did  nothing technologically wrong in their launch, she said tech from a technological  point of view, they was an opt in thing.  They kind of explained what they were doing.  She said, and yet it was quote a complete disaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Her point was brilliantly simple, which was they mixed the private and the public.  Your expectation on email is that it is private and suddenly not understanding this  new paradigm that Google lived under.  Zap.  There you are.  And within Google, it was badly tested because within Google, public and private  are intermingled.  It's your company.  And so it just didn't work for the rest of us at all.  I think she was very right about that.  I think that's the, for a lot of reasons mixing it with Gmail just messed it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why did they not beta Google Buzz when they beta everything else in some cases for years?  Exactly.  And they just threw this one right out.  Inside Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which was a huge mistake, obviously, because Google engineers have different needs than  we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's more than just the beta process.  It's also the expectation that we have out here that says, oh, okay, they know it's not  done yet.  All right, I can yell about this.  And that's the problem by not going beta.  I think it was quite foolish of them not to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to take a little bit of a break and come back with more.  We'll swap some people in.  Jeff, it's been great seeing you.  Thank you for being here.  We really appreciate it.  Come to our meat dinner.  We're going to do you and Jake, please come to have snarf with us after the show.  We're going to have a little party.  In fact, you know, I might turn the live streaming rig on for that.  Yeah, I should.  Meat cam.  I want to surf meat.  Meat cam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's like Austin in a nutshell.  It's been my experience.  It's meat and booze.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Meat gone wild.  It's a meat up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a meat up.  Says Robert.  Hey, hey, Robert.  It's a tomato.  Robert, get Robert back.  Because sit down for a second.  Because after I do the course, I want to ask you about the Chevy Volt because you drove  the new electric car from Chevy.  Can you talk about that?  All right, come around.  I'm just going to do a commercial for Audible.  And when we come back, Robert will join us.  Also, Mark Millian is here from the Los Angeles Times and Shwood.  And he perpetrated a grand hoax last night, which apparently was a grand success.  We'll find out about that in just a little bit.  Before we do, though, I want to mention our friends at audible.com, a great place to get  your audio books.  In fact, I don't even know why they need to advertise.  I think it's the only place to get your audio books anymore, at least online.  But what a great don't say that.  No, they need to advertise.  They need to advertise more.  What a great place to go.  Audible saved my life when I had that long commute to a tech TV.  And now I listen to Audible books whenever I'm in the car at the gym, whenever I'm  cooking dinner, anytime that I need to or would like to read.  I was just talking to Francine Hardaway yesterday, who's also an Audible fan, and she  said, I had kind of stopped reading because my life was too busy and Audible helped me  rediscover books.  I think that's one of the things Audible does really, really well.  It gets you turned on to reading.  Now, I know that, Tom, you do a podcast with Veronica called Sword and Laser.  And I know you also, whenever you do a book on a book, you know, sci fi book  podcast, you do try to look for those books on Audible before you say buy the paper  version. Do you prefer paper or plastic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually the thing that I prefer the most is electronic with text to speech.  You know, you listen to the Kindle.  What is wrong with you?  You can't get it. You can't do it anymore.  They turn it off. Yeah.  So, you know, the thing I like about audiobooks is that you know how much time you need  to set aside to get the book done, because not that it's a burden, but when you're doing  book clubs, you need to you need to get it done at a certain time.  So it's really good for scheduling.  We're doing The Windup Girl right now by Paolo Bacigalupi, which is available on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Audible. And tell me about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is it? It's set in a not too distant future where the main character is a  calorie man because it's getting harder and harder to grow food.  And so there's a lot of genetic manipulation and copyright battles over over the genes  that make food. And so, you know, I don't want to give too much away before we get  into it. But yeah, it's a it's a it's a great read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I you know, I'm listening to Demon right now because on your recommendation and  I really am loving it.  It's even better than I thought. I really am digging it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really good. A lot of that stuff we're talking about, an augmented reality shows

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  up in that. Yeah, it's he's Daniel Suarez really obviously is a geek.  In fact, I'm surprised he's not here because he just he obviously is into this stuff.  All right. Well, let's make the wind up girl our pick of the week from Paolo Bacigalupi.  It is 19 hours and 34 minutes.  You're going to get value for dollar there.  It's a long book. And you can get it for free by going to audible.com  slash twit to actually get two books.  So why don't you get that and Demon?  And one of the great things about listening to these books is now you can participate  with Sword and Laser and you can join their conversation at is it the Sword and Laser  dot com is that? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the sword. Well, actually, no, the Sword and Laser is our email address.  Sword and laser dot com is the URL sword and laser dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And don't go to sword and laser pointer dot com.  That's a whole different thing. Don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, unless you need laser point the wind up girl Paolo Bacigalupi,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  make that your pick. You can get it for free by going to audible dot com slash twit to  actually when you go there, you're going to sign up for the platinum account, which I  recommend Francine.  I was talking to her. She said I sent for the gold account and I wish I'd sign up for  the platinum account because I keep buying more books.  Get two books a month. Really, you'll be listening to my promise.  You audible dot com slash twit to we thank them so much for their support of this week  in tech. I'm going to I'm going to add that to my my cart right now.  That's great. So hello there to Mark Millian from the Los Angeles Times.  Great to see you, Mark. Thanks for joining us.  Also to Mr. Brian Brushwood of the Scam School Show on revision three in our own  NSFW on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It was like NSFW live last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was awesome last night.  Look, what is that?  You have an NSFW sticker or pass?  What is that, Robert?  Stickers. Get that microphone in front of your face because I wanted to ask you about  the vault. You and I drove the vault today, the Chevy vault, the new electric car.  Did you guys drive the vault yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Anybody? How the hell did they get us up at seven?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's kind of mean, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Any of you ever drive the vote?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no. You are sure they get us up at seven thirty in the morning to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was there. I was there at ten.  So it's an electric car which Chevy is going to be delivering.  It's the first electric car since the EV1.  So it's been quite a long time since Detroit's made an electric car.  I mean, Tesla's electric car, but this is a Detroit electric car.  Well, it's not just electric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's electric that drives for 40 miles on electricity.  But once you go over 40, it switches to gas where the gas engine charges the battery.  It's not a hybrid. The gas doesn't power the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It charges the battery so you can keep going.  So it's kind of an unlimited or a much longer distance.  They didn't give us a total distance or maybe they did a few hundred miles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, they said you could drive it forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Long as you just fill the gas tank.  Yep. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's actually my biggest fear with the electrics is getting halfway out.  And it's exactly because it takes a long time for it to charge.  They say how long it takes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you have a 120 volt AC, it takes about eight or nine hours.  Yeah. 240, which many people do because of their electric dryers and so forth.  It takes about three hours.  And it has some smart technology.  It had it for one thing. It had it as an iPhone and a droid app, which I think is very, very cool.  You can drive the car with it. You just sort of turn left and right.  No, you can turn it off. Accelerometer.  It's like that Hummer and Demon that you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You can turn the car on. You can get it ready for you because if you're in cold climate, you can get the car warm for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Or here in Texas, turn on the AC.  Turn on the AC? Yeah, it's hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, I think that's going to be a very big thing that people are not thinking about is, you know,  it's nothing to heat in a gas vehicle because the engine is generating a ton of heat.  When you're heating an electric vehicle, it's taking it right out of the battery.  Oh, wow.  They even made kind of a point about climate control is kind of an issue on a battery driven car.  I don't know what it is on the Tesla, but I'm sure the Teslas do better in California where you don't have those extremes of heat and cold.  One of the things they said is we turn the seat heaters on because it turns out that it's much more efficient to heat the seat than to heat the car.  So they prefer heat heating the seat.  They have like gloves built into the...  Yeah, that's what you're going to need. Yeah.  I think it's I think it's great that they're doing it.  And it was fun to drive. It was a nice car.  It was great. Lots of torque.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I got told to slow down in it.  Did you? Oh, yeah.  I was squealing the tires around the around the s turns and they said, hey, they came out and yelled at me.  Really? Yeah.  Were you alone?  No, there was somebody in the car with me. She didn't care.  She didn't mind, but the other guy.  And I assumed it was like car and driver test track.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, we were in a deserted shopping mall.  That was a little weird because we got in the cab to the shopping mall.  The driver said, well, it's closed. What's that?  Shopping malls close on Sunday in Texas?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'd be the first I've heard of anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's bizarre. Anyway, it was a closed down shopping mall and we were in the parking lot there.  They combed it off.  That was kind of fun because we could really step on it.  And it has some good pickup.  They have a sport mode that gives you better torque.  It was a little hesitant.  Now you drive a Prius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Brand new Prius, a 2010 Prius.  It's better on pickup than the Prius.  It's also a little bit quieter because it's only electric for most of the time.  I never heard the gas engine kick in.  It's amazing.  Yeah, so it's all electric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does it have a little noise maker on the front so you don't run into people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They have a pedestrian mode.  So it's not quite a horn, but it's a little...  No kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Because if you hit the horn, people go, whoa!  Dude, I've wanted that for years, like a polite version of the horn.  That's what it is.  It's a polite horn.  And you need a third one to play like Cucaracha.  You can mod it to do that.  Oh, okay.  The hackers will do...  When do you need that?  Wait a minute, how about ringtone horns that you just load up?  Horn tones.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Quick, I'm registering it.  Horn tones.  Horntones.com.  That was at CES like 2004 or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember that.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, it's funny because the software is only 65% finished for the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's what I want to do is drive a car in beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's why they had us do it at the shopping mall.  It's not street legal yet.  It hasn't been approved to be driven by a non-employee on the street yet.  And that's why we had to drive it off in the parking lot.  But yeah, you know, the hacker...  These things are all computer programmed now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't believe somebody has already got horntones.com, horntones.net, and horntones.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Definitely pornography.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's a thing.  That's horny tones.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are you worried...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, you drive a Prius.  Are you worried about sudden acceleration?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, I was talking to Guy Kawasaki about this this morning.  And, you know, let's be real.  There's been, what, 50 deaths in 10 years that could be attributed.  And it's not to the Prius.  There is a horntones.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It says the one and only MP3 enabled vehicle horn.  Yes!

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That is awesome.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So there's been 50 deaths, supposedly, that could have been caused by some sudden acceleration  problems on Toyota's...  That's a lot.  50s in a lot.  Over the last 10 years.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Only five a year.  Well, I feel better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's 40,000 people a year who die in cars in the United States.  This is a statistical anomaly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You think this is this year's Summer of the Shark, where it's just like they're on the  brow, Toyotas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think we as humans don't have a good way to measure risk to us.  Yes.  We get scared of flying in a plane, which is thousands of times more safe than driving  a Toyota to the airport.  Right.  And we don't have a good way of...  Humans don't measure risk very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That is partly Toyota's fault, actually, in this case.  Absolutely.  Because if they had handled it better, it could have just been like a service...  It really did.  ...a service recall instead of having to become...  They sounded like they just totally rolled over.  They just biffed it, and they ignored it, and they tried to sweep it under the rug,  and then they ended up having to do a full-scale recall, which is a total overreaction,  and now they're having to do all kinds of recalls on just stupid stuff,  but it's really... it's their own marketing fault.  I agree.  Yeah.  It's a PR problem.  I'm not saying you're totally not going to die in your Prius, but they also totally...  Well, I actually love...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You might for other reasons.  I actually love having a Prius now because people get out of my way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could accelerate it any moment.  I mean, if you look at this vault, I guess fly-by-wire cars are the future.  I presume this is all software, this car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And that's really the hard thing is how do you know that there's a bug or not?  Right.  Steve Wysenach and I have been talking about this because we both have the same car,  and he thinks that he has a bug in his car with the cruise control,  which you have to turn on, by the way, and it's always over-rideable,  and he told me how to reproduce his problem.  I've tried it more than 500 times.  I can't reproduce it.  Using his own technique to reproduce the bug.  But can you reproduce it in his car with you driving?  Have you tried that?  Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he won't let Toyota look at his car,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  and no journalist has ever filmed him doing it.  And the way you talk with him, because he says it happens at 61, 71, or 81 miles an hour,  I know how the switch increments.  It increments...  If you tap it up, it increments one mile per hour.  If you hold it, it increments five miles an hour.  And he also, when you drive, he's like,  And he also, when you interview him,  he says he doesn't look at the right number on the right side,  which is the top speed that the cruise will ever go.  He says, I can't see that number, and I don't care about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Are you accusing this of being a user error type thing?  I think there's some...  Dude, we all know it's a user error.  Come on.  Seriously, what does he know about technology?  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm not sure, because maybe his switch is sticky,  maybe his switch has a bug, maybe there is a bug,  but I haven't been able to reproduce it,  and I have tried more than 500 times.  I've put 13,000 miles on my car already since July.  I drive a lot, and I drive a lot on freeway,  and I use the cruise control 80% of the time.  I've never had a problem with it.  You're saying it's PebPass.  PebSkab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  PebSkab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The problem exists between steering column and bucket seat.  Ha!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yours is better than mine.  I'll let you go with mine.  We were both along the same lines here.  Well done, Merritt.  Well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I don't really blame Wise.  I don't know if Wise is having really the problem,  and he's punking the meteor or whatnot.  I don't know.  I assume he's having the problem.  Why won't he let anybody else do it?  But I blame the media for not renting the car  and trying it out.  I blame the media for not forcing their way into his car  and filming him have this problem.  And I blame the media for not understanding  the technology that's going on.  And it's not just the media.  The National Highway Transportation Safety  Administration doesn't have a single software engineer  on their staff.  So how are they able to understand  the kinds of complex issues that these cars are going to have?  My car has radar that follows automatically  the car in front of it.  This is all computer controlled,  and it's the first step along the road  to getting a fully automatic car  that you just punch in an address,  and it goes there.  Totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I wonder if it's the kind of thing,  since there is so much software,  I wonder if it's the kind of thing  you could go in and just get a flash upgrade  to start adding increments that bring us closer

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to that point in time.  That's not good flashing cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, we're close to having user-upgradable cars.  We shouldn't have that very soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The Prius we have does have a problem with braking.  If you have an emergency stop,  the brakes feel weird.  And people say they've had problems with that.  They've actually just upgraded the software  so that the brakes work differently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But you still have to bring it into the dealer, right?  How long until you just hook it up to your Wi-Fi  and it's fixed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it's the standard plug  that gets you into the computer.  People are hacking Priuses all over the place.  I have it by Ford Sync via USB,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so you could do it.  I think there's some real nervousness about liability.  And talking about PEDCAC,  I put the wrong BIOS in my car  and now it drives backwards.  It's not a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ford very cleverly in the last couple weeks  came out with a big press release  announcing that they're basically doing  both hardware and software firewalling  in their vehicles so that any kind of corruption  that happens to the computer systems  that operate the car cannot reach  the mechanical portions of the car.  And it was very good timing on their part,  like extremely savvy media,  to say in the wake of all this Toyota stuff,  we're totally locking down our systems,  but it's also really something  that kind of needs to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's their corporate bias.  I asked Alan Mullally  if Ford's ever going to make an autonomous vehicle.  He said, unequivocally, absolutely not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now, why is that?  I bet they are going to.  You can't...  Never is a long time, okay?  I could say never in 10 years,  because that's pretty clear,  but 100 years from now,  give me a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not even the Volvo V70  is like two iterations away  from being a self-driving vehicle.  Is it really?  There is so much driver control in those cars.  Which is developed by Ford, by the way.  Yeah, exactly.  There was a Mercedes, actually,  that was demoed in Geneva  that's the closest thing  I've seen yet to auto driving.  I mean, it was just the driver controls  in that system are remarkable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The BLIS system, is your car a BLIS?  Because the BLIS system,  that's from Volvo, Ford.  No.  It's the system that lets you  park the car automatically.  I have that.  And it auto-detects people on your side  and will not let you swerve into the lane  when there's somebody there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have a camera in the Prius  that looks at lane markers,  and if you start going into the lane  it beeps at you and nudges you back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And pretentions the seat belts, too,  which I thought was a little creepy.  Well, that's if you're about to hit somebody,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  which has happened twice in my car.  If you're about to hit somebody,  the radar system says,  oh shit, my car is going to get wrecked.  And it prefires the brakes,  it grabs you on the seat belt.  You feel the seat belt go boom.  It pretentions the seat belts.  And that wakes you up  and makes you look ahead, too.  And when you touch the brakes  it really is hypersensitive.  This is one thing that was amazing  and that was a major disappointment  with the Chevy Volt Leo  was that they didn't put these  radar systems into that car.  And if you interview the guys at Ford  who built the Taurus 2010,  Taurus, it has all these systems  that use radar to warn you  that you're about to hit something  or it helps you back out of a stall.  It has radar facing sideways.  So if you're backing out of a parking garage  and you can't see around a big van  or something,  as you back up,  the car has some radar sensors in the back  that sense if a car is coming toward you  and beeps at you and says stop.  It's really, really magical stuff  that is really safe.  It helps avoid accidents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's going to be how it happens.  Where eventually we choose to give up control  and it's always going to be optional.  But we got used to cruise control.  We're getting used to radar assist.  We're getting used to seat belts  that hold you down.  And it's just going to be  one thing after another until  pretty much it's like,  I just flip the switch.  Just hold me down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't even know  if it'll be a flip switch.  I think we'll just suddenly  look around one day and realize,  you know,  we're not doing much in this car anymore.  They just add options.  Hey, you know what hasn't happened lately?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  People dying.  You know,  it's like to me,  it can't happen fast enough.  It's like we're not good drivers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If your car actually prevents people  from tailgating,  then they won't run into the back of you  if a dog runs in front of the car.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, it's like boiling a frog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stories like Toyota set that back  in the public mindset though.  They kind of don't want  to put that control back  into the hands of a machine.  When people are already unsafe,  like we were talking about earlier,  unsafe with handing over their life  to a faceless but professional pilot  of an airplane,  they're not going to want to give it  to an automobile.  A robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The same battle goes on  in the cockpits of airplanes.  There's a real distinction  between how the Airbus and the Boeing  allow you to fly a plane.  The Airbus will not  let a pilot make a mistake.  But the pilots who fly  for United said,  we are not going to allow  Boeing to do this  because we want the ultimate control.  So on a Boeing,  you can put it into a fatal stall  because the software will not  override the pilot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I would love to be a fly on the wall  at that meeting.  It's like,  explain to us why you need the ability  to put your plane into a fatal stall.  Well, you never know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is that scenario in Star Trek?  It's the Kobayashi-Maru scenario.  You never know  when you're going to need to take control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they need to go in  and reprogram the plane?  Yes.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's interesting.  Also, playing with the radar,  right now there are blind spots  in the radar.  If somebody cuts me off  about a foot in front of my car,  the radar can't see it.  And it actually can let you  accelerate right into the car.  That's easy to fix though.  Well, it just needs more sensors,  which cost...  These sensors are, you know,  phased array sensors,  which are probably a few hundred dollars  and they're pricey.  And the more of them you put in the car,  the more software you have to write  and the more testing you have to do  for the lawyers and et cetera.  But there are some blind spots  and so it doesn't work everywhere.  And it can't prevent all accidents yet.  You know, so...  Robert, thank you for coming back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I appreciate it.  I did want to talk a little bit about that  and I forgot to ask.  Both of the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All the companies that are playing with this stuff  is really cool.  By the way, I love the display.  Did you love the display?  Beautiful display.  It's like an iPad display  in your dashboard  and it has really beautiful color  and a lot of information  about what's going on in the car.  I think you can see that  in all cars now.  I mean, that's a great thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In all cars now.  I mean, that's really where cars are going.  And Ford's already announced basically  they're going to have an app store.  You know, everybody sees these apps  taking off on cell phones.  They're going to put apps everywhere,  including your car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  One thing I was talking  with the software guys there  was I can't wait for the day  when they start using the Foursquare data  that we're putting in.  You know, you're driving down the street  and your friends all love this restaurant  that we're going to for dinner tonight.  Why doesn't it warn you  and say, hey, there's a great restaurant  down here or something  that we all have decided  that's important for our friends  to know about this place?  Or Waze.  Have you played with Waze?  It's an iPhone app, W-A-Z-E.  It's a crowd-sourced traffic app.  So if I see an accident happen  right in front of me,  I can report it on my iPhone  or on my Android phone.  Well, that could warn everybody else.  Don't go down the street  because it's going to be bad.  I installed that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but you need the network effect  to make that work, right?  Everybody has to use it.  You're all alone in Petaluma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's no accidents.  It's okay here.  Anybody wants to know?  Thank you, Robert Scowell.  Are you all texting that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  while you're driving?  Yeah.  That's good.  Just saying.  Foursquare thing that Robert

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  was just talking about  actually isn't that far out.  It was just that a panel  that Dennis Crowley,  the founder of Foursquare,  was giving.  And he was talking about  how their next step  in addition to making  some actual money  is to take all of this data  they're getting from their users  and giving it back  in a meaningful way.  Like what your friends are recommending  and making that more Yelp-like  and more usable.  It's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's exactly what Twitter says  and all of these social media companies say.  We're aggregating data.  We know it's got some value  and someday we'll figure out  what the hell we could do with it  to make money on it.  We'd have more of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  data mining available by now.  Now it's even harder to go back  and find tweets from a year ago  and the real-time search  doesn't go nearly as far back  as it used to  back when Samiz was doing it.  You've got to pay.  Yeah.  Maybe that's part of it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but also I wonder if this privacy thing  we talked about at the beginning  of the show also might be some of it.  People are also a little bit  more concerned about  the privacy implications.  Who owns this?  Do you own your tweets?  Who owns these tweets?  I think Twitter has come about fair and square  that we own the tweets, right?  Yeah.  So now what do they do?  That kind of blew that a little bit.  We're going to take a break.  Come back with more.  Mark Millian is here  from the Los Angeles Times.  Brian Brushwood of Scam School.  Great to see you, Brian.  And of course, Tom and Molly  from Buzz Out Loud.  You're watching a special edition  of Twitch from South by South.  We're going to be talking  about the privacy implications  of Twitter and Twitter.  We're going to be talking  about the privacy implications  of Twitter and Twitter.  We're going to be talking  about the ambiguity

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I used them for a  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I  yeah  that's  yeah  yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah  in fact  young guys  for themselves  it's both  I think that's one of the things  I'd like to make clear  it's not a blogging platform  it's a website hosting package  that includes some amazing software  templates that just to die for  the ability to customize  as much as you want  or are capable of  I mean if you're a CSS or JavaScript guru  go right at it  if you just want to be able to drag and drop  the width of your  of your site's columns  you can do that too  or you can just stick with the existing templates  they're really beautiful

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  you know it's funny you mentioned the CSS stuff  allows somebody like me  who knows just enough to insist to want to manage my site myself  but to hire somebody to put together  a killer looking site using all the custom CSS  it's like the scam school site or my schwood.com  actually I love the layout  I never could have put that together  I don't know  are you on Squarespace too?  oh yeah yeah yeah  oh my god  squarespace  and then  but now every time I have a new item to add  it's super easy  I drop it in  I link stuff in  and whenever  you know from time to time  I'll come up with idiotic publicity stunts  and then when the traffic hits  you know it's all scalable  I don't have to worry about the big effect

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's another great feature  we don't talk enough about that  they use a virtual private server technology  based on Java  that means that when there is bandwidth needs  it's very instant  and you never really run out of bandwidth on this thing  and it starts at eight bucks a month  but I'm going to let you try it for free  if you go to squarespace.com  slash twit  you can try it free for two weeks  import all your data  from your blogger  your movable type  your type pad  or your wordpress blog  it just imports the data  it will export it back out  so you're not trapped there  but you can try it absolutely free for two weeks  take a look at the statistics package  the incredible iPhone app  that makes it so easy to post  I could go on and on  and the free is for reals free

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  they don't ask you for a credit card or anything  you just give them an email  and then after two weeks  that's when you know  that they know they've got something good  where it's like  there are no hooks at all  it's like no seriously  just try a little bit  first one's free  squarespace.com slash twit

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we will give you 10% off  if you use the twit coupon code  when you sign up  but it starts at $8  so 10% off is like 80 cents a month  I don't think it's really

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  and that's for the lifetime  that's for the lifetime  forever

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  forever 10% off  you know this ad copy better than I do  I know a thing or two about squarespace  I didn't know that  really

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'm just like his coding  no no no  I'm doing my best to not  that's very good  what is your code  scam school  you can use that if you want

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you choose who you like better  squarespace  we don't really care

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  you guys should have a meat off later

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we will  okay  whoever eats the most

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  okay  you know what  this is all wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not going to talk out loud anymore  it's not all good in my head  very loud

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  very fast  and this is why we don't have  autonomous vehicles  squarespace.com slash twit  give it a try  I think you'll like it  now we're all here  we're not reading the New York Times  or anything  but front page of the business section  of the New York Times  Apple's spat with Google  is getting personal  they're talking about how Eric Schmidt  who was once friends with Steve Jobs  is now  you know  I mean these guys are going  at each other's throats  with this lawsuit against HTC  which was  you know  kind of a proxy for Google  in this case  Google  doing things like putting  multi-touch in the droid  after  or Android  the Nexus One I should say  after  saying they wouldn't do it  it's quite a battle  the Times interviewed  two dozen industry watchers  silicon droids  two dozen industry watchers  silicon valley investors  and current and former employees  at both Apple and Google  most of whom requested anonymity  and  they say this offers an unusually  vivid display of enmity  and ambition between Jobs  and Schmidt

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  which is so weird  because when the iPhone  launched  I mean it was covered  in Google  dripping with Google  all over it  that's exactly right  Schmidt was up on stage  he was on stage

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah  what happened  what went wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jobs kind of  almost seems like  he feels betrayed  by Android  it seems like  you look at that HTC suit  and the vast majority  of these patents  that they're calling out  are software patents  they're Google Android patents  there's multi-touch  nothing to do with hardware  nothing to do with hardware  really is very much divorced  from HTC  in the most part

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but why didn't they go after Google  why didn't they sue Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  would you sue Google  I  I mean not seriously though  would you start with Google  you totally start with HTC  and then you get some precedent  established  and you move on down the line

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and it's a soft underbelly  because you can keep the handsets  off the market  you don't really have to worry  about Android so much

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  it's really personal  and you have to wonder  about how much of it  might be like  how long Schmidt  sat on that board  just kind of harvesting ideas  and then going off  and putting out phones  that really look the same  it's got to chop them  yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  he says, Jobs says  we didn't enter the search business  they entered the phone business  make no mistake  Google wants to kill the iPhone  we won't let them

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean patents are very much  a wall that companies put up  they  when you look at the Nokia suit  Nokia came after Apple  and then Apple counter sued  because they have their own patents  that Nokia is stepping on  so  I mean  maybe  Apple's patent lawyers  looked and said  well  I don't think HTC  really has anything on us  so let's go for them  I'm sure that  Google has some patents  that they could easily  have thrown back  in Apple's face  yeah  yeah, well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's usually what you do  in a lawsuit like this  these suits go away  because you say  well if you're going to sue us  well we have some patents  we could sue you with

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm curious what would have happened  if Schmidt hadn't been forced to leave  Apple  the board  yeah, the Apple board  because it seems like  he left  then all this Android stuff  started to become a problem  as if  Jobs thinks  or maybe other people at Apple think  he took a bunch of stuff he knew  that he shouldn't have known  with him  we don't like it  would they still be  going after all of this stuff  because honestly  I don't believe he did  I believe all that stuff  was probably already in development  it's pretty common stuff  and you want to make it  look like that  so is it just  could it just be sour grapes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they quote one anonymous  Silicon Valley venture capitalist  who says it's World War III  amazing animosity  is motivating  two of the most powerful  people in the industry  this is emotional  this is the biggest  ego battle in history  it's incendiary  Sunday, Sunday, Sunday  Jinx  I think it must have been  Cali Kanna said that  don't you think  that sounds like Jason right there  anonymously  yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  yeah, it sounds very personal  and I think that what you said  about the patent war  Mark is another part of the reason  that they didn't name Google  in the lawsuit at first  like they can name HTC now  and then they don't have to  do the patent trading  with Google  and Google can't do much  right now they're sitting  on the sidelines  with a bunch of patents going like  we have to your location  you bastards

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  they still issued their statement  and then they jumped in there  like we're behind HTC  yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and Schmidt said  I think Jobs is the best CEO  in history  but  according to again  these interviews  you've been behind  I'm sure somewhat involved  Mark  at the Times  in these kinds of stories  they get a lot of  deep background stuff  nobody wants to go on record  but they've got  quote after quote  after quote  there's obviously  a lot of people  who think something's going on  yeah  I'm sure  they can't name names though  according to  some of these interviews  many of the meetings  between Apple and Google  started turning confrontational  very early on

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I love that language  because I just picture  two guys in suits  they're like pulling on  they're like no  I'm going to get it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  according to people  familiar with the discussions  Mr. Jobs often accused  Google of stealing  iPhone features  Google executives  said that Android's features  were based on  long-standing ideas  already circulating  in the industry  and some Android  prototypes predated  the iPhone  at one particularly  I'm reading from  the New York Times here  in 2008  two years ago  on Google's campus  Mr. Jobs angrily told  Google executives  that if they deployed  a version of  multi-touch  he would sue  two people briefed  in the meeting  described it as

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  fierce and heated  what exactly is  their ownership of  multi-touch  because the technology  has been around  20 years

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  it's a sucky weak patent  I think  it's an interface patent  largely right  they don't necessarily  they don't have a lot  of technology patents  the ones that are  so fuzzy and annoying  like how you do it  so not the technology  behind the fact  that you can swipe  to unlock  but the actual gesture  of swiping to unlock  it's like they patented  a version of  click and drag

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  another one of those  patents is  if you click  to delete an item  then the screen  rearranges itself  so that there's  not a hole  that's a patent  we're going to leave a hole  there's no question  it seems like there's

Transcript:  no question that  Apple is furious

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that Google came out  with something  that looked like  the iPhone  and they did

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and Google has scooped  them in some cases  the AdMob acquisition  is one thing  Apple reportedly  was offering  $600 million  for AdMob  the mobile advertising agency  Google snagged them  that mustn't feel  too good  AdMob had agreed  to a 45 day  no shop provision  while Apple was  conducting due diligence  but after  Apple let the 45 days pass  Google snapped them up

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  so it sounds like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the anger  existed before  Schmidt left the board  and as soon as he left  that's what this article  became public  Steve could stop  being nice about it  in public  one of the most  interesting things

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  about this is that  Google almost  never picks sides  I mean  for example  Google has somebody  on the HTML5 stat  which is the biggest  challenger to  Adobe's video  stance on the web  but they're also  partnering with  Adobe to  figure out how  to improve  Adobe's video product  in all of these  different sections  they try and  be this like  nice guy  we're not going to pick  one side  one team or the other  but it's clear  that there's something  brewing between  Apple and Google  and that Google  is taking a stand  and they're behind  HTC and  they have a position  in mobile

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is there a clear winner here  who wins in an  Apple Google cage match

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  well that's the weird part  is how do you extract  the two  I mean it's like  could Google just not  be supported on the iPhone  I mean could they just  yank out of  all the Google-ness

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in there or  well remember we heard  rumors I don't know  if they were rumors  or true I'm starting  to think maybe it was true  that Apple was talking  to Microsoft about  putting Bing on the  iPhone instead of Google  wow  that would be a huge blow  yeah  and now I believe it  I didn't believe it  at the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought oh that's not  going to  that's like that scene  in Pirates of Silicon Valley  when Bill Gates shows up  on the screen  with you know Microsoft  office for the Mac  you know you see  that was creepy wasn't it  it's almost unthinkable

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it damages Apple  doesn't it  what the whole conflict  the lawsuits damage  Apple I think  I think so

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think it damages  the reputation  and it also  you know it's like  what do they expect  do they expect that  everyone would just stand back  while the iPhone just ran away  and I want to know  what they've been doing  with their lead  for the last two years  because it's like  I'm looking at  the droid  I'm looking at the  the Google Nexus One

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and it's like  what are you guys doing  Apple  talking to Steve Jobs  and he's like  I'm looking at  the Macintosh  he said we had a 10 year lead  on Microsoft  and we let it slip away  and in 10 years  they came out with Windows 95  and it was all over  he was very clear  that you cannot  let these technology  leads slip  you've got to stay ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  it's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean I'm looking  oh no go ahead  I was just going to say  you can't sit back  and rely on your patent library  yeah  to keep people out of the market  and that's where it hurts them  is they start to look  really anti-competitive  because they're trying  to get injunctions  against even selling

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  maybe it's a side effect  of how monstrous  their lead was  early on  both from a technological standpoint  and from a perception standpoint  I mean they were standing  so far out of the crowd  maybe it's very attractive  to just  you know  do your profit taking  at that time  but meanwhile  it's like it's been  what almost three years now  and this is virtually identical  to what I stood in line for

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  exactly  they're having  we have to  everybody has told me  because I switched to the Nexus One  and everybody said  oh you'll switch back  when iPhone 4 comes out  well I'll be curious  still waiting to hear about it  what about iPhone 4  what is that going to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah is there an iPhone 4  is it going to be  a significant advance  I don't feel  you know  the rumor level supports  you know we don't have  crazy enough rumors  to support a decent advance  do you think that this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  a case of iPad distraction  where it takes them away  from their core focus  how many of you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ordered iPads  not me  they went  Robert Scoble  thank you very much  Robert did  I ordered four  you only ordered two  at a time  so I had my henchmen order two

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Leo we're going to have a party  April 2nd  Paul Walto store  I'll be there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  all night long  you know I don't think  there'll be lines though  because you can order  for delivery on Saturday

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  there won't be lines  but there will be parties  I'll be there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  no I  you know I don't like  to do that because  it looks like I'm  cheerleading for the device  and I don't  I really don't want to cheerlead  for the device  I ordered four because  well first of all  we have to give one to Lisa Tickle Pink  and by the way  that has succeeded beyond  my wildest dreams  in fact Lisa I think  is in love with me now  Lisa  this was a Kevin Rowe  picture out of a hat  basically  a Twitter user  who had just signed up  had three followers  had only tweeted once  and her tweet was  I hate technology  Kevin searched for that  and he found her  and we  you know because of Conan  we decided that we would do  what Conan did  he followed  what was her name  Lonely Little Toe  I can't remember  it was Lonely  I just remember  Brian Brickman  lovely button  who is now  I think at 27,000 followers  but it's a horse race  because Lisa Tickle Pink  said she wanted to  because Lisa Tickle Pink  since our show last week  in one week  has 22,677 followers  wow  and she's totally  I feel  I feel lucky  she's totally into it

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  you know what I love  I love not only that  you're doing this  but I love that you saying  that got the kind of response  as if you said  and she won the lottery  I know so you did

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  she secured cancer  she did

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  she got a lot of that  wow now she has a lot of  literal net rude replies  all the time  what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  she did it first  people were  a little mean  and now she has a lot of  friends and she's actually  really excited about it  I actually talked to her  a Kiwi radio station  brought her in  and I Skyped in  and we talked  and I apologized  and she was very nice about it  she's a design student  in Auckland, New Zealand  she's got a project  that she thinks  this actually helps promote  and she started  to really enjoy  the fact that she's got  this audience  what you're saying is  she's drunk with power now  is what you're saying  and she's going to get  an iPad  so one of those  four I ordered  will be shipped to her  immediately on April 3  and then the other one  will go to  one of her followers  will pick at random  from all of her followers  on April 3  and give an iPad  to one of them  so that counts for two of them  then one is for me  now what do you  what surprises are you hoping for  from the iPad?  well I don't think there will be many surprises

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think what's going to be surprising  to people who haven't touched it  I've held it  you held it Molly, right?  you didn't get a chance

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to touch it  you didn't get a chance  to touch it  you didn't get a chance  to touch it  you didn't get a chance  to play with it  Tom did you get a chance to play with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  no  universally though  everyone who's touched it  loves it  says they love it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's where the surprise will be  is when people get it  they go oh yeah  I get what you're saying  it's not just a blown up  iPod touch  it really is  something that happens  when that screen gets to that size  and the touch interface  it's when you get infected  by the bugs  by touching it  but we'll see  I'm not cheerleading for it  I think it's going to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  a successful product  and I hope I'm surprised  but I'm very very skeptical right now  it'll be interesting to see  we'll find out

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  my thing is that  I already have a laptop  that I'm going to bring around with me  and I write for a living  so  you're not going to write on that  yeah I'm not going to want to write  I can't use this to replace my laptop  in any scenario  when I'm watching a movie  and then I'll switch over  I'll write a blog  oh no

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  not on the screen  here's what I hope it is  is that original iPod effect  when the iPod first came out  people were  it was just clunky enough  that people were like  I don't get it  and it wasn't until it got  Svelter and more useful  and started adding  little things like games  like oh no no  and then it became  the must have thing for everyone  maybe that'll be  maybe this first generation  is just to get the ball rolling

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but I still don't think  that it's what  Apple needs to do  to maintain the iPhone  exactly  and that iPad distraction point  is very good  because even as good  as the iPad is going to be  it's not going to sell  like the iPhone did  even if it's the perfect device

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and where are the new Macs  where are the new Macbooks  we haven't seen new notebooks  they're way overdue  there's an Intel chip  that I thought Apple would jump on  the Arendelle chipset

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  you know this is  this is a mistake  I remember feeling like  Microsoft made  a decade or two ago  where it's like  you guys are too diverse  it's like I don't know  what Microsoft means anymore  it means video games

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and broken OSs  I think what  it seems clear is  Apple's moving in the consumer space  and they are less interested  and I was very worried about this  in the Macintosh  and OS X  is less compelling for them  it's not as profitable  can't control it  it's more open  there's a lot of profit to be made  in the closed ecosystem  built around an iPhone  iPod  and iPad  yeah  that's I think that's where  Apple is going to be  and I think it's a good idea  to build a computer  electronics company  so Brian tell us about  the scam

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  that you did last night  how's that going  that was quite a night

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  last night  was it there  you devil  I think it's all a bad dream  I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the Wikipedia  of world records  I got a patch  I broke a record last night  for the world's  longest crowd surfing

Transcript:  live stream  that's awesome  that's awesome  I think it's the only  crowd surfing live stream  well and that's the thing  is you can't have a record  for the only  or the first  I guess you could have  it for the only  yeah so you've got to have  a definable  aspect to it  and the standards for evidence  are you just got to have  some video  have your friend take a video  and then you can  you can get world records  so you broke some world  records last night  yes in fact I stole  Jimmy Fallon's record  for the most  drawn on mustaches  in 30 seconds  I went all  up and down the front of the line  and just  how many?  26 mustaches  in 30 seconds

Transcript:  so you mean there are people  walking around today

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  with the Sharpie mustache  yes actually  for the rest of the night  they wanted to take pictures  with me  and they had these big  dirty Sanchez  but the  but the  wait a minute

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've got to look that up

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  no you don't  you don't look that up  no

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  so the  but what happened was  is they said  we want to do something  with the URDB  you're clever creative  come up with something  and Justin  my co-host from NSFW  we started banging around  ideas  come on over here  Justin and of course  Brett Rounseville  the Amtrakr  but we got as far as like  and I remember the moment was  it was a way  it's got to be some kind of hoax  on Twitter like  we say something happens  but it didn't  and then we remembered  the whole  you know everybody  at this moment  super loves Conan O'Brien  revision 3  had just made a job offer  to Conan O'Brien  which may have been  a little bit tongue in cheek  but we said  we wanted to perpetrate  the largest  online  live event Twitter hoax ever  and have everybody  claim that Conan O'Brien  just walked out on stage  and announced that he was coming  to revision 3 right  yeah well because  if there's anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  that is going to get  just absolutely  bombed  especially when  and there's a great video  I forget who put it up  but when we're on stage  and we're telling people  and it was from the VIP  area  and they kind of swooped down  through the crowd  and you just see  all these like  these light up  almost like stars in the sky  lighting up in the ground  all through the darkened crowd  and it was trending on Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  within three minutes  it was trending on Twitter  and we had to be able to track it  so we had everyone  put the hashtag  OMG Conan in there  it was trending within  three minutes  within 10 minutes  Ryan Vance VP of revision 3  had gotten  congratulation calls  from two executives

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  the cool of the century

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  and within 15 minutes  we found a tweet out there  that said  just got off the phone  with Conan  confirmed  this is a hoax  so it's  it's insane

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  poor Conan got woken up

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  in the middle of the night  which the funniest part  about that  is that our  crazy internet hoax  we've repeated this  and said that  Conan got called  and he woke up  and that's crazy  yay  doesn't matter  it lives  we just believe  something on the internet  so it's like  this could in itself  be a hoax  and by the end of it  it was reported on  where was it

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  and CNET did  an article on the hoax  it was a lot of fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  the whole telephone game  of it  number one  half way through it  Conan was buying revision 3  and then also

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  congratulations Conan

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and I encouraged the live stream  also to participate  awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  and that was my favorite  part about it  was that people watching  and everybody in the crowd  there was nobody  who wanted to spoil the event

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  yeah  I went through it  I was just like  these jerks are telling lies  not one person  and the article  the CNET article  clearly is like  some people think  this is  not a good thing to do  well up yours  it's funny
