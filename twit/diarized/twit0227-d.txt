Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You forgot, didn't you, Jonathan? You forgot the name of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He forgot it. He forgot to call us.  Can't remember anything about my own career. That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's a sign that you're enjoying your career, I think.  Welcome to our twit holiday special, our Christmas Eve edition.  We have gathered together, uh, the same, uh, roughly the same crew we got last time.  And I'm so glad to have them all starting with Dr. Kiki who's in studio with us today.  Got Kirsten Sanford of the lovely Dr. Kirsten's Science Hour show and this week in science.  Nice to have you here.  I'm glad to be here.  I gotta give you a hat or something.  Do I?  I didn't bring a hat today.  Did you bring anything festive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, maybe Dane can help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Dane's going around with Christmas cards saying, anybody want a Christmas card?  Wait a minute, here we go. We got a hat for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll wear a Christmas card as a hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Pay no attention to the fact that it says ho ho ho on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  I don't know about this.  Wow, rough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's Merlin Mann over there.  And uh, give her a chance to respond.  Center square. I know. Well, anything you want to say now?  It does say ho ho ho. Turn it around. You can see it on the front.  Yeah.  Wait.  There we go.  See, I wasn't joking.  Ho ho ho.  Merlin Mann, it's good to see you, my friend.  Merry Christmas.  Merry Christmas is going to be Eleanor's first, well, second Christmas, first one she-

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's her first, it's her first third Christmas.  And uh, it's, it's, it's exciting. You know, now she's, she's, she does things and she moves  and she, and she, uh, you know, she wants things.  And so she's intolerable and it's, it's a perfect holiday for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, that cackle comes from the great Jonathan Colton, who is, uh, coming to us from Gitmo tonight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  Did you like-  Very, very gray and dull here, I'm sorry to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Like put like a, a 20% gray screen behind you, just like that's it. That was like intentional.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, the surprising thing is this is actually a blue wall.  I mean, it looks very gray on my screen as well. I don't know why.  It's quite blue when I look at it with my eyes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's very neutral, which is good.  Jonathan is of course a great, uh, cyber balladeer who has been gracing our,  our show for many moons now. It's so nice to see you. Happy Christmas, Jonathan. Happy Annika.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Happy Christmas to you.  Yes. Back at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And, uh, of the great John Hodgman is here. It's good to see you too, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Greetings from another part of Brooklyn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not so very far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not so very far from Jonathan Colton.  Is there some-  Where are you, Jonathan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm, I'm in the, uh, top, the top floor of my house here.  It's actually, it's my sister-in-law's apartment, if you must know.  What a grim scene that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Can you guys, since you are Brooklynites and you live there,  describe to us what Christmas in Brooklyn is like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, obviously everyone drinks egg creams all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We were talking about egg creams. Lovely, lovely things.  Yes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And, uh, you know, it's just like, um, there are a lot of street gangs  wearing top hats and tails.  And with fancy names.  And, uh-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, John, are you, are you, uh, are you going to the tree fire?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  Tree fire?  Oh, in Prospect Park, the Prospect Park tree fire?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Where they set all the trees on fire?  Yeah, it's very festive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, that sounds very festive. You can only do that once in a while though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. We're actually, you know, it's, uh, we live in the, in the Park Slope area of Brooklyn,  which is largely pagan. We have, uh, we, uh, you know, we, we, we all, um, light trees on fire.  We wear our druidic robes. Um, we, uh, we wear mistletoe garlands and we, um, honor the wishes  of children and they, they are our masters and they tell us what to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How about-  Are people still buying, are people still buying fixed gear trees? Is that something people still  do?  They call them fixies, right?  Fixie trees. Is that something people still do?  Fixies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, what is that? I don't know what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We don't have plantable trees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no, you get skinny jeans and a white belt and then you have a, you have a tree that has  the one gear and no brakes.  That's what I was thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I know. That's more Williamsburg. That's not Park Slope.  Williamsburg. Okay. Sorry. I don't know the subway stops yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's a great time of year though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. It's all, it's all wassail and human sacrifice. Very, very typical celebration.  So wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You knickerbockers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's the Dutch. Blame the Dutch. What do they, what do they do in San- now you live out in the  avenues of San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I do. I live in the, I live in the part of San Francisco where people frequently say,  are you sure that's part of San Francisco?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's so distant, so cold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You have to live in a very conservative neighborhood in the western part of town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No charm whatsoever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no, not at all. The streets are very flat and wide and there's, there's no bikes and nobody  walks. You don't really even see people. You just, you just see cars and Verizon stores.  That's pretty much it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm pretty much getting depressed by this holiday so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, it's nice. It's actually, it's a nice, it's a cool neighborhood. It's, you know,  it's one of the few San Francisco neighborhoods that still has a mix of different people that  don't look like me, that I'm kind of ruining by being here. But it's nice.  You white guys. You white guys.  Yeah. Yeah. Gentrification's roughly, you know, once you've lived somewhere for three  months, you're allowed to complain about gentrification.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that the duration? That's it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're coming.  You can do it earlier. It's not considered, you know, it's, it's better if you wait a  couple months and then you can kind of roll your eyes at the people, you know,  you know, with the donical caps showing up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  People not like us are coming. We actually have, there's in Petaluma, we have an abbreviation  L N L U.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  NLU?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  NLU, not like us. I would never use it. I would never use it, but I've heard people,  I literally have heard people use it. They're NLU. John, you have a new book. Newish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have an old book that has come out in a flexible paperback form.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is called More Information Than You Require.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And on Audible now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Indeed. Oh, yes. With Audible with, with special guest, Jonathan Colton.  I heard, yeah.  Among, among a cavalcade of stars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a huge number of people this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We got the, we got Paul F. Tompkins, the famous comedian.  Paul Rudd returns. Rachel Maddow, from the television zone, Rachel Maddow.  Wow.  And, and Mr. Dick Cavett stops by for a cameo appearance as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Among others.  Very Yale-y in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Sarah Vowell.  Sarah Vowell?  Sarah Vowell appears in the role of Chuck D from Public Enemy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She's got the voice for it.  I'm worried that she's going to get typecast with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She has the most forceful and memorable voice in rap music. That's why I cast her as Chuck D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yo, yo, yo.  Exactly.  Well, that's available on audible.com by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He had a very sweet on that. I think he did such a good job with that.  Who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you remember Sarah Vowell's rap song, Andrew Jackson was a hero to somebody never meant to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That was the radio, that's the radio version. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  My daughter is watching at home tonight, so I can't, I can't say what I.  Totally appropriate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Self-censorship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Totally appropriate. Yeah, you wouldn't want to do that.  What is, what is the tradition around the Hodgman household?  Do you open presents before Christmas Eve or do you save them all?  No, no, no.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's.  Bosh.  We may, I don't want to spoil any surprises, but there may have to be one opening pre-Christmas  and I'm not looking, this is a bad break with tradition as far as I'm concerned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We always open the crappy presents Christmas Eve. The ones from the distant aunts, the cousins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I usually make a practice not to give crappy presents.  That's a great present.  That's how I get around that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, your nephews must love you.  It seems like always the aunts and uncles gave the kind of junky stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think they're, I think my cousins, my young cousins are all getting tired of their traditional  25 iPhones. So I may have to come up with something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You get them by the case from Apple, they just kind of send them out to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. The thing with it, I have to remember to pull apart the,  the bits of plastic that hold them together or else the, the, the seagulls will choke on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, you get them in a six pack. That's convenient.  Not many.  It's very thoughtful.  Yeah.  It's very thoughtful.  Tear it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What will happen? What happens if you don't do that? I forget now.  That's right.  The seagulls get otter or something.  Something bad will happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The birds get their little noses stuck in there and birds get tangled up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They get their feet caught next to their face and yeah, it's really awful.  Yeah.  Save a bird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It also, it also makes it much more decorative for garbage island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's right. Little flex, bits of flex of plastic are better than, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like a little more texture.  Yeah.  A little more texture to garbage island.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I don't really have an agenda for tonight. I just thought it'd be fun to get,  to get you all together and sit around by the Yule log and swap stories of Christmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just purchased a, a, a Blu-ray Yule log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, hi, Def.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. I haven't seen it yet. It hasn't arrived.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's much more realistic that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. There's something about the, the old Yule log from the, you know,  televisions that had a tube in them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I like the NTSC Yule log. That's tradition to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The warmth of standard definition. It's hard to beat.  It's yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  These digital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I used to just set my television on fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The burning plastic.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah. Merlin, you do a Yule log or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We do something similar. You know, we watch things that we've downloaded from the internet.  So it's, it's a kind of, it's a kind of, yeah.  I have one thing I wanted to just mention.  YouTube blog.  YouTube blog. I mean, the thing about the socks, can I just,  just talk about this for a second?  Yeah.  Cause I'm intrigued by this. I used to go out with a woman from Germany  and no matter how much I told her about tipping in the U S she was adamant.  Oh, tannenbaum.  Adamant. Adamant.  Yeah, she was actually very Dutch West. Very tannenbaum like.  But, but no matter how much I told her about the need to tip in order for people to be  compensated, she refused. You may have known Germans like this yourself.  Now my sense is aunts and uncles are the same way.  They know that their gifts are totally lame and they keep giving it anyway.  And I don't know why. Do you have an opinion on that?  I think they know. I think they know nobody likes socks and they keep giving them anyway.  Do you think they hate children or are they just cheap?  Are socks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everybody needs socks though. I mean, unless you wear flip-flops all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Everybody needs inoculations too, but you wouldn't want to give them on Christmas day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Coat hangers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Coat hangers would be bad. That would be a crappy present.  A nice coat hanger. Well, you'll enjoy that all year.  A good wooden one would be a little...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You think it's an expression of contempt, Merlin?  I kind of do.  You think it is a funicular contempt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think it could be. My parents and my aunt and uncle would duel who could give the more  obnoxious gift. And alternately, it was like nuclear escalation. It started out with a  calliope and then moved on to a drum set. And then it was like mortars or something like that.  So I don't know. I think there's a lot of animosity in families and that's something  we should just be honest about even during the holidays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think the word would be disdain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You think disdain? I think there's a sense of humor there. It sounds like...  I think the message is...  I knew it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Should tragedy strike, child, you know that I will raise you as my own. But until that day,  just socks for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's good. Yeah.  You know what that is? That's managing an expectation and that's smart.  It's true.  Don't start thinking it's going to be Sundays and pony rides all the time because that's not  going to happen.  Not for an aunt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The thing is the gift buying is actually a very painful process and it's very hard to do well,  I think. To get a gift for someone that is the perfect gift is...  It happens once a Christmas.  I'm still shopping for your Christmas gift from last year, Jonathan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I still haven't quite gotten...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Once a decade.  Really? What will you have gotten me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm still thinking about it. I'm behind by almost exactly a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That is, I think, what will you have gotten me is almost Germanic.  And is that the past blue perfect?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm thinking that I might get you the...  I think it might be the plastic grammar person.  I think that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Jonathan, would you like some needle-nose pliers?  I have some needle-nose pliers.  I actually do need needle-nose pliers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Great gift for jewelry box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's like an O'Henry story. It's all just working out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Don't send him your bail of wire because then it'll be sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As an aunt, I'm now seriously contemplating socks for all the nieces and nephews.  Or needle-nose pliers.  Thanks a lot. That was good.  But be younger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But socks, though. If you get...  Nice socks. I think that's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You don't cop out and go for the gift card because I've been very reluctant to go with  the gift card. But the thing is the kids say that's what they want. They want the Best Buy  so they can buy the video games. And you want to be the cool uncle, so you get them an iTunes  gift certificate or whatever. But I don't know. That feels kind of crummy to me. I mean, now you  go to the Safeway and it's like they've removed pharmaceuticals and bread and it's all just out  back steakhouse and Olive Garden. I don't personally like the gift card, but I think  it's good because then the teens can enjoy things.  And they get what they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That is so weird, Merlin, because my grocery store did that too. They have an entire rack  of other people's gift cards. Like they get a kickback or something from...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, no. Totally. I think in terms of the dollars per square foot, that's got to be  giant compared to something like paper towels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I bet there is. I wonder who the company is that makes the racks of gift cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Really? They're not doing that yet? We're so far ahead of you in grocery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you seen it, Jonathan Colton?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I haven't. But grocery stores here in New York City are very different from grocery stores in  the rest of America where they have space for grocery stores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. I wouldn't know because I send my children out to do the shopping for me.  So maybe I'll ask them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How old are your kids?  Brooklyn, don't you buy everything on Etsy?  Isn't that...  That's right.  ...110 bucks and things made out of felt.  It should all be felt. Handmade. Felted combs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sewed together with yarn.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to stencil some street art for you, Jonathan.  Oh, what a lovely gift.  All I'm saying is keep an eye on the corrugated metal garage door on 9th Street in Gowanus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's for you, baby.  Because there's going to be a special holiday message for you there.  This door is for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Jon had noticed you admiring that sign that said,  No Justice, No Peace. And he made a note of it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Isn't that beautiful?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to do the same thing the Shepherds Ferry did with Andre the Giant, but I'm just  going to do it with... What's his name? George the Animal Steal. Is that right?  No, George Steal is the one we know.  George the Animal Steal is correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Any wrestler, roughly.  He's a great wrestler. That guy was a legend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What about a tribute to Captain Lou Albano, the guy with the rubber bands tied to his face?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That poor fellow passed away. Was that this year?  This was this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, it was kind of my plan to go through the year's big stories in the news,  and I think that would have to qualify.  Absolutely.  I know others have passed away this year, but Lou Albano was a special man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I became aware of him at a time when wrestling was... I got into wrestling in about 1980 or 81,  and I wasn't into WWF. I was into the other one. NWA, I guess, was it? Is that the one that I...  NWA? No, I don't think so. The Beastie Boys.  Very low rent. Lou Albano, to me, was like the Oscars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He was big shot. He was up there with Hulk Hogan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. I was more into the one with Barry Windham and Dusty Rhodes and those guys,  which is a little bit more fairgrounds kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you actually made the distinction then? You were like, I don't like this wrestling,  but I do like this wrestling?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's kind of like whether you're into American or National League, except with, you know,  K-Fabie. You get your preferences. You have a strong allegiance to these people.  It's a Joseph Campbell kind of thing, but, you know, it's a fairground.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's huge.  Did they do an All-Stars? They should do an All-Stars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a great idea. A cage match. Isn't a cage match kind of an All-Star wrestling thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess it is, but I don't know if they cross leagues.  I think they've done plenty of All-Star wrestling type things. That's WrestleMania, is it not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they should take wrestling and mix it with ice skating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, then you'd have sharp blades.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. All-Stars on ice.  It'd be harder to get away.  I don't know. It could be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And there should be a 10-foot bonfire in the middle of the ring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's called hockey, actually.  Hockey. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's called hockey.  I don't know a lot about sports, but I think that's wrestling with ice skates is hockey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think you pinpointed it as a matter of fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what they should have? High-Li on ice.  High-Li.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's good.  High-Li, that's like a tiny ball and it moves really fast, right?  It's just really fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, you have a, what do they call that? The pollote?  Yeah, you get the polluter.  It's a woven basket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's called a basket hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's like on your hand and it's curved, but I, well, it's a Cuban. Is it a Cuban game?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's wicker. It's wicker de mano.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's wicker. Wicker de mano.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, sank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, wicker de mano. And you put that on your hand and then the ball is, what is the ball called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the ball is the pollota.  The ball is the pollota?  I think so. Yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And the place where you play is the fronton. I know that.  They have these in Providence where I grew up. And Florida.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In Florida, see, so like if you watch Mad Men, you saw where the one choir was to,  highlight is going to be the next big thing. By the time I was coming up, it was already dead.  And so they were just having cheap trick concerts in 38 special.  Oh, that's sad.  Yeah. Yeah. They play at a fronton. Yeah. That's not good for anybody. I don't think.  When you're at a fronton and it's not highlight, I don't think that's a highlight for people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Was it the same time as the dog races? Did that go the same way the dog races?  The dog track?  The dog track still goes.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Greyhound racing?  Yeah.  Oh, that's sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I went to college around the corner from the dog track owned by the guy who gave Oral Roberts  the money not to get killed by God in the eighties. Do you remember that?  Wow. So it was dog track money?  Bob said God was going to kill him unless he pwned him.  He was going to go up in that tower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's some money. Don't get killed by God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So you can thank dog racing for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I would like to, Jonathan, I'm going to get you to sing a song a little bit. I know last time  we tried this, you really didn't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was unprepared. I was unprepared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Which is kind of ironic because aren't you kind of known? Isn't that your thing a little bit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Aren't I known for being unprepared? Yeah. Well, I can guarantee you that I'll make several mistakes.  Does that help?  That's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The thing is, Leo, it's usually me who's making him sing a song when he doesn't want to. So he  wasn't prepared for you or you're doing it. It's a surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Me to coerce him. That was out of nowhere. Well, I'm going to make it up to him by promoting his  Buddy's book, More Information Than You Require, on Audible.com no less.  In fact, you could get both the books. Is this the one with 700  Mole Men names? Is that what it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, the first one, of course, famously had 700 hobo nicknames in it,  which Jonathan and I performed. I read the list and Jonathan played Big Rock Candy Mountain in  the background. It was torturous for everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I can imagine. You're kind of looking like a mole man right now, actually. It's a pretty good  look. It's a good disguise. It could be his disguise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have I turned even more pallid than usual? I don't understand.  You're pixelated. You're getting pixelated.  Oh, I am. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, don't apologize. It's quite amusing.  It's been a long day, that's why.  What is a mole? Yeah, I know. I get pixelated at the end of the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I'm just a little tired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What is a mole man?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, well, the mole men, of course, are the race of highly intelligent creatures who live in caverns  and tunnels beneath the earth. They have pallid papery skin and they secrete a luminous slime  in order to see their way through tunnels and they have acidic spits so that they can carve tunnels in  solid rock. Obviously, they wear powdered wigs as well because they are, after all, mole men of

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  reason. Delegate mole men.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they are. They all wear powdered wigs and they were the ones who, they were good friends  with Thomas Jefferson and they were the ones who taught Thomas Jefferson how to write a declaration  of independence. They also invented the two dollar bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that's quite important to our history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and so there's quite a bit more than you want to know about mole men in the new book,  more information than you require, including a list of 700 mole men names, which in the audiobook  as well, we once again performed it, but we were trying to figure out how to make it even more  torturous than the first audiobook, 700 hobo names. So we decided to go ahead and record it  again, but this time we did it in front of a live audience underground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know what excerpt they're going to play. I'm just going to play an excerpt here. You could  be getting Paul Rudd, you could be getting Ricky Gervais, you could get Dick Cavett. I don't know,  you could get John Hodgman. Let's just play. This is from audible.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a wild whirlwind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is it? Do you know what excerpt they have on here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, spin the wheel. Let's find out.  Yeah.  Mimi.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's Jonathan.  Do you continue to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  this is why you got to get the audio version of this.  See, you can get it.  Right. Cause there's very little of it.  And me on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the excerpt they're using. That's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The weird thing about that, pardon me. The weird thing about Jonathan being on the excerpt is that  every time someone plays an excerpt, I get a $25 royalty. Sorry. Because it's creative commons.  Yeah. Sorry. So I get the money. That's what that means. I get the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Colton. So you might take him out for coffee sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe you'll buy me a Christmas gift. Who knows?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or paint you one.  Or give you a first.  Nose pliers.  Yeah, maybe they're waiting for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And look, an empty and this is an empty light bulb box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, how nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My new office is this empty light bulb box.  You don't need a desk. You could just write on the box.  Yeah, that's it's like, it's yeah, exactly. It's its own card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let us, I want to get Jonathan to play a little bit, but we have somebody on the line right now.  Who is a big fan of all of yours. And I understand, John, that you are a foodie and made the term.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I do. I eat it to live.  Amazing. Amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love food.  Eat to live.  I like playing with it.  At one point, you were a writer of food. In fact, writer of, you wrote about fried  fair food at one point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was a professional food journalist for about three years for Men's Journal Magazine,  the national magazine of men's everyday lives for men who love to keep journals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And eat apparently on the line with us right now from her, from her day job,  which apparently is working for the city of San Francisco is Cammie Blackstone. Hi, Cammie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's Cammie Blackstone.  Yes.  Mellie Kalikimaka.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the Hawaii. She's from Hawaii. Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mecca lecca. Hi, Mecca. Hi.  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was excited. I heard you talking about the mole man. And like one of my favorite movies of all  time is Attack of the Mole People starring Hugh Beaumont.  I just saw that.  Such a great movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's weird. Cammie Blackstone. That's very weird. I just saw that movie for the first time  like two weeks ago over the, over Thanksgiving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, it's, it's a Thanksgiving tradition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it is at our house too. At our house too. It's a great movie. And I, did you include the  Hugh Beaumont stuff in the mole man thing or you saw it afterwards?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I, I mean, I had read about that movie. I'd never seen it. I had read about it  while I was reading up on all sorts of, I mean, there are dozens and dozens of movies, novels,  and obviously myths about people living underneath the earth, whether it's a race of weird mole like  creatures or in this case, strange albinos who like to, you know, have human sacrifices.  I mean, it's just, there are hundreds of novels from the early 20th century about this idea that  people live in the earth. And so I had read about it, but I had, I had never seen it because  seeing it might actually constitute as research.  Wouldn't want to do that.  But I was really taken with it. I thought it was fantastic and, and you know, it's very,  very slowly paced movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, it takes a lot of patience. It's not your average Hollywood popcorn,  you know, razzle dazzle thing.  It's cerebral.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you mean to say that it's boring. Yes. My favorite thing about that movie was that the,  so it's about, it's about a bunch of like archaeologists who discover a passageway into  a world where descendants of Sumerians who millennia ago had taken refuge underneath  the earth still live. And they're completely, they're completely albino. Cause of course they  live underground and they enslave a race of sort of quasi savage mole men whom they make do their  bidding. And the archaeologists at first are going to be killed because they are, they are  from another world. It's like Petaluma. It's extremely xenophobic, not like us.  And LU.  But then, but then the archaeologists get the upper hand because they have something that no  one has ever seen before, a flashlight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Was it now, is Hugh Beaumont an archaeologist or is he a mole person?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's an archaeologist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Cause he's the father in Leave it to Beaver, if I'm not mistaken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Later on he escaped from the mole people, got married and raised two sons.  In the Universal Studios back lot. It's a true Horatio Alger story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He had flashbacks whenever he got stuck in the closet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's why, that's why, that's why you never see any episodes of Leave it to  Beaver in their basement. Because Beaumont was still scarred from the time that he spent. He  would never go in the basement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Big claustrophobia thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, wouldn't you?  Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Cammie's show Munchcast, which I know is one of your favorites, John, won the podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is. Not just mine, but also my daughter's.  Oh, wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, here's the good news. It won the podcast award for a best food podcast of the year.  Yay.  Congratulations.  Yeah.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know so, Leo, what is the big cash prize? Is there a big cash prize?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a plaque. There's a plaque, I believe. And a needle nose pliers.  And some needle nose pliers.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  And a fresca.  And a fresca.  Oh my goodness.  So we're bringing the show back because, well, it's kind of embarrassing to have  canceled the show that won the best food show of the year.  I know.  So we're going to bring it back Sundays at 2 p.m., right, Cammie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That sounds good to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And Jonathan and Merlin too. We'd all love to have you on the show, but especially John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. I tried to stalk John when he was here in San Francisco,  but he had very tight security and a very busy schedule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I saw you behind the rope line and I'm like, get her out of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do you have a secret service code name, John, that they use for you?  Because, you know, the president's, you know, has a name, Rawhide or whatever.  I don't know.  Hobo. Hobo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He might have to kill you now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hobo One. Hobo One is on the move.  He's on the move.  So Cammie, anyway, we'll see you Sunday and congratulations on the award.  And I just thought maybe you could stalk John while he's on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you celebrate Christmas or Hanukkah or Saturnalia or Solemnvictus or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Any chance to eat a lot of butter and drink a lot of champagne is really kind of like my kind of  holiday. So all of them, all of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what's the big meal this year?  What are you going to have? Butter and champagne?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cammie Butter and champagne.  Usually in all of December, I go on the five C's diet, which is cheese, cocktails, candy,  cookies and champagne. So pretty much I've been doing that. Although, you know, I try to mix it  up fruit cake. You know, I could put that under a C for cake, but you know, it's kind of fruity.  So I don't know. I mean, we do it all. I just had our big city hall throwdown,  holiday treat throwdown yesterday and I made six different kinds of cookies.  And the winning entry was a marzipan fondant covered banana bread that was in the shape of  the rotunda of City Hall. Wow. Who made that?  That was made by the president of the board of supervisors, David Chu.  He obviously needs more to do. He needs a lot more to do.  And then of course, one of the standard favorites every year is that just red  and green jello shots with a lot of vodka in them. Those are always a big one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mayor Newsom loves those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When you guys revealed on, if I may refer again to the Munchcast for a moment,  when you revealed when you're talking about jello shots and you revealed  that the inventor of jello shots was Tom Lehrer, the famous American satirical composer and  mathematician. I almost drove my car off the road. I was so shocked and excited.  It was almost the end of me and my whole family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That was actually the last Munchcast we were so afraid for you. We decided this is not safe to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  do the show while driving. It's not worth the risk. It's not worth the risk of Hodgman driving off  the road in delight. But did you know that Colton, you're a Tom Lehrer fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I had never heard that before.  Is that wild?  It is true.  Well, it's in Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So you know it's true. It's got to be true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What was the Tom Lehrer jello shot party like, I wonder?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What was the story? He wanted to smuggle booze in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was when he was in the military and he was trying to figure out a way. Yeah,  it was like a smuggling thing. It's the way people used to shoot up watermelons with vodka  at Day on the Green concert. They wouldn't get busted bringing in like a bottle and they'd bring

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  in a watermelon that was all juiced. He's just bringing a big tray of jello shots,  little cups of jello and they'd say, hey, what are you doing? He said, I'm just eating jello.  It's no big deal. Just a tray of jello here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How am I going to get liquor into this event? Well, I could bring a flask  or I know how about I inject a whole watermelon with vodka.  They'll never get it.  What else am I going to do with my giant hypodermic syringe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They'll never guess that I did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I never heard that about watermelon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, now they have like much more high tech versions of the same sort of idea.  There's something online. It's a great Christmas gift. As a matter of fact,  there's the rack of wine, which is a bra that's really like a Boda bag.  And so women can like wear it and then they just put all their booze there.  And people just think they have a big rack or there's the beer belly,  which is the same idea for men to wear. And it's like kind of like one of those  sympathetic pregnancy pillow things. But it's just a big Boda bag.  Looks like a beer belly and they fill it up with alcohol.  And then when you get frisked, you know, you're safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You get frisky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. You can go ahead. It's online. I think it might even be like wine rack.com or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not. I'm not going to look it up.  Leo did it for you.  See what this looks like. I'm not interested in seeing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Take a look and she looks like she's enjoying it.  She's got the bladder in her hand.  And so I don't know.  She's just really.  So much more fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It seems like it would be a lot more fun than an operation. So, you know,  breast enhancement through alcohol. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it sure makes nursing a pleasure. I'll tell you that right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I call story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If I saw a man walking around with a false stomach full of beer attached to his abdomen,  and it was, I'd say, first of all, I don't think the beer that is going to come out of that is  going to be in very good condition. I think it's going to be highly agitated and probably  body temperature. And I don't think it would look even like an authentic stomach because it  would be sloshing around and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you prefer one of those hats with the cans and the straw?  That's too obvious, though.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What I do is very simple. I just take one of the old stretch Armstrong dolls.  I just.  This is not going to end well.  All of the goo inside and then I refill it with alcoholic jello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's an updated jello shot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then when the police say, what are you doing drinking from the neck of that stretch Armstrong?  I have two explanations. One, I can say.  You say, I'm not drinking. I'm eating jello.  Yeah, it's not eating jello. Exactly.  I'm eating jello.  Or just say, I'm a very rare kind of vampire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry. I muted Merlin this whole time.  Well, that's OK. That's all right.  You may speak now, Merlin. I'm sorry. I turned you down. I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now the Internet's fantasy finally comes through.  Please speak. Speak, Merlin.  Oh, nothing. I had a stretch Armstrong.  Yeah.  No, I had a stretch Armstrong. I used to test prototype toys for Kenner, who is there in  Cincinnati. And yeah, you could.  This was a job you had?  Well, I mean, I was in elementary school. I wasn't compensated.  Oh, wow.  No, you could totally do that. I don't think people would ask you questions.  I think you see a guy talking on a muscle man full of jello. They're not going to ask questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What if you see a guy?  Wait a minute. No.  I want to hear more about you having this job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, that's a primo job for you.  Are you ready to be insanely jealous?  Yes. What else did you get to test?  SSTs. Remember those? We call it the T thing.  And this is the long thing.  Yeah. And then I take remarks about it. I tested stretch Monster and stretch Armstrong.  So just some putt putt. Do a little work on putt putt.  Cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look it up.  You're welcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What I would like to see is I would like to see a 12 year old Merlin man doing a corporate seminar  at Kenner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How many of you are ready to get entertained?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me tell you everything you're doing right. Let me tell you everything you're doing wrong.  Okay.  Just talking really fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you get to take notes and like write a report and stuff like that?  Or you just sort of got to hang out with them and tell them what you thought?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It was really dumb. It was like the one way glass kind of deal.  You get out of class for a while. They did this in schools by the way.  They take you down to where the kindergartners were and they gave you toys to play with.  And with stretch Armstrong we got to take it home.  Wow.  This is way off topic. But I would love, I would, all I'm saying is I would love a flask  full of stretch jello. I would drink the crap out of that. I'd be stoked for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How about one of those giant water guns?  Oh yeah.  Super soaker.  Super soaker.  Super soaker you could shoot jello at people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When I was in the magazine.  I've seen you do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She did that at Burning Man.  I did.  Oh really?  I did.  This is not some fantasy of some strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Leo Laporte, Leo Laporte were you at Burning Man? When were you at Burning Man?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wasn't but Kiki was.  I was at Burning Man.  And I've seen the pictures.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  To prove it.  I'm just imagining you walking around on X naked.  Yeah baby.  Glow sticks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now I can't, I can't let it think it.  I can't let it think it.  It won't go away.  Think it baby. Not only that I had a beer belly.  With beer in it.  I know how to party.  And then I found out it's okay to bring beer to Burning Man and I was very embarrassed.  I was smuggling, I was smuggling beer into Burning Man.  Tammy where are you going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I gotta go to the nutcracker.  Oh have fun.  I don't hate to eat and run but I'm so excited to talk to all of you and I'm so excited that  we're going to do Bunchcast again.  But there's somebody, I gotta go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Bye Tammy, bye.  Her ride's waiting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I went to the nutcracker last year.  There she goes.  It was great fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh yeah. It's a must see in San Francisco.  They do it every year.  The tree grows out of the stage and all that's wonderful.  Mr. Colton do you have a holiday jingle that you'd like to sing for us here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A holiday jingle? Sure I could do a holiday jingle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not jingle, I mean you know just a song.  You know just anything.  Anything. Doesn't have to be holiday.  Just something.  Anything. Please I beg you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Play something for Christ's sake.  Do you want me to do one of my songs?  Yes.  Well I could do one of John's songs instead.  No thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Does John write songs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No not as far as you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are you two working up something there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why don't you do the Dick Van Patton's Hobo Chili for Dogs jingle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh he does do jingles.  I don't know if I remember how to play it.  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know what they're asking for in the chat room and it's the song that  I got to play with you on stage and it was a great moment for me.  Of course I really wasn't playing.  I was just fondling a plastic instrument along with Merlin Mann.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Getting our butts saved by Veronica.  We still couldn't be saved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well I was terrible and that was of course the song Still Alive.  But you probably don't own the rights to that.  Do you own the rights to that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't own that song but I don't think anybody's going to get in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're allowed to perform.  We'll just say everybody should run out and buy a copy of the Orange Box so they can play a portal.  Or you know what you can do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can buy Jonathan Colton's DVD and CD set Best Concert Ever which has a live version of that  song on it as well as I think guest performances by Merlin Mann and Leila Port.  That's true.  It's on the DVD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It does have our rock band shame moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know what's great?  Because I was positioned improperly under the screen so it looked like I was playing well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know.  Veronica has still not forgiven me for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It looks like you're saving everybody and she's making terrible, terrible mistakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah it's great.  It's great for you.  That's available at JonathanColton.com by the way.  It is absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Way too many people asking for Lady Gaga songs in the chat room.  Do you do a Lady Gaga cover?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I do not.  I'm not sure where that's coming from.  You've kind of got her hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do you even own a disco stick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can you do Radio Gaga by Queen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a good one.  No I can't do that one either.  I'll do Still Alive.  That's a nice one.  Wonderful.  You know what?  It's very Christmasy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We can ask everybody to sing along in the chorus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  This was a triumph.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Making a note here, huge success.  It's hard to overstate my satisfaction.  Aperture science.  We do what we must because we can.  For the good of all of us, except the ones who are dead.  But there's no sense trying over every mistake.  You just keep on trying till you run out of cake.  And the science gets done and you make a neat gun for the people who are still alive.  Not even angry.  I'm being so sincere right now.  Even though you broke my heart and killed me.  Tore me to pieces.  Threw every piece into a fire.  As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you.  Now these points of data make a beautiful line.  And we're out of beta.  We're releasing on time.  So I'm glad I got burned.  Think of all the things we learned for the people who are still alive.  So go ahead and leave me.  I think I'd prefer to stay inside.  Maybe you'll find someone else to help you.  Maybe Black Mesa.  That was a joke.  Ha ha.  Fat chance.  Anyway this cake is great.  It's so delicious and moist.  Look at me still talking when the science took two.  When I look out there it makes me glad I'm not you.  I've experiments to run.  There is research to be done.  All the people who are still alive.  And believe me I am still alive.  I'm doing science and I'm still alive.  I feel fantastic and I'm still alive.  And while you're dying I'll be still alive.  And when you're dead I will be still alive.  Still alive.  Still alive.  Yeah that was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Boy that's a yeoman effort to do that on Skype.  It was pretty impressive.  I also just had about a gallon of eggnog before I did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the way it was meant to be heard.  Yeah on Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That is available on the DVD.  It's at JonathanColton.com.  Best.Concert.Ever.  What a wonderful holiday gift that would make for the geek in your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I agree with you.  In fact I think I know what I'm going to get.  Jonathan Colton for Christmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Give it to him.  I can get you one for cheap John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What if I bought the rights to still alive and gave them to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just pull a Yoko.  I own you now Jonathan.  So gosh this has been so much fun.  I don't know how we could top that really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't believe another year has come and gone since the last time we spoke.  And this so fast so quick.  I could speak for another two hours.  In fact I'm going to even after we sign off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just keep talking in your empty little apartment.  It's kind of sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is.  I'm going to turn off the heater so it doesn't interfere with the sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did Dane say that also?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dane told me to turn off the heater.  He told me to put pillows in the corner.  And he told me to sell all my furniture.  He is so committed to excellent sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's right.  Leo is there an audio reason that we had to take our pants off and walk in a circle three times?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Did Dane ask you to do that as well?  Yeah a couple times.  It was kind of a fun thing.  I mean I'm not going to lie.  He was like what's that?  Is that an Eames chair in the background there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that an Eames chair?  I'm going to need you to hack that up with an axe.  He's just committed to good sound and good lighting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I think the results speak for themselves.  We all look great and we sound terrific.  And that's there you go.  God bless us everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And God bless us Ford.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Makers of the year.  And we're going to have a great time.  And God bless us Ford.  Makers of the great Ford Sink.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mr. Segway.  Holy moly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know if Henry Ford were here today I'm sure he'd say buy my cars.  And if you get the Ford the Lincoln the Mercury.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go buy the biggest goose in the window and drive a Ford to get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Bring it boy.  Here's a filing.  Buy Ford Sink.  That's all we have to say.  Go to SyncMyRidePodcast.com.  Ford's going to come down to CES with us.  We're actually going to drive the Mustang and the Flex down so that we can show off the Ford Sink.  Which is amazing.  Hands-free Bluetooth.  You play the music.  You can literally press a button on your steering wheel and you say play still alive.  And your car plays still alive.  Which is a little creepy.  You could.  Songs, books, music.  If you've got Bluetooth on your phone it'll play the Bluetooth audio from the iPhone.  Or the Droid or any number of devices.  Of course it has a USB port so you can connect it to.  I just love it.  It's the computer system in my car and it should be in your car too.  But in order to do that you've got to get a new Ford Lincoln or Mercury vehicle.  Ford Sink from the folks at the Great Mines.  The last Great Mines in Detroit.  SyncMyRidePodcast.com.  I had to sneak that one in.  I snuck that one in.  Nobody noticed.  No.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They didn't notice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think anybody heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No.  They were still buzzing from the song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were primed for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Jonathan are you off the road for a little bit?  Do you get to stay at home with the family?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well I'm on the road with the family.  Christmas for me is traditionally driving from grandparents house to grandparents house.  So I'll be doing a lot of driving.  But at least I'll have my kids with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And when's the next tour?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's the 14th of January.  I'll be in Orlando.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Jonathan does, for those who don't know, does this great thing with Eventful.  Where you demand Colton.  And if enough people ask him.  No?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah that's right.  And that's actually Florida.  This is my first time in Florida.  And I'm playing Florida and St. Petersburg.  And really the reason I'm able to do that is because I can look at the numbers on Eventful.  And I know that it makes sense to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm going to demand a concert 94952.  Oh now it wants to know if I'm a man.  Is that something you do or is that Eventful doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I want to know if all my fans are men or women.  No that's them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I am a man.  And there's no other choice.  And then I have to enter this D-E-R-I-C.  I'm just trying to get Jonathan to come to my neck of the woods.  We have a little theater here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it doesn't say this on the site but after that you have to email me your credit card number and the expiration date and the little four digit code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh great.  And do you think there's any reason when I put in my year of birth 1956 that it gave me this ad eldercare link?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Fine quality home care options now.  Jonathan I'd like to thank you for that.  That's inspiring.  But look there are seven people demanding Jonathan Colton and Petaluma.  What would be the threshold Jonathan to get you to come out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Eight.  We have to get to eight people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's a critical mass I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And if I can get the two old ladies in the ad to come would that help at all?  That would be nine people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Technically that would be nine.  So yeah.  They might already be signed up.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And Jon Hodgman how do you get people to bring you to town?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I use television.  The power of television.  I appear on television and that seems to have a strange power over people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Kind of amazing isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No.  My only real tool that I'm using these days is Twitter and my own imitation blog.  I'm not as advanced as Jonathan Colton.  I ought to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Probably the best thing to do would be to go to Jon's site which is AreasOfMyExpertise.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or follow me on Twitter at Hodgman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And Jonathan you're at Hodgman as well right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's also Jonathan Colton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm at Jonathan Colton actually.  I went for the first and last name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  J-O-H-N-A-T-H-O-N-C-O-O-O-L-T-O-O-N.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He just ruined it for you.  There's no way anyone's going to find it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll put it in the chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Everyone knows how to spell Colton.  It's spelled like Roger Colton only with a U.  Merlin Mann is Hot Dogs Ladies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I got a different one.  I'm HotChick87.  Are you?  No.  I post there sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There was another Merlin Mann on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, somebody did a really smart funny thing.  It was really annoying.  They used an invisible Unicode character.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was pretty hilarious actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But that wasn't you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I'm funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's no such thing as a Unicode.  Really? Is that true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You need a virgin to catch one.  It's like a pony with a cone on its head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And there's no such thing as a virgin.  You have to sit alone in the forest and wait for a programmer to put his head in your lap.  Kung Fu Grip.  That's my Tumblr thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  G-R-I-P-P-A.  KungFuGrip.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's Tumblr's fun, boy.  It's very addictive.  I love it.  I'm into Postures now.  Postures is pretty sweet.  Tumblr announced a new thing today.  They're going to use the same kind of API as the Twitter API.  So you can use Tweety to communicate with Tumblr.  It's really, really cool.  You should check it out.  That's interesting.  It's very clever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's very intriguing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I could use my iPhone app to tumble.  I use Tweety as my main go-to Twitter app on the iPhone.  And now you can just set up, basically make Tumblr.com the API address.  So retweeting becomes reblogging it.  It's pretty cool.  That's pretty cool.  That's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's pretty cool.  Oh look, right on the cover of KungFuGrip.  You've already captured.  I made a Superman joke.  Do you like that?  Zod, Ursa, and Non.  I can put you in the cube.  I think I have that somewhere.  I think I have a cube-like transition.  What is this?  For some reason, that's one of those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People develop like, now you're in an aquarium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Somewhere I have a cube-like transition.  Is this it?  No, that's not it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I remember that scene had such an impact on me.  It does, doesn't it?  I don't know why, but I just remember that so clearly.  And then flying around in the cube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There he is. There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There he goes.  Look at me out there in stamp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's see.  I can cube you.  Oh, this is a good one.  Here, I'm going to blow you up and turn you into Jonathan Colton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, man.  Can I say something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not sure that Merlin got the appreciation he deserved for the Terran stamp reference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That was good, wasn't it?  He snuck that right in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is the Christmas present, and all Christmas presents for me, I have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Was that Zod?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That was Jalezod.  He's also a little known trivia in the song Waterloo Sunset by the Kinks.  He is the titular Terry of Terry and Julie.  No.  Really?  Wow.  I should have me on here all the time. I know lots of stuff that needs to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That is great trivia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I love Terran stamp.  And his brother managed the Rolling Stones for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is that a 34 cent stamp?  You were one better than me.  Tramp stamp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tramp stamp.  It's brother Libby.  Tramp stamp.  Yeah, he got into the business through the back door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, my gosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, the pain.  Merry Christmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, this has been so Christmasy, so festive.  Thanks to you Merlin Mann.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Thank you.  You haven't told us. Do you have any special things you do in Petaluma?  What do you do? Do you buy a boat?  What do you do at Christmas?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, Jennifer was up last night. Actually, I have a picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're going to share again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You think I shouldn't show that picture?  Let me put it this way. I had gone to bed.  Oh, no, my iPhone's broken. There must be the fates have intervened.  I can't pull up the picture.  But Jennifer had...  I was on the bed and Jennifer was decorating the home.  And I heard snoring.  And I got up and I said, what's going on?  Because she wasn't in bed.  I thought, there's something going on.  So I went out to the dining room.  And my wife is lying on the floor in her jammies with a pair of scissors in her hand.  And one of those ribbon candies, she's cut the plastic on it.  She was cutting the plastic.  And apparently at some point during the cutting of the ribbon candy,  she got tired.  She closed her eyes.  She fell asleep on the floor of the dining room.  And she was like, oh, my God.  And I, of course, did the first thing that any good husband would do,  which is snap a picture of it.  And...  It looks posed.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This could really change the next couple of weeks of your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I would be really hard about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not, you know, I'm being saved because the iPhone will not turn on.  I don't know what's...  You are truly saved.  Oh, man, that was close. But I do have a picture.  I was thinking of drawing a chalk outline around her.  But it was the strangest thing.  So I thought that might be a tradition we want to...  Bring back every year.  Falling asleep on the floor with scissors?  Yeah.  It's very traditional.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They teach you not to do that when you're in kindergarten, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No.  Sleeping with scissors is all right.  It's running with scissors.  I don't think there's any injunction against sleeping with scissors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think you're not supposed to sleep with ribbon candy.  That's the risk.  Absolutely.  Sleeping alone is dandy, but never with ribbon candy.  Sailors take warning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're going to let you guys go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's been really fun.  Thank you, Dr. Kiki Sanford for joining us.  She's the host of Dr. Kiki's Science Hour every Thursday on Twit.tv.  Also, This Week in Science, which is a great science podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All sorts of science.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And she's helping us put together our CES coverage.  We're going to be heading down to CES in a couple of weeks.  Not too long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know. It's so soon.  My spreadsheets are ready.  I feel I should realize...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's Christmas Eve.  We should do some sort of night before Christmas thing.  I just don't have anything prepared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The night before Christmas, all the kids were snug in their beds.  Except for Kiki.  She was sitting at her computer working on the spreadsheets.  Because not everything was right yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And Mrs. Laporte, who was lying on the floor.  Mrs. Laporte in the dining room.  In the dining room with the scissors.  And the ribbon candy.  It's festive. It's clue time.

Transcript:  The tape never stops.  Thank goodness.  Alright, guys. Hey, really thank you for doing this.  This was a lot of fun.  I'm sorry you can't be at Macworld with us.  I know you guys are busy that time.  But you're doing Ted, huh, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's great.  I'm not doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Your talk was very wonderful.  About your childhood sweetheart and all that.  I love that.  It was really enjoyable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was a very, very strange experience.  To be telling jokes about aliens to Al Gore.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You thought he might stand up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got used to it now, but at the time it was very new in my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a regular thing these days.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you so much.  When I went back to Ted after that,  I saw Al Gore again.  I was with a friend of mine.  I said, hey, look, there's Al Gore by himself.  I'm going to go say hello to him because we're friends now.  Because of Ted.  We're the same.  So I went up to him.  I just wanted to say hello.  He was like, oh, it's John Hodgman.  How are you?  He couldn't have been nicer.  He really remembered.  I was like, wow, this is far more than I expected.  We chatted for a little while.  Then my wife called.  You won't guess who I was talking to.  It was Al Gore.  He remembered me.  My friend who was with me said he didn't just remember you.  He hugged you.  It was true.  I still don't.  My brain could not process a hug from Al Gore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's because he's an alien.  It was lost time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Lost time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He wiped your mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I am physically affectionate with you.  So actually, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You don't remember it.  So you can't tell if it was like a real nice warm hug  or if it was a stiff hug.  I honestly had no memory of it happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was just like, oh, I'm going to go say hello.  I'm going to go say hello.  I had no memory of it happening at all.  It was a weird trick my brain played on me.  The whole experience was so completely unbelievable  that my brain wiped it out.  That's wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't that interesting?  Very strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you, Sa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Good night, everybody.  Thanks, Mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
