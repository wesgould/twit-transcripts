I want to thank very heartily, very heartily, both Tom Merritt and John C.  Dvorak, who filled in while I was gone in China and and just say that I am exhausted.  You're going to you're going to hear a very jet lagged Leo Laporte, but it won't just be me  that's jet lagged because also joining us today on the show, Mr.  Kevin Rose, who is also when did you get back, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Two days ago, but I am also jet lagged and waking up at three in the morning,  ready to sprint for some reason.  Me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the weirdest thing.  Me too. Two o'clock in the morning.  I'm going, OK, well, because it's daytime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And you're like, you feel like you want to go outside and run.  And then like an hour later, boom, you're back in bed again.  It's the strangest thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Also with us from the Houston Chronicle and always welcome regular on the show,  Dwight Silverman. Good to have you, Dwight.  Nice. Nice for you to have me, Mr. President.  I am the president.  During my absence, without any intervention on my part,  I apparently was elected the president of the Internet by it.  Was it Tech Republic that did that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. Yes.  I was surprised it wasn't moot in the end because, you know, the  the four channels swarm those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, they didn't know about it.  Otherwise, it would have been moot.  So Molly would came on strong towards the end.  But but I, you know, it's because I run it because I'm in China  and I can't even get online.  So the site was blocked.  You know, it's interesting that you didn't bring a laptop, did you, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I did not. Just the iPhone with data plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You did a very you did a very different thing.  I did the tourist thing.  I went to Beijing and Xi'an and I went to Guilin.  You went on a tea tour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I was in Beijing for a couple of days, but then I flew into  Kunming and then was out for a week and a half traveling around  the Yunnan province.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  First of all, Beijing.  Could you believe that city?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Insane. You looked you were like driving around and it was so modern  and beautiful and Lamborghini dealerships and just I can't believe how  it just it seems like you're in Los Angeles or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I fully expected a bunch of people in Mao coats and Mao hats on bicycles  jamming the street.  And no, this is a this is exactly like L.A.  or maybe maybe even more vital.  You know, we stayed on Chang'an, which is the main drag.  Just a couple of blocks from Tiananmen Square and went around the corner.  And it's it's hopping.  I feel like we're in Times Square on a Friday night.  Big and big screens, little Blade Runner is because they're big screen ads  everywhere, gigantic screens.  McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken.  But right across the street from McDonald's, there's a booth with a guy  selling deep fat fried scorpions. Right.  It's it's a wild country.  It is in a country on the move.  I really, really enjoyed it.  I imagine you did.  You know, you were you were with farmers, though.  You were really in the countryside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, we were in kind of the rainforest area  just out in the middle of nowhere, about two days away from any major airport  and just going around and kind of decompressing and meeting with different  people that are creating different types of tea and going to tea factories  and tasting tea and just relaxing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you have a translator with you? How do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, we had a translator with us.  So I was also a Tim Ferriss, who also speaks Chinese.  So that made it or Mandarin. So I made it easy.  Oh, that really that helps a lot. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow, that's neat. What fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was fun. We both had a good time. It's great.  So had I known you were going to be out there, we would have met up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you were very far away.  I mean, it's like like being in California, New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, it's a big.  I'm wondering if we were in Beijing at the same time.  We might have been. Yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was in Beijing July 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th and 7th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ah, I think I was there the fifth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, man, that would have been so funny.  I kept looking for you. I kept thinking,  I wonder if Kevin's going to come around a corner and I'll jump in.  It was an amazing experience.  But yeah, talking about censorship,  when we got there, you couldn't get to YouTube. Right.  By the time we left, because I think of the Uyghur uprising,  the they had blocked Twitter, friend feed.  Facebook as well.  And I don't know if you probably didn't see any TV because I mean,  but CNN, if a story that they didn't like came on, they just black it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what the craziest thing was is my friend Tim had his laptop with him.  So he would turn on it on every once in a while.  And I had my iPhone with the data plan.  So I would jump on the iPhone and I could pull up my Twitter feed  and access it just fine.  But if I went to his laptop because it was using HTTP  and it wasn't using like the API, I couldn't get to Twitter.  So I could still access Twitter and Facebook through the API calls on my phone.  It was just the normal web service that they were blocking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They figured it out eventually because it stopped working on the phone as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're right. Yeah. Yeah, that was strange.  It was the weirdest thing because I was sitting here pulling it up  and he was unable to get to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, in a way, it's a real pat on the back for friend feed that they even  they even heard of friend feed.  Yeah, I was still able to post.  I know, isn't that I was still able to post  to video to Twitter using a brand new service.  See, whenever there's a, you know, it takes them a while to figure out.  There was a service called Twitt reel that lets you post video.  So I was able to post that way.  And then I was using Posterous to post to YouTube.  So I would email a video to Posterous and it would cross posts.  They couldn't block that.  And that just shows you how impossible we saw this in Iran.  You can't you can't block this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's funny is I sent out on our last day there.  We did a little tweet meetup.  And so I sent out a message saying, hey, if anyone's in Beijing,  come out and be with us.  And about 15 people showed up.  Yet Twitter was being blocked.  And we asked them, like, how did you find out about this?  They're like, oh, that's you just have to know what you're doing.  Yeah, like the geeks know it's the geeks totally know how to do it.  These guys are like, oh, we just use proxies.  And yeah, it's a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My sense, I'm curious if this is your sense.  And we'll talk about the news in just a bit, Dwight.  Don't worry.  Dwight's been the keeper of the news all this week  because we haven't paid any attention.  And there's been a lot of it.  But holding down the fort, there's quite a bit of news  we're going to talk about.  But but this is newsworthy, too.  I mean, my sense of it was that the vast majority of the Chinese  populace doesn't really care.  As long as they're, you know, on an economic upturn,  which they seem to be despite the world global meltdown, as long as, you know,  everything's going fine, they don't care that they're not seeing that  CNN story or missing Twitter or Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think they even know, though, because we asked our translator  whether he was aware of blocking.  And he's like, well, I know they block pornography.  And he's like that.  And then there was a few other people on the tour that we asked about it.  And they're like, yeah, well, there's just bad sites that they block.  It's like I'm like, well, actually, there's normal sites that they block, too.  Like, and they didn't seem to know or really care, which was weird to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think also the guides, I asked one of our guides about drug use.  And she said, I don't know. What do you mean?  I said marijuana. She said, I never heard of marijuana.  There's a certain amount of intent, you know, especially from the guides,  intentional misrepresentation.  However, I think that it's and you know, I have to draw a parallel  to the American public, too.  That's not just Chinese public.  If as long as everything's going fine, they will know.  So what? Big deal.  You know, I got a car, I got a microwave.  I'm fat and happy.  You know, I don't care if I can't get to Twitter.  And the truth is, it doesn't really make that much difference in terms of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't matter. The geeks know how to get to it anyway.  We would have no problem there, Leo.  I think it's all our favorite. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you'd be state criminals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, that's that's the other thing.  That's right. I have to say, I love China.  And I really it's amazing the what a tiger economic tiger they are.  Some say a paper tiger, but that's a conversation for another time.  But it is a little scary when you think of the control that these hidden.  I mean, these guys are basically hidden.  There's no cult.  It's not like the Mao cult where there's pictures of them everywhere.  I mean, Jiang Jemin, I'm sure, you know, people know who he is,  but you don't get the sense of them being important in day to day life.  The fact that they're doing all this.  I wonder if 4chan is blocked in China.  I bet it is.  Dvorak is, by the way, Dvorak.org slash blog blocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you all see the the pollution that's supposed to be so bad there?  Was it really?  Or had it horrendous? Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In Beijing, you can't see five feet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Beijing, like for the day that I was there, it was 100 to 150 yards  max, and then it's kind of just everything just disappears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I've been told 400000 people a year die of pollution related  illnesses, chiefly lung disease.  400000 a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we were trying to fly from Kunming into Beijing,  and they actually delayed our flight by six hours because they said  there's certain pollution restrictions and they only allow so many planes in per day.  And they'd already reached that level of pollution.  And so they had to hold off and delay our flight. It was crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So. I have a little story to tell about AT&T.  You saw the C.M.G.  Sigler's article in  TechCrunch. What did he have?  How do you put it? AT&T, a steaming steaming pile of fail, a fail.  I AT&T, I bought the 100 megabyte  international roaming data plan for one hundred ten dollars, something like that,  knowing that I was going to be doing a lot of blogging and posting and so forth.  And I watched carefully my usage meter on the iPhone  because it's five bucks a megabyte if you if you go over.  And I got to 100.1 megabytes and I turned off 3G and turned off roaming.  In fact, I'm looking at my usage right now.  And even since I've come home, it's only gone to like 103 megabytes.  Call AT&T when I get back, they said, yeah, it went to 251.  The phone was off by 250 percent.  And I have a seven hundred fifty dollar bill.  And I don't understand how come the phone, they even tell you to use the phone  to watch your usage.  So I have to I'm with M.G.  Siegler on this one.  Not so happy. That's strange.  Not so happy.  You didn't use it much. You weren't posting or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did. I did post some stuff.  I was most did you buy an international data plan?  I don't know. I didn't set that up.  Somebody else set that up for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure I'm sure they did, because that's a very expensive other way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have the cell phones all covered through work.  So they they set up all the plans.  And so I'm sure they did.  Yeah, it's probably smart for you to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. Let's get to our tech stories.  We've got a lot of them, some big stories while you and I were gone.  I'm sure we covered this last week, Google's new operating system,  which got a lot of press for reasons I'm not fully clear about.  That was one big story.  Microsoft tried to counter with Office 2010, another big story.  And then business, the quarterly results are starting to come out  for the tech industry and a grim outlook there.  But before we do all of that, I do want to mention our friends at Squarespace.  I know you use Squarespace, Kevin, for your blog.  I do indeed. Yeah, I've been I'm just blown away by these guys.  They're very smart. They know what they're doing.  We have a special deal.  I think you do also on Dignation.  If you go to Squarespace dot com slash twit,  you can get well, you can sign up and use it for free without a credit card anyway.  But then if you decide to stick around 10 percent off  when you use the coupon code twit.  How long have you been using Squarespace?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Probably about two years now. What?  I'm like that. Yeah. You've known about them that long.  Well, I just they they approached us a long time ago.  And the funny thing about it is, you know, like you do on your show,  we get a lot of sponsors that, you know, come in for an episode or two and then leave.  And the Squarespace guys came in, they said, we want to show you  the product we're working on. They really they didn't want us just to be reading copy.  They actually I was impressed.  Yeah. They sat us down and they showed us what they had built.  And it was it was cool stuff.  And I had a few of my stories get on dig and some of the other sites  and it didn't fall over. And so I was pretty happy with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're a good test for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were happy to have me test it out.  I think they were a little worried the first time.  They didn't have any problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They do this. They do this interesting  kind of virtual server stuff that lets them turn on bandwidth kind of at will.  It's it's all done with Java and very slick because, you know, you're  you're not on a single server.  You're you're shared across the Squarespace kind of cloud.  And if they need more bandwidth, they just respond instantly with it.  So it's really good for that kind of thing.  If you are an existing blogger, it includes complete import and export  for WordPress blogger, movable type and type pad.  Now, when I say import and export, that's important.  I don't want you to feel like you're in a roach motel.  You know, you can't get out.  So you can get your stuff in there. Play with it.  Amazing. Did you do your design or did they do one for you?  I did my own design.  Isn't it cool how you can drag and drop stuff and you should see what they have coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you seen their new stuff?  No. Well, they have something coming really soon.  That's going to be pretty.  It sounds like I'm saying an ad, but I'm not.  I was actually in New York a couple of weeks ago, and they showed me some of the stuff  that they were doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dane and Anthony are really cool, really nice.  Just impressive as heck.  Well, I mean, that's the ad.  We don't have to say much more.  You can try it out by going to squarespace.com slash twit.  Give it a try. Not just for blogs.  You can. They've got forums.  They've got photo galleries.  Amber's Amber's significant other, Chris Dick, uses it for.  He's a photographer, brilliant photographer.  He uses it for a photo gallery.  It is gorgeous.  Google Maps built in amazing stats package and website tracking.  You're just going to love it. Squarespace.com slash twit.  And for a 10 percent off your new account.  As well use the twit coupon code.  And we thank him so much for supporting this week in tech.  Well, I am the president of the Internet.  So I don't know, do I get any?  Do I? I don't think I get anything.  I do. I should point out that had you been nominated, Kevin Rose,  it wouldn't even have been close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Should we be in your cabinet?  Can I be president?  Yeah. What do you want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. You get anything you want.  You don't want to be in the State Department.  You don't want to be Secretary of State Hillary Clinton right now.  The U.S. Department of State is not allowed to use Firefox.  They have to use Internet Explorer six.  They had a town hall meeting on Friday.  And Jim Finkel, one of the State Department, you know, just some guy,  a worker bee says, can you please let the staff  use an alternative browser called Firefox?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love that they asked her about what did she say?  Well, she she didn't answer it.  She deferred it to somebody else who initially said,  oh, there's a cost issue with using Firefox, at which point  somebody pointed out, well, you know, it's free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there is a cost issue.  You have a corporation or business has to, you know, put it  makes a change like that.  There's this training and that type of thing.  And so it's cost millions.  But the truth is, IE is such a piece of crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, you know, there's a very simple solution to this.  What's that? You just basically say if you're smart enough  to know how to install Firefox and use it, then you do so.  Right. Everyone else uses IE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, they're not going to do that.  In fact, with all of the break ins and so forth and the security issues  in the government, you know, those machines, I hope those machines  in the State Department are locked down.  Man, on the cruise ship, there were basically had no internet.  There were six Windows machines that you I don't even know  what version Windows because it had an application running.  It had I thought, oh, good, there's a memory card slot.  On it, I can.  But all you could do is put your card in there and for whatever,  30 bucks, send a postcard to somebody with a picture you pulled off the card.  You couldn't read or write.  I wish you'd been there, Kevin.  Maybe you could have hacked into the darn thing.  I couldn't get any internet access.  So they had no wireless there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, this is the crappy ship.  Who did you go?  Normal. Don't say Carnival.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it was worse than Carnival.  There's actually a step down from Carnival.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What it like cost festival.  It's like festival cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was on the Costa Krapaka, I think was an image.  No, it was it was it was the worst cruise ship ever.  Did you say Costco?  Costco might as well have been.  Anyway, if you want, but, you know, it kept me off the Internet,  which was a little bit of a problem because I had four lectures to give  about social media and the iPhone apps and stuff.  No internet access kind of hampered those. But that's all right.  Anyway, what was I saying?  Oh, locked down. I'm sure the State Department's pretty locked down.  Well, the guy that asked the question

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  actually had come from a security agency where they were letting them use Firefox.  So he had the argument that, you know, if we could use it over at the NSA  or wherever it was, we should be able to use it here. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I hope they I hope they get there.  I hope they get their Firefox.  Actually, there was a big wasn't there a big hole in Firefox 35?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they released 351 this week and patched it.  They originally it was going to come out about a week later,  but they rushed it out because of this flaw.  It also fixed a problem where if you're on a slower Windows machine,  when it started up, it would sometimes take minutes for Firefox 35 to come up  because it was scanning in order to do some kind of randomization.  It was scanning the  it was scanning temporary folders and using it as random data or something.  Right. And so on Windows.  And so it was taking a while and they fixed that as well.  But I also saw another story just today that said that there in 351,  there's another vulnerability and the and the exploit code has been released for it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  already. Yes. All zero day stuff.  Microsoft has a zero day exploit to Microsoft pushed out.  Was patch Tuesday last Tuesday.  Microsoft pushed out nine patches, but, you know,  just to keep the hackers busy, left one open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why? I always leave one on the table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Six of the nine were ranked critical.  Three were tagged as important.  The kill bit turned on for the ActiveX control, the DirectX show fix  Direct show X DirectX Direct show fix.  But one is still open to exploit.  So you figure out which one hackers all you hacker kiddies.  What are you? Are you a Safari user, Kevin, or do you use Firefox?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I'm bouncing back in between Chrome and Firefox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chrome on the Windows side, not a Mac. Oh, that's the Chromium.  The Chromium beta. Yeah. Is that is that stable?  This is Google hasn't released Chrome yet for the Mac, but the source codes open.  So somebody's like done a compilation of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess. No, this is directly from Google.  It's from Google. Chromium. Yeah, it's Google Chrome.  It's it's it's just their beta version of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're doing nightly builds and you can go in and dive in.  And I did a blog post on this.  You can go and dive in and and grab the nightly builds.  You know, some of them are going to be more stable than others.  But I think, Kevin, if you download the beta,  doesn't it refresh from the nightly builds every few days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It didn't. You know, I was always doing the check for update  and I was having to go in and manually download it to get the latest build.  But if you type in Google Chrome Mac, it's the first link.  No, actually, it's not the first link, because the first link is saying  put in your email address.  It's the second link under Google Chrome Mac,  which takes you directly to what they're calling the developer release.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you like it better than Safari or better than Firefox?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just really fast and snappy.  I don't know. I'm just playing around with it  because I want to stay up with with all what all the kids are playing with nowadays.  Well, it doesn't have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How does it feel not to be one of the kids anymore?  I know it's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like I'm not in the loop anymore.  Some of the stuff that's killing me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Those kids don't know anything.  Whippers snappers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't have bookmark management,  so you can't pull up like a screen and manage your bookmark.  You can bookmark things that can't print.  There's a lot of things that it can't do yet.  But yeah, I didn't get really working with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Flash doesn't work.  I just wrote.  I you know, I've been pretty, pretty happy with Safari, Safari 402 now.  They've done a couple of updates to some pretty nasty bugs on Safari.  But I just use I Firefox because of all the  add ons that you know, the extensions that I'm dependent on.  I just can't leave them behind.  And three five at first was very fast, but does feel a little bit sluggish now.  I don't and I don't.  And that's on Mac. I don't know.  I don't know why. Chrome is so snappy.  It is. It just feels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they did a hack on the Mac, too. It's weird.  I've never seen the Chrome dock icon bounce one time.  It's strange. I'm serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I have to launch it.  Let me see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the appearance of speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Launch it and tell me if it bounces.  I've never seen this happen.  It bounce. No bounce.  Is that weird? Yeah.  And I haven't tried to trick it.  I launched like five other things and then click Chrome last.  I'm like, OK, give me one bounce.  No bounce.  Oh, you make me want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a little hack. This is good.  This is like an ad for Chrome.  So I'm sure they covered it last week.  But what do you think about this Google OS?  It was getting a lot of press.  It was a screenshot, right?  It's Linux. In fact, this is what Bill Gates says.  He says, well, it's what's the big deal?  It's a it's a it's a Linux distro, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It they I saw somebody joking on Twitter that  they created a prototype for it.  They ran Ubuntu, deleted everything off the off the  off the desktop. But Firefox and now they have Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's it. It'll be a quick start, although there are other  quick start versions of Linux out there.  Gates says, in some ways, I'm surprised  people are acting like there's something new.  I mean, you've got Android running on netbooks.  It's got a browser in it.  He says the more vague Google is, the more interesting it is.  They've been pretty Google's secret to their PR.  They got I mean, they got Apple quality PR on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. And it was it was weird because this was,  as Kevin said, there's no screenshots.  There's no detailed description of how it would work  other than that it's a Linux kernel with a browser.  I mean, this is kind of the description.  Sounds a lot like what Michael Errington was describing  for whatever operating system he wants to use for the Crunchpad.  But there's it's all vapor.  It's total vaporware.  And the tech press went crazy with it.  And people, you know what it means and how important it is.  And you don't know how important it is.  You don't know what it means because you ain't seen it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's not going to be out till next year, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Late 2010. Late 2010.  Yeah. Second half of 2010.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, you just said it. We could do it.  We could do a distro tomorrow.  Just strip down a little Ubuntu.  There's a lot of choices out there.  You know, in one respect, though, this is sort of a coming of age  for Linux, because Linux now is running in a lot more platforms.  It's the Google. I mean, the Palm Pre is Linux.  Android is Linux.  We're seeing more and more Linux in a lot of different forms  in a way, too, that users don't really even know they're using Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Linux has almost become the the de facto embedded  operating system.  You know, it's kind of it's it's hidden.  And and that's not necessarily a bad thing, I think.  I don't think you should see the operating system, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and this is what Bill Gates is actually saying.  He says, really, the browser is the OS.  And what does the browser mean?  He says it just shows that the word browser has become a truly meaningless word.  What's a browser? What's not a browser?  If you're playing a movie, is that a browser or not a browser?  If you're doing annotations, is that a browser?  If you're editing text, is that a browser or not a browser?  Everything is browser centric nowadays.  That's I guess that's his point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right. And I think ultimately we're moving towards  where the computer is invisible anyway, where you just get your data  and you get the information you need and the computer itself,  the device and kind of the trappings around it should be as out of the way  as possible. I think that's kind of the only thing.  All I need is a browser, really. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nowadays, I mean, that's Web OS is just exactly what it sounds like.  It's a Web OS.  Are you Mac still, Kevin, or Windows mostly or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm Mac. I'm almost.  Yeah, I don't have anything Windows at all.  But I'm hoping that that Apple eventually decides to just open the OS up  and say it can run on any any piece of hardware.  We know that would I mean, everybody's doing it on netbooks.  It would just be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody's doing it anyway. Right. Exactly.  Pretty much. You know, I think Colleen now has.  Easily installed from the Leopard Disks on a variety of Hackintosh platforms.  And if you can stall for the Leopard Disks and you can update,  just as if it's a real Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just can't imagine the Google OS being like a cool operating system.  Like they like design wise, you know, they have their ugly.  Their head designer, Doug Bowman, he was he's phenomenal.  He actually left Google, I don't know, maybe two or three months ago.  And I just don't know who they have at the helm of design.  And I can't imagine it being like a cool, slick OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He left Google saying they know nothing about design.  I can't stand working for these guys.  They're bozos when it comes to design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're all engineers. It's engineer driven. Right.  And design is considered something peripheral.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they certainly I mean, the Google page is nice and clean and simple.  But you're right. I don't I don't think they I mean, Android doesn't feel  for all of its, you know, promise doesn't feel like a cool  operating system in any way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it feels kind of like it's kind of like the OS two of operating systems.  OS two is a good that's a good analogy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whipper snappers won't get that, but that's a good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, I remember OS two. I love those two warp.  I installed that warp warp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I remember when they called it warp and everybody kind of went,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's not a good name.  It ran windows. I remember seeing that at Comdex.  Yeah, it ran Windows 95. Right.  Wasn't it 95 or was it nine? No, it was 95.  Was that three? Was it three?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it would allow you to emulate like three one or something like that.  Oh, lord. Slowly, very slowly. Yeah, very slowly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see here. We're going to talk about there's so many stories. Amazon.  Speculation that there's two huge Amazon stories,  one that they may buy Netflix. You think that's credible, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they should buy Netflix.  I think that Amazon, it makes sense for them.  They're in the data delivery business.  Netflix is going all data for their their shows and everything they're doing  with the streaming over Xbox Live now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're really in the same business now that streaming is it.  Absolutely. I mean, on my Roku player, it's Amazon and Netflix.  Yeah. Unbox and Netbox.  I mean, Flix and Unflix.  And anyway, it's the same.  It's all the same, except you have to buy.  You have to buy the Amazon stuff and the Netflix stuff is free.  Of course, I'm already paying a monthly fee to them.  So it'd be interesting if they acquire them.  Does Amazon become  as big and as strong and as powerful as the the only other competition,  which is iTunes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think it I don't think it puts them immediately up there  because they you know, you still have to have the brand awareness of, all right,  I'm going to do this instead of iTunes.  Apple has a because of the iPod  and the iTunes platform being on so many computers and so many people using it  by default, I think they have a leg up.  But it sure would be great to have that level of competition.  And what was funny was when this story broke,  every tech journalist was just, you know, slobbering over themselves to say,  oh, yeah, let's do this.  Harry, Harry McCracken basically said, did a blog post and said,  OK, how can we make this happen?  Even if it's not real, let's make it happen.  And I think everybody loves the idea of Netflix and Amazon together.  I love Amazon's music service, Amazon.  I do, too. It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. In fact, one of the free apps I was showing on the Geek Cruise  was something called Adventages, which is a iTunes plug in that when you go  when you start to buy a song on iTunes, it pops up.  It's available on Amazon.  Now, that was more important than they saw DRM on iTunes.  But it's just it's just don't forget you get this on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I still think it's important, though, because I wish that iTunes  did it does it because they don't.  They do those. It's like a now.  Whatever is a.  Yeah, it's a. But it's it's you can't you can't play it on all your devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot of players won't do it. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.  We're going to talk about this Kindle thing, because this is a huge story.  And I'd be very curious what your take is on on this.  Kevin Rose is here from Dig.com and Dignation  and from the Houston Chronicle, Dwight Silverman.  And I want to talk about George Orwell.  In just a second.  But I also we have some wonderful sponsors.  As long as we're talking about books, I want to mention Audible.com  and the platinum deal from Audible.com Audible.com slash  twit to that.  Kevin, tell me you brought some audiobooks with you to China.  I did. I loaded up and it was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I brought Kindle stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You brought you brought a Kindle.  Of course, now the Kindle you can't download in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I loaded up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I loaded up. I put a bunch of Chinese  history books on my on my iPod from Audible.com.  And I had some I have some relaxing sci fi  on on my Kindle, which I left on the airplane, by the way.  So whoever got my Kindle, I hope you enjoy it.  Son of a. Oh, no, you lost your Kindle.  It's the second ebook reader I've left on a plane.  But the one thing, the thing that galls me is I get off the plane  in San Francisco, go through customs,  immigration and go, oh, my Kindle.  I left it in the seat back.  Or actually, I looked at my briefcase.  It wasn't there. I left in the seat back.  So I immediately go to the desk at Northwest  and said it's on the plane.  They called to say, no, I left.  I haven't heard back from them.  So it's either another passenger getting off the plane, saw it  and snagged it or somebody in the crew or the cleaning crew  or somebody snagged it.  So, yeah, I'm going to buy a new Kindle.  At least they dropped the price to $2.99.  It plays Audible.  I could put some Audible stuff on my Kindle, getting back to Audible  in the sleaziest way possible.  I could have played some Audible stuff on my Kindle.  Audible is a great place for your audio entertainment, your audio,  not just your audio books, but they've got comedy performances,  radio shows, even podcasts. Audible.com slash Twitter  will give you a chance to sign up for the platinum account.  That's my account. Two books a month.  And you get the first two free.  So there are a lot of choices if you go to Audible.com.  A lot of books, 50,000 books now.  One of the things Audible does that I love,  they do a lot of pro bono stuff.  They've been putting the Sotomayor confirmation hearings up for free  day by day.  They've got all the first four days up there now.  You can download them and listen to them.  They've done this always in the past with convention speeches,  inauguration speeches, all sorts of stuff.  So it's really a great place to get kind of pro bono stuff.  But I am going to recommend a book today.  You know, they're making a movie about Facebook.  In fact, you know who's making the movie is our friend  from Trigger Street, Dana Brunetti, is producing this.  Oh, really? Yeah.  And it's based on this book by Ben Mesrich,  The Accidental Billionaires, the founding of Facebook.  I know you know Mark Zuckerberg.  I imagine you know him pretty well, Kevin,  because, you know, you're both young guys and.  Riding that wave of Web 2.0.  Has he mentioned this book at all?  Does he hate it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He has not mentioned that book to me now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we don't know how he feels about the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can see if he's online now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, ask him.  Eduardo Saverin and Mark Zuckerberg, Harvard undergraduates, best friends.  Eduardo, this is the copy on Audible.  Eduardo figured their ticket to social acceptance and sexual success  was getting invited to join one of Harvard's final clubs,  a constitution, a constellation of elite societies.  Mark didn't care so much.  He was a computer genius, so he decided best way to start them.  Hack the university's computer system, creating a rateable database  of all the female students on campus.  He nearly got kicked out when he crashed the university's servers.  And that's where the framework for Facebook was born.  What a story. This is going to be a great movie.  Read the book right now, The Accidental Billionaires, the founding of Facebook.  They've they've tried to add sex to this.  In fact, the subtitle is a tale of.  A tale of sex, money, genius and betrayal.  All right.  I could tell you right now, Mark doesn't like it.  You can get it for free.  Go to audible.com slash twit to many, many wonderful books to listen to.  Like I said, when I on the way to China, I was listening  and I'm still listening now to a biography of Mao.  I've got some great stuff.  It is for history, for nonfiction, for fiction, for thrillers,  whatever it is you like to read, you can listen to it.  And it's a great thing.  Anytime you've got to travel, drive the car, work in the garden, do the dishes.  Audible.com slash twit to we thank them so much for their support of this week  in tech and all of the twit programing.  What did the mark respond back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to wait till you're done talking about him.  They sent him the links.  I can't watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think let's not get in trouble right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Aaron Sorkin of the West Wing is doing that movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's writing it, which makes it which makes it to me a must see,  because I think he's just brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It'll be a lot better than if anyone else did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's for sure. He's just a brilliant writer.  And I think this is this is going to be his means.  When Dana Dana sent me an email,  I think that he can get us the author Ben Mezrich.  So we're going to try to get him on a show and interview him  because Ben did a lot of research for this.  It should be very interesting.  So we get that interview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There aren't a lot of good movies about geeks,  and this would be interesting if they could actually make this.  What's the best geek movie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it Triumph of the Nerds?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, Pirates of Silicon Valley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was pretty good, wasn't it?  That was Noah Wiley as Steve Jobs, right?  Yeah, I think so. Yeah.  And Gates. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you didn't like that?  No, I didn't think so.  Has it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You think it's never been a good one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I still like, you know, again, this is old school.  This may be my age, but I have always liked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't say Sneakers with Robert Redford.  I'm going to hang up on you.  Sneakers was good. I'm going to say screw you.  War Games. War Games.  That is a great movie. Yeah.  We had John Badham, the director on Screensavers.  Remember that, Kevin? And he had a that was fun.  He had his like scrapbook from the production of the movie and everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although there's a really interesting television show that has started  airing that is very geek oriented called Warehouse 13.  Have you all seen that? I haven't seen that.  No. There's a it's a it's kind of an X-Files  fringe ripoff in which there are two government agents  who are assigned to the warehouse where mystical artifacts  have been collected by the government and they have to go out each week  and get a different. It's the X-Files.  It is the X-Files. But but the the the person who stays behind,  who's kind of their kind of their mentor is a I forget the actor's name,  but he plays basically a computer geek.  And in the last episode, he was using  IP traces to find out who was to hack into his computer.  And, you know, the technology that they were discussing and what  it wasn't just like buzzwords like on 24.  You know, I cringe when they start talking about computers.  This was like they were talking about the real tech.  And I was pretty impressed.  So as a as a geek, I'm going to keep watching it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's your favorite geek movie, Kevin? You got one by the Matrix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That counts. That's a great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I was watching the original Terminator,  which, by the way, looks incredibly dated  the other day.  And I was looking closely at the stuff that was scrolling by,  you know, when he'd look at stuff and go,  and it was bad, it was shell script.  It was bash script. I don't know where they got it.  But it was kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was like little Unix commands going across the school.  There was some geek behind the scenes there.  Yeah, clearly. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But usually it's just pathetic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, normally it's so fake.  All the geeks are like, oh, why did you even do that?  You know, they try and make it look real and like high tech and futuristic.  It's always when they're showing the operating system, right? Exactly.  And then they zoom in on the computer and it's like, it's horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Giant letters. Press this button to hack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I like that.  Or I like the I like it when they show a picture of the person  and you can't quite make it out and they press that button that says like,  I don't know what it is, but it's like it makes it so much clearer  so you can finally see the picture of the person.  It's like if a camera caught someone and it's all pixelated,  they just hit a special button.  It makes it like all of a sudden crystal clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Correction. It's they're telling me the chairman calling saying, of course,  it wasn't bash shell. It was assembly language.  It was loads and moves. That's right.  I'm remembering it now.  Load, move, all that stuff.  Somebody says King of Kong.  That was I haven't seen that.  That's the one about either the guy was a Donkey Kong player, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was great.  Definitely, definitely Netflix, that one.  All right. So good documentary.  Yeah. Documentary about this crazy guy that just got so passionate  about Donkey Kong that he had to get the high score.  And there's this other guy that tried to cheat.  I mean, it was just phenomenal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's really good.  A couple of votes for an oldie, but goodie Colossus, the Forbman project.  That was a pretty bad movie.  But it's still funny.  And in its time and kind of the did war games war games  must have come out, Kevin, when you were a kid.  Yeah, I was really into that.  I was going to say it must have influenced you a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely. I love war games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that was.  Yeah, I think that influenced a whole generation of hackers, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a blog post that I did actually a couple of years ago  called 15 Geek Movies to See Before You Die.  And it went to the front of dig when it came out  and somebody resubmitted it last week.  And it went again to the front of dig this week.  There you go. And so double Doug, I have been double Doug.  That's my big double dig.  Yes, it's my first dig.  But and thanks for the traffic, Kevin.  Excellent.  But what's funny is that I did not include Blade Runner on that list.  Oh, and I got in the we close comments after so many days on our blogs  just because of spammers.  And so there was no comments on the on the second time around.  But it what was funny was all the abuse.  If you go in that post, there's a link off the front of my blog.  If you go in there, there's all this abuse I took for that.  And if I ever redo it, I think I'll add it just to keep myself from being.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a great shot.  And I'm on, you know, Fifth Element is one of those things that divides people.  I liked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have how can you not love Mila Jovovich?  I agree. Most amazing, beautiful woman in the entire universe.  I agree.  Just turn it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Turn off the sound and watch her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, come on.  Who doesn't love multi pass?  Multi pass.  I just love that.  And total recall.  There's a good one.  Mm hmm.  The daughter of Schwarzenegger.  All right. Enough.  Amazon in a bit of trouble.  Because they delete they reached into people's Kindle.  If you had a copy of 1984 or some other George Orwell books on your Kindle,  they reached into it and deleted them.  Now, initially, this was a PR nightmare because all Amazon said is these books  are no longer available on the Kindle, so we're deleting them.  And then it comes out.  And in fact, the publisher of these books did not have the rights to distribute the books.  However, it certainly raised a furor, probably rightly so, because,  you know, if you bought a pirated book or pirated movie, did you go, Kevin, to the,  what was it, the Fang Jing bookstore?  You go in the basement there and there's every program ever made for like 75 cents.  I did not.  Unbelievable.  I mean, wide open.  I mean, there's no IP protection in China.  But let's say you bought a pirated book.  What if the bookstore came into your house, took the book, left a buck fifty on the nightstand  and said, you can't have it anymore?  Were you upset by this, Dwight?  Did you think this was going too far on Amazon's part?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's yes.  I've one of the problems I have with the Kindle in general is it's digital rights management.  And the fact that, you know, if you buy a book, you can't do kind of the most human  thing you could do with a book via Kindle.  You can't like loan somebody else a book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That always bugged me because my wife particularly, that's she'll read a book and then lend it out.  Publishers love this because they sell a copy for each person.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I suggested in a blog post a while back that what they ought to do is allow you to  lend your copy to another Kindle user, but it's unavailable, say, for two weeks to you.  You can't read it or look at it.  And after two weeks, it vanishes from their collection and then they can't read it if  they've not finished it.  And I think that that would be a way kind of to take that, keep that paradigm going.  It's kind of like a zoom where you can squirt it.  Right. Right.  Essentially squirt the book.  I just had to say squirt.  So I think that, you know, it was certainly it's outrageous if you have that on your book.  By the same token, what happened that they allowed a publisher to sell a book that it  didn't have the rights to?  Well, they have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have I'm sure they'll change this, but they have that kind of automated self-publishing  system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they had said that they said that this won't happen again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they said they'll never delete books from your they will never delete books from your  system again, according to Beak Cashmore.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what happens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I said, what happens if you have a book that you don't have the rights to and and there's  a there's a dispute about it.  You know, that means that Amazon doesn't if they say that, that means that they will not  do that.  And that is not a that's not a resolution for them.  I don't think they can say they'll never do it.  But it certainly brings a it really highlights kind of one of the limitations of ebooks and  particularly those that are that are handled wirelessly like that.  It makes sense.  I don't know.  I'm not sure I'd buy one now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just seems to me that what they should do is consider that once you've purchased  a book and it's transferred to your device, that is now in your home.  Right. And they can't break into your home and take something back once you've bought  it. It's kind of like what happens with your iPhone.  If you buy an application and they remove the app from the iPhone, the store, they can't  go in your phone and take it off.  It's still on your phone, even though the application has been pulled down.  I think that was a they have that capability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They do have that yet.  They have. There's a kill bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they've never done.  They've never used a few different apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no. That tethering app, which they pulled very quickly, is still out there.  That's sure.  Yeah. But so they haven't used it, but they do have the capability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. The other thing that bothered me with the Kindle is I was I was on it the other  day and it all of a sudden just flashed a screen saying performing updates.  And then it did a software update and rebooted on me.  And it didn't give me the option to say I don't want the update.  Just all of a sudden started to do it and then just reboot it.  I don't know what additional software was installing.  Like, what if I didn't want that latest version?  Like, that was kind of weird to me as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So should I replace my Kindle?  I mean, what else am I going to put?  I mean, the Sony reader, the Sony.  I have a Sony. I have the five of five.  It's exactly the same screen.  I think the thing about the Kindle is that wireless ability to download.  But that's the same ability that gives them the chance to do those things.  Right. How about Sony?  Whispernet all the time. That's how I buy books.  You hook up your Kindle to your computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I just I go on Amazon dot com and say send the Kindle and then it just automatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK. Well, you're using it.  You're just using it for the other end.  But almost I've never done that.  Maybe with subscriptions, but always with books, I buy it on the Kindle,  which is I mean, I think that's a really nice feature.  But you see the sample.  Yeah, you get the first chapter.  You read it if you like it.  Who was it told me that that's what he does.  He'll load up the Kindle.  Maybe Alex Lindsay will load up the Kindle with first chapters.  I do that, too, before he gets on the plane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe it was you said that I do that with 10 or 15 books at a time.  It's loaded up and things I think I might be interested in.  Read the first chapter. If you like it, boom, done.  It's on there. Credit to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess it was you who said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't think it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you obviously you're not alone. Yeah.  And then if you like the book, you buy it.  Exactly. I don't I wouldn't do that because I don't like to read a lot of first chapters.  And then I have this weird Puritan ethic, I think, that some somebody drilled into me  that it's like cleaning your plate.  You have to finish a book once you start it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not right. That's you can tell a lot.  During the first first the first chapter, though,  whether or not you're going to like it or get into it, you know, I feel that way.  Anyway, you'd start reading something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I agree. But then I feel compelled to finish it like I'm a bad boy  if I don't finish the book.  We have any Anatole who does that, by the way, that Dane just told me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you are the king of the Internet, you can do whatever you want.  I'm not the king. I'm the president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm duly elected. This is a republic.  Go ahead. You know, sorry, Dwight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you connect the Sony reader to its software,  even though you're not connecting wirelessly, let's say you do an update  or download a book, is it possible that Sony could delete something  from the reader in that way?  And what's in their terms of service with regard to that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course, I'm sure they can.  And, you know, the frankly, I don't like this.  That's the main reason I like the ebook reader is I have to use Windows,  I think, to get stuff on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, there's no Mac version. Maybe there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I seem to remember I had to boot Windows.  So. OK, so our consensus is they didn't.  They shouldn't have done that, but they're not going to do it again. So.  But now, what do I buy? Do I buy another Kindle?  I don't think there's anything like it.  How many books did you have on there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On my Kindle now, maybe 10 that I purchased or so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What? How many books were on your Kindle, Leo? A ton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know what I had to do when I realized this when I got home,  since they didn't call me back saying we have your Kindle,  I had to deactivate it because somebody could, you know, it's activated.  You can buy stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Could you tell if anybody had possibly bought something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't. Yes, because I would have gotten an email from Amazon saying.  And you did not. I don't think so.  I have to check and make sure. But yeah, I don't think so.  So but I deactivated it last night thinking, oh, shoot.  Now I have to, you know, now I can't, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh. Was it the first first first kindle of the second kindle?  Was it the thin one or the fat one? Kindle two, of course.  That's the one that has the cracks from the.  You know, what's the story there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't I didn't get any cracks.  You have cracks on yours, Kevin? No cracks.  Do you have cracks? Dwight, do you have one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I don't have one.  But the cracks apparently are coming from the protective case  that Amazon sells as a $30 option.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the one I'm using that leather.  Kindle. I like that leather.  Into the it kind of acts in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And apparently at that joint, it has started cracking.  That plastic is real thin.  And at some point, it cracks enough that it damages the screen.  Oh, initially, they just said they didn't indicate they would replace them.  But now they're saying they'll replace them free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can I say I threw it away? Can you still replace it?  Oh, it was all cracked. I threw it out.  Oh, I can get a new one. Oh, could you send me a new one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you think that's right? You threw it out on the plane.  I threw it out on the plane.  So you just left it on the plane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I said, I don't want it anymore.  Oh, you'll fix it.  How's yours, Kevin? Is it cracked?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No cracks so far, so good.  I have that case as well, though. So me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I bought that because it's a it's a nice case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The cheapest one to like see the other cases like $200  almost for a case like these designer cases.  I just don't get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, and this is it's nice.  It's leather and it makes it like a book.  You feel like you should have something over that screen. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the same.  I have a still the review unit for for the Kindle DX.  I have the big one and it uses the same design.  It's got those L shaped brackets that fit in.  And that hasn't cracked, but I'm curious.  That's also happening with the DX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm looking at the Kindle 2, 299.  Here's my opportunity for 489 to buy a DX.  Should I buy the DX, Dwight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think so. It's you know, it's  I like to read in bed and that's where I do most of my reading.  And I like lay on my side.  Me too. Is it too big for that?  Yeah, it's uncomfortable.  It's comfortable if you're like sitting in a in a chair, like in a recliner or  because it feels like a hardback book.  And it's about that size.  And so it's it's actually comfortable in that way.  But it's just a little too big, I think, for for casual use or comfortable use.  I prefer the little one if I were going to get one.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My sister and I actually split the cost  I want and got it for my dad for Father's Day, the DX.  And he likes it because when you're reading a newspaper,  it feels a lot more like newspaper format.  It's not so, you know, scrunched down and tiny.  So he really enjoys his.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's you know, that's one thing I subscribed to the New Yorker,  Atlantic, monthly salon, a bunch of periodicals.  And I don't like reading them on the Kindle because it's just it's it's it's.  So I kind of gave up on periodicals and just buy books.  Books are fine. If you're doing something linear, it's fine.  I hate to support, you know, and this is something comes up for me a lot.  I hate to support DRM, but there's there's times you just don't have a choice.  Audible is an example. Kindle, same thing.  I mean, I'd love to take to be political, you know, be be principled  and take a stand and say, well, I'm not going to buy it.  But then you don't get the benefit of it either.  Can I work within the system as president?  Try to change things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can do whatever you want.  That's right. You do what you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Except have a BlackBerry.  I think I had to give up my BlackBerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wasn't there a Linux distro for the Kindle a while ago  that they figured out how to hack it and get in there and open everything up?  That did happen a while ago. Oh, that would be cool.  Sounds like some that would be cool.  Something that'll break your Kindle.  Before I leave it, it wasn't so expensive, but the Kindle was like,  you know, one of those seventy five dollar, ninety nine dollar devices.  Hack away. You'd be hacking them all up and down the street.  But the fact that they're like four hundred dollars,  no one wants to take the risk.  Hack away. You don't want to brick Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I don't know if you saw this story in the New York Times, Kevin.  I thought I put this in our list of stories to cover.  It came out yesterday, so you probably haven't.  The crowd is wise when it's focused.  Of course, at Digg, one of the kind of the seminal inspirations  that you had for Digg was let the audience decide what stories are big stories.  Crowd source, the wisdom of the crowds.  And they call it in this article open innovation.  I don't know if you've heard that term before.  I have not. So.  So. This is a couple of scientists, of course, Netflix,  the Netflix prize was where this all kind of got started.  Netflix said a couple of years ago, in fact, that they would pay a million dollars  to anybody who could improve their their movie recommendations,  which are notoriously sucky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I heard someone just did that. Yeah. Week ago. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So on June 26th.  Statisticians, a seven person team of statisticians from the US,  Austria, Canada and Israel and AT&T research.  I mean, these are the these are these guys finally did.  All they had to do was improve them by 10 percent.  The way it works is they did that 10 percent.  I don't know what the metric is.  Somehow they measure it.  On June 26th. But then the rivals have 30 days to beat it.  And I guess we're coming, you know, in a week.  They'll get to claim a million dollar prize.  This is actually a very smart thing for Netflix to do,  because it gives you a goal, gives you a metric.  Encourage them with enough money behind it,  encourages people to really work at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And a million bucks is cheap.  You know, that's that's six, that's six, five or six engineers for a year's work.  You know, point. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hope in glory they get glory. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Open innovation models.  Are adopted to overcome the constraints of corporate hierarchies.  But successful projects are typically hybrids of ideas  flowing from a decentralized crowd, a la dig.  Plus a hierarchy winnowing and making decisions.  In other words, using the crowd plus editorial.  You you've always resisted doing that.  TechMeme just recently hired editorial people.  Have you ever considered that, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I don't know that.  It's you'll have to see what we're working on next.  We have we have a big, big new redesign and launch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love this every time Kevin's on Twitter.  I know. Every time.  I know it's great.  It just shows how how much you're working on it right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just think that there's there's like  that's a last resort, right?  Like if you get to a point where I have like just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a slippery slope to full editorial control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just hate to have to have someone in control  of what makes it on the front page, having like one individual  that sits there and says yes or no to something.  I'm totally with you. I'm totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was the whole thing you want to avoid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. So I don't know.  I think that when we know I don't want to.  I'll get in trouble if I start talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the what's the timing? Can you say timing?  Few months.  You're so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, one book I highly recommend, though,  The Wisdom of the Wisdom of Crowds, the book James Sirawicki.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't it a great book? I just started reading that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You never read that? I never read that.  I read it in China.  And I was blown away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the book that validates everything you're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel embarrassed to say that I've never read that  because I've had reporters ask me in the past,  so like, what do you think of the book?  And I'm just like, oh, I've never had a chance to check it out.  And I read it. I was just like, I'm sitting there like  I consumed it in like six hours.  Isn't it great? So sucked into it.  It was so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he's a he's a writer for The New Yorker and really, really talented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So to me, tech meme has changed since they've added a human editor.  I mean, you can I think you can tell that there's a person kind of push.  Change for the better or worse?  Um, I don't know. I haven't decided yet, but I'm sure that's the question, isn't it?  You can tell, I think.  And I think that one of the things that's better is there are things that show up  there that aren't from the usual suspects.  Tech meme had kind of become the usual suspects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was almost too easy to game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess. And but and but I'm curious what Kevin thinks of it,  because, you know, he's operating something that that is a  that is pure crowd sourcing or as close as you can get, I think, to be pure.  What do you think of what's happened with tech meme? Can you tell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think that I don't spend enough time.  I visit tech meme a couple of times a week, so I don't know that I would notice  a difference, but I think that one of the things I've noticed with with with Dig  is that some days you'll look at the front page and you'll scan the top stories  and the stories that have been promoted.  And you're like, oh, those there's two here out of the list.  I like I don't like the others.  I don't understand why they're on the page.  And I think this is stupid.  But then sometimes you'll come back to the site and you'll say,  there's no way any sane editor would have picked that story.  And it's awesome. Right.  And so you get it. Right.  You know what I mean? So so sometimes it works with you.  Sometimes it works against you.  It's it's just like it really depends on what your flavor of news is.  And I think that we've always had the random aspect going for dig  where you never know what you're going to get.  And that's what I think actually pulled in a lot of people  to view the site in the first place, is it wasn't just your standard, same old  editorial driven news site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm curious. One of the things that surprises me about my own industry  is I would think that more newspapers would be and just general publications  that are doing the web would try something like a  dig version of their front page.  I've seen people talking about it, but not a lot of people have actually done it.  And there are a lot of dig clones out there like, you know, a curtsy.  But Yahoo Buzz or Yahoo Buzz, right.  Which which actually is, you know, the the newspaper consortium  is heavily involved with that.  A lot of that's true. Yeah.  Oh, interesting.  But but what's interesting is that I, you know, I haven't seen kind of other people  trying to do that. And and I'd love to do it.  You know, if we we just don't have the resources to point at that yet.  But but I think it's a great idea.  And I'm also real interested in the idea of a hybrid of of a human  and and and crowdsource, you know, an editor and crowdsource collaboration.  And I think you could get an editor in sync with the crowd.  I think that you actually might be able to do it.  I don't know if they've done that at TechMeme yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kind of lightweight mediation.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm curious what Kevin's going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you see a lot of even major news sites now  that are starting to experiment with different ways of doing this.  I mean, even if you look at like CNN, you see, you know,  they're now placing a lot more prominence on big sections such as,  you know, most viewed, most emailed, most tweeted, most dug, whatever it may be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And, you know, that's the one I always go to right away, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely. Because you know, that's going to be the good stuff.  It's always the good stuff. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's one way that we have, in fact, one of the few ways  that works that we have of mediating the huge amount of information  that's on the Internet.  And and, you know, that's why I use and how I use Twitter and FriendFeed  is I let people surface the stories, the important stories.  I don't use my news readers as much as I used to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's weird. I haven't used RSS in a while now, actually. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Twitter takes place of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google Reader is trying more and more to incorporate those,  you know, social aspects, but it just doesn't seem to do it as well as just  just follow follow Twitter or I use FriendFeed just because it  friend feeds everything, you know, like I was following you in China, Kevin,  because it aggregated all of the stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's weird. And then when you look at like where we spend,  we have our we each have our own daily stops, right?  You may go to like FriendFeed and Twitter and Dig and a handful of others.  And I figure if it doesn't show up on one of those sites,  I probably don't need to know about it, right?  It's going to be on one of those sites that I really care about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't you can not answer this, Kevin, and you can we can move on  and go to something else. But I do want to ask you about the dig bar.  Sure. Now, originally, there was some criticism.  In fact, this was one of the things that the last time you were on,  you said we're going to launch it.  And I thought actually a brilliant idea to do a URL shortening service.  Got some criticism because it was framing.  But you change that.  And now, according to Jason Kincaid in today's TechCrunch,  which I always take with a grain of salt,  it says that you've changed it.  He says the change is a subtle one will have major implications.  Typically, when you use a link shortening service,  anyone who clicks on your shortened link will be sent directly  to the original article without a landing page.  Now the dig bar.  Apparently sends you to dig.com. Is that true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a good question.  I've been gone for two weeks.  So I don't I don't know what got pushed, what code got pushed  and how it functions. But the last my last understanding is that  what we wanted to do is have it so that if you click on a dig URL,  it takes you to the dig story so that you can dig it. Right.  And just rather than providing a short URL service that just forwards  this redirection, we would just do a URL service just for dig articles,  just like the same way that TechCrunch does like TechCrunch slash 85374.  If you go to that, you're not going to go to some other site.  You're going to go to TechCrunch. That's the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're backing off on the original idea, which is a general URL  shortening service to say, really, this is our this is really the dig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is just if you see one of these links, it's going to take you to a dig story.  And but don't mark my don't don't.  I'm not sure if that's what's been pushed yet. Right.  I haven't been to the office in two weeks.  So that was where we're going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That makes sense to me.  And I understand the reasoning to do that.  That's where your revenue comes from.  If you link just to the story, you don't get the page view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we've it's weird.  We've had this hybrid system for a long time where some of the URLs  have gone out just directly to the source.  Another URL will go out and draw the bar if you're logged in user.  And then we also had it where it would take you directly  to the permalink page if it was from Twitter.  And the reason for that is because we were sending out  all of these links through our we had this this this feed on Twitter.  It's at dig underscore 2000 or maybe it's all dig 2000  where it's any story that's received 2000 digs goes out  and that has several hundred thousand followers.  That's good. I'm going to follow that. That's great.  Yeah, it's just like the best of the best stuff. Right.  And so we had that feed and it's beginning really popular.  But the problem that we had is that we were sending all the people  directly to the source and they didn't know how to dig the article.  And they're like, well, what if I want to go back and dig it?  So we made those URLs just go to the permalink page.  But then people were confused because those ones were going to the permalink.  Other ones were not in getting the toolbar.  And so we were like, OK, we need to make this simple  and just make it do one thing all the time. Right.  So it's a unified experience for everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now looking, you have 12 dig pages for the different categories.  Dig images, world news, environment, technology, software.  So you could follow if I were interested, as I am dig technology news,  I just follow that.  And is that what is that duplicate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So any time a story gets promoted in technology on dig,  it will come and come into your Twitter feed if you're following it.  Cool. The Dig 2000 is by far the most popular, though.  That's just stories that have received 2000 or more digs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is huge. Yeah.  That means those are the biggest stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's only that's only going to be, you know,  maybe five stories a day or something like that.  So it's just the best of the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And when I click that link, it brings it to the dig page,  which makes sense because I'm logged in to dig in that way.  If I read it, I can dig it. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. Otherwise, you wouldn't know how to get to the article to dig it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And to be fair, that's the ad page.  That's where the revenue is. That's how we make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, got to pay the bills. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think that that seems logical.  I don't think that there's a reason to complain about that.  It's just a change, I guess.  And, you know, anytime this is always the case,  you make a change. Some people are going to get upset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's you just get the funny thing is I used to get really upset about that.  But at the end of the day, it's like,  I don't know, you just got to you have to evolve and make changes  and not worry about every single person every time.  Like, you can't worry about what the masses are always going to say.  You just have to do what's right for your long term vision, if that makes sense.  And what's going to be right for, like, the consumer.  So it makes sense to everyone down the road, because right now, the way we had it,  it was completely broken where some people were getting confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And certain I know it was broken.  I didn't get what was going to happen.  I couldn't predict what was going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And that's that's a bad thing.  You don't ever want to have a situation like that. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I'm a little jet lagged.  As am I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I never liked the social media bars.  I didn't really like the big bar.  I kind of decided I don't want framing. I don't know. Right.  John Gruber of Daring Fireball was most scathing about the big bar.  And in its initial incarnation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm getting I'm getting kind of fed up with shortened  you are shortened URLs in general, which is why I kind of prefer  if it's a dig URL goes to dig, then I know that or a tech.  I know what you're dealing with. Right.  Because because now I mean, I use bitly.  But the problem is, you don't know what you're going to get.  And especially nowadays that the Web is so dangerous,  clicking on links without knowing where you're going is just it's a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there's a lot of Twitter clients now that will show you  what the full URL is of a shortened URL.  I think Tweety will do that. You have to turn it on.  But I have those turned on wherever I can.  And obviously that that saves me some grief, I think, when you're using it.  I like short URLs.  And obviously in Twitter, you have to you got to have them. Right.  But I know ones where I see them, where I know it will generate  like Ali will generate a social bar.  And I just won't click on them. I just don't go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's one of the things you have to be aware of, too.  It's like we've seen some of that happening when we used to.  When we did the short URL service and and I've also seen other services happening  as you get spam emails now with these short URLs.  And if you see a name, you see a name that you recognize.  You're like, oh, I I trust bitly. Right.  Because I've clicked on bitly things in the past that have come through  my Twitter feed and they've been OK.  You know, this is what the average consumer is most likely thinking.  They see that they click it and then all of a sudden, you know, malware site  or whatever it may be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's one of the reasons I use friend feed because they do that.  And the power Twitter, which is a really nice Firefox app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, power Twitter is good.  I would like to see that feature where short URLs are expanded,  built into Office 2010 and Outlook 2010.  I think that would be very handy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you think of this Microsoft 2010 Outlook announcement?  It's all going to be on the web. Is that the idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there's a version of it that will be on the web.  It'll be like you pay a monthly fee.  Well, actually, for for casual use, it's free.  It's going to be at Windows Live as part of the Windows Live package  and it'll be free. But for companies to use it, apparently,  it will be there'll be a fee for it, just like Google Docs, basically. Right. Right.  And that's that's the competition.  And the idea, you know, that you go and have that familiar office interface  or well, as familiar as the ribbon is to people.  It that'll be the big draw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I want to add, I just saw in our chat room that Frank McCourt passed away.  Oh, yeah. Angela's Ashes.  He was 78.  And that means since I get another audible book pick,  I really want to encourage you to get Angela's Ashes.  He reads it and it is fantastic.  One of my favorite audiobooks of all time.  So there's your second audible pick in honor of Frank McCourt.  We should also mention Walter Cronkite passed away a couple of days ago.  The Dean of Journalism, were you influenced?  You're of an age like me, you're of an age where Walter Cronkite was it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. And and, you know, I kind of grew up with the news with him.  I remember that Kennedy assassination through his news report.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He pulled off his glasses and you could see his eyes tearing up.  And he was visibly shaken.  And he said the president has died.  I mean, I'll never I'll never forget that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the moon, you know, it was funny that he or interesting that he died  during the 40th anniversary of the moon landing  period where we were doing a lot of the Chronicle.  Obviously, we're doing a lot of things with.  Sure. Houston is where the space center was.  And I remember as a kid, my parents had given me a little reel to reel tape  recorder and several years before this.  And because there was no VCR and there was no way to record television,  I sat in front of our Ford Philco  television set with my holding up the microphone  to the speaker so I could have the moon landing recorded.  And, you know, I went back and listened to it a few times.  I was a kid. It was great.  And there's Walter Cronkite again getting emotional as  as Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I from Mercury through Gemini, through Apollo, I watched Walter,  all those launches.  And of course, you never forget the ones where there were holds.  And Walter Cronkite, who was known in his early career as an AP  reporter, as old iron pants, because he could sit there  for days on end, you know, and he had to during these launches  with little more than an expert, you know, Frank McGee or somebody  sitting next to him, I guess McGee was on NBC, but an expert sitting next to him  and a model of the Saturn rocket and just going,  this is stage one of the set.  I mean, just going on and on.  And it was gripping. He was brilliant.  Did you watch his last?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you remember his last newscast? Did you? I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tell us about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I was sitting, I saw it in Austin.  I was in college and I went with a bunch of friends to a  to Mr. Gaddy's just off the drag off Guadalupe Street.  And we ordered a bunch of pictures of beer and a lot of pizza.  And we watched it.  And I remember at the end of it, I expected something kind of more  dramatic. And it was just kind of like, oh, OK.  It was like the only time he ever really disappointed me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the way it is.  What did he say? The last words were that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think he did say that's the way it is, just that's the way it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I interviewed him for an hour after his retirement.  I think this is 90 or 91.  And one of the most engaging interviews I've ever had,  it was it was actually one of my last interviews before I started doing only  tech. And I'll never forget it.  He was just an amazing journalist  and an inspiration to us all.  And the guy who really ended the Vietnam War, because when Walter Cronkite  in 1968 said,  we're losing this war, it's all over, they're lying to us.  That's when Lyndon Johnson said,  we've lost. It's over.  If we've lost Walter Cronkite, we've lost the nation.  So very, very powerful.  Hey, I want to mention, since we are in the 40th anniversary and tomorrow,  today, maybe as you're listening to this, is the 40th anniversary  of Neil Armstrong's first step on the moon.  There's a really great site that somebody sent me in the chat room  called WeChooseTheMoon.org.  I don't know if you've seen this site.  It's put together by the Kennedy Presidential Library,  and AOL is doing the server.  It's got live audio transmissions  from a shopcast of the...  And NASA's been doing this to the audio.  It has incredible animations, video.  Did you read that NASA overwrote, they erased the original moon landing tapes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they have.  They were not really into recording.  Shocking. Back then, it was just a direct broadcast.  And what you saw on your television in 1969 was a camera  pointed at the big screen at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.  And so you're seeing a picture of a picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sounds like a conspiracy to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did they really walk on the moon?  I hate the moon hoaxers.  I don't think the moon hoaxers even deserve a dialogue.  I kind of embarrassed them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You remember a couple of years ago, somebody came up to Buzz Aldrin  and said it was all a lie, and Buzz Aldrin popped him one.  Yeah. Boom! And knocked it.  And it was boom! It was like, good for you, Buzz.  Oh, well, I think that all that Collins, Aldrin and Armstrong  are going to be on stage tomorrow at an event.  You know why I think it's important to  memorialize this, to remember it, is because I want us to go to Mars.  I want us to continue on. Yep.  I think that's so very important.  You know, I know we're in tough economic times, but  this is what keeps this is this is what keeps a human race  looking forward is this kind of thing. I think it's so important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think we need to. I think that's kind of  of course, I'm a child of science fiction and yes.  And I but I think that's our destiny.  It's our destiny to to leave the planet and go elsewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm reading a book I highly recommend.  It's also an audible Kim Stanley Robinson's book.  He's got a trilogy about Mars that is a very heavy duty  scientific.  You know, this guy does hard sci fi and obviously like became a Mars expert  because he's he he describes in great detail  what would be involved in colonizing Mars.  And it's wonderful. Highly recommend it.  There's a detective story in there.  If you like sci fi, it's called well, the first one's red Mars.  And then there's blue Mars and green Mars, red, green.  And it's Kim Stanley Robinson.  It is fantastic.  I've read it. Ben Bova also wrote a book about Mars exploration.  That's very good. But this is this is the one that if you really want to kind of  visualize what it would need to be like, what we would need to do.  They say the biggest problem is that is the length of the flight.  We you know, you lose so much bone and muscle mass in zero gravity that  that's the that's the problem that has to be solved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there's also no way to really adequately shield ourselves  for that length of time from the radiation that's out.  Well, one of the things to be I sound like Walter Cronkite.  There's no way to shield yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of the things that can happen.  This is this is actually in the book.  One of the first instances there's a solar flare and they have to shield.  It's really great. It's a wonderful, wonderful novel.  But let's remember 40 years ago, you don't remember it, Kevin.  You're too young, sad to say.  But I remember getting up in the middle of the night.  I was 12 to watch the eagle land, you know, tranquility base here.  The eagle has landed.  And then a few hours later, watch Neil Armstrong step off that ladder  onto a surface they didn't even know if, you know, if it was safe,  they thought it was possible it could sink right in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So a momentous occasion for that had to be so scary.  I mean, can you imagine getting off and being like,  I don't know if I'm going to step down there?  That could that could be moon quicksand right there.  And I don't know. You don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, amazing, just amazing.  Yeah, but these guys, you know, I mean, these are the bravest men in the world.  I mean, these guys, they're sitting on a rocket.  You know, I mean, it's basically controlled explosion  that's going to launch them to the moon.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  There's a book, I forget the name of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know the name of the author because of his name.  Craig Nelson wrote it. It's about Apollo 11.  And we interviewed him on Wednesday on Technology Bites, the Pacifica  Computer Call-In Show that I do.  And he told this great story about Neil Armstrong.  You know, they were test pilots, so they were used to the idea of danger  and possibly dying.  And apparently at one point, Armstrong was working with a rocket  based simulator of the lunar module and it crashed.  It kind of crashed and burned up and he walked away from it,  you know, without being injured.  And his remark was, well, we lost another pilot.  Well, we lost another piece of equipment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These guys.  Well, if you read the right stuff, of course, right,  Wolf's kind of semi-fictional.  It's supposed to be true.  And I guess it is a story of the first Mercury astronauts.  I mean, these guys were crazy. Chuck Yeager and the like.  Somebody is mentioning that a gratuitous plug here,  Mark Pelletier is in our chat room that we did an interview.  Mark did an interview with Buzz Aldrin and you can listen to it still.  It's one of our Futures in Biotech episodes, FIB 23,  if you want to listen to Buzz's account of landing on the moon.  Of course, we'll hear a lot from Aldrin and Armstrong and Collins  through the next few days. It's a big deal.  I'll take a quick break. Come back, talk more about some.  We've got some quick news about the PC industry completely collapsing.  And we're doing we're doing a special tweet with a couple of jet lag guys  just back from China, Kevin Rose and myself.  And of course, Stratt Silverman of the Houston Chronicle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just sleepy. That's all.  I just want to nap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What time is it now? It's seven thirty in the morning.  So we're just getting up in China. That's right. Yeah.  We're just waking up.  I do want to mention our friends at Citrix and the great GoToMyPC.  I could have used this and I planned ahead.  I should have really planned ahead.  I didn't really realize how blocked the Internet would have been.  I could have used GoToMyPC to log into my systems here.  Basically, I use it as a VPN.  128-bit encryption means you secure end to end. It is the best.  I love GoToMyPC, a fantastic product from Citrix.  And I want you to give it a try by going to gotomypc.com  slash twit, G-O-T-O-M-Y-P-C dot com slash twit.  You could try it free for 30 days.  Citrix knows how to make a product that is straightforward,  simple to use and yet, you know, sophisticated.  This is this is going to give you the state of the art and remote access  better than anything else out there.  But all you need is a web browser.  Just go to gotomypc.com slash twit.  Click the download link in two minutes. You'll be set up.  Now, any other computer you go to, whether you're in China,  whether you're in Timbuktu, doesn't matter.  You open a web browser, get online, go to gotomypc.com,  enter your secure username password, click connect.  And there it is, your office PC.  You can use it remotely, run any program, send and receive email,  access any network resource.  They couldn't make it easier.  They couldn't make it more secure. There's nothing better.  If you need to access your PC from anywhere you are, go to gotomypc.com  slash twit and give it a try.  I had it set up.  Just wasn't thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what they never do?  They never mentioned the biggest use for GoToMyPC,  and that's fixing my parents computer.  It's true.  Seriously, because they have a PC and it's the easiest way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Works Macs and PCs now. Absolutely.  It's just very straightforward and it's fast because they've got the algorithms  to make this as speedy as can be over almost any network connection.  Go to my PC dot com slash twit.  Thank you so much for their support of the twit network.  So we're going to see it.  We're going to start to see a lot of second quarter reports.  But so far, what we've seen is not so hot.  Dell down 19 percent year to year.  They have 26 percent of the market share, still number one over HP,  because everybody else slipped. Apple slipped.  Down 12 and a quarter percent, 12 and a half percent from last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Overall, those are animal analyst estimates and do it animal estimates.  Apple will do its  analyst call earnings call this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I stand corrected. I'm sorry. Yeah.  In fact, we don't know.  You know, Apple traditionally undersells overperforms.  So the analyst could be completely wrong on this one.  Gartner says that PC units sales fell five percent.  But that's better than some some expected as much as nine to 10 percent.  Is the PC industry in a doldrums?  Is it is shambles?  Is everything falling apart or is this just kind of delayed bad economy stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't see the reason to buy another PC.  I don't think that's the real problem, isn't it?  It's like we browse the web, we check our email, we send tweets,  we watch movies and we use iTunes.  And the computer has been able to do that at fast speeds for several years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Starting to sound like an old fart.  No, I'm just saying, hey, pay.  I said this to Craig Barrett at Intel.  I said, who needs a two gigahertz processor?  He said, only old fart journalists like you ask me that question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo, take that and couple it with a bad economy.  And there's no reason to ever upgrade for the foreseeable future. Right.  Like I've had the same concern for a couple of years now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think Windows seven will change that people will go?  Because that's how people upgrade Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the people that upgraded to Vista are going to upgrade to Windows seven  just because they're so pissed off at how bad this is.  They want to get out of that.  Yes. But yeah, I mean, I think I think Windows seven is a big step in the right direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Windows seven will sell computers, right, Dwight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yes, definitely.  And but not as not as much as a window, a new copy of Windows used to in the past.  You know, it used to be that's what everybody waited for. Right. Right.  Well, and Kevin makes the point that people are going to want to buy  Windows seven to get out of Vista.  But there are a lot of people who don't trust Microsoft now as a result of Vista  and won't upgrade probably until they get themselves a new computer.  But I think this is probably the main reason that we don't buy a lot of computers anymore.  And I think it's I think smartphones, you know, smartphones are kind of a bright spot  in terms of sales in the industry.  And I think that this may be particularly as the if the iPhone moves to more than just one  carrier, I think that the PC industry has a lot to worry about.  You think that's going to happen?  Point. That's the point.  I think, well, you know, I don't know if I were Apple, certainly they're in the catbird  seat right now because they're in the negotiation supposedly with AT&T  over extending the exclusivity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Please, Apple, don't please.  We beg of you. Go Verizon. Right.  We want Verizon. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I can see I can see Apple, you know, if the if the deal  if they can get a better deal from AT&T than they can from anybody else.  And there's something in there that, you know, the bottom line, isn't it?  Right. Right. And that they can extend their market share.  You know, they may look at the numbers and say, OK, it's time to, you know, the best way  and the best deal that we can get is to is to end the exclusivity.  What I'd be curious about is what if Apple does another exclusive deal?  What if they instead of saying AT&T and Verizon, they just drop AT&T  and only say Verizon?  What would that do?  Oh, that would be just as bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We don't want that because I've got, you know, I have to buy a new phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Well, let me ask you a question.  Is it possible for Verizon is not GSM, correct?  Yeah, there's CDMA. Right.  So Apple has designed a new  have to change the type of phone.  Right. Change the chipset.  Is that a big deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's funny.  Some say it is because the chipset that Apple's using right now is GSM only.  Right. I think it's an Infineon chipset,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  which means that the only two carriers that could go with our AT&T and T-Mobile. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they have to put a new chipset in.  I mean, they could do that.  That's not, you know, impossible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I didn't know if that would be a different engineering feed.  Like are the chips bigger for that particular type of?  Well, I wonder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, that would be one way to do this is to keep it do a non-exclusive.  If they're not going to do it exclusive with Verizon, because that would just screw.  I mean, as much as Apple likes to screw its existing customers, that's.  You have to have an international phone, too. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to have a phone that's going to work in the world market.  And the entire world is GSM based.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So absolutely. I mean, if I had, you know, if I had a Sprinter Verizon phone,  if I were using the Palm Pre, I couldn't have used it in China. Right.  Now, Verizon makes world phones that are both CDMA and GSM.  And I think that's what you'd have to do.  You'd have to make a hybrid phone that does both.  But that's that's you're right.  More chips redesign, complete redesigns.  I don't know.  I don't know. It's a it's a tough one.  I'd like to see him get rid of AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is T-Mobile a better provider? No, no, no.  They're nicer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're nicer on the phone.  Nicer on the phone. Very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they're they're known for their customer service.  Although, actually, if you deal with AT&T's customer service on the phone,  they're actually pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, especially since the iPhone, they they've retrained, I think. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, on the other hand, they're very nice to you.  And when you hang up, you still have, you know, AT&T. Right. Right.  Yeah. AT&T service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I called them up and I said, what's the $750?  And they said, well, you know, we could do  we could we could we could split it up between two different months  because my you know, my contract is like the middle of the month.  And then you would only owe us  $100 for the second hundred and then  300, 250.  So it would only be $350 instead of $750.  I said, OK, well, if that's what you can do, do it.  So that was nice of them.  They were very friendly while they were screwing me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's better better to have a friendly screw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like, you know, they bought me dinner.  Right. They took you out first. Yeah, took me out first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you take a screenshot of the phone? Yeah, I twirled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Showing that it was. Yeah, it's still showing that I could do it.  It you know, it says July.  When did you reset it? July 2nd.  How much usage since July 2nd?  It's still well under 250 megabytes.  It's like 103 now. Tell them you pay them for that.  Yeah, here's what here's my phone says.  I already pay them for that, Dwight.  That's why I stopped at 100 megabytes.  I paid him for 100 megabytes.  I was paying attention to the phone usage, and that's what, you know,  I thought I could trust, you know, my phone that I bought from AT&T  to tell me the usage accurately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And what did they say when you pointed that out to them that the phone says X?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had nothing to say. They say I had nothing to say.  I said, well, we show 250 megabytes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe they count them and say my phone shows this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure I'll hear from somebody tomorrow.  I've I've I've reamed them now on a national radio show and twit.  I'm sure I'll hear from somebody.  But, you know, I almost I hate to pull that card.  It's like almost I want to be.  How would you treat somebody normal? Right.  Not so well, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the question is, your phone shows X.  That's what they tell you is the meter.  Then they come at you with a different meter.  And there's a bigger issue there, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, we were going to talk about and I yes, I agree.  And I, you know, I'm going to pursue it.  I'm getting an itemized bill from them and I'm going to see what I can do.  But I, you know, I don't have time for all this stuff.  I got jury duty tomorrow.  Can you believe that?  I got back and I have jury duty. That's rough.  They're all guilty.  Repeating. They're all guilty.  I hate them all.  Hey, if you got arrested, it's for a reason. Go to jail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And besides, you're the president of the Internet.  I'm the president of the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't make me do jury duty.  So let's talk about the Twitter hack, because I wasn't going to cover this.  And you raised some interesting issues, both Kevin and Dwight.  Before we began the show, this will be our last story.  We're going long. I know.  I apologize, but there's so much to talk about.  Twitter got hacked.  Twitter keeps getting hacked.  And this one was, again, somebody at Twitter having a crappy password,  which was guessed by the bad guys using a brute force attack.  This is not the first time this has happened to Twitter.  The difference is this time, supposedly, the bad guys got access to the  employees' email account or something.  They got all these documents.  They got all these documents.  Now, as far as I know, only TechCrunch published these documents.  I looked at this and I thought, I don't want to do this story.  I felt kind of dirty just reading them.  What is our obligation here, Dwight?  Do we do it?  Do we tell this story or what?  Well, I think you're the official journalist of the group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think there's a I think there are a lot of interesting issues here.  You know, Michael Arrington kind of went on at length about why he thought he  should publish them.  A lot of people disagreed with him legally.  I think he can publish them.  The law has been this has been litigated quite a bit where if you receive  documents that are stolen and you print them, so long as you didn't collude in  the original crime.  Well, let's go all the way back to the Pentagon Papers.  Right. The Pentagon Papers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is the classic case where, you know, the inside papers from the Pentagon  were leaked by Daniel Ellsberg.  New York Times got them.  Cy Hirsch wrote about it, published it, I think won a Pulitzer Prize for it.  And the Times never got, you know, was of course immediately tried.  The government tried to shut them down and lost.  But now that was about the Vietnam War.  I mean, there was something, something going on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. There's an issue of whether this goes to the public good.  And, you know, do we essentially need to know about, you know, Twitter's business  model, which is kind of what everybody in the tech industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was started reading it and I felt sleazy reading it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the difference is that the Twitter business model, I think, would have been OK.  That what bothered me about what I saw published was the fact that it was a lot of  Twitter's dirty laundry that was published out there.  And we didn't really need to read all that.  I just don't understand why.  Why this was put up on the Internet?  Like, why did that have to be on TechCrunch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I know why it had to be on TechCrunch, because let's face it, that's how  TechCrunch makes its living.  They're basically the valley wag.  I mean, they've really become a scandal sheet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they have, you know, they it comes down to this is that ultimately they received  what amounted to stolen property.  And yeah, they may have.  They have the technical right to publish it. Absolutely.  They have the technical right.  But the question is the where and whether ethically they should have.  I didn't see anything, Kevin, that was necessarily sleazy other than in fact, he  apparently has sleazy stuff and he's not really sleazy stuff.  And he's not doing anything with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But but first of all, you can't you can't you can't judge the provenance of it, right?  You don't know that it's real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't know that it's we don't know has been altered.  You know, you all you know is that you got these documents from somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, the story is a little far fetched just because somebody hacked the Twitter  account. How would they or do they hack their Gmail account?  I mean, well, I guess they had the same password, right?  Oh, same password. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they also used once they got in, they used password recovery where it gets  a password gets emailed back to the original account.  And so then they were able to get into things like their like their Google Docs.  And it also raises the issue of putting, you know, company documents up in the cloud.  You know, where they're you know, where they can access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no question that there's if I'm on the Twitter board, I have some pretty  serious questions to ask.  Right. Right. Because I mean, you know, that's but that's an internal issue.  And frankly, I think TechCrunch has the right to publish this stuff.  I'm not I wouldn't even complain about that.  I just decided not to cover the story.  I'm not going to repeat any of the information from it because it just I didn't  you can't validate the provenance of it.  Nothing I read there, you know, had the importance of the Pentagon papers for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. The thing that bothered me more than anything else is that, you know, we living  in the Bay Area, I'm sure Leo, you know, some of these guys, too.  These are like friends of ours, right?  That they run these companies and they work at Twitter.  And, you know, Arrington is also friends with these guys.  And I just think that, you know, if something like that, let's just say I'm TechCrunch  and something like that lands on my desk and you have all these documents and you say,  wow, this is going to be a really big story.  Right. I understand him going out there and saying, like, OK, here's what their business  model is or here's what they're thinking, because that's something that everyone is  really curious about. It's just a general interest tech story.  But when you get down to start talking about, like, the specifics of what they were  thinking about certain individuals that worked at Google, who they liked, who they  didn't like, what they were thinking about dealings with like Puff Daddy and the fact  that they didn't think he was a really big asset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's when I stopped reading right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that was the kind of stuff where I was like, why did you even have to put that up  there? Like, that just makes those guys look bad and it hurts people.  You know what I mean? It's not just like reporting on the news.  It's actually hurting someone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. That's what drives traffic.  Let's face it. That's where I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's just a shame.  Well, there's also an issue of Internet journalism here.  And that is one of the things that sites like TechCrunch and other pure Internet sites  do is they not only give you the story that they've written, but they put the documents  themselves up. They put their raw material, which I think is fine.  But the raw material had the information about P.  Diddy in it. Well, and so what happens is I can argue the other side, which is the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  public's right to know if you're a real journalist, you don't say, oh, they're my  friends. I'm going to protect them.  You publish the story. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't want to do that. But I.  But what's the story, though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's true. What is the story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The story is primarily in this case that that you get an insight into what they are  considering as a business model, which is what everybody wants to know about Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely. Absolutely.  It's not. And it's and they're going to be peripheral things if you're showing they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  going to be peripheral things if you're showing the documents that include the reference  to P. Diddy. You have to explain that.  And so as stupid as it is, you know, that's kind of you have to put that out there.  You have to do something. That said, you know, they could have done it in a noninternet  journalism style. They could have done it in a more traditional style and not put the  raw documents out there. That would have been an antithesis of tech crunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I kind of like the idea of the raw documents, but I felt sleazy reading them.  So I just stopped and I actually wasn't going to cover the story at all.  I think the meta story is interesting, though, of what do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, what's the most damaging information that was released, though, has to be  what they thought of, like Marissa Meyer from Google, who's like the number third  person in charge over there, and also what they thought of Microsoft and how they  That's got to hurt. With the ad deal.  I mean, these are huge partnerships.  Yeah, these are the relationships that are being damaged.  And I don't know if they're recoverable at this point, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that hurts a little bit.  I mean, we all say stuff in private meetings.  That we wouldn't really necessarily want the world to hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You take notes in different ways and are actually sad and just like, you know,  like never do business with that guy and just like you're just jotting something  down and it's taken out of context.  And then I don't know. It's rough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The one thing that the thing that most intrigued me was Twitter's ambition  of being the pulse of the planet.  And I like that they want a billion users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But, you know, it was Jason Calacanis who said this on this show  months ago, whether he had inside information or not, I don't know.  Of course, he like everybody else knows all these players.  But but he said the goal is to become the Internet phone book.  If everybody in he said, imagine if everybody in the world  and a billion people is for this, for our purposes, the same number,  had a Twitter account, that becomes how you identify the value of that to Twitter.  And that's clearly what they're going for.  And that's, by the way, exactly what Facebook's going for.  Right. And everybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Transcript:  How long are you going to are you going to keep it or you going to drink it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll chip away at it over time.  But like, let me show you one other one. This one here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They allowed you to bring these back.  Did you have to do a deal with customs?  Tim Ferriss have to grease some palms. What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they just let you bring it to this little guy is about  15 years old and it's about, I don't know, $1,200, something like that.  What? Yeah.  Oh, what? That's like gold.  It's pretty crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The good stuff is just insanely expensive.  And it's it's like wine and gets better with time.  Well, what does it taste like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, have you had some of that $1,200 tea? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's an acquired taste.  It tastes like dirt.  $1,200 an ounce dirt.  That's right.  Party at Kevin's house.  I admire anybody who follows a passion to any to that degree.  It doesn't matter what the passion is.  Tea is not a bad passion to have. I can understand.

They do grow tea as well as on the on the real steep hillside.  You can't grow kumquat, so they grow tea.  And I was going to bring some back.  Our guide bought a brick and I thought I wouldn't be able to get it through customs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
