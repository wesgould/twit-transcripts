It's time for TWIT this week in tech, the show we cover the latest tech news.  We have assembled an odd panel today.  I think this is going to be very interesting. To my left, Mr. Ben Parr, author of Captivology, the science of capturing people's attention.  I first met Ben when he was at Mashable. You left very kind of famously left Mashable to pursue investing startups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. How's it gone? Seems to be doing well. Octane.ai is your new thing. What is that?  It is a company that lets you communicate with your customers over Facebook Messenger.  You were showing me how L'Oreal uses it. L'Oreal or famous people. Yep, like Maroon 5 and 30 Seconds to Mars.  So I went from this journalism to the book to investing to the book to the startup. So I kind of do a lot of things.

Start time: 190.06
End time: 214.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think a lot of people in tech journalism look and feel like we're on the sidelines watching all these people make billions of dollars.  I think there's not a few of us. I do not have this problem, but who say I want to do that.  And so you do see people sometimes leave and say maybe not for the money. I don't think you did it for the money, but to do it because I want to make something.  I want to be in the battle instead of watching the battle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So like Mashable was an accident for me because I was like studying entrepreneurship in college and took entrepreneurship courses at Northwestern in Chicago.  And then I moved out and I just like got lucky with the Mashable thing happening. I got recommended. I got articles. I got to join Christina.

Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, Christina Warren's here. This is odd too because we haven't talked to Christina since she left publishing, writing, journalism and became a Microsofty senior cloud developer advocate at Microsoft.  And now a big superstar on Channel 9, Microsoft's in-house TV system.  Yeah.

Start time: 256.45
End time: 320.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you do?  I don't know about superstar. Well, so it's new actually. So for the first three or four months that I was at Microsoft, I was a senior content PM on a product called Microsoft Virtual Academy,  which is like free online training in a variety of subjects targeted to developers and IT pros.  And as of last week, I'm now on the cloud developer advocate team, which is a new team at Microsoft that basically we kind of sit between PMs and I guess like what you would traditionally call evangelists.  And the idea is basically for us to kind of communicate with the public.  They've hired a ton of really smart people from the community and from within Microsoft to kind of find out from customers.  What's the stuff that you need? What's important to you? Listen to their feedback, be part of the community and then bring that stuff back to the people who are actually making the products.  And then my role is as I'm working a lot with the video teams on Channel 9 and with the docs team, I'll be creating a lot of videos for Channel 9, going to events, also maybe working with some of the other cloud developer advocates to visually kind of bring stuff out there.  So that's my new job.

Start time: 321.00
End time: 328.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So how is it working at Microsoft? I mean, from within now, you're seeing it from within. Is it what you imagined or is it different from how you imagined?

Start time: 329.64
End time: 339.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I didn't really have a lot of I wasn't really sure, you know, when I started when I got the job offer, it was kind of when I got the first, I guess, like feeler to say, would you be interested in this?

Start time: 340.14
End time: 341.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they approached you, they headhunted you.

Start time: 342.30
End time: 383.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they had handed me and because I'll be honest, I don't know if I would have been confident enough to even think, oh, with my journalism background, I can be a PM and I can, you know, not have a role that's in comms or marketing.  And there's not not to say that there's anything wrong with those. And people who do that stuff are incredible.  But I just always thought that if I wasn't going to be doing something like that, that that I wouldn't have a place to fit it at a bigger tech company.  And so when they approached me and I kind of learned more about my first role and now that I'm in my new team kind of learning about what I was doing, I was like, well, this is interesting.  But when I got to Microsoft, you know what I found is and we've seen that I saw this as an outsider as a reporter how the company has kind of changed in the last few years.

Start time: 383.16
End time: 390.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The new CEO kind of a new credit to such an Adela for really re steering the ship and doing I think a brilliant job with it.

Start time: 393.16
End time: 449.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you see it internally to where even people who've been there a long time kind of comment on how it's a newer Microsoft.  And obviously, you know, every big company has, you know, they're they're kind of microcosms within different departments and different teams.  But the teams that I've observed, you know, it's it's very different than what I expected.  You know, when you when I've talked to people who've worked at other tech companies, a lot of times there's like no, you know, balance between work life and personal life.  And I'm sure that on some teams, that's probably true.  But at least where I've been and people I work with, you know, people leave at a normal time every day, which is great to see.  And it's not one of those like, you know, it's not what you expected.  Nine to five, really?  Nine to five.  Which as a journalist, like I didn't have nine to five.  Right.  And so it's weirdly that I had to go to like work at a big tech company work for, you know, a giant corporation to have like an actual place to have, you know, free time.  It's kind of funny.

Transcript:  Well, so Micah and I are looking at and thinking, what did we go wrong here?  We're still we're we're still stuck in the in the media.  Micah Sargent here, he's senior editor with Mobile Nations, sister publication to our good friends at iMore.  It's great to have you on.  Micah's been on TNT many times.  But I think first time with me anyway, you've been on Twitter.  I think you were on when I was on vacation.

Start time: 472.55
End time: 478.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, yes.  First time here with you.  Happy to hang out.  Yeah.  A podcaster.  You do cartoon cast with Christina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're about to make our triumphant return.  It's we've been on on hiatus for a little while, but that's about to restart up as we're getting into the October months and we've got some spooky Halloween stuff going on.  So about cartoons.  Yeah.  I mean, OK, here's the thing is like adults.  There's like the stigma with with adults like enjoying and talking about and loving cartoons and Christina Warren and I are both like unashamedly in love with cartoons like Bob's Burgers, the shows for adults, but also the ones that are like for kids.  We have the guy who is the voice actor on a cartoon show called Clarence, which is a show directed at kids.  But we loved it.  And we brought him on and interviewed him.  And it's just it's the very official fart meetings episode.  And anyway, we were not we're not ashamed to proclaim our love for cartoons.  So she and I talk about different shows that we've watched when you know that the older shows newer shows just all the all the cartoons are all good.

Start time: 538.14
End time: 548.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I realized this when I think it was you, Christina, who had the Louise costume.  Yes.  One Halloween.  I thought, oh, she's a cartoon fan.  Yeah.

Start time: 550.08

Start time: 555.14
End time: 559.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's going to be a movie now soon.  I was just hearing about it.  Oh, yeah.

Start time: 560.12
End time: 561.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you see that?  Oh, how exciting.

Start time: 562.54
End time: 647.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, the reason I this is kind of an idiosyncratic panel.  But everybody knows everybody is a thrill to have you all.  You're all good friends.  Just kind of a little different.  Somebody works for Microsoft.  Somebody who's a startup guy.  And then me and Micah.  So the journalists of the podcast journalists.  Oh, God.  So I don't know.  What do you want to talk about?  We could do the traditional thing, which is run down nine products that Google announced on Wednesday.  And I guess we'll probably get to that.  Or we could talk about the Guardian article.  I think I'm going to start with the Guardian article interviewing a number of Silicon Valley folks who have decided.  Well, they feel guilty.  Our minds have been hijacked, they say.  It features the guy who wrote the like button on Facebook saying that he now when he gets a smartphone has his assistant turn on parental controls so he can't install stuff onto this.  He says it's dangerously addictive.  And I'm just wondering.  I mean, this is Justin Rosenstein.  They interview a number of people for this piece.  And I think that this is kind of going on right now in Silicon Valley.  A number of people.  I remember Steve Jobs said I'd never let my kids have an iPad or an iPhone.  Yeah.  Johnny Ive just said something about timeframes.

Start time: 647.64
End time: 651.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like where his kids can do it, can use any device or can't.  Right.

Start time: 652.18
End time: 662.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What did Johnny Ive say?  What did he say?  Johnny Ive just recently said something about how we're spending too much time on our phones.  I can't remember where he was being interviewed.  The New Yorker Festival.  Yeah, the New Yorker Festival.

Start time: 663.57
End time: 666.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, David Remnick interviewed him.  I think it was Friday.  Yeah.

Start time: 667.00
End time: 683.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tristan Harris, a former Google employee says all of us are jacked into the system.  All of our minds can be hijacked.  Our choices are not as free as we think they are.  He has been, according to The Guardian, branded as the closest thing Silicon Valley has to a conscience.

Start time: 685.00
End time: 696.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's a good friend.  He has been on a roll with this.  Like the whole article is really going down into an area that I did research which is the science of attention in a lot of ways.

Start time: 696.46
End time: 732.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it starts with Neer Iyal and his Hooked book.  And I've interviewed Neer on triangulation.  He wrote a book that is a roadmap for how to addict people to your app or website.  How to build habit-forming products.  It's called Hooked.  And he studied, as did Harris, with a guy at Stanford named B.J. Fogg.  And that's where this all begins.  He's a behavioral scientist.  And apparently was the first to say we can use technological design to persuade people, to hook people.  You were a World of Warcraft fanatic, right, Christina?

Start time: 733.55
End time: 736.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I mean I played him for hours.  You never got addicted?

Start time: 737.08
End time: 737.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no.

Start time: 738.14
End time: 739.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I know people who did.

Start time: 739.16
End time: 740.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know many people who did.

Start time: 741.36
End time: 757.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And before that mobile was on EverQuest.  People used to call it Evercrack.  But what I have been addicted to have been the stupid other D-Finder phone.  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean I've spent actual money on Candy Crush Saga and things like that.

Start time: 758.52
End time: 822.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's not your fault because all of this stuff is cleverly designed.  I use World of Warcraft as an example because they have all the data.  They watch.  They know exactly what you're doing.  When you play that game, you're playing it online.  So you're playing it on their servers so they know exactly what everybody does.  And they can optimize for stickiness.  And that's really what's happening.  This is timely because Facebook, the chief security officer at Facebook did a tweet storm yesterday saying,  You guys don't understand how hard it is.  Facebook's a really good example.  I don't think Facebook's doing it nefariously.  I think some people do.  I don't think they are.  I think Facebook optimizes as any company should for profit.  And the way Facebook optimizes for profit is by having an algorithm that designs the news feed to make it stickier, right?  To keep you on it, to keep you sharing and liking.  And they know they have all the data points to optimize it.  And they don't pay, I don't think they're paying at this point particular attention to the political or long range impact of this.  I think they may be forced to.

Start time: 823.24
End time: 860.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they're going to be forced to because of all the inquiries that are coming up.  And there are open questions about saying,  Okay, if we have certain regulations around the sort of political speech and advertisements that are on broadcast television or on cable or whatever,  should those things be extended or should we be at least looking about how they're being put about on online networks,  especially when so much of the ad traffic is controlled by Facebook and by Google?  And as you said, they have so much information that they can kind of do.  I thought Alex from Facebook, and I'm with you, I don't think that they are nefarious by choice.  You know what I mean?  I don't look at what they're doing.  They're doing what every company does.  They're optimizing for profit.

Start time: 861.04
End time: 861.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Totally.

Start time: 862.42
End time: 910.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I do think that his tweet storm was a little bit disingenuous and that he's kind of complaining and saying it's really hard to get the full story out  and journalists aren't doing this the right way.  And as a number of journalists pointed out, and as I can say, as someone who was a journalist until just a couple of months ago,  Facebook is a really hard company to get a straight answer from.  They always have and it's become even increasingly more difficult as time has gone on and as they become bigger and bigger.  So it's not that people don't want to tell the stories that they'll reach out to Facebook and his own people won't let him talk to people.  It's like people would love nothing more than to have a sit down, very candid conversation with Alex Deimos about how this stuff really works.  They would not love nothing more than to let Facebook explain things, but the company won't talk.  And so it's a little disingenuous to say the reporting isn't getting the nuances right when the company itself won't actually engage with the reporters.

Start time: 910.48
End time: 915.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Doesn't Facebook guard the algorithm like Coca-Cola guards the recipe?  Of course.  All of it.

Start time: 916.04
End time: 916.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Start time: 917.08
End time: 926.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Facebook does.  I mean, Google does too.  But I think you can guard the algorithm and can still have a conversation about how things work and about what's actually going on.

Start time: 926.02
End time: 961.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the impact will be like on the long term societal impact and political impact.  I feel like we're coming more and more to the realization that human beings are easily manipulated by different kinds of cues and different kinds of signals and different subconscious biases that are hard for us to admit that we can be really influenced by things as simple as like they talk about in the article how changing the notification from blue to red and the notification thing instantly changes the way we think about things.  And that's what changed how often people click the notification button.  Small things like that have such major incredible impact.  Yeah.

Start time: 962.34
End time: 1019.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Guardian pointed out that you're seeing red badges everywhere now on your iPhone and everywhere because red is a... that's why all these red dots on the iPhone, because red is a call to action.  It's something you see. Blue you wouldn't react to, but red is a hot color.  So they're using it. Does that mean that Apple is trying to manipulate you?  No. They're just trying to...  They're optimizing.  They're optimizing.  Yeah.  Here's the problem.  Alex, if you want to be on the show anytime.  I have a huge respect for you.  Alex Deimos was the chief of security at Yahoo when they were broken into for 3 billion records.  But he left because he said Marissa didn't tell me.  And now he's at Facebook doing the same thing CSO.  But I do have huge respect.  He's very well respected in the community.  But here's the reason people are concerned about this, Alex.  It is a mysterious secret algorithm.  I would grant you and I think we all agree it's optimized for profit right now.  But who's to say that it wouldn't be tuned to do something else?  For instance, elect Mark Zuckerberg president.

Start time: 1019.95
End time: 1089.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. It could be. And that's the concern there.  And I think when we were talking about sort of the doing this nefariously,  certainly not like actively nefariously,  but through ignorance or through almost ignoring just the fact that this has happened.  I mean, we had Mark Zuckerberg sort of saying, oh, no, there were no,  there was no influence on anything because of the way that the algorithm was set up.  And now that's sort of being backtracked.  And we're seeing Twitter too, where we're seeing that these different bots that existed  helped to spread news from certain organizations,  foreign organizations and things like that.  And so it's clear that the social media networks and these apps and things like that,  they can be used in nefarious ways.  And if you ignore that or you sort of tend to disagree with the data,  if you have the data to back it up, then as Christina Warren saying,  like, let's share that data.  And if you don't have the data to back it up,  then maybe listen to the people who are paying attention to this and who are collecting that data  and say, OK, you know, we can't just keep twiddling our thumbs and ignoring this stuff.  We have to pay attention to it because we're clearly making a huge difference.  And we're making behavioral changes to people.

Start time: 1090.48
End time: 1139.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I also would tell Alex, that's the concern is what the algorithm is doing and why  and what it could be used to do later.  He sets up a straw man.  Maybe it's not a straw man saying,  you guys in the press think it would be so easy to design an algorithm that would find fake news.  Well, I want to tell you, it's really hard.  Well, I believe it.  In fact, I've always said, of course, it's going to be hard.  One person's fake news is another person's rock truth.  And it would be very difficult.  And so I don't blame Facebook for that.  But I do think going back to our original question,  Facebook is designed to become more addictive.  And ultimately, there is power there and Google too.  And that power isn't necessarily being misused now, but could be, could it not, misused.

Start time: 1140.30
End time: 1163.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it does lead to another question, which I'd be curious what the panel would think.  Both Steve Bannon and Democrats proposed the idea of things like Facebook becoming like utilities being more managed or more regulated.  Is that a good idea? Is that a terrible idea?  Because I feel like that's the course that this seems to be going down in some way.

Start time: 1164.83
End time: 1173.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, you're not wrong.  I mean, it becomes an interesting question.  I do think that if you do want to have actually any sort of regulations at that step, it would have to be treated as a utility.  But that could go.

Start time: 1174.50
End time: 1179.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  God, you don't want the government to have control of the algorithm.  That's terrible.

Start time: 1180.12
End time: 1201.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course.  Well, there's a difference between the government having the control of the algorithm and the government putting in sanctions about how certain things can be done.  You know, again, like the broadcast networks, that's considered a utility.  So there are equal time rules when it comes to election.  There were.  Did you say equal time?

Start time: 1202.04
End time: 1205.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There haven't been equal time rules in some time.  Did Trump tweet about equal time?

Start time: 1206.00
End time: 1210.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he did today.  What does he want?  He thinks it's unfair how much equal time he doesn't get.

Start time: 1211.38
End time: 1213.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What?  It's on his Twitter.

Start time: 1215.29
End time: 1221.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What?  And then Bob Corker tweeted is like, it looks like that the president is optimized for attention.

Start time: 1222.00
End time: 1232.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's exactly like the news algorithm.  He's designed for something.  He gets more coverage than anybody.  Yes, he does.  Maybe it's not exactly coverage he would like or control.  Right.

Start time: 1233.54
End time: 1283.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not opposed in theory to companies having to be more transparent about how information is collected and about what they're doing with it.  But I don't.  I'm uncomfortable with the fact of saying that the government's going to regulate a service like Facebook or a search engine like Google.  I don't even know what rules you would make.  I don't know.  Well, we've seen what's happened already in the EU with Google and Google has had to and Microsoft.  My employers had to do things to where you have to abide by certain privacy standards and you have to abide by other rules and it can make it difficult to operate.  And I just I don't know if that would be a net positive.  I also in all real is like the current FCC.  I don't think whatever approved that.  I mean, they're they're already looking at basically dismantling net neutrality, making the Internet a utility.  I can't see them taking that the going of a level beyond that, which would be to the opposite.  Yeah.

Start time: 1284.22
End time: 1312.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Think about the entertainment industry, though, like the movie industry and also video game industry said, oh, dear, the government is like on its way to come in and regulate us.  So here's what we're going to do.  We're going to set up these movie rating systems are PG PG 13, et cetera.  And we're going to do that ourselves.  We're going to regulate ourselves.  And we're going to be very forward about that.  And then the government said, OK, you know, we can keep our hands off.  That's what I want to see these these different companies do.  I think they take care of themselves.  That's what's going on right now.

Start time: 1313.32
End time: 1366.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't it? I mean, that's exactly what's going on right now.  Facebook is finally cooperating with Congress after Twitter and Twitter of denying Facebook denied that they had any influence from Russia, that Russia bought any ads for months and then finally said, oh, yeah, here's a few thousand.  Here's this was on 60 Minutes last or actually is it maybe it's says October 6th.  Trump campaign director Brad Parscale, scale talking with Leslie Stahl.  I guess it'll be on tonight said that Facebook and Twitter, by the way, had and Google embedded employees in the Trump campaign to help them maximize their effectiveness.  Furthermore, he says now this I wouldn't I'm not surprised to hear the first course.  Google with if you're a big customer, you're spending a lot of money on advertising.  Right.  Google will help you.  They'll send a salesperson.  And I don't think I don't I agree.

That I don't credit that I don't.  That's BS.  So that's not surprising, though.  Right.

Transcript:  Oh, yeah, they sure did.  If you're buying enough ads, they're going to come and help you.  They want you to buy more ads.  Yes.  Right.  So, Alex, come on the show, Alex.  I'd love to have you.  I'd love to hear your point of view.  I think you're I think you're wrong about assuming the press doesn't understand how hard it would be to detect fake news.  I think there are people there's a big drumbeat for Facebook should detect fake news.  I agree.  That's a very difficult thing to do.  I don't know how you would even approach that.  Facebook is putting a more info button now on articles where you could find out more about the source, which I think is a good start.  Yep.  That's a safe, fair start.  Part of the news feed update, they're going to give you context.  When you click a button, you'll see information from the publisher's Wikipedia page, a link to follow the publishers Facebook page and other links that might be related.  You know what else I'd like to see Facebook do they haven't done as yet.  They have given Congress those Russian purchased ads in the campaign.  It seems very simple for Facebook.  I don't and I'm not sure why they wouldn't do this to have a database of all the people buying ads and all the ads they bought because part of the problem is these are dark ads.  When Russia buys an ad, only the very specifically targeted people see them and not the rest of us.  So we don't know what influence is trying to be exerted.  That would be easy for Facebook to do.  I don't I think that Congress needs to at least suggest they do that.  Maybe they'll do it voluntarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, with that first thing that the more info button, the context, all that kind of stuff, I'm going to be a mean press person right now and say, I think those are good ideas and there aren't direct solutions that I can offer.  But I think for the most part, a lot of those things are tiny bit an empty gesture.  And the reason I think that is because you can go to any I mean, Christina, I'm sure you can cite plenty of articles, but you could cite plenty of articles.  We can all cite plenty of articles where you literally have people asking in the comments of an article, something that is answered in the article.  People read headlines.  They may read 140 character tweets.  They don't click more info buttons.  When when we were doing data studies to try and figure out how best to optimize our social media posts and things like that, if you have a Facebook post that we have to click that more button, like 98 percent of people don't even click that more button to see more text.  Nobody's looking for more info.  They're just looking at that first thing and then they have a problem with fake news.

Start time: 1557.42

Transcript:  Isn't this what Eli Parasol was talking about in his book, The Filter Bubble, that the way the Internet works is it segregates information and people only hear the stuff they agree with basically.  And then and there's if you had if you subscribe, I don't know if this is a different difference from the past.  Jeff Jarvis says it's always been going on.  He says you'd get if you got the newspaper, you'd get the liberal or the Republican or the conservative newspaper.  There would always filter bubbles.  You talk the where you live, the neighborhood you live in is very much a filter bubble.  We aren't really exposed.  In fact, Jeff says it's quite the opposite.  The Internet has given us exposure to a broader range of opinions just through serendipity and accident than ever before.

Start time: 1703.36
End time: 1721.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the difference is that there are fewer content source.  There were fewer content sources before, so it would be difficult for you to have your entire media diet consumed by one point of view.  Whereas now, because there is so many different content things and so many different channels, if you never wanted to leave a bubble ever, you could.

Transcript:  It's a steal wholesale from from Georgia Dow.  Thank you, Georgia.  The fact is this is this is this is confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance.  And it goes like this is the thing is like it goes back to our primitive brain when we were, you know, many, many, many, many years ago hunting in packs.  And we were small little groups like we had to find the people who were like us.  And anything that was different was dangerous because it could mean that we don't get to eat that day or that someone was going to come steal our food.  And we have this primitive basis of our brain that still exists.  And that's why it's scary to have anything that goes against our beliefs.  And that's why, like, there's there's literal pain in your brain whenever something challenges your very belief system.  And so when you see all these things that agree with you, it's like, oh, this feels good.  This is nice. But those things that exist outside, there's like a danger to that.  And that is why we get into these bubbles and why we don't because there's so much discomfort involved with sort of expanding our viewpoint.  And so the challenge is to like to be more evolved humans is to, you know, fight past that cognitive dissonance, fight past that confirmation bias and let in those other things.  And so now we have that opportunity to find new viewpoints and find new beliefs.  But the fact is you have to take that or you can just stay in your little your little group and continue to sort of go down that hole and be part of that pack.

Transcript:  And then, in a way, this takes us back to how we began, which is these Silicon Valley refuseniks who said, you know, we created something far too addictive and we think you should turn it off.  Is that one way to get out of the filter bubble is to maybe I last night or two nights ago, I was up at 3 a.m. on Facebook and it got me so angry that I deleted Facebook, Instagram and Twitter from my phone.  Wow. I it's not like a kill my account. I still have it on the desktop.  But the Apple estimates that we pick up and unlock our phone.  What was it? Eighty times a day that we spent a lot of time doing this.  And I thought if I and you know what? I haven't really my battery life really sort because I have no reason to turn my phone on.  There's nothing on here I want to see.

Start time: 1850.24
End time: 1888.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have I have a theory that like we're seeing more and more people start to put implementations to like limit the amount of their Facebook or remove their Twitter from their phones.  But I also feel like it's a little bit of a privilege.  Like if you are you are high paid or if you are lucky and you're like you people will still contact you even if you don't check those things regularly, then you could do that.  But in like smaller parts of the country rule like Facebook is like where you meet talk to your friends and meet your friends.  And if you're not there, you've got like nothing you can't.  It's like you can't do it because they don't like people.  So I don't mind. So there could be so like my guess is like they could also be sociologic.

Start time: 1888.02
End time: 1910.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I could do that. Yeah, that's a really good point.  So what do we do? So how do we solve this?  So these are two problems we've got. We've got the filter bubble.  We've got this kind of unified worldview that we're not and we're not hearing from other points of view.  And we've also got this addiction problem where these these not maliciously, but these companies are designing super addictive products.  What's the answer?

Start time: 1911.92

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If anyone actually do a good answer, we said that person would also be a billionaire.  I think this is like this is the hardest.

Transcript:  It's self-control there.  You know, whenever the Apple and I know that Google has had this for a long time, so please don't be angry at me.  All of you out there listening when Apple had come out with the do not disturb while driving thing, I had wrote up a piece about that.  And I got a lot of flack because people like why can't you just control yourself?  You don't need to have a certain I turn that do not disturb on right away.  Right. Because people will you know, you see that notification pop up and then you're wanting to pay attention to it.  Your brain is spinning circles thinking about it.  And so we do have to it is it's you got to take it into your own hands, whether that be like go see a therapist and talk about, you know, if this is seriously something that's enough of a concern for you or you've got some sort of like Facebook addiction or internet addiction versus just like finding a way to get to that self-control.  It's all about beating that primal brain.

Transcript:  I think is that passing the buck, Christina, though, to say, oh, it's personal responsibility.  You companies keep maximizing profits.  Don't. It's our job.

Start time: 2001.08
End time: 2071.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, I think I mean, obviously, I think that ultimately it may be our job to do this.  I think the big the big solution and I don't know how you do this is you have to incentivize people from wanting to take advantage of these things, which Google has effectively done in some of the other algorithms in which Facebook maybe should do to is when you figure out what dark patterns are existing and what people are doing to, you know, get people to stay addicted in certain ways.  You have to look and say, is this ultimately helpful or harmful, you know, long term beyond just is this good for our revenue stream?  But I do think it is passing the buck a bit to say, well, we should just all have self-control because these things are as you know, we were saying at the top of the pieces, the people who are in that Guardian story are talking about are, you know, they're using science there and they're literally designing things so that so that people will be more engaged and will do it.  I mean, it's it's and so they'll click more, you know, so that so that they'll be more addicted.  And and I don't think you can blame it be like, you know, blaming, you know, drug addicts for for for taking, you know, drugs because, you know, they're addicted to them.  You know, I mean, part of it is personal responsibility.  The part of it is that people are on the streets and are offering it to you, you know, so I think it's passing back a little bit.  But like Ben said, I don't know the solution.

Transcript:  It is because the war on drugs has been a political movement, not about really stopping drugs, but stopping anyway.  I don't want to get into that, but I'm not I'm not going to do that.  But yeah, the war on drugs has been a failure.  And I think that, you know, the opioid opioid crisis in particular has gotten worse over time.  And I think that kind of shows that I think part of the reason the war on drugs has been a failure is because it's been attacking the victims rather than attacking the source.

What is the equivalent for technology addiction?  Technology treatment centers.  We need treatments.  You know what?  This may be something where there is no answer to this may just be our future.  And I feel bad for our kids who are growing up this way.  And it does seem and this is the point of the Guardian article.  It does seem to have somewhat perverted our political process.  And that's a cause for concern.  But maybe that's just a liberal point of view unhappy with the results of Brexit and the presidential election in the United States.  Maybe that's maybe it hasn't perverted our political process.  I'm just too much of a relativist.

Transcript:  I think whenever you think about drugs and where we are sort of with like marijuana and with some harder drugs like opium and things like that heroin.  We you know these drugs hit the scene and at the time people had trouble and there is a crisis.  Yes, but we also know more about the drugs and are continuing to learn more about the drugs and are continuing to get better at treatment for those drugs.  And you know we're living in this this technology boom right now.  And so later on down the line when we better understand this you know our kids are going to be so knowledgeable about this and you know they'll go on to be researchers and scientists and psychologists and psychiatrists and things like that.  So they'll probably know more about the technology as well and be able to better handle it right now.  We're sort of just like bathing in it and our learning as we go whereas they'll sort of have hindsight and things like that.  So you know it may be our future for a while but eventually I think we'll get to a place where either we're all killed because you know the artificial intelligence to take it over or we've gotten better at it.

And yet at the same time I think it's really important I'm glad we talked about it because I think it's really important to admit that there is something going on.  There is something going on. There is an issue.  Tristan Harris when he wrote in 2013 a memo at Google he was a product manager.  He was called a call to minimize distraction and respect users attention.  It spread to 5000 Google employees included senior executives who said oh Tristan we're going to give you a new job.  You're you're our in-house design ethicist and product philosopher.  Looking back Harris sees he was promoted into a marginal role.  He says that that basically was getting rid of me.  I got to sit in the corner and think and read and understand.  And that's that.  So that's that's one way a company can handle it.  We're going to take a break when we come back.  Google's being accused in a big lawsuit of racketeering.  Kind of the same kind of thing Microsoft is accused of in the 90s.  The engulf and devour strategy.  We'll talk about that in just a little bit.  Ben Parr is here the author of Captivology the science of capturing people's attention.  And he's the founder of a new company called Octane AI that helps.  You're you're part of the problem.

Transcript:  This is our ad for Tracker.  I was in a we went to a concert and I went oh crap I've lost my keys.  And because I had I was wearing a Scotty vest and I have like a hundred pockets to put  the keys in there.  So I looked all around my seat couldn't find it.  And then I went back to the bar and I was searching all around.  I thought oh wait a minute.  I have a tracker attached to my keys and there's a button on the on the on the phone.  In fact I could press it right now.  I don't I don't know where my keys are.  There's a button on the phone that makes the keys ring.  So I press it.  I was so embarrassed because I heard the sound coming from my coat and I realized oh I put  it in some obscure Scotty vest pocket.  So you you absolutely have to have a tracker if you have a Scotty vest because there's  so many pockets you will lose it.  The tracker is a great Bluetooth tracking device.  They have a couple of form factors.  There's the tracker Bravo which is aluminum anodized aluminum very lightweight by the  size of a quarter.  I have that attached to my keys but I also have the tracker pixel which is actually  phenomenal.  I put that on my remote controls because when you press the button on the phone app for  the tracker pixel not only does it make a sound it lights up.  It's got LEDs all around it.  So when I lose the remote control down the cushions and stuff I can see it.  It like lights up.  I could find it.  You will never lose anything again with the tracker.  Tracker is Bluetooth not GPS in there but it pairs to your phone.  You can have up to 10 trackers paired to the tracker app on your phone.  You can also and trackers the only one that does this have one tracker shared to multiple  phones so everybody in your family can have the tracker app looking for your keys that  kind of thing.  It has also the best crowd sourced network out there the crowd GPS network.  That's really their secret sauce.  See they've sold five million trackers over the last couple of years.  That means there are people running the tracker app all over the world.  So here's the scenario.  You lose your keys.  Let's say I left my keys at the bar.  Now it's easy to find it if I left it in the bar because the tracker app will say well  the last time I saw them was in the bar.  I go there but wait a minute somebody picked them up at the bar and decided to move to  Mozambique.  I hate it when that happens.  Fortunately the next time somebody running the tracker app walks by my keys the app says  oh those are Leo's keys and sends my app and my phone a ping saying your keys are in  Mozambique buddy.  That is awesome.  That's the tracker crowd GPS network and is the secret sauce tracker.  Tracker T-R-A-C-K-R dot com.  Actually the hardest thing to find at this point will be the website.  You'll never lose anything again but the website is a little hard to find it T-H-E-T-R-A-C-K-R.  There's no E in tracker at the end there.  T-H-E-T-R-A-C-K-R dot com.  Use the promo code TWIP.  Load up your basket.  Okay get all get tracker bravos tracker pixels.  You can get this waterproof tracker cover so that you can use a tracker for your pet.  Great way to keep track of your pet.

He made I thought a very good point on the verge saying this is just more walled garden  because OK so obviously no headphone jack Bluetooth headphones right.  But not just any Bluetooth headphones if you want to get the most out of your iPhone seven  eight or 10 you get out the air pods with the W1 chip and Siri.  If you want to get the most now Google's doing if you want to get the most out of your Pixel  2 you get the what do they call them.  The Google Buds.

Point is and I think this is actually well taken is that the side effect maybe not even  unintentional side effect of eliminating the headphone jack is now you have to buy the  branded headphones to go with it.  Yep.  Big money.  150 bucks for air pods 160 bucks for the Google Pixel Buds.

Start time: 3024.10
End time: 3027.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 3029.02
End time: 3087.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is as outraged as the Technorati got.  It didn't matter.  Because most people, let's be honest, most people not listening to this audience, to  be clear, but most people who buy a phone use whatever headphones come with it.  So whether it's going to have a lightning cable or a 3.5 meter jack doesn't matter.  You're going to use whatever comes with it.  Is it more annoying now that you can't charge your phone and listen to your wired headphones  at the same time?  Sure.  That's frustrating.  But that aside, I think most people use whatever comes with their phone.  They weren't upgrading to better headphones anyway.  And it's been much to do about nothing.  That doesn't mean that it's not used or hostile, because I think that it is.  But I just like I wrote when I was I think I was even still at Mashable when I wrote  something I was like, I've come to terms with the headphone jack going away.  I'm already planning for it.  It's terrible.  I'm not happy about it.  But I'm just I'm used to it.  I've come to terms with it.  I went through my five stages of grief.  And I feel like a year later, I feel like a year later, it's like, yeah, it would be  surprising to me if the other companies hadn't followed suit, if that makes any sense.

Start time: 3090.42
End time: 3128.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I think it depends on maybe their schematics and whatnot.  I mean, and if they see it as as a true differentiator, if anybody is actually buying  their phones because of it, maybe maybe they would keep it on.  But I don't.  But again, I don't see anybody choose.  I don't think anybody is going to choose to buy the Galaxy Note 8 or the Galaxy S8  because it has a headphone jack.  I think they're buying those phones for other reasons.  They want the camera.  They want the battery life.  They want that edge to edge screen.  Right.  They want the Samsung experience.  I don't think anybody's saying, oh, you know, I was going to get an iPhone, but it doesn't  have a headphone jack or I was going to get a pixel, but it doesn't have a headphone jack.  I think they're saying I want the phone for other reasons.

Start time: 3158.10
End time: 3181.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I mean, I think that this goes back to the argument we had a year ago.  I mean, I think that the difference was that you had like when you replace floppy disks  with optical media or with flash media, it was superior.  Whereas you can, as you were saying, you know, Bluetooth, it's getting better, but you do  still have drop offs.  The audio quality is not as good.  So we haven't necessarily replaced it with better technology.

Transcript:  And in fairness, like that's that's I like that.  I like that sort of thing.  I like that sort of pairing of hardware and software, even if it annoys me as like an  iPhone user that I wouldn't be able to get that same experience with an iPhone.  Like that would that that could be one of those things I would say if I were going abroad a lot  and I didn't speak the language, that would be a real selling point, not just for Android, but for  the Google Pixel phone.  Like that's a really cool feature.

Start time: 3233.18
End time: 3285.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that especially well, Japan for me would be it's impenetrable.  I don't it's not like a romance language where I can kind of understand them.  I can't have no idea what somebody's saying in Japanese.  So I think it'd be really intriguing to know what the way it works is you launch the translator  and you do that with audio.  You tap the thing and you say I'd like to speak Japanese or something.  And then the person says, you know, what kind of must whatever.  And then in my ear, I hear how you doing.  And then I say something in English and comes out of my phone in Japanese.  And the demonstration they did was almost it wasn't simultaneous, but it was almost instantaneous.  So as soon as I say something, it comes out in Japanese.  As soon as she says something in Japanese, it comes out in English in my ear.  You can now have a conversation.  That is remarkable.  Now, Microsoft demonstrates something very similar with Skype.

Transcript:  I mean, I mean, I mean, obviously, this sort of technology has existed.  I mean, Google has been doing stuff, you know, for visual stuff for a long time.  And I think they've even been doing apps like Duolingo have existed for a long time, too.  That'll do this sort of conversion.  What's really remarkable about this, assuming it works.  And I don't have any reason to believe that it won't is that is like you said, it's kind of that instantaneous on the fly translation.  And that's really impressive.  Like I'm really interested in seeing it and use of it because it works even half as well as what they're showing.  That could be huge for so many circumstances.

I was out of town.  And for some reason, I opened the Google Translate app for something and I forgot that that feature existed.  So I had tested it.  I was trying to learn a Spanish phrase that had been said on television.  So I was speaking in Spanish to it and hearing it sort of speak things back in English.  And so, you know, to have that instantaneous and right in your ear, I think, takes it to the next level.  That's really cool.

Start time: 3412.25
End time: 3447.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's totally this one.  There's like, oh, it'll be in a thousand retail stores.  And I'm like, really?  Best Buy is going to sell them.  Who's going to buy them?  That's I can't figure out.  Because if you if you spec it all the way out and it can be very powerful.  Right.  It's a nice seven to five, twelve gigabyte SSD, 16 gigabytes of RAM.  You know, this thing, if you do all the bells and whistles, it's sixteen hundred fifty dollars.  And I'm looking at that.  I'm like, OK, you don't even run a real operating system.  And I know, I know, I know, I know.  I'm hearing all of you guys in the audience.  I get it.  You can you can run stage route on it.  You can get like the version of that.  That's not fair, though.  But it's Chrome OS.

End time: 3474.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  And for me, I mean, look, the one thing that could make it sort of compelling.  But again, this is for such a small use case.  Ken White, the security researcher, was telling me on Twitter that apparently they've made  some commits to the Chrome OS where you can where virtual machines will act as containers  and can basically be, you know, first class citizens.  So if you were like, you could have a bunch of Docker containers potentially of your different  environment.

Start time: 3475.00

Start time: 3477.14
End time: 3485.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, apparently that is it's not yet there.  First party.  But apparently that looks like that's going to be coming.  So then you could have a Mac OS that would actually be really cool.

Start time: 3485.28
End time: 3492.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't have to put up with this Mac operating Mac hardware.  I could get the Mac operating system on my pixels.  I'm saying that potentially makes it interesting, right?

Start time: 3493.06
End time: 3521.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is if you were able to have Docker containers running natively, that could be really cool.  But it's not there yet.  But even even if you assume that that's going to happen and that's coming down the line,  I still feel like at that price point, you're at a very, very limited user base who's saying  why would I get this machine for this price?  Nice hardware aside, when I could get a MacBook Pro where I could have Docker instances or  I could have a service book or I could have a service book.  Why am I not doing why am I not getting these things that are already fully functioned?  What makes it better?

Start time: 3523.08

Start time: 3531.60
End time: 3538.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 3539.16
End time: 3587.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, all right.  So I bought the thousand dollar version, which is still expensive.  I mean, for a thousand bucks, you can get an Apple.  Well, maybe you can't.  But you can get almost get a MacBook.  Yeah, an Air.  Well, that's you know, or you could you certainly get plenty of Windows machines under a thousand  dollars.  But maybe I don't want maybe don't need all the complexity of a Windows 10.  Maybe I just really surf the web, do email, you know, send postcards to my grandkids.  Maybe that's not a bad choice.  And by the way, if this it looks like it does fully supports the Android store, I could  put Photoshop mobile on it.  I could put Lightroom mobile on it.  I could put Snapseed on it so I could do all my picture stuff.  I can.  I mean, there's a lot of Android apps to do almost anything.  Yeah.  Microsoft has excellent Android apps.  I could have Microsoft.

Start time: 3588.08
End time: 3627.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Microsoft is great Android apps.  But I mean, the bigger concern with me and I haven't tested the latest version.  So my tests are I guess going back to April or so.  But last time I was trying to use, you know, the Android apps on Chrome OS and I was using  like a Samsung that had been specifically designed to kind of do that.  Some of the apps, you know, some of the Adobe ones worked well and Microsoft to their credit,  like I was actually.  Oh, their Android apps are superb.  Yeah, they're great.  But they've also done a good job optimizing them to work on the Chromebooks.  Having said that, a lot of apps just aren't optimized to work on the Chromebook.  And so it's kind of like you never really know is this going to work or is this not going to work?  No, that's true.

Transcript:  I mean, for a long time, there's been rumors that Google will formally kind of merge Android and Chrome OS.  And I think that for this sort of thing to work, especially if you're going to have like a thousand dollar plus strategy,  I think you kind of have to do that because otherwise everything you're saying about why people buy Chromebooks,  even though I personally it's not not for me.  I try not to similar to why I wouldn't be able to use an iPad Air or not an iPad Air and I've had pro is like my main computer.  Like I just need different.  I have different needs, but there are plenty of people who a Chromebook is perfect for them.  And I don't just.  I would agree with you that most people can do just fine with a Chromebook.  That said, I just don't understand why you would choose a thousand dollar Chromebook over a really nice Samsung or Acer five hundred dollar Chromebook.  You know, like it's a great build quality, but it's going to be much better.  They should be spending double.  That's what I don't understand.

I honestly think that and I've even talked to people who say, you know, I do my full design workshop and people who are professional designers who use apps like Figma and use, you know,  Chromebooks for that.  And obviously, you know, Micah and I know a lot of people who are very proficient at using an iPad Pro for all of their workflow tools.  I don't want to discount that, although I think it takes more work.  But when I look at a Chromebook, the one thing that is I think that a lot of people do that you still can't do, you can't replicate is video editing.  And that's something that's, you know, you can at least do that on an iPad.

Transcript:  It's like a.  All right.  Our show today brought to you by Fracture.  Fracture is a photo decor company that prints your photos onto glass, delivers them to your house perfectly.  They have a really sweet packaging method and they look fantastic.  They're ready to hang. You can just hang them right up on the wall and they look good.  I have to say printing on glass does something to the photo.  Really?  The colors pop, the contrast pops.  So you've got photos.  I know you have photos that are sitting on your phone or on your computer or in a digital vault somewhere.  You never look at them.  Take some of your best pictures and hang them on the wall.  And I'm telling you, it brings your house to life.  Fracture starts with these little ones.  This is a four by eight by six by four.  So it's like a little postcard print.  This is one Lisa made of her son's eighth grade graduation.  Here's one that now this is this is the way it comes.  I should point out in the box.  So it comes mounted on the cardboard and then the cardboard has a little screw and on the back of the fracture, there's a little mounting place.  So it's ready to go.  That's me.  You can make them borderless or we put borders on because sometimes our shots are three by two.  And so the the aspect ratio of these is four by three or square.  They do.  You can import your Instagram directly, your Facebook.  This is my son at his high school graduation with my daughter.  This is don't tell anybody this be a gift for Christmas to a few of our family members.  Grandma's gonna get that.  Don't you think she'll love that?  And look what it does.  They have an advanced editor on the fracture site so you can make it monochrome.  And look what it does when it's black and white.  They're just something that it just you could fall into it.  Don't you think?  I mean, I really think they look good.  All right.  I'll show you how big you can get, though.  This is the this is the big one.  Actually, I got to show you this.  I like showing off my pictures on fracture because they look really good.  This is my also my son at his high school graduation.  I like this picture because it felt like it was Frank Sinatra in the Rat Pack.  Look at the look he's given me.  Like he's mad.  He's like stuck taking pictures.  Dad, is that great?  Black and white.  All right.  It goes all the way up to twenty one point six inches by twenty eight point eight inches.  That is big.  Oh, look at that.  But see that you could hang that over the mantle right in the fireplace.  Isn't that a great picture?  That that is a that is a sea lion.  This is from the Galapagos.  I took this this spring yelling at a flightless cormorant saying that's my spot.  The funny thing the funny thing is the cormorant just looked at him like, yeah, and never backed down.  So eventually the sea lion goes and lies next to him.  It was actually the sequences funny.  I might I might do a thing of the sequence.  Lisa's done that on her blog because she has a similar picture.  So look how good your pictures do.  Don't let those pictures kind of just die in obscurity.  Go to fracture dot me.

Fracture dot me offer code twit 15.  We thank them for their support of this week in tech.  One thing Google announced that I thought was really weird and maybe you guys can explain it is the clips camera.  Yeah, this is I don't even know if they even even I don't think even Google takes this seriously.  Two hundred forty nine dollar standalone little camera.  It's tiny. I mean, it's the size of a postage stamp.  And the idea is it stands on its own or you can clip it actually in their video onto a flower sack is how they did.  But the idea is it's got artificial intelligence built in.  And you just you know, when you're like with the family, you're doing something you pointed at and you just forget it for a while.  And then it's it's takes the best pictures like of the most exciting.  I don't know how it would know. But somehow artificial intelligence knows, oh, that's a great shot.  Oh, that's a great shot. And you get to relate to your family.  And then at the end, it's got 16 gigs of storage.  You take your phone and you you copy them to your phone, pick the ones you want and upload them.  What do you think?

Start time: 4192.32
End time: 4202.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a cool concept. It'll be used in some very interesting ways.  Oh, wow. You have a dirty mind.  I didn't even I'm a crime, but now I'm thinking sex.

End time: 4205.90

Start time: 4206.28
End time: 4227.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a cool idea there of like being present in the moment and having the thing like at a big event, taking pictures so that you don't think about it.  But it totally could be used for all sorts of like other things.  And I like it's cool.  It's like it could also be used in creepy ways.  But we'll see what happens with it.  I think of that, Ben, you are.

Start time: 4229.08
End time: 4230.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did immediately.

Start time: 4231.00
End time: 4288.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  And like everyone I was talking to is like, what you put in the bathroom or some things.  I mean, that's I mean, you got maybe you're being an optimist here, which I'm not used to because we were just being really negative about things.  But don't tell me now.  I mean, I think about like a stalker or something like that.  They could put this thing in someone else's house or you will like on their porch.  It's right.  Right.  This is just like another another more like mainstream possibility here.  And like the interesting thing to me was the sort of press rollout that happened after Google announced this immediately.  All of these big sites, I watched the Verge video on it and they were talking immediately about how, yes, this is creepy, but everything happens on device.  The A.I. its storage is all local, all of this and everything.  And so like Google, I think, knew that people would be sort of skeezed out by this.  But I mean, it's still regardless.  It's so sort of I understand where people are concerned.  One of the things they did think that people were skeezed out because it would be uploaded to the net.

Start time: 4288.00
End time: 4294.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they were great pains to say, no, no, no, this is local.  It only saves local.  Right. Right. Right. Right.  Which, which I mean, is better than than, you know, turn off.

Start time: 4296.00
End time: 4323.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean, it's in a lot of ways, it's kind of similar to a GoPro.  Right.  Except it's using your phone rather than, you know, GoPro usually uses like an SD card.  I wonder how many people are actually going to want to use this.  Like, I think that's the challenge.  More than the skeevy factor is that how many people are going to remember to be, oh, I'm having this great time.  Let me pull out, you know, a little camera and set it up and make sure I'm capturing everything.  Google also said there's a light on it.  There's a, they intentionally made the lens really look lensy.

Start time: 4326.00
End time: 4330.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's obviously a camera.  Yeah, no, they've learned from Google Glass.

Start time: 4330.00
End time: 4365.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just saying I wonder how many people are going to like want to carry this around in addition to all the other stuff you carry around to capture the moments.  But I mean, I don't mind the concept.  I mean, obviously we're all kind of skeeved out by as Michael was saying.  I'm not even thinking that.  You have the pure mind.  No, I wasn't even thinking about in what context you're talking about.  I'm just saying like, you know, people potentially, you know, like capturing you when you're not sure what not.  I don't know.  Although it is what it is.  If people want to put spy cameras in your house, they can and will, you know, drop cams, nest cams, do those sorts of things now.  And they stream it to the clock.

Start time: 4367.00
End time: 4381.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now I'm horrified.  I swear to God, I didn't even think of that.  I just thought, oh, that's cool.  Because my kids hated it when I took pictures of them.  They would always go like this.  And so I just like the idea I could, you know, put something there that would do that for me.

Start time: 4383.70
End time: 4440.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What I kind of like about it is in some ways, it's kind of similar to the Snapchat Spectacles, which idiots like me waited in line for.  And now everyone's forgotten about.  But it's kind of the same idea where that, you know, again, they went through great pains to like make sure that you know when it's recording and whatnot.  But the idea would be present in the situation.  And that's a similar thing where it would capture it and then transfer it to your phone.  And then you would choose if you wanted to upload it or not.  But this is obviously a separate device has better quality.  And like Ben was saying, I do kind of like the idea of being at a party or out someplace and not having to be buried in your phone the whole time.  I don't know if this is the right approach, but I think what they're aiming for and this is, I think, actually pretty notable, especially given what we were talking about at the beginning of the show, is to say rather than being stuck in our phones all the time and constantly on our screens, you could be in the moment and still go back later and say these are the most important parts.  And now I'll share that.  Yeah.

End time: 4468.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You want to like pull it out to like do that?  Is it going to be a selfie like this?  No, like for I would put it here.  Yeah, but for the most part, for most parties, like you wouldn't get the good angles.  Like what I'm thinking is like cameras work is all about the angles and it's all about the lighting and the shot.  You don't control any of that.  It's a strange product.

Start time: 4468.00
End time: 4475.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a 130 degree field of view.  So it's very wide.  I don't know.  It is a strange product.

Start time: 4475.33
End time: 4483.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it would work.  It reminds me of those apps where you push the button and you don't know what the photo looks like and it like pretends to develop the photo for you.  You see it like the next day.  Yeah, I don't like that either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I think that they're trying to maybe try to see.  I think when I looked at a product like this, you know what I kind of thought?  And I kind of got this from the Google Home devices too.  I feel a certain amount of Amazon envy from Google with some of this stuff where Amazon has done,  I think, better than any other company right now.  And a lot of this kind of space has really kind of taken over the home space  because of the success of the Echo products and some of their other things.  And so I look at the new Google Home minis and the redesigned Google Home and all that stuff.  And I look at even these things.  I think that it's kind of like them trying to succeed the way that Amazon has  in those kind of new spaces like the home.

And then in this assistant assistant war, like I find, for example, I have a Google  Home and I have an Alexa and I find the Google Home can answer more questions, has better  context.  But but the Alexa has a better eco.  Call it Echo so we don't trigger the echo.  Yeah.  Oh, the echo has a better ecosystem.  More.  Yeah.

Start time: 5016.00
End time: 5024.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I use Echo all the time and I have a Google Home and I rarely use it.  But it recognizes more things if you like mostly because I use the echo for music and  for timers.

End time: 5070.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah.  Same.  And I think last week was interesting because they made a strong play for the home.  And I have actually talked to developers who say it's hard to develop for Apple's home.  They're everybody's very interested, though, if you ask me, everybody I've talked to in  Amazon.  That's the that's where you want to be.  Google clearly says, no, no, no, we want to be the the assistant that you control your  home with.  But with the problem, this is that ecosystem thing again.  Consumers are going to you don't you don't want all of them.  You want to invest in one and then and the investment at some point is going to get high  enough that you're just done.  You can't switch.  Totally.

Start time: 5071.32
End time: 5187.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, and I think that that, you know, the fact that that Amazon and Microsoft are working  together so that Cortana and and the Echo will work together is it's kind of shows that  even within those companies, they're kind of picking winners, so to speak.  And you're right.  Like Google is definitely making a big play for the home and I wouldn't count them out  in the slightest.  Definitely.  I think that they are going to make it easier for people to write things than than the home  kit stuff is because because Apple is very specific about who can have home could access.  And I understand that from a privacy perspective and a user data perspective.  That's all very good.  But what it means is that it's a lot more difficult for cool things to happen.  And so also, frankly, you know, until the home pod, which is very expensive, comes out,  there won't be a single appliance that's not your phone that will be able to kind of do  a lot of these things, you know, or your Apple TV to it to a much lesser degree.  But I think that, you know, Amazon has I don't think they expected the Echo, the original  Echo to be so successful.  But I think with Echo Dot and kind of this whole ecosystem and by having a really good  SDK and an open API, you know, from the beginning for the skills and one, even if most of the  stuff isn't that useful, they really kind of have one mind share for a lot of people.  And so everything works with the Echo and everything works with Amazon, whereas, you  know, it's going to be a much harder thing for any of the other companies to kind of  get even the bigger players on board, not to mention the smaller people.  But if you are a consumer, like if I'm trying to say what home assistant should I buy, if  you're really into the Google ecosystem, a Google home could be great.  And like Ben said, it can be better to answer certain questions.  Right. But if you're saying I have some things from this company, some things from this  company, I really just want to control music, maybe my lights, maybe do a couple of other  things. Basically, every light provider and every smart home provider at this point is  hooking into the Amazon ecosystem if they can.  So it's kind of hard to recommend against them, if that makes any sense.

Start time: 5188.00
End time: 5201.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no, right now Amazon's the lead horse.  The real question is if Google can catch up.  But the other question is, given that Siri's the first of these, what did Apple do wrong?  Why isn't Apple doing better?

Start time: 5203.38
End time: 5250.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A lot of people argue that it's the fact that it's because of Apple's like tied to privacy and  things like that.  And so they don't have necessarily as much of the online processing that some of these other  companies have and the way that it works, you know, to collect information and process that and  then roll it out. But I also think it's the fact that up to this point, like Apple is just now  finally coming out with this sort of disembodied device that is just meant to interface with Siri.  Whereas we've had the Echo and we've had the Google Home for quite some time and these devices  have the Google Assistant and A-L-E-X-A respectively.  And so we've sort of tied our brains at least to this assistant that lives in a tube or this weird  circular thingy that the Google Home speaker is.

Start time: 5337.38

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it works. I'm happy to say I installed it. I can now, I put a dot, you have to connect,  because I don't get the Sonos one I have yet, their new speaker that will do this.  But if you have an Echo Dot, you could plug it into the back of the Sonos.  I don't know how they're doing it, some sort of magic. There's an Echo skill that you have to turn on.  And now I can shout anywhere in my house. I have to shout, what do I shout?  It's a complicated, it's, if I had to parse this in English class, I'd fail.  Echo Play Kenny Rogers on Master Bathroom Sonos.  Oh no.

Start time: 5377.45
End time: 5384.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 5384.78
End time: 5397.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's interesting is not all the Amazon Echo features will work, but I can hear the music that I want, all the Sonos music.  I am actually, this, they should have done this months ago, because by being so late to the market.  They were supposed to. They were supposed to.

Start time: 5398.26
End time: 5442.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did originally, Sonos had originally announced this integration in, I want to say it was August of last year, because I was at the event in New York.  And they were in beta testing. It's supposed to be out early 2017.  So now, you know, more than a year after it was announced, it's finally rolled out.  But I thought the bigger news, obviously the integration is great for the existing Sonos users who I think there's probably, if you were to look at it,  probably a huge overlap between people who have a Sonos and people who have at least one Echo product.  But I think having the new Play One that has it built in is really compelling.  And especially at its price point, because at that point I'm saying, OK, well, why would I buy a Google Home Max or why would I buy?  That's $199, right?  Or why would I buy a HomePod if I, you know, if I can get this Sonos thing, which will provide great sound and work with my existing system of devices.

Start time: 5443.20
End time: 5451.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think my sense is that you get one-one and it controls all your Sonos speakers.  You don't have to. So they're all now in Echo enabled, which is great.

Start time: 5452.18
End time: 5475.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And later on, I think it was in 2018, they'll bring the Google Assistant and Siri through an iOS device.  But the Google Assistant full heartedly into the Sonos one as well.  So I think that that's really cool that you're basically getting to choose between the three with the Apple integration,  not as great as the other two, but to be able to choose between a Alexa and the Google Assistant, I think is really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I agree. That's the best thing about the dot.  In fact, my dots, all the dots I have in the house are connected to bigger speakers, nicer speaker systems.  And in fact, that's one of the things that allows Sonos to use a dot as its controller because you take the line out of the dot and put it into the line in on the Sonos.  So that's interesting.  I don't get why they didn't include it.  Why didn't they do that?  Maybe it was the same reason they put a headphone jack on the Pixel.

Start time: 5629.74
End time: 5654.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, if you look at, according to Amazon anyway,  they claimed that during the last holiday season  and also I think during Prime Day,  that they'd sold the best selling item was the Echo dot.  So they're clearly selling tons of these things.  So I mean, I think that regular people, that's probably, again,  I think this goes in line with what developers are doing.  And one of the reasons why the mindshare tends to be there is that,  you know, they're the ones that everyone has.

Start time: 5655.00
End time: 5702.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Agreed. That's been my experience as well.  I remember going over to a friend's house who's not a techie in the slightest,  and he turned on the lights with a command to, you know, the Echo device  and was like, you have an Echo? I just wasn't expecting that.  And I mean, that was the one that he body found out how to set it up,  got it all figured out and enjoyed it.  And that's been the experience that I've seen is people going to that one.  I think part of the thing too is though it's like a lot of people do shop on Amazon.  And when that is right there and you're able to purchase it and, you know,  you see the commercials, but then you know where to go.  It's interesting how many people don't necessarily know like,  I need to go to what Google site do I go to?  How do I find how to buy a Google Home or how do I find where to buy a HomePod?  It's not as simple as you think it is.  You can even buy Echos at Whole Foods now.

They now have Amazon lockers there. They have Amazon deals.  They cut the price on their ribeye steaks, Amazon special.  So Amazon's really changing Whole Foods. It's very interesting.  And I bet you it will end up being a place you can buy Amazon hardware,  which is bizarre. Oh, I'm sure.

Start time: 5738.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Why would you not?  I mean, they have, I mean, kind of the same way that, you know,  the Apple Store kind of exists as a way to push things.  And, you know, Barnes & Noble when they were trying with the Kindle and things  like that and Microsoft has their stores. I mean, Amazon, it's really interesting.  They have some of the bookstores in various cities.  But now by buying this grocery chain, they've actually now have a way to push  some of their official items, even if you wouldn't normally think  that you would buy a gadget in a grocery store.  But I mean, that's what the super Walmarts have taught us is that, you know,  clothing and clothes and food and electronics can all sit side by side  and no one really bats an eye.

Transcript:  So it's, first of all, this is a very surprising category.  They came out of nowhere. I mean, maybe with Siri, people thought, oh,  this is it. But Amazon really, really came out of nowhere and just owns this.  Can they can they hold this lead or is it who's their challenger?  It feels like Google is the only one that can offer them a serious challenge,  not Microsoft. I don't think Siri is going to offer a serious challenge.  Is this Amazon's to lose at the moment? For sure. Yeah.

I think right now it's a one horse race. Amazon's way ahead.  But if I were looking at Google, I'd say that's that that kid, that kid could do it  because they've got a huge advantage in artificial intelligence. Right.  No one has as much data. No one's been doing it as long.  No one has as much machine learning. Google could become, you know, her, you know,  Scarlett Johansson in your ear.  But whereas I don't think Amazon's close to anything like that, they don't have the data,  they don't have the software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I mean, I think you're right. Although I do think again, and I don't know all the details  other than what's been publicly announced, but I mean, I think that's where like the Cortana  Amazon relationship becomes sort of interesting because obviously, and look,  Microsoft has been doing a ton of stuff with artificial intelligence and machine learning.  And that actually does become interesting if you start to maybe think about how that partnership

Start time: 5889.56
End time: 5893.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 5894.12
End time: 5935.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in terms of. Right. And and and and and I think the reverse is true is that Microsoft is saying  even though we're going to have devices in the home, maybe through other people, and even though,  you know, Windows 10, which has, you know, hundreds of millions of installs has Cortana built into it  and all that sort of thing. We don't have the, you know, echo like product.  So this will help get us into more places in a different situation.  And Amazon saying and we can use some of, you know, Microsoft's experience with AI and machine learning  to help our stuff improve. And then together, they might actually be able to be, you know,  a challenge to what the her sort of thing that that that Google is potentially doing.

Start time: 5936.92

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's an interesting question. But all Microsoft with Cortana, Apple with Siri,  even Google with their Chromebooks have a desktop assistant. You could there's actually on the new  Pixelbooks, there's a button for Google Assistant. Yeah. Of course, Cortana, you just say, hey, Cortana,  it pops up Siri. Same thing. I never use it. I actually don't even really use it on the phone that much.  There's something magical, at least for me, about saying talking to my house is what I really want to do.

Start time: 5963.68
End time: 6029.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that your experience as well? That's my experience. What I will say and I weirdly I never use Siri on my  Mac ever, ever. I just in the year that I've done it, I've almost never used it, primarily because it's not that good.  I have found myself because I've been using a Surface Book at work for the last few months.  And before that, I hadn't really used Cortana. I will say, although I don't speak to it, I don't I don't talk to Cortana.  I do find myself typing things into the Cortana bar because I find that to be very good, you know, to find a certain file  or to get information about the weather or something else. I find that not a speech assistant, though.  That's just spotlight. Right. But it's still asking a specific question in a way that I couldn't ask spotlight.  It's still giving me more and more updated information. But I'm with you. For whatever reason, I don't talk to my computer, but I talk to my house.  And it just feels natural. It does feel different, doesn't it? Yeah.  You know, you know, the one and it's weird because here's the one case I do use Siri. I use Siri with my Apple TV.  I use Siri with my Apple TV all the time. And I use Google Assistant with my Android TV, with my Android.  Yeah. And I use it's natural to search for, you know, I want Alec Baldwin movies. It's natural to do that.

Transcript:  I think that's the really important thing. And I think this is still we were talking about how is the six year anniversary of Siri.  I think part of the problem with Siri has been is that when it first came out, you know, it was good at certain things  and it wasn't good at others and people kind of gave up on it. And it has improved a lot over the years.  But a lot of people, myself included, just don't want to try because I just remember what it was like when it couldn't, you know,  even now, like you were saying, you ask a question, it'll send you to the web result for results.  Or it'll say, I don't understand that. And, you know, you just kind of got used to at least in my mind, I was like, well,  Siri is not going to be able to give me an answer. So I'm just not even willing to think to ask it things.  Whereas with the number of years that had passed by the time that Siri launched on the iPhone 4S and the first Echo came out,  you know, that was like, I guess, three years. And at that point, it was 2015 that the so I guess it was four years.  It was three years. It was the end of 2011 and then the beginning of 2015.  In that time, I think that things improved to the point where we didn't have a lot of high expectations for the original Echo.  And then when it started to be able to do things and and and, you know, control your lights, play music, you know,  give the weather set a timer, do that sort of stuff, you became more comfortable with talking to it.  In addition to it just being more convenient to talk to your house versus, you know,  having to hold down originally on a button on your phone and that sort of thing.

Transcript:  A data point there to my partner is like sort of my litmus test for the norms.  The people who are not as into technology as we are people who are not as steeped in technology.  And it's interesting because, you know, early on he I think gave Siri way more chances than I ever did.  Yeah, we all got used to the fact that it failed a lot and it may have gotten better,  but I just don't want to take the time to watch it fail if it will.  But he uses a le xa all the time. We'll ask it questions. We'll ask about the traffic.  We'll ask it what I mean. No problem at all.  And even when it will fail occasionally, then he's forgiving of it and will try again or say it a different way.  So I think Amazon really has gotten out ahead here and has sort of these other companies have a lot of work to do, I think.

Transcript:  It's also just even like having to pull out the phone and hold down the button to do that.  That's much trouble, although you know you can say, hey, yeah, but maybe the other thing, too, is just like the amount,  the perfection and voice recognition really does matter.  And I feel like it just feels like maybe it isn't anymore, but it used to feel like just Siri would miss at least two different words.  Alexa will miss less words, Google Home even less.  And so I tend to talk to those two. Yeah.

Well, I'm going to stay friends with you.  We're all friends here today, right? We're all friends. Google's accused of racketeering and a well-known architect.  Eli Attia spent 50 years developing what he calls a game changing new technology for building construction.  In 2010, Google said, hey, Eli, that's cool. We'd like to work with you to commercialize it as software.  Attia moved to Palo Alto to focus on it. Code named Project Genie.  It was part of Google X. In fact, it was one of the very first Google X moonshots.  But then, according to the lawsuit, Google, Larry Page, and Sergey Brin plotted to squeeze Attia out of the project,  pretended to kill it, but then spun off Project Genie into a new company, which Attia had no stake in.  Attia is accusing Google of racketeering, saying it's not the first time, it's not the only time.  They do this all the time. It's cheaper to steal, to develop your own technology.  This is what Microsoft was accused of, remember, in the 90s.  They would do an NDA with a company. They would learn all about it, saying, we were just inquiring you.  And then they would say, yeah, no, we decided not to, and build exactly the same thing.  A judge in Santa Clara County Superior Court approved the addition of the racketeering claims to the lawsuit.  The suit was filed a few years ago, but now this new racketeering charge has been added.  Apparently, according to some, Google likes to do this sort of thing.  They renamed Project Genie the Flux Factory. Now it's called Flux. It's headquartered in San Francisco.  It sells building design software and markets itself as the first company launched by Google X.  Google says, hey, we paid him for his technology. We own it now. That's that.  We'll watch that case with interest.

I'm now looking at an old rundown, I think, because it says, this is an old story.  Let me see if I can find it. Yeah, here we go.  Actually, let's take a break, and then I'm going to ask you all why it is the tech community is so anxious to defend Eugene Kaspersky.  Okay? Okay. When we come back.

A big, big company.  Quicken Loans, the number two lender in the country.  Billions of dollars in loans has created something just for geeks.  When that happens, I have to celebrate it.  Yay, they're thinking of us.  They have created an entirely online home loan process.  So you don't have to go to the bank.  You don't have to go to the attic to find all the pay stubs and all the paperwork.  You can do it all on your phone, on your laptop.  You can do it on your phone at an open house and get loan approval in minutes  from the best lender in the country, Quicken Loans.  It's called Rocket Mortgage.  It gives you the confidence you need when it comes to buying a home  or refinancing your existing home loan.  You'll understand all the details. It's all very transparent.  Because they have trusted financial partners,  you can share your information with Rocket Mortgage easily with a touch of a button.  And once they get that information,  they can crunch those numbers fast because computers...  Last home loan I got about four years ago,  the guy actually had a calculator.  And he has a sheaf of paper.  He said he was calculating the amortization table on his super-duper calculator.  I thought, this is not exactly 21st century technology here.  Rocket Mortgage is, whether you're buying your first home or your 10th,  they can calculate in minutes and give you a loan based on income, assets, and credit  that's right for you for a loan for which you qualify.  You choose the term, you choose the rate, and you're done.  You could do it at an open house and buy it right then and there.  Rocket Mortgage by Quicken Loans. Apply simply.  Understand fully mortgage confidently.  Equal housing lender licensed in all 50 states at MLSConsumerAccess.org.  Number 30.  Now, I know you may not be buying a house right this minute.  I hope not. I hope you're just listening to us.  But bookmark this site if you do down the road want to buy or refi  rocketmortgage.com slash twit2.  rocketmortgage.com slash twit2.  It's really a great idea.  And we thank Quicken Loans and Rocket Mortgage for their support of this week in tech.  So Eugene Kaspersky is a very well-liked guy in the tech industry.  I know so many people say, oh, he's great. I love Eugene.  Kaspersky makes antivirus software.  I remember Dvorak was his favorite software.  He loved it.  And then recently, I was at the Department of Defense said, don't use Kaspersky  antivirus because Kaspersky is known to have written software for the Russian  FSB, the secret police.  The Wall Street Journal this week published an article saying hackers working  for the government, for the Russian government, stole confidential material,  see an NSA contractor.  This keeps happening to the NSA.  Just like Edward Snowden, an NSA contractor decided for, you know, I think I'm going to  bring all of this stuff home and put it on my personal computer, my personal computer  that's loaded with Kaspersky antivirus.  According to the journal, the government believes, the NSA believes that the  Kaspersky AV scanning his computer found those documents.  Maybe they were viruses created by the NSA, notified Kaspersky.  Kaspersky notified hackers in the Russian government who then exfiltrated the stuff,  maybe with the help of the Kaspersky software, it's unknown, and stole those,  penetrated the NSA contractor's computer and stole the files.  Now, it may be that Kaspersky had nothing to do with it, right?  Best Buy in September stopped selling their software and offered free removals and  credits toward competing packages.  U.S. Department of Homeland Security directed all USA agencies to stop using  Kaspersky products and services last month.  Do you guys use Kaspersky antivirus?  And yet I see Dan Gooden and ours, Technica and others defending Kaspersky saying,  well, we don't, not so fast, Dan writes.  We don't know what really happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they're defending Kaspersky, the company.  But I think that I have to trace this back to the fact that Eugene Kaspersky, the  founder, is a very genial, jovial guy who used to go to trade shows, CES and Comdex,  bought drinks for people.  Everybody loves Eugene Kaspersky.  And I think they don't want to believe that this, but if you were a spy, wouldn't you  buy drinks for everybody and be lovable and fun?  Right?  Anyway, I guess none of you are friends of Eugene Kaspersky and want to defend him.  Kaspersky officials say, Kaspersky Lab has not been provided any evidence substantiating  the company's involvement in the alleged incident reported by the Journal.  It's unfortunate that the news coverage of unproven claims continue to perpetuate  accusations about the company.  As a private company, Kaspersky Lab, which is in Russia, does not have inappropriate  ties to any government, including Russia.  And the only conclusion seems to be Kaspersky Lab is caught in the middle of a geopolitical  fight.

The fact that you're talking about a Russian based security company just makes it difficult,  if not impossible, for it to, in this environment, be on US computers, especially computers  used by the government.

Transcript:  So Uber gets kicked out of London because they won't submit the fingerprints.  Uber and Lyft kicked out of Austin because they said, no, no, you can't fingerprint our  contractors.  The state of California said, no, you know what?  They're right.  The Public Utilities Commission says, although we recognize the public's familiarity with  fingerprinting, we do not see that a demonstrably greater level of safety would be added over  and above the current background check protocols.  The PUC says you don't have to do fingerprints.  That was a bad idea.  See, the public understands fingerprints and thinks that will help.  But it turns out there's a lot of false positives.  It isn't necessarily, you know, proving that the person is connected to whatever crime  that fingerprint's connected to.  Fingerprint answers aren't the fingerprint checks aren't the answers is the PUC.  I thought this was fascinating.  It turns out it's the taxi commissions.  Taxi drivers are generally required to give fingerprints in London, in Austin and other  places.  It was the taxi commissions that said, why should we have to do it and not Uber and Lyft?

Transcript:  Which is a fair thing to ask.  I mean, in New York City, for instance, all Uber drivers have to be approved by the taxi  limousine commission.  But Uber pays and Lyft, they basically pay the fees.  But you have to be registered with the TLC.

Start time: 7427.08
End time: 7432.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's important because the TLC doesn't represent taxi drivers, right?  No, no, no, no.

Start time: 7433.94
End time: 7469.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just means that in order to have a car that can pick passengers, you have to be registered  with them.  And that's different from almost any other city that Uber operates in and Lyft too, for  that matter.  And they made that concession because New York was such an important market.  And, you know, they fought in Austin and ended up being reinstated.  And who knows what will happen with London?  London might be an important enough market that the Uber will change its policy.  But I mean, it's a valid question for the taxi operators to say, why do our drivers  have to follow these rules when the others don't, especially since the services for the  most part are so similar.

Transcript:  Why wouldn't Uber and Lyft just say, OK, well, why wouldn't they?  Why wouldn't they do that?  Well, apparently it's expensive.

Start time: 7481.12

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's time consuming.  And it has a lot of a high rate of false positives.  Yeah.

Start time: 7487.02
End time: 7552.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing.  And it has a long and for them, you know, you have to think of, OK, the big case in  New York again, it's kind of an outlier market because, again, most of the people who drive  in New York are professionals or at least trying to make their living kind of driving.  And, you know, some other cities are like that too.  But New York is one of the big ones.  You have to think that the big value proposition for Uber and Lyft has always been, even though  this is false, there's like a great game that I think Fast Company or someone made that  actually shows how hard it is to like earn money driving for these services has been  that anybody could kind of do it in their spare time.  And the more friction you bring into the process, OK, now I have to be fingerprinted.  Now I have to go through this background check to do that.  The fewer people are going to be willing to be part of your ecosystem.  Now, OK, all things said, you know, Uber and Lyft, obviously, Uber more than Lyft want  to be in a place where self-driving taxis will pick everyone up anyway.  Right.  But until we get to that point, you do need to have, you know, people willing to do it.  And that it takes the more red tape you put into it, the harder it is to have people willing  to be your drivers.  So.

Transcript:  My daughter is 25 now.  Grew up on AIM.  That was instead of calling as high schoolers did when I was a kid.  We actually had phones back then.  They just used AIM to talk.  But my son is 22.  Actually missed that.  They didn't use AIM by the time he was a teenager.  They were using Skype and video chat and video conferencing as Google Hangouts and stuff.  So it really was this kind of slice of time.  Her her just just for completeness sake, her aim handle was got a base, not a life,  which I thought was good, except that she didn't play the bass.  But anyway, it was a it was clever.  I liked it.

Transcript:  1997, 2007.  You know what else was started in 1997?  That my generation loves Slashdot.  Slashdot.  Rob Malda, Commander Taco, wrote a...  He doesn't have anything to do with Slashdot.  It's been sold and other companies run it.  But he wrote a really nice kind of history of Slashdot on the medium on the free code camp medium feed.  It was originally a section on his homepage called Chips and Dips.  And eventually he decided it was running static HTML.  So eventually he decided to create something a little bit more sophisticated called Slashdot.org.  It was running on a deck alpha of all things, which he got for free for skinning a Space Invaders clone.  It was about a 486 speed, but it ran Linux.  And he was pretty happy about that.  Slashdot was almost immediately slash dotted, which is kind of ironic.  But Slashdot was pretty amazing for many years.  That was the source of tech news.  And it's now 20 years old, but it's still alive.  It's still alive.

Start time: 7763.04
End time: 7790.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so interesting because before there was Hacker News, before there was Reddit, before there was Digg, Slashdot was the place.  Even Twitter to a certain extent, that's where you would kind of go to figure out what was at least in the nerd sphere, the tech sphere.  And I know it's like a writer.  I remember when I first started writing professionally, if the link got on Slashdot, that was a big deal.  And then it became like Digg and Hacker News and Reddit and whatnot.  But yeah, so funny.

Start time: 7792.00
End time: 7822.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think, in fact, I remembered Kevin telling me, I think, that Slashdot inspired Digg because we use Slashdot on tech TV all the time.  So that gave him the idea to do Digg.  And then Digg was very clearly, I think Alexis Ohanian told me this, the inspiration for Reddit.  So it all really started way back here.  And it's run.  Is it run? Who runs? Is it the?  I'm not sure who owns it these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the irony of these sites is it doesn't really matter who owns it as long as they keep the code base working because it's really a creation of the people who use it.  So Slashdot today is not at all different from Slashdot 20 years ago.  Pretty much the same.

Start time: 7850.66
End time: 7914.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although you see kind of the same thing happen with Digg too, you know, is you see some of the users and editors migrate from one place to another.  And so the community around it becomes important to keeping those things relevant.  I mean, Rob Mulder was with he was I think he left like 2011.  I want to say is probably when he left Slashdot.  But he was there for a really, really long time and kind of went through a bunch of the changes.  And yeah, it's even though it's not the same place it was and only certain people, I think, you know, kind of like still hang on and kind of go to Slashdot every day.  Like, I certainly don't visit it ever unless, you know, like something like this happens and I see it.  Weirdly, I saw it on Hacker News, right?  I saw I saw the Slashdot link and and I was like, oh, man, yeah, that was so that was such of its time and such an important part.  I think of like news culture and Internet culture.  And it's awesome that that it still exists after 20 years and that the people like Robert are still able to kind of share the oral history, so to speak, of of how it came to be.

Transcript:  And finally, this was a bad week to be 66 years old.  First, Tom Petty passed away.  And then a couple of days ago, the the former CEO of Intel, Paul Otellini, passed away at the age of 66.  He oversaw a very big growth area era for Intel, but also was there when Intel kind of missed the boat on mobile.  Yeah. So well, well, I think you could say his reign from 2005 to 2013 was pretty successful.  Maybe he didn't set the best tone for the future of Intel.  Intel's revenues went to fifty three billion dollars at the end of his tenure from thirty four billion dollars before he started.  Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this edition of This Week in Tech.  I want to thank you guys. You're fun.  Everybody must come back.
