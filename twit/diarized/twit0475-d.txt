Transcript:  Now, you've been on a quest recently to find a foldable Bluetooth keyboard. I remember those back in the like, what, 10 years ago. They were all the rage.

Start time: 177.34
End time: 251.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How's that quest going? It's going pretty well. I have an inventory fold, two different folding keyboards.  One is a Matthias keyboard that's still for sale, but that's like an extended folding keyboard that's about this big when it's folded up.  I also have a verbatim one that's a little bit smaller, but probably a little bit bigger.  The idea is to try to find one that's as close to the size of the iPhone 6 Plus as possible to try to see how much work you can do with everything in like your very ample coat pocket.  So I bought a couple of different ones that are available on Amazon, so they'll be arriving soon.  What we've all been looking for and hoping for is I think the one that you were talking about, the one that Paul used to sell,  which is the most incredible and reassuringly nice thing.  It folded into the size of a tiny paperback book, but then it just in a very nice metallic clank, clank, clank, clank, like a transformer.  You needed a flat surface for it, but it transformed into this really nice notebook style keyboard.  And I'm shocked that especially with how popular smartphones are and how good the software for it, whoever has the intellectual property on that.  I'm amazed they have not done a Bluetooth version of this. I've got $80 for it.  I'll put $80, tape it to my monitor, waiting for the person who makes the Bluetooth version of this keyboard.

Transcript:  I've written a couple only when I've really been caught in a true emergency where there's been a news story and I get a text from my editor saying,  Hey, can you give us 800 words on this in the next two hours?  But that's the reason why I normally travel with an iPad and often travel with both an iPad and an Apple extended, excuse me, an Apple wireless keyboard.  I mean, even if I'm just out of the office for three or four hours, I'll have this with me.  But it's really intriguing to me to replace that kit with a phone screen that's big enough and a keyboard that's good enough to actually make allow me to put that in a pocket or at least have a smaller smaller pouch for it.  Yeah, we'll talk about later. I'm sure about boy that iPhone six plus that is really right within the pipeline.  It's a very Andy and not go sort of Andy. We want you to switch back to the spec to iOS and iPhone.  Even if we have to make a big phone to make you do it, that's how much we want you back.

Also with us today is Kevin Toffle, senior writer for Giga Ohm, who specializes mobile and wearable computing.  That's one of the reasons he's here. He's also here because I love having on tech news today.  He's one of my favorite guests. Welcome, Kevin.

Transcript:  Good to be here. As always, Mike, I am not internationally beloved, but hopefully I'm locally beloved.  I'm going to check that out after the show.  And Andy's going to hate me because I have one of the original Stowaway portable Bluetooth keyboards.  That's the one I have one in my closet along with all the other gadgets of yesteryear.  And it's it's just awesome. It's a shame they don't make them anymore, quite honestly.

Transcript:  Now, Kevin, you wrote about one of the craziest Android apps I've ever heard of called the Cosmos browser.  Can you tell us about this wacky product?

Start time: 365.02
End time: 423.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is wacky, but it's actually useful, I think, in certain areas where maybe a data plan is too expensive  or you live in a region or an area that just doesn't have like even a 2G or 3G network.  What Cosmos browser is, it was created at like a hackathon.  And what it does is it's basically a way for you to get web access without any mobile broadband or without Wi-Fi.  What you do is you use this browser for Android and you send the address or URL of a website as an SMS message in the app.  And what happens is on the back end, the URL is parsed out, the content is taken, it's compressed and it's sent back to you over SMS.  And you basically you don't see any of the CSS or JavaScript.  You just get straight straight straight straight HMS networks.  So maybe it's not even any charge for you.  Also, it works when you don't have any data signal at all.

So for the recorded version, you're going to enjoy that.  That was that was a really cool effect.  And also with us today is Lee Hutchinson, senior reviews editor at Ars Technica.  And Lee also writes about manned space flight, as you can see from the background there.  Welcome to you, Lee.  And Lee's very quiet.  You haven't been muted. I think we I think we had him.  So you had him muted? No, that was not on our end.

Transcript:  I have I I've my wife has asked me about this before because I'm not by trade a journalist.  Right. I am. I'm a sys admin and an IT guy who wrote on the side for a while.  And when when Ken Fisher asked me to join, it was a really big career change for me.  But I have to tell you, after after having been here for two years,  September 10th was my was my second service anniversary at Ars.  It is the greatest bunch of people I've ever had the honor of working with.  And the the work environment is, as I'm sure you can imagine, really lively and really hilarious.  And it's it's just great. It's a great bunch of people.  It's a great job. I every every day is kind of a gift, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. You guys write some really cool stuff and you write a lot of really cool stuff personally.  So it's really exciting to see that. And so welcome to the fraternity of journalists.  I'm sure you drink much more heavily now and you have a penchant for free food and so on.  So welcome to the world of journalism.  One of the only one of the only professions that is more lowly rated among the public opinion than I.T. people.  So that was a step in the wrong direction.  But anyway, it's great stuff and I really enjoy all of your work.  So let's jump into it. Of course, the big news this week is everything that Apple announced.  And a lot of my Android fan friends have asked me, please, enough with the Apple stuff already.  We do have to cover certain things, but I want to zero in on some of the unique things that have been under covered about the Apple event, starting with the watch.  The watch, of course, in general is a point of controversy with the Apple lovers saying it's the greatest thing in the history of mankind.  The Apple haters saying it's a copycat. It's overpriced. It's too big.  It's so on. And all of that, of course, is true to a certain extent.  But I want to talk about a couple aspects of this watch, not only about the watch itself, but the technology and how they're being how it's being implemented.  And also what its prospects are for being a popular culture shifting sort of item, which I have a tendency to believe that it is.  So the two general areas of technology that I want to focus in on, because we've talked about all the wristbands and the gold and all that kind of stuff ad nauseum all week long, is the pressure sensitive screen, which is really interesting.  And also the tactics engine and how Apple is implementing that.  So let's just let's just go around the horn app. Andy, you you were playing with it.  You came right out of the Flint Center building to talk to us on our live coverage and you you were impressed with certain aspects of it.  But I've read since then that you're kind of on the fence. You can't really you don't have a really good reading about whether this is like the greatest thing ever or if it's just an also ran thing that's just overpriced.  So what is your feeling right now as it now exists about the Apple watch?

Start time: 642.24
End time: 832.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right now, I just don't think I have enough information to have a real opinion on it yet.  As a physical object, I think it's great. I think it's the first smartwatch I've ever seen that if this were an analog watch, I would consider buying it just as an analog watch.  The stainless steel version with that serpentine metal band. Man, that's a handsome piece of jewelry.  But the problem was that I think it was a much different work rollout than the iPhone rollout was or the iPad rollout was.  And I was at both of those things. And you left at the end of it with a very clear picture of what Apple intended people to do with this.  But here is the entire story from start to ending of what this product is.  And remember, both of those products, those weren't shipping for several months either.  When I left the at the end of the day from the from the Apple watch event, I felt like they'd shown me a complete picture about the fitness features.  But I did not know what sort of role they intended for this to play in people's daily lives.  I was, for instance, I was really concerned that the last thing I expected to see was as part of the demonstration is here is a constellation of dozens and dozens of application icons.  So many you need to zoom in and scroll in order to select an app.  I think do I want dozens and dozens of application icons on a on a wristwatch when I have a phone right in my pocket?  And and guess what? We have there are so many ways to interact with it.  You can tap on the screen. You can press because it's pressure sensitive and press and hold down the screen.  You can swipe on the screen. We have a scroll wheel here.  There's a button on the scroll wheel, too. And there's a second button right over here underneath it for other purposes.  And that was another thing that I would not have predicted from an Apple watch like that.  Doesn't that sound like a lot of controls for, again, a simple device?  I know the difficulty is that we're all all of us, the makers, the consumers and those of us who have to talk and write about it.  We're all trying to figure out what the role of a computer on your wrist is supposed to be.  We're expecting it to be as radical as the difference between a tablet and a notebook or a phone and a tablet.  And I just don't think Apple really made it very clear to us whether or not we're supposed to.  This is supposed to be a device that we glance at as we would glance a watch to get a specific piece of information and then go back to our lives.  Or whether we're meant to sit there like twiddling this thing and just looking at photos and getting news information and navigating the universe and checking out planets.  So it's possible that Apple themselves are still working on the software and they're still working on what they think this is going to be.  For now, again, I just don't have enough information to reach a conclusion, particularly based on we were we had access to what looked to be finished hardware.  But the watches that were actually running interactive software were only on the risks of senior Apple executives and the demonstrators.  And we were not allowed to touch those in any way, shape or form.  So I'm looking forward to the coming months when maybe Apple will reveal a little bit more about the sort of software they expect developers to write for it.  More importantly, the sort of software that they hope the developers will not write for it.  And when I get my first chance to really go hands on with this and figure out what that experience is like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, Kevin, let me give you my little theory about the Apple watch.  It's essentially that they got a long list of things wrong. It's too big. It's too ugly. It's too expensive.  The interface stuff that Andy talked about is definitely a problem.  The scrolling around all the millions of icons. There are a lot of problems about it.  And there's many aspects of about the Apple watch that are identical in function to any other sort of Android wear watch or any of the non Android wear watch watches out there, even the Tizen watches.  But my essential theory is that Apple is onto something that is really tapping into the future of wearable technology in general.  And you're a wearable writer. You write a lot about the wearable space.  And what that thing is, is that the Taptics engine, combined with sound, combined with the touch interface, create you.  It brings into into your experience a lot more of your senses.  So instead of like, here's some information going out and here's some information coming back in.  It's tactile. So, for example, this is this. These facts are under reported, in my opinion.  When you sit there and use the scroll wheel, there's a specific vibration and a specific sound that's associated with that gesture that's exactly in sync with that gesture that you feel on the bottom of the wrist.  When you tap on it, you when you tap on the top of the screen, you feel that your own tap on your skin.  And when you move things around, everything has a haptic element with a with a combined sound that goes with that.  And so the the end result is that this thing becomes kind of psychologically and emotionally part of your body, essentially, instead of just being a thing that shuttles information on and off.  It becomes part of you and you inevitably will have phantom vibration syndrome and all that kind of stuff later on.  What do you think about that theory? Is that is that is does that make sense to you?  Or is that just to sound like some fancy features that they're throwing in there that are just designed to be harder to do for their competitors?

Start time: 950.22
End time: 1104.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I think you're onto something there, Mike.  And I think Apple is onto something, too. But I have to agree with Andy in that they haven't told the whole story.  As much information came out of the event, I actually only wrote one post out of the entire event.  And it revolved around, did Apple really give people a reason to want this thing?  I basically said they're trying to redefine a market that isn't yet defined.  And that's kind of new territory for them. Now, granted, the the the haptic feedback, it does look more advanced than what we have on competing devices.  I love the idea that as you're getting navigation directions, you don't even have to glance at your watch.  You'll feel the left tap or the right tap when it's time to make your left turn or your right turn.  If you're walking around, for example, I think that's where some of the innovation lies.  But I don't think that we've yet seen the full story and how that's going to be applied.  You know, it comes down to what what do people want this thing for?  What does Apple want people to use this for?  The haptics are interesting to me, very much so.  But granted, we've had haptics in devices forever, and there have been some improvements on that.  Some keyboards have haptics that are kind of if you're tapping on the left side of the screen, you could kind of feel the haptic touch on the left side as you're touching and so on.  But I'm not sure that, you know, the whole story has been told here.  And if you notice, Apple did not call this a smartwatch, not one single time.  And what we've been talking about here is smartwatches, by and large, wearable devices and so on.  I don't think that Apple wants this to be classified as a smartwatch.  I think, Mike, what they're going after is that that physical experience, that psychological experience that you were just mentioning.  And they're still working out the bits and pieces on how to make that happen without calling this a smartwatch, because let's face it, a lot of the features, as you said, they're already available on Android Wear and such.  But are they compelling features, you know, favoriting a photo on my iPhone so I can see it on my watch?  Why would I do that when I have to have the phone with me?  I want to see it on the bigger screen, the better screen.  That's not a compelling reason to spend three fifty or much more, because that's the starting price, probably for the lowest and smallest watch.  So, again, the haptics, the pressure sensitivity, it sounds interesting.  Apple's good at hardware.  I'm not even sure about the whole touch versus tap and the pressure sensitivity, though, because let's face it.  I mean, when your iPhone can detect a touch or a tap, if you tap and hold, it knows that you want to rearrange your home screen.  There was a lot of marketing mumbo jumbo around that.  And I'm not completely sold on that being innovative yet.  I really need to see the product.

Transcript:  In addition to this watch touching you, Apple, you know, this interesting concept, Apple touching you all the time.  They're also going to be touching your money with Apple Pay.  And this is an interesting implementation, I think, for the Apple Watch because essentially how it works is you authenticate the watch, presumably with your fingerprint on the phone.  And then as long as the watch stays lashed to your wrist, you're good to go to pay for stuff.  And as soon as you remove it from your wrist, it loses the authentication and you can't do it anymore.  Generally speaking, what did you think of Apple Pay, not only as a technology and the implementation of that technology,  but as a competitor to all the other methods for electronic and mobile payment?

Start time: 1164.91
End time: 1272.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's an interesting question.  And the best answer I can give you is that even if something hasn't necessarily taken over the world by storm yet, don't discount Apple.  They seem to have a way of taking technologies that are sort of right on the edge and then pushing them into mainstream and having people adopt them.  I'm not really sure if it's something that I would necessarily use, the integrated watch pay.  But at the same time, I'm kind of old fashioned.  And the idea of the idea of storing payment details in a mobile device like that really kind of makes me nervous, which maybe means I'm outdated.  But it's not really something that I think I would take advantage of very much.  Credit cards are a well-established system.  Merchant agreements between the people who are accepting cards and the card, the banks and everything, the payment processors, MasterCard and Visa do a really great job of protecting consumers.  But Apple adding them into that link, adding any payment, a mobile payment system into that link is just another speed bump to overcome.  We actually just published today, I believe, a really good overview of Apple Pay written by Megan Geist, one of my guys.  She's a girl, but written by one of my people.  And she goes really in-depth on how it works out.  But I don't know.  I mean, the analogy that I read online was that, I'm going to screw this up.  It's like Google pushes the frontiers and then Apple sort of brings all the settlers in after the frontiers have been pushed.  And I think that you'll probably see mobile payments looking at one of those things where it's like that.  Like Google and other smartwatch vendors have sort of tread this territory before, and phones too.  But now we're going to see, I think, it actually taking off because Apple is going to push it mainstream, as they have done with lots of things that a lot of folks didn't know they needed, like tablets, for example.

Transcript:  The iPhone, the iPad, and now the iWatch.  Apple Watch, the Apple Watch.  Damn, I'm never going to get used to that.  The Apple Watch stands for a pleasantly plump little electronic watch.  Android's terrible.  Come here.  It does so many cool little thingies.  You can share your heartbeat for some reason.  You can try looking at pictures on a one inch screen.  You can buy five in a row and watch them dance.  You can thumb something down or up.  You can even set the date just like a regular watch.  Oh, it's got maps on it.  Kind of like the phone you already have.  Can it tell time?  Yes.  Do you have to charge it every night?  Yes.  Just like a regular watch.  Sending emoji has never been more complicated.  You can draw and send pictures to your friends.  We don't know how to turn off dick pics though.  I mean, it's going to happen.  That will be a feature that will come in the iWatch 2.  Apple Watch 2.  I'm never going to not say that.  Now you can watch YouTube videos right on your watch.  Now you can watch YouTube videos right on your watch.  Hey man, can you like move?  Shut up, man.  It also comes with Apple Pay so you can use your watch like a credit card.  And trust us, Apple will keep your banking information very secure.  Just like all those nude pics.

Transcript:  Tim Cook did it too on some network TV show.  He actually said the iWatch.  It's a difficult one to break.  Difficult one to break.  And I think everybody's making the same mistake.  Although it's probably cool to see them retire the i thing.  That was kind of a trend years and years and years ago when the iPod came out.  That was the thing.  People were putting E and then I in front of everything.  So I think Apple Watch makes a lot more sense.  I'm guessing the next phone will be called the Apple phone or something.

That you could see, I saw this exact same sort of stuff on Steve Jobs' face when he was introducing the iPhone.  And it just immediately hits you that this guy has been keeping a lid on a secret for a year or two or three.  And now he finally gets to tell everybody about this cool thing that he and the rest of the team have been working on.  There's some obvious pride there.  Oh it is.

He sometimes has, what's the best way to put this, he sometimes seems like he's not the most enthusiastic presenter.  He often comes out and he looks like he's maybe a little nervous or maybe about to puke on stage or whatever.  But you're absolutely right Andy, this time he came out and he was gleeful, he was engaging.  It was really good to see.

Transcript:  It was clear that this was his way of stepping out from under Steve's shadow.  This was the Tim Show, the first major product release on his watch.  No pun intended.  You're right, you guys could see the obvious pride.  He was excited to show this off and showing his emotions I think here were higher than anything else I've seen him present so far.  It was actually nice to see for him.

Transcript:  Plus he got to touch Bono's finger.  That was a highlight.  Now he was so excited it gave me the feeling that they weren't going to tell him that there was a big meltdown,  that they were essentially showing the truck schedule for a lot of this announcement.  And then later they were giving the Mandarin or Japanese translations as part of this thing.  The entire launch has been plagued by problems.  There have been three major problems.  One of them was the fiasco for the video when they rolled out the announcement.  We covered it live and it was just a train wreck in terms of the weird audio, the truck schedule, all that kind of stuff.  And then when they did pre-orders they got everybody on the East Coast up at 3 o'clock in the morning to order this phone for some reason.  And then there were glitches and they quickly ran out even though lots of people had trouble ordering it.  And there were probably shortages in the United States because they probably reserved millions of these units for China.  But then the Chinese government didn't approve them for sale.  And we still, as far as I know, don't have a date for when the iPhones will be available for sale in China.  And this seems to be part of the ongoing harassment by the Chinese government of American technology companies  for a long list of reasons and gripes that they have, plus to protect Chinese companies presumably.  So how bad is this for Apple do you think?  Are these passing glitches that people will forget about or is this going to go down in history as a flawed and glitch-filled launch?

Transcript:  I hope not because think about all the work and all the thought that goes into developing two new phones and a brand new platform.  And then are we really going to dismiss that because the video feed was not good and because they couldn't handle the initial onrush of orders?  It's embarrassing certainly because Apple is certainly very known for.  They're the company that says we make sure that the back of the fence is painted just as well as the front of the fence  because every step of the work actually matters whether it's visible to the consumer or not.  And so this is obviously embarrassing to them.  And also I think it's mostly it's firepower for people who just really want to find nasty things to say about Apple.  And so you can say nasty things about you can say that you can talk about things you don't like about the hardware.  And you can also say that this is legitimately embarrassing that they had such a not just a glitch but such a humiliating glitch.  But I mean even AV Club they were talking about the reviewing this week's project runway in which one of the one of the one of the designers put a  dressed on the runway that was inspired by color bars from a Samsung TV.  And of course they had to tie that into a joke about about it was a celebration of the Apple fiasco the first half minute half hour of the thing.  That is bad PR. That's not something that Apple likes.  But it's it's embarrassing when you see so many people talking about things that certainly matter but they don't matter as much as anybody thinks it will.  I mean the last thing to say is that at the end of the day how much money is Apple making?  How great is the demand for their products? If both of those are high.  OK though they're willing to take the hit for an embarrassing couple of embarrassing glitches like that.

I mean look at if if I look at you know the ridicule that we'd be heaping on any company that was in this position right if Google had a product launch and this happened during Google's  live stream we you know everybody would be flinging just as much poo with them.  It's it's embarrassing but it's absolutely not the end of the world and I don't think it reflects on any company's ability to you know to execute their product.  I mean scaling demand is you know video streaming demand at this at the you know tremendous scale that a keynote like this gets gets watched that has got to be very very difficult.

Transcript:  I couldn't do it. Yeah it's not going to hurt any sales at all and I mean you guys are right it might be embarrassing but long story short nobody's going to remember this in a month or two after they've got their iPhones in hand and such.  You know Mike you brought up the whole China government and no iPhones for sale there.  You know last month there was something interesting that happened I don't know if everybody caught this.  The Chinese government a specific area of it told the carriers the big three carriers over there.  You guys are spending far too much on hardware subsidies for the phones and they basically said that you guys need to cut down on the subsidies by two billion dollars this year.  This was actually just China mobile alone and I'm wondering if Apple's playing a little hardball here saying whoa the whole piece of the subsidy pie is going down.  We got to make sure we get our share. I just wonder if that's playing into this at all.

That is a good point and one final thing on the Apple announcement we're going to talk a little bit about the iPhone the quality of the iPhone whether you should buy it or not in just a sec after we take a break in just a minute.  But one final thing about the whole launch was the YouTube thing overblown. YouTube I'm sorry YouTube the integration of YouTube's album onto the phones which now people are publishing instructions for how to get rid of it.  And the whole YouTube on stage and the touching the fingers and all that kind of was this too much.  It's this thing kind of like tone deaf as a presentation metric and also as a rollout for this album. What do you guys think.

I've heard figures up to 100 million dollars that Apple paid in order to have access to the out to have exclusive access to the album from a consumer perspective though I think more than anything else people were a little creeped out.  I think with this demonstration that Apple can they have the ability through the iTunes cloud service to sort of reach out and touch your library and put stuff into it.  I mean you know it's it's obvious what happened you know we regular iTunes users understand the technology you know we're tech journalists we know all this works but I mean for the average person it's like how did this get in my library.

Transcript:  Well they couldn't have they couldn't have anticipated that.  And it's also Apple has difference Apple has a different relationship with its consumers that they really do consistently project this this point of view that look we don't care about what you do with our products we don't know we're not here to be involved in your daily lives we just want you to buy our products and use our services.  I'm a little bit I was a little bit bummed by Amazon and Google music music services because now my my online libraries my cloud libraries are corrupted by songs I don't like that were just simply given to me for free and I should I should not I should be pleased that well if you give me 50 songs that I like four of them.  I should be pleased I got four free songs that I like but nonetheless I've got this these music that will might come up on shuffle play that I don't like.  But you sort of expect that from Google you expect that from Amazon you don't expect that from Apple so whether or not that was something they should not have done it really does change the relationship a little bit maybe in some people's minds.

Transcript:  Well just said we're going to take a break and just said we can come back and talk about which is the best phone you can buy the best one that has come out or will come out this year but first I want to tell you about Scotty vest you see the shirt right here this is called a Scotty vest.  This shirt kind of a jacket like shirt but it's it could be worn as a shirt or a jacket has 13 pockets it has a zippered seam side pockets on the side has a bunch of pockets inside quick dry fabric perfect for travel I like to say that everybody who's able to work from anywhere other than an office is a digital nomad we're all digital nomads now because we can all most of us can work in various locations at Starbucks while traveling on airplanes in the car while waiting for various things to happen.  Trains and buses and whatever it is we do and so we need our clothing to match that we most of us wear jeans all the time and there's a little pocket in your jeans that exists for a pocket watch.  Yeah once upon a time we used to build our clothes to to go with our gadgets and our technology and we still need to do that we just have a lot more gadgets a lot more technology and that's what Scotty vest is really all about.  I think it was last year maybe a year before that my wife and I were in Spain and we're watching the Las Fias festival this is a big festival where they burn almost the whole city to the ground every year they build these big effigies and they burn it down I was taking video and pictures with my iPhone there was a huge crowd of people and I had it on a stick and then I wanted to use my other camera so I didn't have a place to put my phone it had a big big special attachment on it was so it's too big for my my pockets and I handed it to my office and I called the guy and he said you know what Scotty, we're going to do a live stream.  So I went to my wife she put it in her purse and then somebody came up behind her and pickpocketed my phone and also had a wallet attachment so all my credit cards were in there everything was gone.  Okay, so this is one of the best use cases I've ever heard of for using a Scotty vest shirt if I had this shirt when I was at Las Fias I would have simply put the phone in one of the 13 pockets and I probably still have that phone I could have sold it to Gazelle and so on and made a bundle.  But instead I had to replace it and that was a bummer. Interestingly Scotty vest has a pickpocket guarantee if you get jacked while you're wearing this device and something stolen out of one of the pockets and good luck to the pickpocketers.  They will give you a thousand up to a thousand dollars reimbursement for whatever it is that was stolen that's that's how confident they are and I've you know my wife and I live for a couple years as digital nomads we lived all we live in Kenya we lived in Greece we lived in all over Europe and spent some time in Morocco and so on.  And norms vary in terms of how you use technology in public for example in Greece I learned it was really kind of an odd thing if you walking around with with earbuds sticking out those white signature Apple earbuds.  It's kind of socially unacceptable to walk around listening to podcasts which you know I have to listen to podcasts all the time and so shirt like this has actually has a.  All Scott almost all Scotty vest jackets and shirts have a way to hide your earbuds so the whole cables inside the shirt and then you can just reach into the collar and pull out the earbuds and listen to them and they're very difficult to see places like London.  You have those white earbuds you're just a target for pickpockets theft on the street of iPhones is very very high because people can see from a mile away that you've got those white earbuds so Scotty vest is a solution to that as well and Chad is actually wearing another Scotty vest.

The zipper matches your hair isn't it awesome I absolutely love this thing and the pockets not only are there are numerous but they can hold sometimes some kind of ridiculous items I have my iPad inside of inside of my jacket here.  This also has a really cool feature that if say it's getting a little warm but you still want a little bit more protection also has a hood inside of this collar here I can actually pull off the sleeves if I want they're all magnetically attached and now I have a sleeveless.  I can actually pull off this vest instead of a jacket and then this is all just magnets and they'll just snap right back on it's a really really cool jacket I totally think the tropa former is like the coolest thing I've ever had.

With all these mobile devices they don't get a really good battery life so you're going to want to carry that that Apple watch charger somewhere you're going to need lots of pockets for the new world of wearable computing and of course if you have these pockets and you're wearing these things then all your technology is wearable computing.

Transcript:  it's windows phone but you know I really like it what can I say all right what do you think Andy I would add the Lumia 1020 to that list because it has something it has something that no other phone has which is that really that absolutely pocket cameras quality camera on it nothing when I when I did my big shootout a couple months ago but every single every single camera every single phone that I had in the office at the time and every other phone that I could get back for a loan for the shootout really was the iPhone 5s  and the Lumia 1020 and for very different reasons because there were the iPhone 5s was the most consistent press this one button get a nice picture but the Lumia could get photos that no other phone could get and windows phone has been making a lot of really big leaps this is a this is a banner year for it which this is this is sort of like the iPhone 3gs year for windows phone where some features that make make it more practical and acceptable for more people are finally here still a pity that the software  library is only adequate and not exciting still a pity that they're getting acceptance for it and support for it is not is not as good as anything you can get on Android or iOS but I pretty much I pretty much agree with your lineup I would take the only one that I might not put on that list would be the HTC one because that camera is just a non-starter so you guys are both focusing in on the cameras which is makes a lot of sense on the camera no no I think that there's so many of these other features are so similar to each other  the screens are almost all exactly as good as the other individual features from Android phone to Android phone there's enough to the feature of Android is diversity so that if you really really want something to be weatherproof great you can choose between the Sony or the Samsung S5 if you really want something that has haptic sense has a really good sensor array is very forward thinking and gets great Android updates then you want to go for the Motorola so and so on and so on and so on when  for me the difference between the HTC and the rest is that any reason that I would have for getting the HTC there's a better reason for getting a competing phone and because not this at the camera becomes a deciding factor when you have so many phones that might be so close to each other it seems to me though Andy that essentially which are gaining is a better camera in some cases plus some of the other features you mentioned I mean these are hardware features for the most part and they're awesome and compelling features but you're pretty much giving up on a two huge universes of apps  is that really a trade-off you'd be willing to make for some it would again we're talking about a constellation of great phones if I'm saying that if someone is asking me hey you recommend a phone it's probably going to be one of these five probably not the HTC but because I think there are other phones I could  I'm not the sort of person who keeps getting different games every single month or keeps trying to expand my universe with different apps I have my usage for phone is pretty much within the 65 to 75 percent of the universe bandwidth of it maybe they could be more attracted to the way that windows phone works which is a very attractive user interface I love their start screen and if they tell me that really this is the only camera they ever use and they're concerned they're concerned about all the times where they're going to have to  have gotten bad pictures bad once in a lifetime pictures from their iPhone or from their previous Android phone then I would sound them out on well what if I what if I told you there is a one only one camera that has all the features that these other phone cameras do not have you have to do some trade-offs in terms of its functionality as a an app running device but if that's not a problem for you you should at least take a look at it I agree that I would not recommend the 1020 or Windows phone to the majority of people I would have

Transcript:  to talk to them first to find out what they're looking for yeah for that what their expectations are Kevin Toffle what's it going to be what would you what would be your list and you think the Moto X the new Moto X is likely to be to merit inclusion on this list absolutely the Moto X belongs on this list I have one in my hand right here the new Moto X as you said it goes on sale September 16th I was a big fan of the of last year's Moto X and I think that Motorola has addressed the the glaring gap  the few glaring gaps that the original device had particularly in the camera I'll agree with Andy you know this is not going to compete with a Lumia PureView camera by any means but for most people I think it's going to be perfectly fine you know this this I think is the Moto X that Motorola wanted to build last year but really couldn't because of the hardware chip cycle they just couldn't wait for Qualcomm to get their act together and therefore they had to put that special chip together with the with the processors and sensors and stuff  much improved battery life is good so I'm already I was already a fan of the Moto X so I will probably be buying the current Moto X but as Lee said just before the show he's device agnostic platform agnostic I try to be the same way I did order an iPhone 6 not a 6 plus and I also do own a Windows Phone 520 Lumia 520 which I'll probably replace with a 521 just to keep track of what's going on in the Windows Phone world why did you order the 6 instead of the 6 plus is it because you're a runner and you like to carry it  with you when you're running that's that's really a big part of it Mike I originally had the Galaxy Note 2 before that was cool if that ever was and I used to carry that everywhere I mean I've used the I've been down the phablet road two years before most people are going down it so I use those phones in fact the iPhone 6 plus is very similarly sized to the Galaxy Note 2 that I used to use the thing is I have gotten more into running with my phone most of the smartwatches still require a phone so it's not like I can wear a smartwatch  and go out and run and have a GPS route tracked for me because I think only the Sony smartwatch 3 has GPS right now for Android wear so yeah so I stuck with what I wanted I wanted a larger iPhone but I didn't need a bigger you know 5.5 inch phone

Transcript:  shift from you know not quite as big screen to 5.2 inch screen is it really really noticeable when you have the two the pre the first gen Moto X and the new one next to each other yeah that's definitely true I hope that we're not going to totally abandon people for whom right for whom this is actually kind of a perfect size phone it because it really is a very attractive size it's just big enough I think without to let you really have the full phone experience without making you have to  buy a special shirt to carry it around in so I'm sorry that Motorola did not decide to keep that that size in the lineup but I just wanted to quickly underscore what Kevin was saying the the the lead paragraph in my Moto X review is that finally I have a good default answer to the question what Android phone should I buy because like I said it is all about choice it really is about what do you what are your priorities and hardware because you don't have to settle for only three models of phone from one manufacturer you there's a whole big world out there but now it is like it's  there's chances are excellent probably 80% that the Moto X is the perfect phone is the best Android phone for you unless you want one of these three features in which think about maybe these are the three but definitely don't discount the Moto X because there's so many advantages to it in so many ways I agree and the price is right so exciting you can get it on 99 bucks I had a double check to make sure I got that note correctly 100 this 199 surely no is 99 all right then better incredible now let me ask you one last thing and we'll move on from the

Interesting well just a sec we're going to hear from Facebook and see what they're up to there's a lot of people complaining about Facebook again this week and we'll see what they're up to but first I want to tell you about GoToMeeting one of our sponsors today. GoToMeeting is a suite of applications from Citrix that enables you to communicate very freely and very with very high definition through video and all kinds of other ways that essentially reduces the need for you to go traveling and spend the  fortune and go through the hassle of flying around just to go to meetings in any sort of business strong communication and collaboration are super super important and you know if you're in sales or do anything that involves closing deals of course GoToMeeting can help you close those deals quicker  solve problems better and essentially connects you to your clients your customers and your business partners and your co-workers in a way that's like super super efficient now with GoToMeeting you can meet with online as often as you like with anyone anywhere in the world and you can share screens to review documents presentations in real time together and use the built in HD video conferencing feature to see each other face to face to engage and connect that personally like GoToMeeting meetings far better than in person meetings because you can sit there and you can look at the information don't feel like you're being  rude to people when you're reviewing the documents over an electronic connection but when you want to make eye contact and talk to people in real time you can do that of course to the HD video conferencing feature best of all allows you to cut out the wasted time and expensive travel I personally think that meetings gobble up so much value for every company especially small companies when you don't have a lot of time to flush down the toilet with all this travel is so much better to just have your meeting have this great meeting everything's recorded and then you can move forward and stop wasting so much  time and so much money we of course we use GoToMeeting here at twit and it's like we're in the same room even though we may be miles apart some of the people we interact with on the other side of the world so try GoToMeeting free and see what it can do for you if you go to GoToMeeting.com and just click the try it free for 30 days button and make sure you use the promo code twit that's try it free for 30 days there's a button there and use the promo code twit that's GoToMeeting.com promo code twit and we thank GoToMeeting for their support of twit well Facebook is at it again  they are being slammed in the press for their lack of privacy specifically a report on motherboards said that they talked to a security researcher who examined the code for Facebook messenger and he basically said the code looks more like spyware than like a messaging application simply because it's harvesting so much information there Lee you cover security a lot and security related things what do you think about this is this just Facebook being Facebook is there something that we should all be concerned about

Transcript:  there's an old adage that I try to always keep in mind when looking at applications like this and that is to never ascribe something to malice that can better be ascribed to stupidity I don't honestly I don't believe that you know there's there's an international Facebook cabal that's out to steal everybody's information I think that this this type of application is typically programmed on a deadline the application developers do what they have to do in order to meet their goals and sometimes if less attention is paid to security than is net than  is perhaps wiser prudent it's often because of deadlines are because the developers simply don't care it's I I don't think that this is you know like Facebook is out to you know look at every point on the screen where you tap they want to know so that they can record all of your tapping day I don't think it's anything like that I think that the people who program the app just didn't really give it the appropriate amount of security auditing or simply didn't care and they also put in some kind of sort of funny comments in the code for example they said

Transcript:  and remember also that that Google and Google and Apple both are capturing the same type of data right everybody they use it to Google especially uses your Wi-Fi access point and geolocation in order to help better you know find where you are on maps it's I mean all of these things like the you also have to look at with this particular app they've got access to some of the nonpublic APIs according to the motherboard report because Facebook has such tight integration with you know with the IOS course they're given a little more access than you know random Joe developer would be  so I mean it's it's just really difficult obviously as as journalists we don't have the you know some of us do I suppose most of us don't have the inside knowledge on on the the you know design flow process behind apps like this what what exactly is Facebook trying to achieve by segregating the stuff out I mean there's there's what we can theorize that they want to achieve but what exactly is the goal here and you know it's it's it's hard to say but again I don't think that any of this I mean clearly some of these things are problematic and you know it's not a I'm not a  personally not a I don't I'm not a Facebook user I have Facebook calm black hole in my local DNS I don't account use it like them but I had to send your wise I know I don't think I don't think that this is a purposefully you know malicious app that is out to you know snort up all your credit card data and have you know Facebook steal your personal information and you not go how concerned should be people be about Facebook's alleged privacy violations and the messenger

Transcript:  stuff in particular is this a concern yeah I think that anything anytime you talk about Facebook and privacy you should be concerned it's part of your responsibility as a Facebook user to really curate all of your settings carefully and make sure that this is that Facebook is working the way that you want it to because they just have a deplorable track record here and I don't it's I agree that it's it's it's kind of broke to to imagine red red-robed people and accolades inside of Facebook  circling around a scrying pool trying to figure out what what brand of shampoo that you personally are using and being upset that they don't know what brand of shampoo you're using but the there is such a thing as corporate culture there is such a thing as there is a message that is sent to every single employee through the behavior of the rest of the company is privacy of user data important well not really it can be sacrificed for the greater good and we believe that sometimes the greater good includes the greater good of the users of Facebook that's why we make sure that if you put that  if someone sends you an invite to something and you click well maybe I'll go we want to post that on your wall so that all of your friends know that you might be attending the roller derby in Framingham in two weeks time even though you just thought you're privately telling your a friend of yours who is a roller derby roller derby team that you're going to try to make it this time so you really do need to curate this stuff carefully in terms of when bugs like this happen again it's most likely it's an as an honest mistake but you would also I also would have to think that  a company that takes privacy more seriously would already have had safeguards in place to say hey look if we're taking if we're taking a look at this kind of data we have to make sure we get sign offs on this this and this we're going to add so much to our QA process for this feature to make sure that it is not possible to compromise people's data that way if you don't take that stuff terribly seriously you're definitely to make sure that the program doesn't do anything that it's not supposed to do but you're not going to put up those five barricades against bad things happening so if you're going to ask me should I be concerned about privacy  with Facebook the answer to that is always yes.

Transcript:  You know it's interesting that I have the feeling that Facebook likes to say that they care about privacy and I believe that they believe that they safeguard privacy but they also harvest all kinds of personal data for all kinds of reasons mostly to improve I think they generally want to improve the app but I think the key point with Facebook is that they've discovered somewhere along the line that users don't care there are a few vocal people in the press who complain about privacy violations and who really pay attention to this stuff but they have 1.3 1.4  billion how many users do they have now and the vast majority I'd say better than 98% I'm making these numbers up just don't care they just don't care at all they you know they you know they just trust Facebook or they believe that they don't have privacy information they may not be thinking about how a malicious person might be able to put two and two together and figure stuff out or whatever but they've learned that people don't care and Kevin Tovell let me ask you this if people don't care if Facebook is in fact right about that isn't it okay for them to just harvest

Transcript:  all the information in sight if the end is to improve the product isn't that a laudable goal well you know they're a business and you know they're in business to make money and they're going to do that by capturing this data would I say that it's all right no I wouldn't but I think you hit the nail on the head because most people these days I mean we've been using smartphones now for how many years we've been downloading app after app after app we're becoming numb to the permissions of what these things can do because we're just  you know it's just part of our life now to download the app and go to you know and we're putting a lot of trust in all of these companies should we that's obviously a personal choice you know I would have to side with Andy and say you know we do need to be very cautious with it with a company such as a Facebook or you know whatever whoever it is be at Google be at Microsoft be at Apple I think Facebook has an obligation to be forthcoming with what they're doing with data and when they make changes but again part of the problem as you're alluding to Mike is  people either don't care or don't want to invest the time to care.

Transcript:  Can I think a lot of folks have kind of a reactive mindset about privacy and I mean we've been trained to that right. You look at these corporations that are putting out large you know invasive applications that you depend on for huge chunks of your life like Facebook and you trust that they're going to do the right thing.  And what your definition of the right thing is and what Facebook's definition of the right thing is maybe different. It's certainly easy for Facebook to say trust us because Facebook you know speaking of them as a big monolithic entity they understand what they're doing and they know that you know whatever they're doing is ethical by their standards and so you know why wouldn't you want to trust us you know just you know we're going to have this app and you just just go ahead and do we're doing the right thing we're Facebook trust us.  People are often very passive about their response to security issues and they wait until there are compromises or issues to adjust their privacy settings for example. This is I think just one more thing.

Start time: 3612.78
End time: 3725.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah I just want to say on the on the subject of people don't care.  It's OK for that to be a factor when people are informed and they understand the situation and they've decided that they don't care.  But if they don't understand that look the fact that that this motor this car company has put the gas tank this close to the bumper means that if there is even a minor rear end collision there's a good chance that the fuel will splash into the passenger compartment and a very survivable accident will turn into a four way fatality.  Then if they decide that I'm still OK with with the styling of having this with not having regulations about the gas tank or buying this car no matter what.  That's silly but OK you can allow them to do that. I think that it's our responsibility to make sure that they know what they're what the hazards are because again I'm not telling anybody to not use Facebook.  I did a podcast a video a couple of weeks ago where I decided to say nice things about each of the five what I feel to be major consumer facing companies.  And the thing I had to say that was nice about Facebook was that the fact is it connects everybody and the fact that you're you're you are a great uncle and you get to find out things about your nieces and nephews life that lives that they want you to know about without every without having to call every single day.  That is a good thing that Facebook does but so I'm not saying that anybody should be would be foolish to trust Facebook with us with their transactions.  All I'm saying is that they have to be aware of this is what the company does and this is what the philosophy of the company does and this is the history of their company and the company and private information.  They're not evil but the idea of protecting your personal information and making sure that you're not exposing things to the company into the world that you would not want to be exposed.  That's not a very high priority so know about that and then what then take a look at the pictures of your your your nieces a high school graduation party but definitely know what you're getting into if you don't care the price of not caring is knowing what you're not caring about.

Start time: 3725.64

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah that's a great point and I get the feeling that Facebook is kind of similar to Google in the sense that you know there are two kinds of companies there are companies like Apple which have this you know behind the scenes they form this grand vision and it's very clear to them what that vision is.  And then they plow forward toward that vision and then there are companies like Facebook and Google that throw spaghetti against the wall to see what sticks and I think that Facebook and Google in both cases part of their model is to build a better user and a better user is one that can tolerate more invasions of privacy to a certain extent.  So they they both tend to push push push and see the pushing they they're sort of like blazing you know blazing into new territory in terms of getting people to accept different things and privacy standpoint as part of their survival strategy because you have to reinvent yourself all the time if you're in technology.  And this is how these companies do it and so you know in the case of Facebook they you know I have a an ongoing thing that I do on Google plus with my post where every time they issue another apology I do a big post about it and list all their past apologies they apologize.  Ten fifteen times a year for major things that really upset people and that seems to be the policy try anything if everybody freaks out apologize backtrack a little bit and keep pushing forward and that's that's kind of like their governing philosophy in it it works for them they're very very successful and increasingly they're successful financially special in mobile advertising.  There's another aspect to to to Facebook's criticism that's in the news this week a website called Queer Tea it's a network of gay and transgender people and also people who are in drag and who have drag personas and that they want to put on the on the on Facebook as their name.  And they have been apparently I'd singled out by Facebook according this article and and they've been ordered to to pony up their identification their their passports and so on to prove who they really are in order to crack down on real names now you guys remember the real names controversy of a few years ago because both Google plus and Facebook were requiring real names and Facebook recently excuse me Google recently backtracked on that said yeah we don't care what your name is anymore we're not going to  try to force you to have real names but according to this article Facebook is sticking with the real names thing of course this is an attempt to use Facebook for identity which is great for selling people things and and so on so what do you guys think about this.  So Lee let's let's start with you is this what why is Facebook insisting on real names if in fact these reports are true.

Start time: 3877.60
End time: 3973.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can you guys hear me okay I have like a little video glitch a second ago. Yeah you sound great. Okay.  You know the the Internet has traditionally separated people's real life identity from the identity that they have the option of portraying online.  And I think it's I think when a company decides that they want to you know sort of step in and police anonymity or they want to come in and you know use their position as the provider of a network you know in this case Facebook to sort of like make sure everybody is behaving correctly and tying their online identity to their real life identity.  I think it's a massive invasion of privacy and I think it's a terrible mistake. I think that I think that this is a huge overstep. It is it's not it doesn't do anything to stop abuse. I think we clearly saw that with Google's real name policy and the tying of names with G plus and all of that craziness that was supposed to fix YouTube comments and make life better and it just didn't.  Blizzard with Battle. Net has in the past tried to do a real name thing that flopped terribly. And this is you know this is just another terrible idea. I don't think that forcing people to identify online with a with their real name serves anybody's interests at all except potentially you know advertisers who are building profiles etc etc.  This is this is a terrible idea. It's an invasion of privacy and it is runs the risk of exposing you know the classic examples are it runs the risk of exposing victims of domestic violence or victims of crimes who want to you know still be able to communicate with others online but hide their identities.  It's it's I'm absolutely opposed to it. I think it's terrible.

Start time: 3981.22
End time: 4060.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not really. There's conceptually a benefit. We all understand how we imagine how much better the Internet would be if everybody who says something had to put their own reputation behind it. But this is why it's so great to have technology that that evolves.  I think five years ago we would not have considered the idea of their people who who need to have anonymity their people who need protection their people who wouldn't participate if they had to expose their true selves to the world.  And that certainly is their their prerogative. And so I think as a society we have to ask ourselves do we want to exclude those people in the interest of hopefully the broader goal of a more rational and a more polite Internet.  Or do we simply say OK we did not think about that. So let's figure out a way to make sure that these people can be safe and be happy and not feel as though they're excluded from this worldwide conversation this worldwide community and find a different way of making the making the Internet a more polite place.  I think that if Facebook wants to stick to the idea of real identity. Good luck with that. I think they're definitely wrong. They're very ignorant.  They were not wrong to think that was a good idea to begin with. But now that we know the ramifications of real identity for so many people you really have to accept that this is a different world that their world excuse me that someone else's world is different than the world that I myself might live in.

Transcript:  And it seems discriminatory in the sense that if you know let's say I want to call myself Kevin Toffle on the on Facebook.  They have no way that I would I would have bask in the glory of being Kevin Toffle.  But but they have no way to challenge that they wouldn't challenge it that I would just be allowed to use somebody else's name or a made up name that sounds like a reasonable name.  There are people all over the world like if somebody you know isn't from a relatively speaks a relatively obscure language somebody's from Swaziland or something.  And how does Facebook know if a certain name is really fake or sounds legit from all these different languages and so on.  And so people for example this this this case revolves around a person who I believe identifies themselves as male and the name is Sister Roma.  So that's a case where Facebook would single that out and say wait a minute that doesn't sound like a real name.  And so there's certain types of names maybe OMG Chad for example when the real names policy hit back in the three years ago OMG Chad is the name I believe Chad you wanted to use on Google plus.

Start time: 4123.30
End time: 4149.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And he said that doesn't sound like a real name. Absolutely it was the worst and because Google plus was forcing you to integrate with YouTube.  And so the only way that I could get my YouTube name was to create a page and I had spent all this time creating my normal account my Chad Johnson account.  But I couldn't integrate that with YouTube because of the forced integration.  Yeah that was definitely a huge issue for me and it didn't even have these LGBT concepts around it.

Transcript:  It's a pretty poor thing. It's a pretty poor thing to tell somebody that they don't have a right to self determination to say this is who I am and this is how I want the world to refer to me as and to say that no we're not going to let you choose your name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's that's poor behavior. That's terrible. Now the other side of this of course is something that has to be mentioned now.  Violet blue really went after Google plus with the real names thing because specifically for transgender and gay people who who who basically were being outed against their will by Google when they had the real names policy.  But the other side of the coin is when you have real names if they could really do real names people who want to speak up in public and still be able to smack down trolls and block them permanently real names are more a more powerful way to do that.  And so there's a there's a benefit to people who want to be public and and who want to be free from trolls because real names right now since since Google dropped the real names policy you know trolls are popping up all the time to harass people with racist and misogynistic comments.  And when they're blocked they just create a new identity and come in as a different person happens all the time. So that's the other side of this.  But I think I agree with all of you that that the larger benefit is toward allowing people to use the names that they want to use.  And of course in Chad's case they fixed Google plus but it's too late for Chad you've already got way too many followers now to really go back and change it right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And to be honest it kind of killed Google plus for me. I don't I basically don't use Google plus anymore because I have a public face which is OMG Chad which is associated with YouTube account.  And I have my Chad Johnson account which is the one that I actually use and is connected with all the things on my phone and the page isn't really connected to things on my phone.  I've they lost a user and a pretty prevalent one because I was really enjoying Google plus up to that point.

Transcript:  Well we miss you. I know you're on a little bit but you're not as tiny bit you might have been and it's just really mostly auto post YouTube.  Yeah. Yeah. Well it is it is an odd thing.  Well I'm expecting an apology any second now from Facebook and something of a revision of their policy.  But I think they're still going to try to have something of a real names policy.  It's just you know Facebook just can do no wrong.  No matter how many times they come and sort of hit people with unpopular policies like that they're still huge.  You got to go there because everyone you know is on Facebook.  They have what I call a monopoly on everybody.  Everybody's on Facebook because everybody's on Facebook.  And so I don't think people really care that much about the service itself.  That's just where people are. So they they'll continue to dominate I'm sure.  Well just a sec. We're going to talk about something dear to OMG Chad's life which is the potential purchase which will probably be announced tomorrow by Microsoft of Minecraft and the company that makes it.  But first I want to tell you about another one of our sponsors which is Shutterstock.  Now I've been blogging for many many years.  I've been blogging since before blogs existed.  And if you want to be blogging nowadays you have to be visual.  You have to be super visual.  You can't just throw text based blog post because nobody will want to read them.  We live in a visual world.  Well sometimes we blog things that are very abstract.  So how do you come up with a visual element for something very abstract an idea like privacy like how do you illustrate that with a visual element.  How do you illustrate that with a compelling image.  Well you do it with Shutterstock because Shutterstock is an amazing service for.  Of course they have other things besides pictures but for pictures and blogging.  This is an amazing service.  They also have of course video clips and other types of content vectors illustrations you name it.  They've got all kinds of content and and two hundred seventy five thousand new images every single week.  So it's always being refreshed for new stuff.  But what I love about Shutterstock most I think is the search engine.  So sometimes you want to go in there and you want to something very particular.  You want to look for somebody who's using a computer but who looks sad and they're wearing orange.  You know you can go really specific on that kind of stuff and find images on Shutterstock no matter what it is you're looking for.  And you don't want to just grab a picture from the Internet.  Obviously somebody took that picture.  The photographer owns the copyright on that and you're just asking for trouble.  And you're also asking to be to have your reputation kind of tarnished by the theft of images.  You don't want to do that and there's no need to do it.  A standard subscription on Shutterstock gives you twenty five images a day.  So when we do blogging on Twitter we can just go there and you know grab images up to twenty five.  You'll never use twenty five a day probably if you're a blogger.  But it's nice to have all those options.  You can download the image in any size and you pay only one steady price.  They have sophisticated tools.  You can search by color palette type gender even emotion.  You can go in there and say I want somebody who's happy that's doing XYZ  and they'll show you hundreds of pictures for exactly what you're looking for.  And they have shareable light boxes.  So if you collaborate on your blog or your projects with someone else  you can share your light boxes and say hey what do you think of these five images.  They have an award-winning iPad app.  I like to use Shutterstock on my iPad because it just looks so beautiful  and it's fun to just flick through that very nicely.  And if you speak another language other than English they have multilingual customer service  which is fantastic.  If you want to try it with no credit card just start an account  begin using Shutterstock to help imagine what your next project could be like  and to save favorite images to a light box to review later.  And once you decide to purchase make sure you use the offer code TWIT914  and new accounts will receive 20% off their already low prices for image subscription packages.  And we thank Shutterstock for their support of this show.  And again I get so much out of Shutterstock because I go in there a lot  and I post some very visual things on Google Plus.  And what I've discovered, I discovered a little blogging trick.  Here's one of my blogging tricks for Google Plus.  Google Plus and the Internet in general and other social networks  has a very radically international audience.  Sometimes we tech people talk about some pretty obscure concepts  and they tend to be lost on people who don't speak English as their first language.  However if you don't get the international community behind your project  you're never going to go to the what's hot list.  You're never going to go to the make it at the top of the viral voting.  But if you use a really compelling image a lot of people will upvote just that  because they love the image.  And that'll get you your post in front of a lot more people  because it'll be essentially upvoted.  So that's a little trick that I like to use on Google Plus  and I've gotten to the what's hot list many times  with a little nudge from a really awesome, awesome photo.  Well, OMG Chad man, what do you think about Microsoft buying Mojang?

Mojang is the company that makes Minecraft which is of course  if you talk to any boy who is from the ages of 7 to 12  he will absolutely know what Minecraft is.  Not just 12, man.

Transcript:  Absolutely. Now something that's not as well covered  but is definitely an issue in the circles that I hang around in  is Minecraft is also a huge platform for making videos on YouTube,  making Internet entertainment.  Somehow Minecraft was there at the exact right time  and has the exact right features to be creative enough  where you can create entertaining content on it almost endlessly.  So there's a lot of online entertainers and YouTubers who have grown up  with this video game of Minecraft and they're very, very sensitive  to any large company coming in and saying,  well now you can't monetize videos.  And Mojang has been very lenient on all of the creators making  as much money as they want.  In contrast, a company like Nintendo has basically taken money from those creators  by saying, well if this has Nintendo intellectual property in it,  we're going to take a version, an amount of the ads that are placed on the YouTube videos  that you create and that incredibly frustrates creators.  But Mojang, on the other hand, has been completely easy about it.  But if a sale to Microsoft happens, that might not be the case.  And people are really shaking in their boots.  There's channels that are solely devoted to Minecraft videos  that are very scared about what this could potentially mean for their careers basically.

Start time: 4714.68
End time: 4838.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh man, poor Notch.  So I've been involved with Minecraft as a player and as a private server admin  for a long time, since the end of 2010.  And beating up on Notch is kind of like the oldest Minecraft activity you can possibly do.  It doesn't matter what the poor guy does.  I mean, he gets stick from the community for having made a tremendous amount of money.  He gets stick from the community for having screwed the game up over and over and over again.  It seemed like for a while in late 2010, early 2011, that every addition to the game,  he was releasing updates very, very frequently, and every addition would break something  and there'd be like image macros immediately after every new Minecraft release.  So I'm like, here's what Notch has screwed up this time.  I mean, the guy has come into just a tremendous amount of money over the past few years.  And he's done a really good job, I think, in my opinion, of being responsible with the tremendous,  I mean, the millions and millions of dollars that have come his way from programming this game.  He gives huge amounts of money to charities.  He's given a tremendous amount of money back to his employees.  I mean, he's a great guy, but dealing with a very rabid, very active fan community for any game,  I think, is very difficult.  And Notch has gotten more than his share of poop thrown at him for his success.  And in this, of course, everybody says, oh my gosh, he's selling out.  Notch is selling out.  Well, I don't think really Notch has been that involved with the day-to-day activities.  I know he hasn't been involved with day-to-day Minecraft activities for a long time.  I don't know how active he is really in steering the course of the game.  I mean, he stands to make a tremendous amount of money from the sale if the sale happens.  But my impression is that he was so soured on just the sheer amount of hate he gets that this is, if anything, kind of a relief to him,  that he can sort of cash out and not have to just get beat up from 15 different directions no matter what he decides to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that, you know, so just the consensus out there is that this is going to be announced tomorrow, on Monday,  and that the reason Microsoft wants to do this is to really bolster its mobile platform and its mobile gaming platform.  I just hope that, and I don't know if you guys will agree with this, but I just hope they won't wreck it.  I hope they keep it cross-platform and keep it on all the platforms.  Yeah, add it to Windows Phone. Of course, it's on Xbox and so on already.  This is an important game, I think, because this is a game that really excites a lot of very young people,  and it provides an alternative to Grand Theft Auto and some of these other things.  So instead of your nine-year-old out there beating up prostitutes and mowing people down with old Cadillacs or whatever on Grand Theft Auto,  they're building stuff, and they're learning how to build stuff, and they're getting the thrill of creating things  and having a social network around something very constructive.  I think that if Microsoft does purchase this, and again, it looks like they will, I just hope that they don't mess it up.  I hope that they invest in it and really get it spread out there, because this is a great thing.

Transcript:  Well, there are lots of areas that the fan community, I think, thinks that Mojang has sort of fallen down in its development responsibility.  I mean, you're right that it is a tremendously egalitarian game.  The server platform runs on Mac, it runs on Windows, it runs on Linux.  The game itself runs on Mac, Windows, Linux, consoles.  I mean, it runs on just about everything.  Raspberry Pi.  Yeah, exactly.  But it doesn't have, even still, years and years after they said they were going to do it,  it doesn't have a functional plugin and modding system.  You've got to do weird stuff to add mods to it.  There's a lot of things that would enhance the community's involvement with it that it doesn't yet have.  And the promise of a big company like Microsoft coming in and owning the IP,  the hope, I mean, is that they would come in and rather than closing it off and saying that Minecraft is an Xbox One exclusive from now on,  the hope is that they would come in and sort of bolster the development resources, add the plugin system,  help do the things that the game needs that hasn't been done in the game for so long.  I mean, that would be the optimistic thing.  Whether that actually is going to happen or not, I don't know.  I sincerely hope that they don't come in and change the platforms the game's available on.  That would kill one of the most valuable aspects of the game.  Because I mean, as it is, you go in and you pay your money and it doesn't matter what you're running,  everybody can come in and play the same game in the same shared world and build stuff and dig holes and mine and everything.  It's great. It would be a shame if it gets closed.

Transcript:  There's one last little kind of funny bit of information that came up on the subreddit for Minecraft.  Two years ago, Notch tweeted his price that he would sell out for.  His price two years ago was $2 billion.  My price is $2 billion. Give me $2 billion and I'll endorse your crap, is what he said on Twitter.  It wasn't Omen two years ago.

Transcript:  So yeah, that's apparently what Microsoft must be paying.  And they've got it. They've got many, many billions to spend on this stuff.  And it sounds to me like a good move for Microsoft.  And if they keep it and support it, like you say, Lee, in the way that you say that, that would be a great thing for everybody.  And I hope they do that.  We'll see. We're going to find out what's what the deal is tomorrow and see if he got us two billion.  Well, the U.S. government threatened to find Yahoo $250,000 a day way back in 2008.  They didn't hand over user data essentially to the NSA.  We were just learning about this because, you know, this stuff was sort of ripped out of the hands of the government.  And now we're getting all these formally redacted, heavily redacted documents that are being unredacted.  And we're learning all kinds of nasty stuff, roughly 1500 pages worth, a secret and ultimately unsuccessful legal battle by Yahoo to resist the government's demand.  So essentially what happened is the government came to Yahoo and said, yeah, we want all this data.  Just hand over all this data.  And we know that there's some American citizens that are going to be affected.  But you know what? Where are the government? We were the FISA court.  We have to hand it over and you can't tell anyone you're you're you're doing it.  And Yahoo said, that sounds unconstitutional.  I think that doesn't sound right.  And they said, well, unconstitutional or not, you've got to pay us $250,000 a day for every day that you don't comply.  And also, they implied that we will make your life miserable in other ways if you don't comply.  So that's why Yahoo ultimately complied and Microsoft complied and eventually everybody complied.  And then we led to the whole PRISM thing and all the NSA revelations that have been surfaced by Edward Snowden and Yanako.  This is this is another case where we're kind of looking at the ugly details.  This was during the Bush administration. I think both Bush and Obama administrations are at fault in all this.  What do you think about this? I mean, I know you're not a constitutional scholar and so on.  But does this sound like something that the government ought to be able to do?  Just go to Yahoo and say hand over all the data.

Transcript:  You know, I have to circle back to what I was saying earlier about the Apple Watch.  There's so much that I don't know about this situation.  But that doesn't get that doesn't get in the way of my revulsion that the government can do stuff like this.  I mean, I have to say that I have a lot of respect for Google for having to really be absolutely be thrown against a wall with a forearm against their neck before before handing over data like that.  I really have to say that as an individual, what I'm most bothered by is the lack of oversight.  I think that we have to as adults, we have to get we we for generations,  understand, but which are actually quite very much in our interests and not only us, but the rest of the country.  But the rule has always been that if the government is not telling me personally about this, there is an outside if one if I don't know personally about what the FBI is doing,  the FBI has to talk to another agency and they have to be transparent to another agency who will be secret.  But at least they have to they're not completely in control and answerable to nobody.  What has concerned me the most is the fact that not only do you have to hand over this data, but you also can't tell anybody that you're handing over this data.  You also have no idea who does the NSA have to tell about what they're doing.  Do they get it? Do they have to explain to any other agency that as severe as this action is, it is actually getting results.  Here's the report that we are required to file on an annual basis about the results of what we are doing.  The difficulty is that whether you believe that there is malice involved or not, the primary responsibility of any government agency is to get funding for next year and not be eliminated.  And that's one of the most concerning thing of all, whether it is something as big as this program at the NSA or something as simple as the need to keep making sure that telegraph wires can support Morse code at a certain baud rate.  Even after a certain need has surpassed, there is a division at this agency whose job it is to make sure that they get funding for next year and they will do whatever they have to do to say that no, no, we are absolutely essential.  There's almost no agency who has ever said, actually, what we're doing is completely redundant.  We don't need to exist. Here is our here is our eleven billion dollar budget back to you.  And we three hundred people are going to find something else to do with our time because we are a colossal and government supported waste of time.  That's what my concern is that there is never going to be a situation in which the NSA says that we don't need this information anymore.  There are better ways for us to achieve our goal of keeping United States citizens safe that do not involve all this sort of stuff.  So if they get the budget to keep harvesting data, harvesting data, harvesting data, there's going to be a way for them to try to keep that budget of hard harvesting data, whether it's not necessary or not.  And the last and the thing that happens that becomes most destructive is when ten years go by and no one even stops to consider anymore if it's a good idea to keep harvesting this data.  It's because the reason the reason why someone is hired to go to this little pump house station in the water table and make sure that this little valve is turned to the left ten degrees.  There was a good reason for them to do that 50 years ago.  Now that pump house station doesn't exist anymore, but this person is still required to go to that station and look for a valve that isn't there anymore or else there's going to be a problem.  That's the difficulty of all this sort of stuff.  So, yes, I'm it's amazing.  I'm immensely disappointed and saddened that this is the situation that we are in in 2014, where I think a lot of us find ourselves wondering here is something that we could say that's a joke or we're just interested in this piece of information.  We want to search for on the Internet.  But if we were to do that, would we attract the attention of an agency and five, ten years from now we get turned down for clearance or we get turned down for this or that.  And we have no idea that the fact is that we saw a news report on a wacky video that terrorists are putting up to try to recruit.  And so we searched YouTube for that video.  But that put our name on a certain list that got connected to another list that was related to another piece of information based on someone's theory that somebody who drinks a lot of diet Pepsi has been to these three cities in the past four months.  There's probably a connection between that and other activity.  That's the sort of environment that they're creating.  And that's what makes me very, very sad.

Transcript:  You're speaking, of course, of big data.  That's what that's how big data works.  Essentially.  Yeah, I somebody in the chat room said that the NSA is an American terrorist group.  I don't believe that at all.  No, I think it's vastly overkill.  I think that I think they're really good intentions.  And I like to I like to compare the NSA to local police departments.  Imagine how much better the police department could could could prevent crime and crack down on crime and catch suspects if they could just walk in anybody's house and search without a warrant.  If they could if they didn't have to read Miranda rights to people, if they could if they could sort of push the envelope of torture, if they didn't have to testify in court.  You know, all these safeguards exist not because we expect police people policemen to be to be bad and so on.  We have a social balance between our desire to to have to to solve crimes and to to put away the bad guys and also our freedoms.  There's a balance between those things.  I think we all understand naturally and which exists in the Constitution very strongly and clearly.  And yet here's a case where there doesn't seem to be a counterbalancing force.  It's like, oh, we can harvest all this information.  So let's do it.  And who's there saying, wait a minute, there's a there's another side to this.

Transcript:  That's an excellent and important point.  When I talk, I've talked to lots of members of law enforcement about this topic going past 10 years, and they make a point that I absolutely respect that they have a mandate to preserve the public safety.  And they and this has been a consistent thing from different agencies, different levels of law enforcement.  They said that we really think that we are we took this job for a very, very important reason.  We are here to protect the public safety and we are limited by the laws that the public decides to put upon us.  And once there is a law telling us we can't do anything, we are not we don't we are not interested in circumventing that law because we are good people.  And this is the job we are going to do.  But if you don't tell us that we're not that we have to get a warrant to attach a GPS tracker to somebody's car and we feel as though this is a very, very bad person and we can stop them from doing these things by putting a GPS tracker on the car.  We're not going to ask if that's a good if that's something that we're entitled to do or not.  We're going to ask is it legal or not?  And if it's they feel as though this again this has been consistent.  We feel as though if we are allowed to do this by the law and we do not do this and this is a way that we can keep people safe.  We are doing something wrong by not doing that because again they look to the law to tell them what they can and what they cannot do.  So if there's a defect in in regulation and restriction, that's a defect that needs to be corrected because that's what prevents good members of law enforcement from doing things that.  I'm sorry I need to backtrack on my use of multiple negatives.  They want they they they want to do good things.  They don't want to do anything that people don't approve of and their cue as to what people do and do or do not approve of their behavior is what they're legally allowed to do.  So if we don't tell law enforcement, no, we don't approve of you doing this, then they're going to keep on doing things that they think is in our best interest.  Yeah, absolutely.  That makes sense.

I don't know that we can put any any blocks in place or legal hurdles because it seems like we have to come up with defining every situation.  No, you cannot do this specific thing to us to, you know, to look at our backgrounds and so on and so forth.  And the Internet is always changing.  So to have all these definitions when the Internet is changing all the time, it's very challenging and it's very scary.  I don't know what kind of world my kids are going to be seeing in five to 10 years.

Transcript:  Well, in just a sec, we're going to come back and talk about the death of Macworld, a print publication about technology.  But first, I want to tell you about our sponsor, Squarespace.  Squarespace is a you know, I can't remember if I started using Squarespace because I heard Leo do an ad on this show.  I think it may have been the case a few years ago, but I've been using Squarespace for a long time.  A whole family uses. In fact, Chad, if you can throw up kevnadia.com, this is my son's website.  He's getting married next month in about a little bit less than a month.  And, you know, they have a wedding website. It's so easy to do.  He put this together. I think he told me it took him about an hour and a half to put together the entire site.  He manages a little bit here and there, adding more pictures and just changing little things here and there.  There are multiple sites and multiple pages, excuse me, on this site, which is super easy to do with Squarespace, by the way,  and including the ability for them to do their wedding registry, which he put together himself very quickly.  Look how cute she was when she was a little girl. That's his that's his wife to be Nadia.  And, you know, Squarespace is the place to do something like this because you can take money, you can sell things, you can do all this kind of stuff,  which, of course, you do with a wedding registry.  The way it works is you start with one of 25 beautiful templates.  This is world class design that they have.  And once you've selected your design, the one you like best, you can modify it, add pages, take things out, tweak it, change the size of the font,  change the color of the font, change how everything looks.  You can modify it to your heart's content.  And, of course, if you're a software developer, you can really, really modify it.  But if you're not, you can go in there very easily with easy to use tools.  And any time you want to swap out one template for another, you can just easily do that.  And all your content stays in one place.  Super, super easy to use.  I like to use Squarespace just for fun.  It's like a video game to me to a certain extent.  Going there and see what kind of a website you can create.  Sometimes I see some beautiful websites out there and I think, you know, I want to see what that would look like as a blog or some other kind of website.  Really fun to do.  And if you need support, though, it's available 24-7 via chat or email.  Their tech support is fantastic.  Truth is, I've only used it once and they gave me a really good answer right away.  So that was really refreshing.  They didn't throw me into some knowledge base somewhere.  It's also inexpensive.  Squarespace starts at just $8 a month.  And that includes a free domain name if you sign up for a year.  And of course, they're famously mobile ready.  So if you use a web, if you use one of these giant phones we're talking about, even if you have a small phone, a tiny phone, like a current iPhone, you can manage your website from that phone using the Squarespace metric app, which is great.  Whether it's a blogger or a non-blog website.  And of course, your audience, when they go to your website, if they're using a phone, it's going to look perfect when they look at it on a phone because Squarespace automatically recreates the page on the fly from old devices, whether it's tablet phone, whatever.  Really great stuff.  So start a free two-week trial with no credit card required and start building your website.  When you decide to sign up for Squarespace, make sure you use the offer code TWIT.  And then I'll get you 10% off the already low price.  And that'll show your support for this week in tech.  And we thank Squarespace for their support of TWIT.  And remember that a better web awaits and it starts with your new Squarespace website.  Well, gentlemen, Macworld is no longer at least the print edition.  Is this the end of an era?  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, definitely.  Because there has been one constant through line through the Mac community that has remained consistent over the past, God, 30 years.  And that has been Macworld magazine because we forget that there used to be the Macworld started off with actually getting pictures of getting the first Max on the cover.  The day that the day that the new Max were really introduced with Mr. Jobs on the cover as well during and during his nice suit and tie phase, there were other magazines that came along, most notably Mac user and Mac user became a force as well.  I was I wrote two columns a month for them for many years.  And then those two magazines merged so that basically they became the caretakers of two different sets of legacies.  And as other magazines came and went as other magazines that had been around and thriving when Macworld was was still brand new, they fell by the wayside.  And Macworld was the only magazine that was still in print that had managed to maintain its mandate and its identity.  And a staff of people that have been working together for so many years that they really were like a really good infield of a championship baseball team.  So it's sad to see that the magazine, the logo and the site are going to continue.  It's very, very sad that so many of the staff are going because, again, you can put you can put that logo on pretty much anything.  But these this people and these people in the way they work together under the company leadership of of Jason Snow, that was just a unique thing.  It was like the Blues Brothers Band.  You know, they had a power, they had a sound that could turn go pee into gasoline.  And now these people are split up.  Hopefully, a lot of them have already found new gigs.  They're certainly going to be doing as good work as they've ever done for these new organizations.  And I'm not worried about these people individually because, again, they're incredibly talented and there's already people who are not striving for their for their services are foolish.  Chris Breen did a very nice article that basically went through here's all the people that have lost their jobs or decided to leave over the past three or four months and just tell it talking, talking very, very nicely and positively and accurately about all the work they've done.  But it's too bad that there is there isn't it's one of the what I guess what the bottom line after my stammering here is that there are very free publications that have authority based on their totality, where there are a lot of max sites where they're nice sites.  But it really is all about what one or two people have to say and the investigative reporting of this person or the reviews of that person or what this person has to say about the work that they've done.  There are a lot of max sites where there are very few places left where you can really say that I the name of this publication means that if Macworld has reviewed the new Mac Pro, I know they've done it with a certain amount of seriousness and integrity and thought for creating value for users.  They're not going to let slip somebody who had a very, really, really active Twitter feed and they asked him to, hey, what if we send you a Mac Pro for a month or two and you're not going to be able to get a lot of feedback from the people that are going to be watching this?  So I think that's a very good point.  And then it winds up being 2000 words, a thousand words about how much Windows sucks, Windows sucks and how much, oh boy, I can get my Android phone to work with it.  But then again, I don't have to be a huge fan of the new Mac Pro.  But I think that's the key point.  And that's the problem that we're talking about here.  I think that there's a lot of people that are going to be like, hey, what if we send you a Mac Pro for a month and then write something about it?  And then it winds up being, you know, 2000 words, a thousand words about how much Windows sucks and how much, oh boy, I can get my Android phone to work with it.  It's sorry to say, I'm just very sorry to see a resource like that go away.

Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely. And of course, the heyday of print technology, computer magazines was in the 90s.  And in the 90s, I edited one of them called Windows Magazine.  And that was a crazy time because the internet hadn't really come up to replace the information.  And yet PCs and technology were very new to a lot of people.  So people turned to physical print paper magazines in huge numbers.  We used to publish bigger than 400 page issues.  We had an editorial staff, just the editorial staff, not sales or any of the rest, of more than 60 people.  And PCMag, of course, was the larger publication in that space.  They had a staff of 122 people in the late 90s.  And they had, you know, they did 400, 500, 600 page issues and they were twice monthly.  So it's hard to remember that.

I think that IDG deserves a lot of credit for keeping it around for as long as it did.  They recently closed the paper or the print version of Computer World.  I think that was within the last year.  I write for the digital edition.  But of course, the Internet is so compelling.  You can search, you can promote it on social networks, you can have live links, you can do all these things that you can't do in print.  So it makes a lot of sense that print goes away.  And I hope that whatever they do with the brand honors the legacy of Macworld.  And, you know, I think we can all agree that it was it is the end of an era.  Any thoughts on this, Kevin Toffle?

That's you know, I bought my Commodore 64 through there for crying out loud way back.  I mean, yeah, it's just sad to see.  I guess you could say it's one of those things that I guess you expect to see happen over time.  The Internet has disrupted everything, quite honestly.  And now with the rise of tablets, people buying digital editions of their magazines, that's putting pressure on all these print publications as such.
