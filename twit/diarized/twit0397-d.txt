Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  still, I was actually telling  you after I mean when I get my  nails done, I have absolutely  that's when I use my phone the  most. Actually, because you're  like sitting there. You have  nothing else to do and it  doesn't mess up my manicure.  The magazine pages mess up my  manicure. So so really it

Start time: 360.46
End time: 362.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  wasn't so much there was sex.  This is it was just wrong. Yeah.

Start time: 363.94
End time: 364.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was actually wrong. So I

Start time: 367.64
End time: 374.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  got to figure that something  like half the market for Samsung  phones is our women. Yeah.

Start time: 375.05
End time: 439.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, considering half the  market for any phone, it  should be women. You know, the  event was very it was just  Samsung wanted to put on a big  show, and I think actually the  most telling thing about it was  at one point they said, you  know, we're gonna launch this  phone on, you know, 2 billion  carriers and something like 155  countries. And that's when I  began to like thinking about it.  It's like, Oh, that's why this  was so terrible because when you  have that many people, you can  only end up at the lowest  common denominator, right? And  the very sad truth is that the  lowest common denominator is  just stereotypes of people.  It's everyone is like this,  right? And that's to me, it's  you have to be smarter than  that. You have to think to  yourself. Well, we're talking  to this huge audience, but the  people who are covering it, the  people who are going to be  there and talk about it  afterwards are not necessarily  the huge audience. They're  people sitting in New York and  tech fans around the world who  are a little bit more  sophisticated than 155  countries on 300 carriers. And  I think that's really  I'm not even sure. I see what

Start time: 441.50
End time: 459.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you're saying. But that was but  they had to know who they were  presenting to because like you  said, the audience for the  actual show that they put on,  I'd be very surprised if that  was many more people than tech  media and total tech and  half a million women. No, half  a million people watched on

Start time: 460.54
End time: 463.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  watched live on on YouTube.  And in the audience, it was

Start time: 464.22
End time: 483.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  unfortunately way more than  just tech media or enthusiasts.  I mean, it just it was tons of  people. I mean, my biggest  problem as I told me, I was  like it was more the lack of  wireless than the making fun of  women or whatever else was  going on in the presentation.  But I mean, I ran into people  there that I was like, Why are  you here? And like, Oh, we just  got a ticket. Yeah. How did you

Start time: 484.36
End time: 487.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  get a ticket? How do people get  tickets? I had press was like,

Start time: 488.26
End time: 499.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know, all press usually get  into Samsung events. We run  through the whole process. But  I ran into a lot of like tech  PR people that were just like,  I just wanted to come see this.  Well, they rented Radio City.

Start time: 500.10
End time: 513.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They rented Radio City Music  Hall, which must have cost them  a million dollars, right?  Something some huge number.  It's more than that seats 3500  people. I don't know if there's  3500 tech journalists who could  go see this, right? I mean,  they've got to fill it with

Start time: 514.38
End time: 527.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  somebody also flew in all. I'm  pretty sure all the tech media  from around the world. I mean, I  was sitting next to a Russian  journalist on my left and a  bunch of I don't know where they  were from on my right. They were  just I just knew they were  equally as mad about not having  wireless. And there's a guy

Start time: 528.00
End time: 588.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  behind me. He was like, I flew  in from Germany for this. I mean,  Samsung opened it up. I mean,  they were holding contests to  give fans tickets. That's great.  So all of that is great. And I  think what I think ultimately  what happens is when a giant  corporation decides to deliver  marketing messages to people,  they forget that people are  actually people and not a  collection of demographic  information. And so I think  that's a huge problem. I mean,  you know, it's not just  information like women, you  know, like if you just reduce  women to like here are the  activities women do with the  phone here are concerns we've  heard about using a touch  screen phone from women and  surveys you. Yeah, go ahead.  Well, I just you immediately  lose the fact that people are  actually people and you start  thinking of them as how can we  effectively talk to these like  disconnected disembodied  concerns? And then you generate  a lot of people. There's a  there's like the only silver  lining is like at least at least  it wasn't as stupid as some of

Start time: 589.04
End time: 608.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the other stuff they've done,  right? What have they done that  was stupider than that? I mean,  the sad thing to me is that  they were to be to be totally  clear. I don't think any of  this, as I said on CNBC, is it  going to affect sales of the  phone? It doesn't matter. Right?  Yeah, it's going to be  absolutely fine, right? Going  to sell like gangbusters going

Start time: 608.90
End time: 611.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  to be a disservice to the phone  by not just focusing on it.

Start time: 611.98
End time: 628.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have. Yeah. I mean, it was  you could barely tell that they  were introducing a new phone and  a new phone that is a really  great successor to a really  popular phone. And then the  saddest thing of all is that I  think they were actually trying  to sell the phone to women. And  that's why they had so many  examples of context in which  women or at least one  dimensional cartoon character  ladies might want to use it.

Start time: 630.10
End time: 660.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. So I think that's the  thing. So they got this is what  I'm saying. This is where they  improved. They actually had the  product involved much more so  like, you know, in 2000, they  had a whole presentation in the  point that presentation was going  to get this order wrong. They  were moving from digital  humanism to human digitalism.  Not even kidding like that.  That was true.  They had the kid from Billy  Elliott dancing around and  saying insane crap. And I don't  know why that happened. Look, I  still was amazing. It was  amazing. And I had a lot of fun.  I can't think of another tech

Start time: 661.92
End time: 667.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  press conference where they had  tap dancing. I think that's no.  Yeah, I think that's a good  point. I think that's a good

Start time: 668.08
End time: 672.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  point. No, but yeah, I can and  they're all Samsung.

Start time: 672.82
End time: 675.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat room said  nobody does weird like Samsung

Start time: 676.37
End time: 708.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  weird.  It was so I mean, like stepping  away from the part where it sort  of did gradually just get more  and more offensive. It was  surreal, like it was beyond  bizarre. I mean, I'm watching  this thinking, well, at some  point, they're going to stop  doing this right and then start  to have like a weird presentation  and then every time I thought  that it just got weirder and  then there would be tap dancing  and there would be like, I mean,  I just I don't I kind of don't  understand, especially  considering the money involved.  Plus, why didn't you get a  bigger star? Like, why do you  get that orange guy from Smash  that no one's ever heard of?  I have no idea who he was.  No, I had a Google.

Start time: 708.70
End time: 711.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was like, oh, Will Chase.  I was like, I have no idea.  You know why? Because Neil

Start time: 711.70
End time: 735.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Patrick Harris could said no.  No, so it's all Broadway.  Let me let me let me ask Joanna  because Joanna and Eli were  there and one of the things I  thought and maybe you too,  Molly, is that those of us  watching at home were watching  on a screen that this is a big,  big theater with 3500 people.  It's a big show.  It might be playing differently  to the people in the in the  the live audience.  Was that the case?  You think Joanna?

Start time: 736.41
End time: 747.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was trying to find wireless  for 50 minutes.  That's all you cared about.  So I have really no clue what  happened. All I know is I kept  picking up my head and I was  like, what the hell is going on  and why is there no wireless?

Start time: 747.90
End time: 749.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stay away from the brown acid,  Joanna.

Start time: 750.70
End time: 764.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me just give you an idea  of how there was no wireless.  I had an AT&T phone, no service  in there. LTE Verizon, not  working.  Apparently 3G Verizon was  working and that's what saved  me, Eli, and the Verge bunch.  And there was a press wireless  but that didn't work.

Start time: 764.70
End time: 766.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Were you trying to do a live  blog, Joanna?

Start time: 766.76
End time: 785.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that why you were?  Yeah, I was trying to.  We were trying a live blog for  ABC News and Yahoo and I was  just sweating it out.  But yes, I did keep picking up  my head and I was like, what is  going on in here?  And I mean, no one in the  audience was really reacting.  People were clapping because  they felt like they had to, I  think.  Well, that was another

Start time: 785.60
End time: 792.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  production error that we at  home noticed, which is they  didn't mic the audience.  So even if the audience was  clapping, it always sounded like  this.  Yeah.

Start time: 793.97
End time: 803.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Plus, shouldn't everyone  learn at this point that don't  clap on stage when you're mic'd  because you will always sound  like the only person clapping in  the room?  Like, it was just so...  Neil Patrick Harris would have  known that.

Start time: 803.60
End time: 807.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I gotta point out.  He would have known that.  He would have known that.  There was a big applause, I

Start time: 807.64
End time: 818.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  think, when they announced 13  megapixel camera.  There was big applause for that.  And then it just kind of went in  waves.  I think people were sort of like  are we supposed to be clapping  now at the end of the scene?  Yeah.

Start time: 818.76
End time: 832.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's one moment of huge  applause when they announced the  phone would have LTE.  And I still don't know why that  happened.  Like, maybe they invited a bunch  of Qualcomm engineers and they  were like happy, they were  drunk.  No, no.  Again, we win.  It was LTE worldwide.

Start time: 832.60
End time: 841.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We've had LTE in the U.S.  But internationally, often not.  And they said LTE in all 155  countries.  That's an applause line, if it's  true.  Yeah, maybe people thought the

Start time: 841.62
End time: 843.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  LTE would work in the audience.

Start time: 843.94
End time: 846.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it was very, very  interesting.

Start time: 846.62
End time: 848.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Joanna's rage about this  is like the best thing ever.

Start time: 849.27
End time: 852.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, really, I'm still so  worried about that.  Did I mention the wireless?

Start time: 853.37
End time: 860.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, which was worse, the  Qualcomm CES keynote or the  Samsung Radio City Music Hall  debacle?  Because the Qualcomm was pretty  bad, too.

Start time: 863.66
End time: 875.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm thinking I got to go Samsung  because there's bizarre and then  there's bizarre and offensive.  Here might be the source of the  I'm thinking kangaroo for sure.  Yeah.  Or whatever they had on there.  Maybe.

Start time: 876.84
End time: 946.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know.  So here's the thing about chip  companies doing keynotes.  They have no idea what they're  selling or how to sell it.  Right?  They're like, our chips are fast  and you can do stuff with them.  And because they're faster, here's  some awesome stuff you can do.  And here's some people you can  relate to.  So the Intel keynotes are always  crazy, too.  They had a Zee's and Sorry one  year.  I remember just like pretending  to be a time traveler.  And I remember having like being  like, this isn't affecting me.  I don't know why.  There's literally this is  watching this happen and  wondering why you spent this  money instead of like pushing  chips forward.  Samson, on the other hand, I  think they actually with the  galaxies where they have a  similar problem is they have a  phone with all of these features  and all of these gimmicky, crazy  features.  Like I don't think people want  them.  I told I told when I was going  on CNN the next morning and talk  with a phone, I told the person  who is like the CNN makeup lady  as like, oh, there's a new  phone.  It watches your eyes when you're  when you're reading a web page  and scrolls for you.  And she's like, I don't want  that.  She was like, that's freaky.  And she started telling her  friends like the new phone  watches you and they don't know  how to sell it yet.  And I think they can kind of  wave off your life.  It's not working.

Start time: 946.40
End time: 951.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Do you do you do you think,  Joanna, that it's a gimmicky  you think it's a gimmicky.  I mean, the idea that I'm I

Start time: 953.42
End time: 977.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  don't you know, I think how  annoying is that going to be  on the gimmicky features, which  is the wave and the scrolling  and that kind of thing.  I think there are some people  that are really useful and  practical features.  They didn't seem to really want  to like focus on those.  But I do think, yeah, this idea  of wanting to tilt and wave your  phone is they're just trying to  come up with ways to say, look  at look at how we've been  innovative in this space.  We actually we've been saying

Start time: 978.62
End time: 1025.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for a while at CNET that Samsung  has a little bit of feature  itis or maybe a lot of feature  itis and that they they really  do think that the way to you  know, our hearts is to just sort  of keep cramming things into the  phone as well as the way that  things are being used into the  phone as opposed to having a  killer feature.  And I almost feel like the  saddest thing about this  presentation was that it that  they could have I think had the  self-esteem in a way to say this  is a great phone.  The Galaxy S3 was a great phone.  It was the first like phone all  on its own to outsell the iPhone  and this phone is just as great  and then some and worldwide LTE  and things like like a few  features like that that are  really important to people like  a really good camera, great  battery life and fast data.  That's all you got to say.  I actually like to be the  phone with a by the way a  release date and a price.  But the problem we didn't get

Start time: 1025.22
End time: 1043.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  either though.  The problem with that is that  it's kind of a commoditized  thing now.  Everything's all the new phones  will be 1080p.  All of them will be really fast  quad core or R8 core.  All of them will have two gigs  of RAM and Samsung's Achilles  heel is is the design looks  exactly like an S3 or a Note 2.  They haven't really updated the  design particularly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, but that phone is going to  matter.  It doesn't matter.  Right.  I mean the HTC hasn't sold any  more phones.  I agree with you.  The HTC One is a beautiful  piece of hardware and has a  tremendous screen actually I  think.  But I think the software the  average person isn't looking  for a flip board on their home  screen and the people who want  to buy gadgety phones they're  going to go they're going to  flock to the huge list of  Samsung gimmicks because  they're there.  There's a list of Samsung  gimmicks and then they're going  to have a phone with a big  screen that has LTE and that's  what people want and Samsung  has a marketing budget to say  this is the phone with a big  screen and LTE that can do all  the stuff the iPhone can't do.  And you know I think it's  working.  You know I think Apple is  running a little bit scared.  They've got they had you know  Phil Schiller gave those  interviews to the Wall Street  Journal and the Reuters I think.  The day before the event they  put up the new marketing site  today or yesterday only an  iPhone can do this stuff.  I think Apple feels the heat  from Samsung a little bit.  So tone deaf yeah a little  sexist yeah.  But effective like apparently  so and I think that's really  interesting.  Here's the thing going back to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Samsung had this same  thing last year with the Galaxy  S3 and I asked a bunch of my  friends who bought the Galaxy S  3 well not a bunch I have two  friends that own it and I said  you know do you know what S like  the pop up video thing is do you  know what I forget the name of  the feature that allowed you to  have a phone that you could use  and the name of the feature that  allowed you to be able to pop  the video and watch it while  you're web scrolling and  watching the web or do you know  about smart stay or do you know  about all these features and  they said no I have no idea what  those are and when I reviewed  the phone last year I said  there's a ton of features but it  took me a long time to figure  out how to use them and they're  not very obvious when you first  get the phone so my feeling is  that these features are great  and maybe they'll market them  this year maybe they'll just  keep going after Apple and these  marketing things but how are  they going to go to use these  features and are they going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Android I think that well I  think they're trying to  differentiate themselves from  the slew of Android phones  they're trying to create their  own ecosystem their own sort of  proprietary app universe on that  phone and I think they're  probably trying to give people a  reason when they go into a  Verizon store or an AT&T store  to go to that phone as opposed  to some other phone and give  actually good talking points to  carrier salespeople when they're  trying to sell that phone so it  is smart to say listen we have  all these features that nobody  no other phone has so the HTC  one might be really pretty but  there's a lot of cool stuff cool  magic to work when you're trying  to sell this phone to a consumer  in a store right and I think you

Start time: 1254.08
End time: 1335.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  know the fact that they can do  that with what is a hundred  photos in four seconds like you  can demo that in a carrier store  right you can be like look you  can you can remove photo bombs  in I will say that was a nice  feature I think I think I went  to and I think some of the  camera stuff actually got  applause yeah and I think that  stuff is really interesting I  think people want to take better  photos of their phones I don't  know if any of it's gonna work  there's there's a sense to this  and this is what I'm always  saying about feature itis I  remember when Microsoft used to  have a lot of features with  windows and they would demo all  of these features endless  features to you know basically  fought out the competition so  you know don't don't wait for  the Mac to get this feature  don't wait for word to get this  feature here's a demo of  something it works like it in  word or windows and they did  this throughout the nineties  and that's there's a sense of  that here it's like look at all  the features like you want to  use a Fitbit with an iPhone  guess what we made an armband  I thought that was that real is  that going to happen yeah is  anyone going to buy Samsung's  Bluetooth scale maybe I don't  think so no I really don't I  think they're gonna I mean I  don't I think people are  invested in the Nike system I  think there's a lot of people  invested in the Fitbit system I  think those companies actually  know what they're doing and  they're building good products  I think Samsung and they work  with the Samsung phone so you  don't need to get a Samsung

Transcript:  you said two words Nellie earlier  that I think are actually at the  root of all this marketing budget  interesting article on a Simcoe  Horace Eddie who is talking to an  economic analyst from a French or  European magazine and they came  up with this graph which shows  that Samsung's marketing spend is  proportionate to its income in  other words the more they make on  the phone the more they spend on  marketing Apple's the opposite the  yellow line is Apple it's been  going down as a percent of sales  so Apple's marketing budget is  fairly constant Samsung's  exploding they've got a ton of  money to spend and sometimes when  you have a lot of money to spend  you just spend it on stuff that  may not be useful.

Transcript:  launch Windows 7 yeah huge amount  of money they're very proud of  it it's more than Apple's ever  spent so I've heard and that's  just a massive amount of money  and I think that what they want  to do is they want to cement  themselves as the Android phone  I think you know there's been a  lot of stories about Galaxy  taking over as a brand name from  Droid I think that's tremendously  important and I think they want  to be the underpinning they're  basically getting Android for  free right Google spends all this  money developing it they take it  and they do whatever they want  with it and I think they want to  be the Android phone I think all  these competitors like HTC or LG  or whoever Sony they're building  all these other you're seeing  Android fragmentation happen you  know I think it already did  happen and now I think what  you're seeing is consolidation  of the market onto Samsung's  version of Android and I think  you know that they've got what  Android 4.2.2 on the phone so  they're not the latest behind  right right at this second but  I suspect the phones going to  come out in April May that seems  to be that's what I've been  hearing and right after that  Google's going to have I know  and have the next version of  Android so they're going to be  behind again it doesn't matter  right and it just doesn't matter  it's a two horse race I don't

I think that the reason that in  fact to answer that earlier  question about HTC versus  Blackberry the reason that  Blackberry may end up triumphing  is that people will buy the Q10  for that physical keyboard.

But it doesn't mean that people  don't want those keyboards to  be broken.  I mean I don't mean that people  don't want those keyboards and  I do still see people like  reluctantly using the Droid for  because they want the keyboard.  Right.  And I think that is enough of a  selling point if BlackBerry  gets the damn Q10 out the door  and HTC continues to just like  not market.

Transcript:  I'm going to take it.  I don't know what she meant.  Our show today brought to you  by our good friends at Citrix  who do that fabulous GoTo  meeting.  Actually there are people  waiting with bated breath  because we're going to announce  the winner of our iPad giveaway  in a moment but first let me  tell you a little bit about GoTo  meeting.  It lets you work face to face  no matter where you are.  I mean successful teamwork is  the key to successful business  and when you meet face to face  you are working more  effectively.  You're getting the job done.  Not always easy nowadays.  Business is spread out all over  the globe.  Clients all over the place on  the go.  So GoTo meeting makes it  possible to work with them  wherever they are even on an  iPad or an iPhone.  It is the powerfully simple way  to meet and collaborate online  and with HD faces you're actually  seeing each other.  From wherever you are,  wherever and whenever you need  to connect.  It's just a remarkable tool for  meetings.  You can now present on the iPad  which I think is fantastic.  It uses the camera for HD faces.  It uses a microphone and the  speakers so you don't have to  need a phone line or anything.  You can go out in the garden and  enjoy a lovely GoTo meeting.  I have to say it's a great way  to share screens, work on  documents in real time, see the  people you're meeting with.  It's actually better than  meeting in person.  I love it and I love it so much  because it's so much fun to  do.  I love it and I love it so much.  We arranged to give you an iPad  to somebody.  We asked you to tweet where this  winter you would like to host a  meeting, hint, hint, using GoTo  meeting, where you would and why  you would and maybe who you  would like to meet with.  We asked you to use the hashtag  twitipad and GoToMeeting.  And we have, wait a minute, we  don't have a winner.  We've got another week.  I thought we were going to have  a winner.  Oh, that's good news.  So here's the deal.  Just tweet where you would like  to use GoToMeeting and with  whom and why.  Make sure you use hashtag  twitipad, there's two hashtags,  and hashtag GoToMeeting.  We'll do a random drawing of all  the entries next week.  So you've got to, it's going to  end this Thursday, March 21st at  11.59 Pacific, 11.59 p.m.  Pacific, and then we'll announce  the winner next week in the show.  I thought we were going to do it  this week.  So that's good.  You've got another week to do it.  Thursday, March 21st, 11.59 p.m.  Pacific is the deadline.  Contest open to U.S. residents  for contest rules and regulations.  Visit our inside.twit.tv blog  and click the link that says  contest rules.  And don't forget to try GoToMeeting.  Visit gotomeeting.com, click the  try it free button.  You've got 30 days free when you  use the offer code TWITGOTOMEETING.  And good luck winning that iPad.  I got it right here, but I'm not  going to show you because you  didn't win it yet.  You've got to win it.  But by the way, speaking as long  as we're still on the phone thing,  seeing rumors, Neelai, I don't know  if you had this on the verge of  this Nexus 5.  We know that Google I.O. is coming  up in a couple of months.  Do you think it's conceivable that  they'll have a next generation  Nexus phone?

Start time: 2234.40
End time: 2249.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think they have to.  I think that the Nexus 4 has been  a bit of a failure, actually.  There's a lot of people on our team  who have them.  The battery life is bad.  You can't take out the battery.  What?  You can't take out the battery.  Normal people.  The battery life is bad.  The battery life is not bad.  The thing to remember, this is

Start time: 2249.30
End time: 2267.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  different.  This is the difference of this.  Google wanted to make a cheap  phone.  This is a $300 phone.  They weren't, admittedly it's the  Google Experience phone, but I  don't think they were saying this  is the phone you want if you have  a Google, this is the inexpensive  Google phone so developers and  people internationally can afford  it.  That's a very different thing.  Are you using it as your primary?

Start time: 2268.30
End time: 2269.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I carry both, but I

Start time: 2269.95

Start time: 2280.20
End time: 2300.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what though?  I've had so many problems with  LTE and 3G.  If the camera is not good, and  that's really important.  Camera sucks.  This one's better than the last  one.  This is a little bit of a tangent,  but I really don't know why  manufacturers aren't going after  the iPhone more on camera.  Like it's one thing to come out  and say you have 13 megapixels,  big deal.  I agree.  Talk to me about the sensor.  Like I couldn't believe.  But they're using the same  sensor.

Start time: 2301.20
End time: 2306.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're using Sony sensors.  This is the same sensor.  It's something, there's magic  saws in it.  I said what Apple's doing.

Start time: 2306.83
End time: 2321.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is magic saws because  there is not a phone on the  market that can touch the iPhone  5 in terms of the camera, and  that is the reason that I'm  still carrying that thing, even  though I think it's annoying and  kind of lame feeling and the  screen is tiny.  I couldn't be more over the  iPhone except for the camera.  For the camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just switched from Android to  the iPhone.  I had the Nexus, the Galaxy  Nexus, which was a great phone  for a while, but like you're  saying, the camera was terrible.  The battery life was terrible.  The battery life was never very  good, and I've been really happy  with the iPhone for the last  month.  So I think you're seeing here

Start time: 2342.16
End time: 2359.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  is there isn't a huge difference  between any of these phones  anymore.  Yeah.  But I do think that it does seem  like Apple's doing something  with the camera that makes it  better.  In fact, I had hopes that HTC's  one with its four megapixel  camera, its two microns pixels  might be a better camera.  It's an ultra pixel.

Start time: 2370.02
End time: 2380.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, it was not.  I don't think it's terrible.  Disappointing.  It's not measured against their  claims.  The reality doesn't match the  hype.  I think-  Is it possible that you had a

Start time: 2385.07
End time: 2413.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, maybe, but if HTC is  handing these things out to  reviewers and saying go review  this, then there's not much we  can say.  I mean, who knows what Verizon  is going to do to this phone  when they release it, or AT&T.  You know, I had a Galaxy  Unlocked Galaxy Nexus and was  fine, and then I had a Verizon  LTE Galaxy Nexus and it was a  total piece.  So yeah, we had the  manufacturer's version.  Maybe AT&T will make the camera  better, but I really would not  hold my breath for that.

Transcript:  Anyway, Andy Rubin, moving on,  in a bit of a shock actually,  announced this week Wednesday,  he's going on to places unknown  and the former head of Chrome  and Chromo, it's actually not  former, he still is head of  Chrome and Chromo as Sundar  Pichai is taking over at  Android.  What does this mean?

Start time: 2458.80
End time: 2513.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, I think we've been  doing a lot of research into  what's happening over there and  talking to a lot of people.  And my gut says that Android is  too big and too important for it  to be a silo at Google anymore,  which I think it has been.  And I think Google realizes that  it has a real chance to go after  Windows and to go after  Microsoft.  You were just saying you're not  a big fan of Windows 8.  The head of Samsung said Windows  8 isn't hitting with consumers.  I've heard that from a lot of  companies.  So I think Google realizes that  everyone's poking around at  Chromo OS.  We have what is effectively a  dominant platform on the web.  People who use our services  don't use other services.  And we can make a real play to  be like the dominant platform  in computing in total if we  integrate our products.  And I don't think Rubin was  fond of that idea.  I think Android was his baby and  he was moving forward with it.

Start time: 2513.70
End time: 2521.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you think we're going to see  a merger of Chrome OS and  Google has two OS's, Android and  Chrome OS.  You're going to see some sort of  unification?

Start time: 2523.33
End time: 2564.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think we're going to flip  the switch tomorrow, but I think  we'll see.  You know, I think if you, if I  look at Android and the way it  handles the web, I have a Nexus  10, a Nexus 7, a Nexus 4.  And I actually think browsing  the web and Chrome on those  devices is less good than using  the web on the iPhone in Mobile  Safari or on the iPad with  Mobile Safari.  And I think that's kind of a  huge shame.  And I think you can, it's weird  that Android has these other  alternative apps and they don't  really depend on web technology  as much as they could and that  Android isn't being used to push  the web stuff forward the way  that Google should be using it.  So I think maybe not a direct  integration, but I think we'll  see a lot more sharing, a lot  more collaboration between those  teams.

Transcript:  You know, I was just reviewing  the Pixel and I've been playing  around with it and I think, you  know, I just so much of the time,  like, why can't I run, like, why  is there not some sort of melding  here on the app front, right?  Like, it's confusing.  And I think, actually, again,  talking about that Mathias  Duarte interview I did last year,  he said that he wanted Android,  again, he's the head designer of  Android, he said that he wanted  Android to run on every kind of  computer.  And, you know, when I asked him  and said, well, that sounds a  lot like Chrome because you've  got Chrome on laptops now and at  the time, you know, they had the  little desktop too.  Did I still have that anymore?  The desktop box?  I forget what it's called.  The Chrome box.  Yeah, the Chrome box.

Start time: 2608.52

Start time: 2612.50

Transcript:  have it, yeah.  That was just themselves.

Start time: 2614.56
End time: 2663.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looks exactly like.  And that was definitely the  Eric Schmidt.  The Eric Schmidt vision also was  Android on everything, Android  in refrigerators, Android as, you  know, a platform, an office  operating system and an integrated  system.  So it's, but it seems weird to me  that Rubin wouldn't be the guy to  take that vision and run with it.  If anything, it feels like maybe  they've decided to double down  more on Chrome OS or they've  decided to kind of move in that  direction that, you know, the  Google, I mean, they're doing  some kind of integration.  They do seem to be realizing  that all these separate things  like killing Google reader, but  folding feeds into Google Plus,  driving users, like, you know,  corralling people into different  directions.  So I think that maybe that is sort  of a unification effort.  But the fact that Rubin is leaving  makes me wonder if the unification  is centered a little more on

Start time: 2664.91
End time: 2671.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Chrome.  Boy, if you were going to bet  between Chrome OS and Android, if  somebody said, well, which is the  stronger, the two you'd say it was  Android.

Start time: 2676.52
End time: 2691.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Time out.  Why would you do that?  No, no, no.  I would say that Android has the  better brand recognition and the  better market penetration.  But I would also say that if I  were at Google, I'd want to pour  my money into Chrome because  Chrome has the better potential  to make money for them.  Like Android doesn't make very  much money.

Start time: 2691.58
End time: 2704.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, there's that.  But Chrome is their product, man.  You go and you download Chrome  from Google and it's Google's and  it works as Google.  Android is great, but we've just  been talking.  Android is Samsung's product.

Start time: 2704.56

Start time: 2707.80
End time: 2721.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a feeling that if they're  centralizing on anything, it's on  the product that they control,  they own, that they're gathering  your data from, that they can  make more money off of, and that  Android actually might be getting  pushed aside a little bit, and  that's why Rubin left.

He has, when you ring the door  bell, a robotic arm rings a gong.  He is into robots.  And I think this is Google's next  initiative is robots.  I don't know why they haven't  done more with robots up to now.  So it's a win-win.  Yeah.  That's what you really want as a

This was because they did the  Andy Rubin thing.  And then like three hours later  they announced Reader.  And I thought, oh, this is smart.  They're going to bury the very  the Rubin story with another  story that's going to drive  people nuts.  But who knows?  That normal people care about,  I guess.  Normal people don't care about

Transcript:  Everything you need to create an  amazing website at  Squarespace.com.  In fact, they've added another  feature that makes it even more  fun.  And that's Squarespace.com.  And I'm going to go ahead and  They've added another feature  that makes it even better.  You've seen Squarespace.  We've showed it before you  before.  If you're creating a blog, a  portfolio, it's hosting plus the  best content management software  out there.  So it's everything you need.  And now they've added  e-commerce.  So it makes it so easy to set up  your own store so affordable too  on Squarespace.com.  Fast merchant account setup.  You can accept payments right  away within minutes.  Credit card or debit.  A single interface for order  management.  Tracking orders.  Providing customer email updates.  Printing shipping labels.  Coupons.  They take care of all the taxes  and all the different tax codes  and all that.  They handle that for you.  For physical goods or digital  goods, this is the easiest way to  set up a store.  I feel sorry for these companies  that have been around for a while  with these online stores.  This is amazing.  Look at the cost.  So there's three pricing here.  Well, first of all, you can go  there and try it for free for two  weeks.  You don't need a credit card.  You don't need our offer code.  Just go to Squarespace.com.  Set up your site.  They've got importers for  WordPress, TypePad, Blogger, so  they can get all the data in.  And that's everything, including  comments, images.  All the links are preserved.  So you'll really get a sense of  what your current site might look  like on Squarespace.com.  Then, after a couple of weeks of  trying it, playing with it, you  know, kicking the tires, if you  decide to buy, that's when you  want to look at these pricing.  And I got to say, it's  fantastic.  Oh, I touched the screen.  My mistake.  Wow.  That surprised me.  So standard price is when you  buy an annual plan, $8 a month.  The unlimited plan, which is  right now the most popular, gives  you unlimited pages, galleries,  unlimited blogs, unlimited  bandwidth.  You will never get a bandwidth  bill if all of a sudden, you  know, you get slashed out or we  point a lot of people to you.  No problem.  First of all, you can't bring a  Squarespace site down.  Second of all, you've got  unlimited bandwidth plus  unlimited storage, a mobile  website.  When you buy an annual plan, you  get the custom domain name free.  They'll hook it up for you.  That's $16 a month purchased  annually, $20 month to month.  But now look at this new e-commerce  account.  Everything you need to do, your  own store, built in, all the  Squarespace templates work with  it.  You get the mobile store as well  as a desktop store, fully  integrated, physical products  unlimited, digital products  unlimited.  Squarespace does not take a cut of  your sales.  They just ask $24 a month when you  buy an annual plan or $30 month  to month.  That is a great deal.  I want you to check it out.  Squarespace.com.  Click try it free.  When you decide to buy, do buy an  annual plan because you'll get  the best savings and you can take  10% off right off the top when  you use our offer code.  Twit 3, 3 for the month of March.  TWIT, the number 3 for the month  of March.  Squarespace.com.  Try it and then set up your  store.  You are going to love it.  Let's talk to Tom Merritt.  He's in the other room right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just want to hear the answer.  There's been a lot of  conversation.  And I think it's true.  I think for normal people,  Twitter and Facebook and other  social channels have taken over  for Reader and RSS.  I don't think...  I think that's fine.  But Dieter Bohn wrote a big  editorial about why RSS is still  important for us last week.

Start time: 3868.70
End time: 3872.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, a lot of people who are  listening to this show are  listening on an RSS feed.

Start time: 3872.74
End time: 3888.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, sure.  But the RSS feed has been  repurposed into iTunes or a  podcatcher or something.  It's still an RSS feed.  But that's like saying SMTP is  important because everyone uses  email.  Well, it is.  Well, right, but it's not a  front-facing technology.  But it's how it's presented.

Start time: 3889.96
End time: 3897.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  RSS has been generally replaced  by a button, whether that button  is follow or add to or the icon  in the iTunes feed.  But it's also a different

Start time: 3897.70
End time: 3922.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  context.  Dave Weiner, who invented RSS or  was one of the people who  invented RSS, actually had an  interesting quote.  He said, you know, maybe it's  appropriate because the inbox  metaphor for content, where I've  got 3,000 unread articles in my  inbox, which is basically what  Google Reader tells you, he  says, I don't use that anymore.  I do the River of News, which is  more like Twitter, Facebook,  where it's flowing by.  I dip in.  I read.  I move on.  So here's Dieter's point, which

Start time: 3922.60
End time: 3964.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I thought was really tremendous.  I never thought about it this  way.  That's great if you're like an  Internet nerd and you spend all  day in the River of News looking  at stuff and tweeting.  And that's real time.  And I think real time has  replaced a function of auto  RSS, which was here's what's  happening right as it's  happening.  But RSS also has a secondary  time shifting DVR for content  purpose, which is I'm reading my  feeds.  Like, what the hell happened  today?  Like, what did, what, how, you  know, we publish 50 articles a  day on The Verge.  Like, you can't get those all in  real time because it takes 24  hours to do it.  And if, unless you're watching  our site all day every day, which  you should be.  You, that means you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But really, I think for a lot of  people, there is that, which is  if you want to follow something  and you don't want, you can't be  in real time, which is the vast  majority of people, I suspect,  RSS fills that role for you.  And it's important.  And I think Google Reader was so  good and served as the  underlying foundation for so  many other RSS readers.  What people are complaining about,  I think, is that Google basically  wiped out a market in an instant  by saying, we're going to kill  Google Reader.  Worse than that.

Start time: 4012.85
End time: 4022.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They killed it.  They started killing it a year  ago.  They started taking out features  and moving share to Google+.  If it died, it's because Google  actively killed it.  Right.

Start time: 4022.70
End time: 4029.77

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and that's the good news.  I mean, Feedly has already, they  say, signed up half a million  Google Plus or Google Reader  refugees.  But it's not quite the same.  I mean, I'm looking at my Feedly  feed.  It's more of a magazine than what  I would really like.  If I look at my tech news,  instead of the articles all  being lumped together, they're  organized by source.  That's not what I want.  Right.

Start time: 4052.50

End time: 4094.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I think that, you know,  there's a lot of news junkies in  the world.  And I think the market to replace  Google Reader was not a good one.  I mean, building a one-for-one  replacement for Google Reader  while Google Reader existed, I  think, was a stupid idea.  And I don't think a lot of  Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are  running around trying to do that.  Now that Google Reader is gone, I  think the market to try to  actually replace that experience  for journalists and other news  junkies is there.  And I will tell you, you know,  all of our people use Google  Reader.  Joanna and Molly, I suspect you  do, too.  Leo, you obviously do.  Every tech journalist I know does.  Yeah.

Start time: 4095.32
End time: 4102.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

And Twitter is harder to, like,  go back and see what happened,  right, because there's such a  flood of stuff.  But all day, I used to watch  Google Reader, and now I just  watch Twitter.

Transcript:  really, and I have to admit that  some of the stuff they've done  around discover and discovery is  really, really useful to me.  It actually has turned into a  nice, helpful digest.  And then, to be honest, instead  of using Google Reader, I use  Google News.  Really?  Yeah, I use Google News or Tech

Start time: 4137.20
End time: 4154.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  because...  I'm kind of old, though.  I like the idea of articles  being surfaced by interest.  So I also use things like  Prismatic, these social news  readers, Nuzle, that are designed  to kind of surface stuff via  Twitter, Facebook, and other  social signals based on interest.  And that...  Right, when I'm not working, I

Start time: 4154.12
End time: 4163.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

You want to lean, you know, read  and look at these photos and  maybe go watch a video when I'm  at my computer.  I'm doing that lean-in experience  as everyone's been saying, and  I'm copying links and I'm reading  and I want to write or assign  something.  By the way, thanks to the chat  room, I found a view on Feedly

Start time: 4184.00
End time: 4195.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that is closer to my Google News  view.  If I click all, I'll see all the  articles in a chronological  fashion.  That's much more like Reader.  I love the chat room.  They're so helpful.  Yeah, so there is an

Start time: 4196.08

Start time: 4198.00
End time: 4206.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe it's not a big business  for third parties.  Maybe it's not a big business  for Google, but half a million  users, new users is a big deal  for somebody like Feedly.  Right.  Can I ask a question though that

Start time: 4206.90
End time: 4218.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been wondering about this?  Like Google usually kills off  products and it's always like  that no one's using them.  But in the case of Reader, like  why couldn't they just leave it  alone?  Like not...  That's what I wondered too.

Start time: 4219.00
End time: 4230.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was, in fact, I think I tweeted  something about that.  Like how expensive or difficult  is it to actually maintain  Google Reader and keep it alive?  And that's what makes me think  it's all about...  Just leave it on.  To Google+.

Start time: 4230.80
End time: 4236.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know Eli has an answer, but  I'm not sure we want to hear it.  So here's the thing.  So Google had no dedicated

Start time: 4236.88
End time: 4269.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  employees on Google Reader.  None.  For at least the past year.  Zero.  Zero employees running  Google Reader.  And when it had problems, they  would have to divert people from  Google Plus onto Reader.  And the second thing is that  running it isn't, relative to  Google, running it isn't  expensive because Google has  massive amounts of Google  processing power and data  storage and all that.  But running a cloud feed service  for people is tremendously  expensive.  Just think about...  They're not going to stop

Start time: 4270.08
End time: 4276.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 4276.92
End time: 4286.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  is Google saying we want you to  use Google+, even if it's a poor  fit, even if it's completely  different.  We just...  And you know what?  Nobody freaking uses Google+.  Can we just acknowledge that?

Start time: 4288.31
End time: 4290.92

Start time: 4291.70
End time: 4294.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 4296.10
End time: 4322.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've totally aimed it.  Every company, every journalist  and every personality is using  Google+, because the second that  you post something there, you  instantly get a Google News  result with your name in it or  your company name in it.  Because they...  And if you want more proof that  they are gaming their own  results and their own search  results, you look no further  than the one-to-one response  from posting something on  Google+, to seeing a Google  News alert.

Transcript:  So I have a theory about this,  and I have this book on my  shelf over there.  I don't remember who wrote it,  but it's called The Conquest of  Cool, and it's all about...  It's basically about the  Mad Men era advertising.  Yeah.  Oh, I got to read this.  The counterculture in the 60s  was subsumed into advertising  in America.  So irony became the dominant  mode of American and thus  Western communication.  Everything, we're too cool for  everything, and hitting  something right on the nose  doesn't work for American  consumers and American taste  because the counterculture is  so dominant.  So you have to be ironic or  sarcastic or funny or whatever.  I think Samsung is the  reason why Samsung's  presentation and Broadway as a  combo effect are sort of immune  to this, right?  They're big and they're cheesy  and they're brave and they're  not brave.  They're bold and how earnest  they are.  I think there was a lot...  I think Life Companion is an  example of that.  I was in Dubai a few years ago,  and I just remember seeing the  billboards for real estate, and  it would straight up be like,  buy this condo and your life  will improve.  And thinking to myself, that  would never fly in America.  But it's just the lack of irony.  I said it in my live blog at the  S4 event a few times.  There's no irony here.  There's this camp self-awareness,  but there's no sense of  detachment or cynicism about the  product.  They really think it's your life  companion and that waving at  your phone will improve your  life.  That's the sense I'm getting from  all of what Samsung is doing  right now is it's so earnest and  so on the nose direct about what  they're trying to accomplish that  they're missing.  They're just floating over the  sense of irony that I think we  all have about how we're marketed  to be.

Start time: 4524.30
End time: 4599.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I think they could  have actually played, they could  have gone with earnest, right?  I mean, you can't say that  Apple's presentations are not a  little bit earnest or at least.  They're very earnest, yeah.  I mean, they're extremely  earnest and they really are  promising this incredible thing.  I mean, Samsung's language, it's  true, and I think that sometimes  the language or the presentation  does make Americans feel a  little uncomfortable because it  is sort of right in your face  and really lovey.  But I almost felt like if  anything, they were trying too  hard to be sort of ironic and  self-aware.  I agree.  In this particular presentation,  it's weird because sometimes  Samsung, when they nail it with  advertising, they really nail it  and they did manage to build up  this reserve of cool.  That line campaign was great.  That line campaign was absolutely  brilliant.  But then when they don't nail it,  when they do these sort of, you  know, they'll do these weird  like YouTube campaigns where the  people are all really white and  they're all on the verge of  singing and it's just like,  what are you, whoa.  Oh, yeah.  Like the one that they did for  the phone that had the  projector built in, where they  were like, oh, yeah, yeah.  It is unbelievably earnest and it  almost feels like, and it's very  likely actually, they have two  totally different ad agencies  working on this kind of thing.  Many, many different.  But it's, I mean, they need to  like just centralize on the one  that has the little cool factor  because the reason Apple wins is  cool.

And I think this is, I don't  want to veer too far into this,  but I think there is a big  difference in tone and content  when Samsung US and Samsung  Mobile US are speaking to US  consumers and they're the same  ones behind the line ads, for  examples.  And when Samsung headquarters  in Korea is doing the top down  speaking.  And, you know, I don't know.  That makes sense.  Samsung has 500 ad agencies and  300 PR people and it's a joke  in the tech press about how  disorganized and disconnected  all of these different pieces  can be when you're dealing with  them.  But I suspect that some of this  wild, like disparate tone comes  from here's one regional  organization doing this versus  another regional organization.  And the reality behind it, I  don't know if anyone will ever  figure out until like the one  disgruntled Samsung marketing  manager comes forward and speaks  about it because it seems like  it's chaos.  Yeah, exactly.

You can print little fairy  hearts and stuff if you want.  You can intertwine little  things around it.  You can have your return  address automatically printed.  It'll even pull the address of  the person you're mailing to  from your QuickBooks, your  business, accounting, or your  address book on your computer.  Or if you sell on eBay or  Etsy or PayPal or anything like  that, it'll pull it from there  too.  It's really for people,  mailing professionals.  It's a pro tip for people who  do a lot of mailing.  And I've got a special deal for  you.  If you go to stamps.com and you  see Callie Lewis there, but  don't know, I've got a better  deal than Callie.  Go over on the right there where  it says $80.

Start time: 5859.92
End time: 5887.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  just, I mean, the reason that I  actually use the Google, the  Nexus 4 more than the iPhone, I  mean, way, way more than the  iPhone is strictly about Gmail  delivery.  Like I have three different Gmail  accounts and I just cannot  reliably get mail on the iOS  device.  Like it's just, I feel like  Jelly Bean is a little bit  more of a pain.  It just makes iOS look so tired  that it's gotten almost  embarrassing.  Yeah.  But then you've got a lot of  work to do.  But then you have a lot of  results.  But man, that camera though,

Start time: 5888.17
End time: 5914.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that camera is so good.  Yeah, the camera.  And the apps.  I mean, the main reason I  actually finally switched was I  was sick of carrying around  another iPhone to test apps  because any of the new apps are  first coming to iOS.  It's still the case.  And still I'd rather use some of  these apps.  Like I just, they look nicer,  they're easier to use, and I  find that lag still happens in  a lot of Android apps.  So there's nothing, there's no  perfect solution.  Except two.

We'll tell you in just a moment,  but first I want to remind you  that if it's time to get rid  of your Z10  or maybe upgrade your  iPhone 5, 5S,  maybe get a new iPad,  don't forget, you can get money  for your old stuff at  gazelle.com.  G-A-Z-E-L-L-E  will give you cash.  American dollar for your old  stuff.  In fact, you can go to  gazelle.com right now  and get a 30-day quote  on everything.  I presume we're going to see  some new hardware pretty soon.  Maybe you're thinking,  I don't know, I want to see  the S4 before I buy it.  Well, get the quote now  on your old phone.  That quote's good for 30 days,  giving you plenty of time  to look at the S4,  to decide whether to buy it,  to transfer your data over,  then send it off.  Look, here's my old S3 in good  shape, no water damage.  What would gazelle give me  for that S3?  Bingo!  Now, the best part is,  they'll send you a prepaid,  postage-paid box.  You throw it in the box  with a lot of other stuff,  and then on the return trip,  you get money.  You can either get a check,  a PayPal credit if you want it  right away, or my recommendation,  get the Amazon gift card  because they bump that 5%.  Gazelle buys phones,  they buy Mac computers,  they buy a variety of stuff.  Visit gazelle.com.  Get the quote now  because the quote is good  for 30 days.  And I can guarantee you  one thing,  that phone is not gaining  in value.  Absolutely not.  It's worth less  every single day.  It's not an antique yet, folks.  It's got no nostalgia value  whatsoever.  What's my iPad 3 worth?  I'll take it.  Oh, that's an iPad 2.  That's an iPad 2.  Even better.  Wi-Fi only.  Wow.  Gosh, that's like half the value  of it.  I know.  Wow.  Gazelle.com, they've paid out  over $50 million to half a  million customers.  Maybe you're next.  Gazelle.com.  So thank you, Ed Bott,  for noticing this  and making me feel  so much better.  Microsoft, maybe you know this,  in Windows 8,  in the Metro browser,  they block Flash  unless you're on a white list.  And they switched that this week  to having a black list.  So in the past,  if you went to a Flash site  in the Metro version  of Internet Explorer,  you would either be able  to run it or not,  depending on whether  it was on this white list.  So they updated it,  and now they have a black list,  and there are only 12 domains  that Flash will not run on.  HBO and Twitter are two  of the 12.  So I...

It contains only  the main names.  Presumably they'll add  to that later.  And it's mainly focused  on Flash and ARM,  Windows RT and the Surface RT.  My Surface broke.  I dropped it.

If you want to watch live,  we can only do it in Flash right now.  Interesting.  So they hate us,  I think is the reasonable conclusion.  And...  Maybe because you broke your surface.

Transcript:  I have another speculation, Leo.  What is it, Jay?  It's that probably one of our viewers  noticed that the live stream was broken  and then they emailed Microsoft.  And so now Microsoft is like,  oh yeah, no,  we don't have a solution.  Let's just go ahead and blacklist it.  And that's why this list is so small.  It's a weird list, too.  Yeah.  Is that I believe that a viewer  probably contacted Microsoft.  Well, whoever did that,

Transcript:  I am excited about the new Roku 3.  Just got it.  It's one of the features I really like.  It has a headphone jack in the remote,  which is bizarre,  So I could listen to my headphones  through the remote,  and I'm like, great.  Sounds good.  Yeah.  That's great.  It's really cool.  But the thing that's most interesting  is there is a Time Warner Cable app.  Now, I'm not a Time Warner customer,  so I haven't tried it.  Zachary Seward writing for Quartz  points out that you can watch everything,  including live TV.  It is a set-top box for Time Warner Cable.  They're all going this way.  You have to be a Time Warner cable.  Yeah.  But you don't need to rent a Time Warner box anymore.  You don't even need to have a cable connection.  All you need is internet,  and this will make your TV do everything,  including live TV,  that a Time Warner Cable box will do.  But you can do this on an Xbox right now.  You can?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Xbox has a – I have a Fios app on my Xbox.  It's bad.  Well, that's Fios, though.  No, but there's a Comcast app  and a Time Warner app.  The problem has never been the technology  or the UI or the delivery.  The problem is the content deals.  If you're watching on Time Warner,  they're licensed for delivery over Time Warner's pipes,  literally over cable.  And when they say,  we want to deliver it over the internet,  their licenses don't allow them to do that.  Right.  So they've got years and years of legal shenanigans  to go through to get the licenses to deliver over IP.  So, yeah, it's there.  It's cool.  But it's the same kind of limited app  as what's available right now on the Xbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By the way –  Because HBO doesn't own a lot of that.  You know, they don't own that content  apart from their original series.  So they're doing a lot of work.  I talk to these guys all the time.  And they want to do the work.  They know that the answer is there.  What they say to me is,  we go to the content companies  and the VP in Hollywood is sitting there saying,  if I bet on you,  the only thing that can happen is that I lose my job  because this won't bring in the guaranteed revenue  that selling this stuff to the cable companies  the way that we already do does.  And that's like reality.  But it's cool.  It's very cool.  But it's not quite what you might think it is.

So somebody at an interesting article said this is the end of Kickstarter.  This is the end of television.  This is the end of everything.  Life is over as we know it because why would anybody –  There it is.  Did Veronica Mars ruin Kickstarter?  Why would anybody now put up money for a movie when you can get poor schmucks on the Internet  to kick in with no participation?

Transcript:  Well, Tom and I talked about this on an upcoming episode actually of It's a Thing.  And he was saying that the movie studios, essentially that the message they gave to the makers was  we're interested in the movie but we don't know that there's enough interest.  So if you can raise some money on Kickstarter, if you can raise $2 million,  we will greenlight it and match it or put in more money.  So it's going to – I think it will cost more than that to make,  but it proves interest in a way that I think is useful.  In fact, now I'm thinking like I want to put Jericho up.

Transcript:  Well, Kickstarter is building some massive new headquarters here in New York  and one of the reasons it's so massive is they're building a screening room.  I mean, funding movies and TV shows and other kinds of media is actually the predominant use of Kickstarter.  So for something mainstream or closer to mainstream to go this route, it's not surprising.  And I don't know why this would be the end of Kickstarter.  This is actually, I think Kickstarter hitting a point where the studios are taking notice of it as a platform  rather than doing whatever they were doing before and like doing petition drives to bring back Buffy or whatever.  Right.  Did that happen? I don't know if that ever happened.
