Transcript:  Bandwidth for This Week in Tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com slash podcasting.  This is TWiT, This Week in Tech, episode 60, July 2, 2006.  So, joining us for a special Independence Day edition, a last minute cast cobbled together  from the dregs of my Skype contact list, ladies and gentlemen. Actually, it's a pretty good  one. To my left, johncdivorak slash blog dot org, or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a little dyslexic, but it's close enough.  It won't work if you enter it in.  Type dvorak blog into Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there you'll get it. Also from the slam dance industries, ladies and gentlemen, Mr.  Patrick Norton, don't call him Pat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't call me dreg either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's no dreg. And David Prager, who is also, I guess everybody else is on vacation for  the 4th of July, but hey, this is a quorum. This counts as a panel of twits. David's working  hard on revision three's podcasts and podcasts system. And do you do, do you work on Dignation  as well? I guess that's really part of your job too, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All of them. There's, there's some changes going on. We, which I've probably said before,  but everyone's been focusing on dig 3.0 for the longest time. So now that it's out of  the chutes, we're going to shift focus over a little bit more. We're going to update the  website and, and start putting forth some more consistent, different kinds of content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So John was playing for us and you might, you might want to play a little bit of this,  Ted Stevens, who, who is from Alaska, although I was confused earlier, the, the, he's on  the tele, is he the chairman of the telecommunications committee?  Indeed.  And the guy who is spearheading the new telecommunications bill this week of the Senate voted, well,  actually, they didn't vote to eliminate the net neutrality provisions. They just didn't  vote to include it. It was a tie vote.  Yeah, 11-11.  The committee couldn't agree. So it needs to be a majority to put it in. So the net  neutrality provision is gone. And we have, I think this fascinating explanation of net  neutrality from Senator, Senator Stevens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What the Senator's talking about is allowing all of these entities that support this to  provide streaming, stop going on, on the, on the internet. Now the internet, you know,  so let's go back. Internet started with, with a concept of local to local connections across  the country. And you could go for Alaska, but you only had, you had to go through local  connections to get there. Industry wisely provided for streaming for, in effect, a new  kind of long distance. And that's what we've got. We've got a service that's immune to  distance and it's there for the consumer. But when we take and really indicate that  anyone that wants to use this system for massive, massive commercial purposes, there's one company  now you can, you can get, sign up and you've got a movie delivered to your house daily  by subscription service, by delivery service. Okay. And currently it comes to your house,  put in a mailbox for you to get home and you change your order. But you pay for that, right?  This service is now going to go through the internet. And what you do is you just go to  a place on the internet and you order your movie and guess what? You can order 10 of  them and the delivery charge is free, right? 10 movies streaming across that internet.  And what happens to your own personal internet? I just the other day got internet, was sent  by my staff at 10 o'clock in the morning on Friday. I got it yesterday. Why? Because it  got tangled up with all these things that are going on the internet commercially. And  here we have this one situation where enormous entities want to use the internet for their  purpose to save money for doing what they're doing now. They use FedEx, they use the delivery  services, they use the mail, they deliver in other ways, but they want to deliver vast  amounts of information over the internet. And again, the internet is not something that  you just dump something on. It's not a big truck. It's a series of tubes. And if you  don't understand those tubes can be filled and if they're filled, when you put your message  in, it gets in line. It's going to be delayed by anyone that puts into that tube enormous  amounts of material.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which reminds me of that old April Fool's gag I did some years ago where I said these guys  were trying to pass a law saying you can't be drunk when you're using a modem. Drunk  driving on the information superhighway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I can actually see these guys doing it. Now look, Stevens is one of the three  oldest senators. He obviously didn't grow up with the internet. He didn't even grow  old with the internet. I mean, the internet is...  He doesn't use the internet period.  He doesn't even use it. So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And he's... Oh, that's right. He's the guy who was trying to sneak the broadcast flag  into the net neutrality bill.  Yes. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's a weenie.  Exactly. On Wednesday, let's see, the broadcast flag did make it through committee. So net  neutrality did not get through, but the broadcast flag did get through. Oh, what a wonderful  day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's because the broadcast flag is incredibly well-funded. The net neutrality apparently  isn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say, I shouldn't say this, but I'm still kind of conflicted over net neutrality.  I don't like to see any government regulation of the internet one way or the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is government regulation that says there's no regulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it necessary? It's something we have to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it happens in our country. It is. I don't think it is in any other country in  the world, even China, although, you know, they're going to be doing their own thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Technically, you know, it is necessary or they need something like that. In Canada,  Canadian cable companies are notorious for blocking competing services like voice over  internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Well, that's going to happen here if we're not careful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this really is not a regulation of the internet. It's a law to protect the internet  and it is something we need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, the funny thing about it is though, if it doesn't pass, it doesn't mean  anything because it can pass again. I mean, it's not like a law, an onerous law is being  passed. So it's not like a negative thing like this flag deal.  Right. But, you know, so they can take another shot at it or two.  So I think it'll eventually go through it or either that it may just go away if these,  you know, the guys that run the cable companies and the phone companies stop maybe shut up  for a few minutes and quit threatening everybody with, well, you know, Google shouldn't have  a free ride.  I like to see what Google doesn't have a free ride.  I know they don't.  Google pays it therein.  Can you imagine how much Google is paying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Enormous amounts. And that's what's so pathetic about this is because of, you know,  a few well-placed lobbyists and one idiot at AT&T and his cronies have been out there  going, there's a free ride. We built those pipes to the household. And it's like, hey,  jerk, you know, when did you get to wire copper to every house in North America when you were  a protected corporate monopoly? You know, guess what? You want free market? Great. But  it's like, if they're looking at the idea that they're looking at, you know, we want  to be able to, you know, it's, it's, we want to be able to create, and this is the  interesting, we want to create a, a, a preferred carriage that will only be accessible if it's  paid for by, you know, the, the server at the other end. And it's a complete line of dog  snot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, what's interesting about, I mean, they already have tiered service in terms  of the speeds you buy. And, you know, we, we've already tolerated that. I mean, they're,  I don't know what more these guys want. The fact of the matter is they can, you know,  do whatever they want with the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they don't want to have to deliver the speeds they claim they're delivering you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's another thing. They should be, that should be a guaranteed speed. This is  a, this is a, I think this is, these guys should be arrested. There's, I mean, this  is fraud. They claim to be, all these guys give these claims of speed. And if you go,  you check it on any service that checks speeds and you're not getting those speeds. Why is  that even, why does it the district attorney go after these people? This is a consumer  affairs department kind of thing. I mean, there's a, there's a, a scam going on here,  it seems to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. It's, look, the other thing I find out I've been noticing is, is it's  really interesting to watch the level of package shaping that goes on in different, package  shaping in the sense of, of, of limiting or, or throttling your speed depending on the  traffic and where it's coming from and where it's going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they do that with BitTorrent particularly because they don't like all that BitTorrent  traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We actually run into it a lot with streaming video and with video downloads. We run into  it a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's, you know, when they talk about it though, when they're not talking, when they're not  complaining about Google, what they talk about is the positive. They're saying, well, we  can do, if for a little more money, you can get better quality of service for your voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's just it. You're not, you see the whole thing, the whole thing, the whole argument,  right? Part of the original argument behind this came from sort of an engineering economist  at AT&T was like, you know, you know, people want this, the equivalent of managed, people  want the equivalent of a managed circuit, right? They want, the fundamental argument  is if people actually want the bandwidth that they think they're paying for, it's going  to cost us $400, you know, for a five megabit line instead of the $50 we're charging them  monthly, right? And that it's completely unsustainable. And the flip side is a lot  of the engineers, you know, and you can get into the whole argument versus, you know,  college engineers versus, you know, university professors versus people out in the quote  real world, you know, is that a lot of people are saying the easiest way to deliver bandwidth  on the cheap is to just step everything up to, you know, Internet 2 throughput speeds.  But you know, part of what AT&T engineers said, look, if everybody wants that video,  you know, our network wasn't designed to do that. It was designed for burst transmissions  here and there. And yeah, you know, we can give you like this speed, but we can't sustain  it 24 seven for every user. That's impossible. If you want that, you got to step up to a  managed line that costs, you know, a couple of, you know, a hundred, four hundred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that the case? I mean, doesn't, don't we get, I mean, sustained throughput, high sustained  throughputs over, you know, these files and other high,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think files might be doing it. But do you think the average DSL customer can  download it? You know, their maximum speed 24 seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess. I don't. Certainly not. Not if everybody did it at once. So in that case,  they certainly have an argument. They're saying, well, look, everybody, you know, people are  using it harder than they were before. We could, we could give you that number when  it was. Well, how does that mean? How does that, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  how does that cost more? Right. Because at the, at the top level, the interchanges between  backbones are peered, which means it's free exchange of packets. And at the lower level,  I mean, are we talking about saturating routers so that they have to build additional equipment  into the colo? I mean, what does it cost more if they're not paying for their access? You're  saying they're not paying for their access? Well, if, if, if like AT&T, for example, AT&T  is not just an ISP, but they're also a backbone, right? They control some of the fundamental  lines on the internet. So where are they getting charged for this bandwidth that supposedly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is breaking them? I mean, there, maybe they're charging themselves  internally, but I think it's not unreasonable for them to say it's costing them something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's costing them something, but where is it costing them? You know what I mean?  It's like, I understand if they, you know, if they, if they basically, if they've wired  every neighborhood in North America with the equivalent of, you know, 10 megabit per second  ethernet or a hundred, you know, megabit per second ethernet. And I'm generalizing here  before I get angry letters from network engineers. But, you know, and, and if the whole country  wants to have, you know, you know, 10 times, you know, gigabit ethernet, then they have

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to upgrade equipment. But, you know, there is a certain amount of merit to the argument.  I mean, look at, we're kind of whiny, frankly, we consumers, we want everything cheap and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  free and... Hey, no, I don't. I didn't go with a 25, you  know, $22 a month service. Yeah, but most people do. But most people do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And most people are saying, I don't want to pay at all. And why am I having to pay so  much? And, and I've said that myself. I've said that we pay more in the States than we  do in most other countries. Is it unreasonable for them as a business to say, well, look,  you want better service? You want, you guys all want to watch YouTube 24 hours a day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're gonna have to pay us. Well, if they actually do, you know, they're  not delivering me the bandwidth a lot of the time that they currently claim they are.  Right. Because I get the bandwidth if I go to like,  you know, you know, bandwidth detector dot test dot whatever it is. But if I'm actually  real world on an application where I've no, I've got the bandwidth on the other end, then

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can tell it's throttle. I'm in agreement with Patrick. And the fact  is, you know, these guys, these guys are selling something there. It's not like they're, you  know, it's just almost bait and switch. I mean, they say they're giving you, you know,  1.5 megabits per second or, or, or six or whatever they're particularly thinking.  And within that range of the, if I'm getting six, where is it?  Well, don't they say, and then they whine about, oh, you, you, you, well, you didn't expect you to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  use it. Don't they say up to six? Do they actually say always six? No, they say up to six megabits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. What does that mean? I'm supposed to be getting 750.  So that means maybe I get six once a year pay on Tuesday and November 6th. They gave me a six for one millisecond.  I mean, what kind of a scam is this? I don't know why you're supporting these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm playing devil's advocate here, but I think it's important that this argument be made because I'd like to hear the argument against it.  You're not convincing me. I mean, if, if they built a network that was based on a certain amount of usage that wasn't sustained six megabits,  but peaking at six megabits and all of a sudden everybody's looking for a sustained six megabits, the network doesn't support it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think that... Everybody's not looking. Most people are surfing the Internet once in a while.  But most people, more people are. Who's getting the six? That's what I'd like to know. Where is that guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I get, I get four or five regularly on my cable modem. And I'm, you know, they bill it as up to six, peaks at six.  But I get, I mean, I'm not unhappy with four or five megabits. Have you ever gotten six? You ever gotten six? Is up to six?  I don't know. You ever got it? That's a good question. I don't know. I doubt it.  Well, I don't think anybody would know unless you were constantly monitoring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and a lot of people are, you know, I think if any of the numbers I've heard are real, right, and not just the fabrication of somebody who's trying to crush, you know,  BitTorrent, you know, if they're claiming like some huge percentage of all traffic on the net right now, it's peer-to-peer file sharing.  You know, that's an interesting thing, right? I mean, that's an interesting proposition, you know.  It would be, it would be, you know, it's because I run into people who have some pretty, a lot of Fios customers and certainly people at certain universities who aren't out on like the dormitory networks,  but are working in the labs and stuff, you know, they can download like DLTV at two megabits per second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if it's possible, if it's possible to economically offer really high speed internet, in other words, if these guys are greedy and just claiming it's harder than it is, why doesn't some white knight come along and say,  okay, well, you know, the truth is, I can do it for a buck fifty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, remember something, right? If you're the white knight, like right now, you know, I went with a cable modem instead of DSL when I moved into my new house, because I no longer need a landline, right?  Right.  So if I need a white knight, I need a landline. So, you know, who's my white knight for DSL? And do I want to put in a landline to do that? So what's my other option? Comcast cable.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, clearly competition is the key here. And in fact, if anything, maybe we should be encouraging Congress to encourage competition and encourage alternate sources of internet.  And if there is true competition, then wouldn't, I don't know, wouldn't all of this go away?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting thought.  These are a couple of monopolists that know how to play the game better than we can argue about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They are playing it very well.  Anyway, you know, I agree. And I am absolutely in principle in favor of net neutrality. I was disappointed that the Congress, that the committee didn't add that to the bill. But at the same time, I think there are some legitimate arguments saying, well, you know, do we want to, do we want to legislate this? And I think you've argued well in favor. So all right, I'm supporting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other thing is part of the whole reason this came up is because the baby bells want, you know, the blessing and love of the government to do what amounts to cable TV over the networks.  No, I agree.  And I think that's a fair trade if they want to be, you know, if they want to crush the cable TV networks or get into a running battle with them, the very least the federal government can do is an exchange is make sure that they're not going to crush the ability to download video from places other than, you know, insert name of my DSL providers.  Video project, you know, right.  Because that's where that's where it gets interesting. You know, like Craig Newmark's argument is the whole like if I call for Joe's pizza, you know, I want to get, you know, I want to directly dial up Joe's pizza. I don't want, you know, to dial Joe's pizza and have, you know, AT&T send me to, you know, Jimmy Joe Bob's pizza and barbecue because Jimmy Joe Bob's pizza and barbecue is a subset of AT&T.  You know, and then eventually, if I choose not to do that, then they'll let me, you know, talk to Joe's pizza.  Well, I hear these arguments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now see this again, this bugs me a little bit because I hear these arguments, but these are completely fabricated.  Nobody's suggesting that.  I mean, I don't think AT&T is going to suddenly substitute your search at Google with MSN search just because MSN gave them money.  And if they did, I think then howls a protest.  Absolutely. But I mean, that's hypothetical.  I don't think anybody's saying,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, if I want to download video, right, and my my ISP throttles any video that doesn't happen to be part of their flash, you know, video on demand service, you know, that's that's right there.  That's effectively doing it.  Will they move that direction in the future?  I'm sure they'd like to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess the question is, are they going to throttle or are they going to leave it the same and give you better bandwidth for their service?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, the problem is that they're already throttling now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot of cases, this is whether or not they're throttling or not throttling or whether or not it's hypothetical, hypothetical or not hypothetical, as Leo suggests.  The fact of the matter is they've been hinting at it.  They've been hinting at this is what they're going to do.  And that's the reason that they haven't been if they hadn't been right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Let me add Bill McCrone, who is calling in.  Bill, are you there?  Yes, I am.  Hey, that's great.  And of course, Bill would have good quality headset microphone and sound great.  I would expect that no less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We were just talking about net neutrality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And, you know, I don't know if you have any thoughts on that, but essentially before we do, I should I should probably introduce Bill because we have a long history.  Bill McCrone was at PC Magazine editor.  He was the guy who started Ziff Davis's entry into television.  And I first met him when I auditioned for him in 1994 for the show that they were going to do on CNBC called MSNBC.  Well, no, no, this predates that there was no MSNBC.  Oh, really?  I thought we were.  OK, this goes back to when we shot.  Gina and I did the show with Jim Latterback at the old Apple TV studios.  That's right.  And it was we had a couple of different names.  In fact, at one point it was called Tech TV, ironically.  That's right.  And what are you doing these days?  Are you still writing for PC Mag at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm still a columnist.  I guess that makes me the longest running columnist maybe in the industry at this point in one publication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Doesn't Jerry Arnell have that right still?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Jerry's writing for Byte, but Byte's not really a magazine anymore.  So I don't know if that counts.  Yeah, well, it's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's a good point.  I'm hoping he also is going to quit so I could take it.  Oh, take the reins.  I have to be there another few years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, I had dinner with Stuart Alsop last night.  So he's gunning for you.  Look out, John.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Bill is really the geek's geek and always has been.  He was the guy who really formed PC Magazine and led it for many years.  And I'm really glad we could get you on.  My pleasure.  Join the conversation.  We're talking about net neutrality and I'm afraid I've been cast in the role of devil's advocate on my own decision.  And what we're really talking about, my question is, is this really something we should be worried about?  Yeah, sure.  AT&T and Verizon have started rattling the cage about, oh, Google's stealing our bandwidth.  And that's something to be concerned about.  But do we really need to make a law or won't just natural competition protect us from this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I don't think our politicians will protect us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we know that much.  They've already decided not to.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I have a link somewhere here to an MP3 of Ted Stevens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we were just listening to that.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just missed it.  Well, tell us your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, I'm going to...  I'll edit this a little bit.  So you heard Ted Stevens kind of disjointed conversation about net neutrality or speech about net neutrality.  What's your take on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd say that if anybody ever wants to know what the working definition of double speak is, they should just listen to Ted.  Do you think he's in the pockets of the big telcos?  I could not say, but he has not exactly been Mr. Squeaky Clean, has he?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have a policy of describing him on the Dvorak blog as an a-hole.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ever judicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Something to do with Alaska?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, exactly.  That's it. That's a ticket.  He's from Alaska. That's it.  So, I mean, I guess I volunteered myself for this devil's advocate.  I really think that what's happened is there's been this polarization between those who say net neutrality is a must.  We've got to have it.  And those who say, oh, that's ridiculous.  And I don't think people are listening to the other side's arguments particularly or even defeating the other side's arguments.  So I thought it'd be important to kind of bring up the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, does that...  You're kind of suggesting that the other side has a valid argument.  If the other side has a valid argument, since you're playing devil's advocate, what is that valid argument?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly what I just said, which is they built their networks for a certain amount of usage.  They didn't plan on people using it as thoroughly and heavily as they are.  They didn't plan for sustained five megabit downloads from a quarter of their customers.  And they quite rightly say that if you want that kind of service, we're going to have to prioritize traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if this is a legitimate argument, Leo, and they are so beholden to the consumers that keep them paid, us, we,  why are they not turning to us and saying, if you want guaranteed bandwidth, you, Patrick Norton, will have to pay X number of dollars more per month.  And we will deliver that bandwidth to you instead of going into Congress with lobbyists and saying, Google is ripping us off.  I ain't paying for the bandwidth when I come to our customers.  Tell me that, Leo. Explain to me.  I'll tell you exactly why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the issue is they feel like customers are not going to pay any more money.  They're very price sensitive as it is.  And they feel it's only reasonable if providers like YouTube, like Google want better access to their customers.  And this is where I think the monopolies of the cable companies and the phone companies have a worldview that is a little distorted.  They view us as their customers, that they offer access to other people, like Google and YouTube.  They offer us to them.  And that's why they want to go to them and say, look, if you want access to them, if you want better, and by the way, let's not say just access.  They already have access.  If you want better access, we'll be glad to give it to you, but somebody's got to pay for the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is so twisted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is so twisted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This internet would be nothing without what we've done here at AT&T to connect up our consumers to the internet.  I mean, is that exactly the argument?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you're talking about the eight companies that are the top tier in terms of providing the high speed backbone.  And they're saying they're not making money on their backbone.  Well, raise your price per gigabyte.  Nobody's stopping them.  But I see arguments from these guys that make it sound like it's universal access, that somehow the internet subsidizes individuals the way the phone companies do.  And I think I heard Stephen say that until one of his underlings corrected him.  Right.  So there's a lot of general purpose misunderstanding out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It may be a worldview issue.  I mean, I think that there definitely is a worldview that the big providers have that's somewhat disjointed from what the actual facts are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're not their customers.  The metropolitan area networks are their customers and the ISPs are their customers.  And they're about three tiers, four tiers away from us.  Right.  You just have to look at the number of hops and where your signal goes to get from here to there.  And they're up at the top of the chain.  And nothing to do with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're just greedy sons of guns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  Sons of guns.  I'm not going to call them greedy.  I'm going to call them stupid because they don't know how to price their own products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there's something to that.  And the fact of the matter is I don't think these guys really get what they're into and what they're doing.  And I think that the fact that...  Wait a minute. You're saying we should be paying more?  No, the stupidity is what we're talking about.  And I tell you the reason why I totally convince that Bill's right on this because their representative is Ted Stevens.  Come on.  This is the guy, their frontman is Ted Stevens.  I mean, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem is that they're not charging us enough?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they're not charging enough for access, period.  They charge by the gigabyte, terabyte, monster byte, whatever.  Backbone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The real access.  But it'd be passed along to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or it gets passed along to Google and Yahoo's profits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're looking for...  You know what? There's something...  That's what I think maybe we're getting at here.  There's some scam going on because all this is just about, you know, access and where to trust it.  Just put the...  Yeah, just up the ante and do it on the backbone side.  Everybody just has to pay more.  They're trying to nickel and dime us to death with some scam.  That's what's going on.  Let me propose...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe the scam is an anti-competitive scam.  They're worried about voice over the internet.  They're worried about YouTube and Google providing television and Apple providing television shows.  Before they can.  So is it merely that there...  Is it an anti-competitive issue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  They've been talking about this voice over video diatone.  For the last 25 years that I recall.  And they've never been able to deliver it.  And I think it's possible they're looking left and right and they're seeing all this stuff going on.  They're saying, oh my God.  What do we do to slow this down? We can't keep up.  We're too stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you one thing. I do know for a fact that they don't like the business model of merely making money on bits.  They, both the cable companies and I think to some extent the telcos,  see themselves as making their money on premium services.  Selling premium services on top of those bits.  They don't want to be a data provider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, certainly the cell phone networks are realizing it's much easier.  Because they spend so much money subsidizing cell phones.  It's easier to skim profits out of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we've made our point. Why don't we go to another topic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Topic number two. Microsoft delays Office 2007 till sometime in 2007.  Saying it's not ready yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Will it ever be ready?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've been playing with it.  And of course, Vista Beta 2.  They both seem fairly ready. I'm not sure exactly what the issue is.  But why is it Microsoft's having such trouble getting these products out the door?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they're phenomenally complex for one thing.  As if 2003 and XP weren't complex enough.  They're layering even more stuff on there.  And of course they're building all of this phone home stuff into their software.  Which is not getting a great reception out there.  So they're having to re-engineer some portions of that to make it a little more socially acceptable.  You're talking about the Windows Genuine Advantage type stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who knows what else is in there. But certainly Genuine Advantage is a silly thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To Microsoft's credit, they're doing 2 million. They shipped out 2 million Betas of Vista 2.  They just closed it down by the way on Friday.  That's it. If you didn't get it. In fact, they say if you haven't activated your Beta, activate.  Because we don't guarantee you'll be able to activate much longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey Bill, for people out there who don't know, can you explain Windows Genuine Advantage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll try. It's an anti-piracy technology.  When you, Microsoft introduced this shortly after ServicePad.  How does it advantage?  Well that's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's just clever marketing. It's like Patriot Act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who's advantage? Microsoft's. But I can't blame them for trying to protect themselves against piracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Except that it slows down all of the people who aren't pirates.  It's a classic case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And not only that, it seems to be broken substantially.  I talk to a lot of people who have legitimate copies of Windows who are told they don't have legitimate copies.  And then there's the greater issue of the fact that it was actually phoning home daily.  Which Microsoft says they're going to stop doing.  I can't imagine what it's asking about.  Is it okay to run? Can I run now?  Is it okay now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've seen some really egregious stuff on the part of manufacturers.  I monitor all new software that I install.  My wife got an HP computer a while ago.  It's subsequently been replaced.  But it suddenly lit up my packet detector.  And I was wondering what it was doing.  And traced it back to the keyboard driver.  And it was calling some server deep in the bowels of Packard.  So I, of course, locked it out and then called the PR people at HP.  And they were completely baffled and embarrassed about the whole thing.  And they went down the chain of command and found some engineer deep in the bowels of the organization who said,  Oh, yeah, I wrote that driver.  And I put a little bit of a link to it in the description.  I'm pretty thoroughly impressed that you were able to get to the bottom of that.  That is impressive, yeah.  I was amazed myself.  But you know, there's all kinds of stuff that we can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'm pretty sure that's what you're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure that's what you're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure that's what you're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I was a little bit surprised.  I was a little bit surprised that my wife was able to get to the bottom of that.  But you know, there's all kinds of stuff like that going on in the world.  And you never know until you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But doesn't that also mean that you could have some guy who writes drivers in the back of any big company like HP write all kinds of queries back to the home office for who knows what?  Sounds like a bad back door to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And you have no control over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing you'd wonder about HP's QC that they didn't notice that themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the QC guys probably never thought about it.  And it's like, oh yeah, it's logging in.  Or else they'd have it all up and down the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's get realistic about QC nowadays when it comes to computers.  These things are rolling off a line in northern China by the millions.  And the QC is like a bunch of people with rubber mallets pounding the side of the machine if it doesn't blow up and get shipped.  Come on.  Sometimes I think you're right.  Sometimes I think you're right.  I've seen these factories. I am right. Believe me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Speaking of pounding things with a rubber mallet, they don't have to worry about pounding anything on the space shuttle.  They just got to worry about launching it somewhere instead of Florida.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's all weather, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, I know it's a big issue to do something, but I just don't understand why they keep launching out of Cape Canaveral.  I mean, they should launch from the middle of Death Valley because it's a blue sky every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As long as it's far enough south.  But you know, the whole thing is about recovering the boosters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The SRBs, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they fall in the ocean.  Of course, the Russians never had that problem.  No, they used to land in cities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Russians at the USSR at the time had a slightly different sort of, you know, impact.  I mean, they're a little less worried about the impact on communities and the environment.  Not that blowing off rockets doesn't spew a lot of insane stuff underneath it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They just pack up and move communities the same way as China packs up and moves people out of when they built that Three Gorges Dam.  They're like, we're going to flood your town. Get out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now that's eminent to Maine. That's power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So does anyone, jump into a new story.  Has anyone noticed a story about Alaska trying to sell a school on eBay?  Has anybody followed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, what? Tell us about it.  So the eBay, is that the tech angle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that TedSAhole.com? Is that where you send your PayPal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's actually very expensive. It's at $1.8 million for this Lucian's Eastboro school.  I don't know why you would, it's a 40, oh, I see it's 43,000 square feet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a warehouse, which is the way most schools are built nowadays, if anyone hasn't noticed.  And it's on the waterfront.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're going to turn it into a seafood processing plant. That's what they're going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, red hats slapped with a patent suit.  Are you just dipping your finger in the story?  I'm just going for it. We spent so much time on that net neutrality thing that people must be listening to the show thinking that we're just not paying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll cut it down. Don't worry.  I'll cut it down to the seminal five minutes. Don't worry.  Bill, I'm sorry you had to be here for this bickering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's okay. It's very enjoyable, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Red hat suit.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anything?  File Star has filed a claim against red hat for patent infringement. I don't even do these stories anymore.  Okay, no story.  Because anybody can file a patent lawsuit and they often do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  New attack, flaw in Apple computers. I'm not getting anything there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's actually interesting because this actually attacks a flaw that Apple so thought it patched.  There was a fairly large patch that went out this week for OS X users, including a patch for a security hole in LaunchD.  And apparently this attack found a continuing hole in it.  You know, the problem with this is the story comes from Symantec, who makes, interestingly enough, security software for OS X.  I'm always a little suspect when a company that makes security software tries to play up these vulnerabilities,  especially since there has been no evidence of it in the wild at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. Well, let's jump to this story. This one here fascinates me.  By the way, Bill, we have a list of stories that we can send you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but you don't need it, believe me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you don't need it because obviously these stories are so thin that you're not going to need to know anything.  Well, I haven't pruned them yet and that's my fault for not...  Okay, Western Digital settles. Does anyone find this to be actually kind of a funny story?  Because I've always thought it was slightly confusing the way they would present these.  You know, what I got an 80 gigabyte drive with me, you do the calculation. It's something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you mean the whole one divisible by 1,000, 1.84 type of thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Decimal versus binary. There's actually somebody sued over that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they got sued. Western Digital got sued for calling... let me read you that from the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They say it now very clearly in the ads, on the packaging.  One billion bytes equals one comma zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero.  They always say that now because they know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what's so good about that? They called their 80 gigabyte drive... they got sued because it only had 79.97254272 gigabytes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The only reason I'd ever want to be a judge is so I could get cases like that and throw them out.  Yeah, just throw them into jail just for bringing cases like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But now there have been some legitimate suits. Remember there was the lawsuit over screen monitor measurements  where they were including the black edges and the old CRTs. I mean there have been cases where it's a little...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, woohoo, but we all knew what size TV we were getting.  And a 27 inch TV, you could just buy them by the pound or the depth or anything because everything else was the same.  Right, that's a very good point.  Yeah, but people just love to sue for incredibly stupid things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Speaking of suits, we were talking about WGA. There is a class action lawsuit against Microsoft for Windows Genuine Advantage.  Let me see if I can find that story because that might be a lawsuit that you would back up. I don't know, let's see.  You're talking about the class action suit?  Yeah, it was filed on Monday in Seattle and the lawsuit alleges the program violates consumer protection laws in California and Washington state  against spyware and invasive programs that surreptitiously collect data. I mean nobody's denying that WGA does...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the irony is that Washington state has probably the most onerous laws in that regard that not let you do that.  You can actually, you probably could start a business and make money by busting people for spyware in Washington state.  Well...  California less so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting revelation though in this suit. For instance, and Microsoft admits this, there was a high priority update I think in April, one of those critical updates.  Turns out it was just a test version of the WGA software that Microsoft was pushing at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gee, it sounds like those terror alerts they have just before the elections.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding.  Wait, but WGA is manufactured specifically to keep people from pirating their operating system, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, but everybody who runs XP now, wants updates, needs to be running it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so like the whole issue is if you're running a fake, a non-validated Windows, you don't need to be spreading viruses because you don't have the latest patch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and this to the Microsoft's credit, and I don't know how much longer they'll do this, they do still give you critical updates.  So security updates are still available even if you're running pirated versions of Windows. Not if you're running legitimate versions of Windows 98.  But if you're running...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they're not supporting Windows 98 Windows anymore.  No.  Right, they're dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought part of the whole point of this was that they were just going to start blacking and shutting down systems that weren't accepting Windows genuine advantage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, I haven't heard that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they did threaten to do that early on and there was such a hue and cry that they immediately backed away from that.  And people would rather go back to the days of Bill Gates stepping on little companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Microsoft did release a new version of WGA that allows you to at least turn off the notifications.  It also doesn't check out phone home quite as often.  But the real problem, I think, is that it's...  Again, I'll say this again because it keeps happening, is it does also flag legitimate software frequently.  And then you've got this notification. You still can get your updates. You can't download the next DirectX 9 or, you know, copies of Paint.net or whatever.  But you can get the critical updates.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Paint.net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whatever it is.  You know, there is a Paint.net. It's not from Microsoft. What is the name of that Microsoft Paint program?  MS Paint?  No, no, no. They actually have a pretty good little graphics program that they pushed out for free.  But you had to do that.  The one from years ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The one that they pulled out, they don't have it anymore? That cool little thing that did all kinds of weird stuff and then they just disappeared?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think it's that old. I think it was recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, well, there was one I remember. They've done this in their programs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was a Paint program that went by the books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was it called Max?  Max. That's the one I'm thinking of.  Was it Max?  Max is like a Picasso, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. You can only get it if you are a genuine Windows user.  Like, who cares?  What does that mean?  Who cares? I don't care. I don't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm a genuine Windows user.  So what do you guys think of France and the passage of this new DRM law and its effects on...  I'm confused by it.  I guess pretty much iTunes.  I'm confused by it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't understand what the issue is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think it's a legitimate...  Here I am again defending the bad guys, but I think it's a legitimate issue, which is that Apple...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a fair play DRM law that says that if you're going to sell something that has, well, copy protection,  like all the music that you purchase off the iTunes music store, the fair play junk part of the law says that you've got to let it be compatible with competing...  with other people's music players.  But there are some outs.  ...have a creative jukebox or something that you should be able to play your iTunes downloaded music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think that's fair. I mean, I think it's trying to break Apple's monopoly as iTunes iPod access.  But there are legitimate outs. If the artist and the labels say, oh, that's okay, then you don't have to share your DRM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the out is saying make an exclusive deal with a company to distribute your music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I see. So if somebody else is selling it, then you're out of luck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if you're the Beatles, or whoever owns the Beatles, I guess, is Michael Jackson, and you want to distribute Beatles music,  which they're not able to do on iTunes right now anyway, but if you want to distribute it specifically for the Nomad jukebox,  you can sign a deal with Michael Jackson and tell Apple to go do whatever they want to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm still not getting this, what you're saying. Why couldn't you do that before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the short answer is that the law does two things. One, it does what it's supposed to in theory,  which is allow interoperability so that I can play any secured music on any player. That's the theory.  But then they had a loophole inside of that that said Apple can basically not allow its music to be played on competitors' players  if and only if they get the permission from the artist to do so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's also some... the open source community was a little upset about it because they would have to provide this information  on interoperability under NDA, and it would actually leave open source developers out of the loop.  Or if they were in the loop, they couldn't publish the source code. It would no longer be open source.  So Richard Stallman was a little upset about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Am I wrong in... hasn't the hacking community busted this system by now so you could take an iTunes piece of music  and run it on an old... anybody's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, actually they did for a while. In fact, it was DVD John or Yon, I don't know how you pronounce it, who cracked it.  He cracked the Fair Play copy protection and created a program called Play Fair.  But then Apple updated iTunes and ever since version 6, it hasn't worked. You haven't been able to strip it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unless you... the only way I know to do it is to burn a CD and...  Yeah, the analog hole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go through the virtual CD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're trying to get the analog hole plugged too. I don't know what the status of that is in Congress as long as we're covering that.  Yeah, that just...  ...is trying to plug holes.  He's an Alaska Hole, actually.  Yeah, are we talking about Ted again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ted again, who's back?  Yeah, there is a push to close the audio hole and the video.  Of course, Macrovision does in effect close the video hole unless you know how to get around it, but...  But they're trying to do that with audio too, where they're encoding what, ultrasonic things that create distortion,  unless it's the original copy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pretty soon they'll have it so you can't even hear it yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you have to pay them a dollar every time you listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You need special ears. You need ears implanted.  DRM ears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to borrow some ears.  Money to be made.  Somebody has scammed the Nigerian Scammers.  An interesting story from Australia.  There is...  You know the 419 scams where the Nigerians say,  I have $15 million, help me get it out and I'll give you 10%.  So there is an anti-419 site.  And the guy who runs it, he says,  My goal is just to keep the 419 scammers so busy they don't have time to steal.  These scams are actually surprisingly effective given how much publicity and how far-fetched it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's been a few famous people that got caught in these scams.  By the way, there's another group that's been doing this a lot longer than these guys.  I blogged them a couple years ago and it's still on the blog somewhere.  But this guy took it to one other extreme.  He would agree to do all this stuff and then he'd give these guys to run around.  Eventually, get them to do silly things.  This may be the same group but they've been around for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The website is called 419eater.com and the guy's pseudonym is ShiverMeTimmers.  Basically, he's been getting these 419ers to do things for him.  In this case, wooden sculptures of a Commodore 64 keyboard.  It's so awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The show of good faith is critical to any confidence game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right. That's the good faith.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just looked it up.  This makes the story even more interesting in some weird way.  The 409eater, I actually first blogged it in 7-17-2004.  These guys are obviously going around the horn again with publicity for themselves.  Well, good for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't realize they'd be at the next level.  They got some jerks to carve out in the time.  That's a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He had the picture I have from two years ago.  They created a fake church and got these guys to join it.  They had to put all kinds of weird markings on their bodies and send pictures around.  It's a group of people who like to humiliate dummies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The best part is that they got the Nigerian, this is the good faith bit,  they got the Nigerian scammer to carve this keyboard and some other intricate little models.  Then they sent a note from the Australian police saying,  you've been dealing with a notorious art forger who's been arrested.  We're so sorry you got scammed.  I just love it.  Give them more publicity, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We actually blogged this particular story too.  There was one picture where they had him carving all kinds of stuff.  I think that was creative because you can get the carvings,  it'd be nice to have them around the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then they would use Photoshop to distort the picture and say,  oh no, it got hurt somehow and you need to send us another one.  I love it.  I think that's fine.  There was a very good New Yorker article about a month ago about a preacher  who got sucked so deep in the 419 scam that he was actually prosecuted in the US  and convicted of a felony because he started passing checks and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Remember when we did the Q&A with the Secret Service?  The thing they said is they still investigate hundreds and hundreds of 419 scams every year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They wish they didn't have to, frankly.  They think they're better things to be doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do people get so out of touch that...  This has been going on for years.  People have written columns about it.  There's been a million things and they just still don't get the word out.  It's amazing to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there's always somebody new in the retirement community  who gets their first computer or whatever.  It's not just the retirement community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stevens from Alaska is falling for it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be funny if he got scammed?  There's people in Nigeria who have internet access and they're paying for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, I think we should maybe form a scam-Stevens society  and just pretend to be the ninth big telco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would like to officially distance myself from this conversation.  No, no, no.  I really think this is...  No, no!  I'm the one who usually... I have absolutely no interest in...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nothing illegal, absolutely.  It's not the illegal I'm worried about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're just kidding. We're just kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is there anything illegal about us forming a telco?  No.  I don't think there's any actual reason to have any capital equipment  or anything silly like that.  We could simply organize ourselves a telco, hire ourselves a lobbyist.  I vote for Patrick. He's a very honest-looking guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Plus, I can ride like a cheap rug from Sears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So, I mean, here's our man in Washington.  A couple of lunches and I'd say we'd have the guy dead to rights.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Senator Stevens, I want to tell you about what you have in mind  considering about net neutrality, which you really need to embrace  for the citizens that are going to re-elect you next year.  I love this. You're on a roll, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Buy me another suit, man.  So, David Pogan, his column, New York Times columnist,  David Pogan, his column on the internet reveals that, in fact,  the Toshiba high-def DVD player, the first HD DVD player,  which costs $500, actually loses Toshiba $200 on every player.  It costs more than $700 to make.  So, why, he says, are they making it?  And he says that, in fact, he believes, he has no evidence for this,  that Microsoft is underwriting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, please. What planet did he come from anyway?  This kind of marketing has been going on forever.  If you buy the first Plasmas that come out,  they're shipping about a $500 bill with each one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Excuse me, how many millions of console gaming units?  Game consoles always sold at a loss.  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  Aren't cell phones sold at a loss by every...  All right, all right, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe they used to. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  His next article is going to be about how some lawyers are crooked.  I mean, come on.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Well, here's an interesting thing,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because I just logged into this article,  and it's got an address, an email address for me.  I don't know where it got it, but I haven't had in 10 years.  So, I don't know what's going on there.  Maybe they... Does the New York Times keep track of my old email addresses?  Obviously, they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a conspiracy theory we've got going there.  Maybe they have a reason to.  Maybe, I don't know.  Anyway, yeah, that thing...  Apparently, the Blu-ray they're going to sell.  They're not going to make any money on that either.  They might not sell it at a $200 loss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, that one's several hundred dollars more expensive than the HD.  It's a thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why you got to buy the Sony PS3.  It's only $500.  Yeah, that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, OK, hey, ship me one tomorrow, David.  OK, bring it over to the house.  I'm waiting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I told my son, you can have game consoles.  As soon as Sony's PS3 comes out, let's wait for that.  And wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And wait.  I mean, the other thing is a lot of these estimates of what devices cost to build.  I've noticed a lot of them tend not to take in little things like bulk discounts or existing relationships with parts suppliers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's hard to really know how much it costs.  Yeah, you can get pretty close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not saying you can't get pretty close, but some of them have been sort of...  I've seen some that listed close to retail prices for parts.  I don't know.  It's interesting.  Toshiba's already started saying that they're actually making a profit on these boxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really?  With a good bookkeeper, you can make a profit on anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I mean, it's interesting that Toshiba came back that quickly and was like, this is ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How early adopters are there of the HD DVD player already?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They seem to be selling out.  They said they were sold out.  What does that mean?  Let me rephrase it, John.  I mean, they built, supposedly they built around 10,000 in the first run.  We were actually trying to find one to purchase to do a comparison with the Blu-ray player.  We had the Samsung Blu-ray player in, which is a pretty good unit.  It's unfortunate the initial run of Blu-ray discs aren't that hot, but the Blu-ray player is pretty solid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they wouldn't send you a review unit because they were so hot off the press?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, we couldn't find any for sale in Northern California.  I mean, we couldn't find any for sale that weren't being delayed for a couple of weeks.  So they may actually have sold out completely on the first run of those.  I mean, they're picking up some momentum.  They got 70 or 90 titles out already.  So it'll be interesting to see how fast Blu-ray comes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What I don't get, you know, to be honest about it, because you talk about these things having a run.  I don't know why these things are having a run at all.  They should be in continuous production.  They don't make runs of a device that they're going to be putting into the public  at these kinds of numbers and millions and millions of units eventually.  It doesn't make sense to me that there's not a ship coming over right now loaded up with these  unless they just sent a bunch of testers or maybe the ones that just cost too much to make  and they got a cheaper one they're working on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It seems logical to me that they do run because what if they don't sell on the first run  and then all of a sudden they don't have to spend as much money on increasing their losses?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well then they did some pretty poor marketing or market planning it seems to me.  I don't think that these guys roll out a product that's this complicated  without knowing exactly what the demand is going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, so what is the real demand driver for HD DVD?  Is it sports or porn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Neither.  Always asking the tough questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not regular movies.  No, no, no. It's beautiful nature documentaries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there aren't any.  There isn't any.  The cherry blossoms. I get it. The cherry blossoms.  Well, there's no prong, there's no nature documentaries, and there's no...  Just a bunch of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no good movies either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's actually some really good movies.  Okay, I'm sorry.  I'm a personal favorite right now still being good fellows and it's also really good transfers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are they doing a good job with the transfers? That's actually...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  HD DVD ones seem to have been...  It's interesting that we've got pretty much all the first five or six blu-ray titles in-house  and what's shocking about a couple of them is that either they couldn't get a decent film to scan for the transfer  or they didn't care because you're looking at scratches in the film and specks and dirt.  It's quite impressive when you're looking at a 50 to 60 inch screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It sounds like they were rushed in that case.  Maybe they didn't have the opportunity to get pristine prints.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's a lot of interesting dialogue about how they're handling the initial run of blu-ray discs  and what level of security is being employed on them.  It's interesting, but the biggest...  The Samsung player itself is doing a really good job.  It's a smidge faster than the Toshiba, but the Toshiba is essentially a Linux box.  It's slow.  Well, here's the thing.  One of the reasons we're waiting for another review unit to come in is because supposedly they've done a pretty hefty firmware upgrade  that's going to improve a lot of the performance issues we saw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can they push those out or do you have to bring yours in to get it up there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's designed to be pushed out and done over the internet.  That's very clever of them.  They're very smart of them, I think, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Patrick, when you talk about these movies that you've looked at that you say they did a crappy...  Are people standing up and moving around?  Did somebody in the audience get up?  Is that the kind of...  This is not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's kind of like you laugh, right?  You go to see...  Remember, you go to a movie in a theater and it's been out for five or six weeks  and occasionally you see some scuffs or some splices or a little scratch.  There's hair in the gate.  This is better than that, but it's still highly noticeable because you're looking at this, right?  You're looking at these movies and you're thinking, okay, what do we got here?  Terminator, not the priciest film stock used to shoot that,  but you're looking at some of the other Blu-ray titles that are available.  And you're sitting there and going, I'm trying to think of one I was watching where I was sitting there  going, wow, there's no the scratch, there's no the scratch, there's no the scuff, there's no the scratch.  Wait, you mean HD, right?  No, Blu-ray.  No, I'm talking about Blu-ray.  HD DVD stuff, one of the most amazing experiences I've ever had with home theater  was looking at Goodfellas in HD DVD on a 60-inch monitor.  I bet that looks good.  It looked amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, wait, one more, I need to interrupt one more time.  Now, what you're describing is kind of weird, it seems to me,  because I have seen these same movies, not all of them that I saw in that pile,  but I've seen that pile, but I've seen Terminator and some of these others,  and I have seen them on Mark Cuban's HD net,  and I've seen them on HBO and Hi-Def on a big projector,  and I've never seen these scratches.  Did they re-scan these old films?  I mean, why don't they just take, I mean, these have been digitized by somebody else before,  just baffling to me what you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Probably not a 1080p though.  They probably did have to redo it because they probably never did it at 1080p.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What else would they do it in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm wondering what they would have scanned at 720.  I don't know, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Doesn't make sense, the HBO's...  I don't know, first of all, I have no idea whether Cuban is doing his own scans for his network  or whether or not he's using...  A lot of people, anybody who can get a print can scan a video, right?  Not necessarily legally, but it seemed like I can totally see a situation  where somebody went, you know, grabbed five Sony films, ran them down to somebody,  had them scanned, and then encoded them really fast to make the delivery.  That's what I think it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they were rushed, and I'm sure they'll fix it in time.  That's an unbelievable story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What studio is going to put their name on crap?  You wonder, yeah, you wonder.  Well, Sony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Scandal.  Scandalous.  Well, I'd be mad if I bought a $1,000 Blu-ray player and all I saw was scratches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That scratched up old movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually wanted to ask Bill McCrone about the decision that Microsoft made not to ship  a standalone version of the WinFS file system with Vista.  Is that significant?  I mean, they took it out of Vista.  They promised it in Vista, took it out, but said, well, we'll ship it standalone later.  And then last week they announced, or it was hard to determine what they were trying to say,  but it sounded like they weren't going to ever do a standalone version of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're not going to do it.  And I've got to think that that is some hedge, yet another hedge against the open source  community.  There are so many things going on there, and the open source operating systems are gaining  so much power that I have to think that it's just another attempt to keep people locked  into Windows Server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  NTFS and Windows Server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In other words, if they shipped a new file system, and it's of course a data basing file  system with better search and so forth, if they did that, you're afraid, their fear is  that people would just ignore it and go to open source solutions?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or that the open source solutions would hook on to the new file system.  Samba and so forth would start.  Exactly.  And just run it.  I mean, we're seeing, well, AMD and Intel are involved in this kind of stuff too, because  they're both feeding the open source community and trying to keep it at arm's length in order  to maintain their relationship with Microsoft.  And they're doing an even better job than the politicians at DoubleSpeak trying to keep  both ends from meeting in the middle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Speaking of AMD and Intel, Intel is really making a push now to take back some of the  ground that's lost from AMD over the last couple of years in making announcements of  new chips, new Xeon chips and so forth, that they say will beat AMD.  Patrick, are you guys doing any testing?  Bill, anybody take a look at these?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been looking at the technology, and basically Intel's problem is they went off  on that branch prediction branch.  These really long pipelines.  Really, really long pipelines.  And they said, no, it's no problem because the cache is deep and if it flushes.  Well, code was never as pretty as Intel's engineers said it was going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That started with Prescott, which was just a bust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's an old problem that unfortunately took over the product line and really hurt Xeon  much more than the desktop, which surprises me because you would think that server code  would be more regular.  But I guess even HTTP services, the world throws so much crap at your server that you'd  better be able to switch horses really quickly to keep up with it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what is Intel doing?  Are they doing a RISC chip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they're basically emulating their own instruction set and shortening their pipeline  and doing everything they can to make the chip more facile and also give it more internal  speed and less dependence on the frontside bus.  I mean that was AMD's genius with the Octoron is that they basically said we've got hyper  transport, which they announced what?  Six years ago?  Took a while for Intel to catch up to that.  And I don't know that they've actually caught up.  I think that if you look at what Sun and Fabric 7 and some of these hot server companies are  doing with 8-way AMD servers, they're rocket ships.  They are really fast machines.  No Xeon can touch them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact Dell has announced that it's buying a bunch of AMD chips for its servers, which  is a big shift for Dell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that amazing?  We've all heard Michael Dell and all those people proclaim their undying loyalty to Intel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, we haven't seen, you know, I talked to the guy that runs that division.  He was in town a couple weeks ago, the Dell guy.  And I specifically asked him about this because we've always known that these guys are pretty  much, you know, they're wedded, Dell and Intel, although there's been a few industry hiccups  between the two of them because Dell has become such a big customer for Intel that Intel doesn't  like that because they don't like to have a customer telling them what to do.  And meanwhile, you know, Dell has been loyal and back and forth.  So I asked him specifically if they, if at the drop of a hat, Intel improved either their  chips or their deal, if they drop AMD like a lead balloon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not a loaded question or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I try to be blunt when I ask these questions.  You get a better answer that way.  And the answer, which was of course not a great answer, but it's kind of answered it  with the guy said specifically, he says, we'll always go with the best technology out there.  Never, of course, said yes or no to the question, but what he said to me was, and with the hints  out there that Intel's got some hot stuff coming, this whole thing may have been a big  bluff.  Even though, like Bill said, those eight-way machines are apparently just rocket ships.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe it just indicates a weakening in Intel's market power and Dell could finally safely  say, well, we're not tied to them anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dell's really gotten big in the last couple of years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been told by some people that are in the chip business that Intel, because Dell  was buying so many chips and they were getting such a good deal from Intel that Intel was  telling Dell, and this may or may not be true, but Intel was telling Dell that, you know,  we're only going to get you so many, you're going to have to go to the gray market to  get the rest of your requirements because we just can't provide that many chips.  And Intel in fact was shipping chips over to the gray market so they could get a few  more dollars from Dell because it was hurting their bottom line.  That's an old story.  It is an old story, but it's been a crop.  It's an old story.  I mean, that's what the chip companies do.  But this story cropped up recently around this Dell deal and then just within six months  after I heard that story, this announcement comes out about the AMD chips, which we still  really haven't seen.  So I think this is a political thing.  That's it.  That's my story.  I'm sticking to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't hurt anybody if it is just saber-rattling.  It helps AMD just by reputation.  They never sell a single chip to Dell.  And they're still sitting on top of the server world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So these new Xeons aren't enough, you think, to knock AMD off the perch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, because AMD's got their quad chips, if not quite ready to go.  They're pretty close.  They have a huge new plant that's cranking out all the 65 nanometer stuff that they can  make.  They're ready to up their speeds.  Well, actually, they don't want to go much faster in speed.  They're finding, especially with hyper transport, that they can just put more CPUs on the chip  and get more and more performance.  And more level to cache.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, my understanding is that there's a hot chip coming out from Intel that's a desktop  chip that's going to be a mind blower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You mean the Core Duo, the Core 2 Duo stuff that's coming out?  I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that essentially a four-way Core?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I think it's just a faster, plus gigahertz streamer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the Core 2 Duo is the update, the higher internal speed Core Duo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  800 bus and the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the consumer part, and they're releasing it this month, and they're releasing it from  the low end to the high end and not staggering the delivery, that a lot of the initial benchmarking  is putting it, in many cases, 30% faster than anything AMD's got.  And there's going to be cheap versions of it, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But how long is it?  I mean, AMD may have something up its sleeve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I don't think AMD has anything up its sleeve until the four by fours for the  consumers until the four by fours comes out later this month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or it's going to be later this year.  Surprisingly, they're doing a single core.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're doing a single core.  It can't be really used to the optimal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Surprisingly, they're doing a single core, Conroe, too, which I thought that the whole  single core stuff was just gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's still a lot of single execution thread games out there.  And that's where the original AMD 64 stole Intel Thunder.  And I think they need that chip for reputation as much as anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For gaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because the gamers drive so much, you know, upgrade every time there's something new.  Yeah.  So you can frag your buddies even faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, just remember, the internet is just a tube, my friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm hoping upon hope that these new faster chips in the competition between AMD  and Intel, no matter what the politics are, actually results in some new applications  coming out that can be useful to the average user.  Because right now, it's nice to have these screaming machines, especially if you're running  Photoshop.  But for the most part, I'd like to see some new uses.  I mean, we haven't had any really great new uses for these computers for a while.  You've been saying this for years, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where's the new killer app?  I'm like an old man.  Where's the new?  But you've been right.  Get off my lawn.  You've been right.  There really hasn't been a killer app in the way that, you know, Lotus123 was a killer  app or VisiCount in some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if that was a killer app.  It was just like the original app.  There was the original, the first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, the original app was VisiCalc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, you could also say home theater PCs is probably the last.  Maybe.  You know, home theater PCs, VoIP.  I mean, what are the other big things that have come out in the last couple of years?  Online video delivery.  True, true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, do you need faster chips for that?  I mean, one of the things where I see a performance increase is rendering DVDs.  And as people do more and more burning, you know, you can get pretty close to real time  on a really hot machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But John wants something new.  That's just video.  It's old now.  Where's the new compelling?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just a faster disk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe we need to develop a new sense, you know, something that kind of reads the gigahertz  directly or something and then these new machines can play right into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do know I'm running the Skype program on this fast AMD machine I have here.  I have a dual core.  It's a better job.  Sounds good.  It sounds a lot better than when I ran it on my old Northwood, which was, you know,  fast for its day.  But, you know, just so there's something about there is some processing going on that is  necessary.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Plus there's also the whole Vista performance tax.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, anytime there's a new operating system, you're always paying some overhead, some significant  amount of overhead.  But Vista is designed for dual core machines for all intents and purposes.  You really don't want to run that on a single core machine unless it's a rocket ship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And a gigabyte of RAM.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm running it on a, you know, like a AMD 2500 with, you know, 750 megabytes of RAM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I got to say, it's not a thrilling experience.  I bet not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you getting arrow and glass or do you have to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Arrow and glass is no problem.  That's really a lot of the functionality of glass.  You know, glass is really all about having a fast video card with a whole bunch of memory.  Hey, we got to wrap this up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bill, I'm so glad you could join us.  It was really great to have you.  My pleasure.  Yeah.  And we'll help you come back and join us again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, you know, his real name, in fact, when he came to Tech TV he was called Josh  and Joshua but because we had Brentano I said, we can't call you Josh.  Give me another name.  He said, well, when I was a kid they called me Yoshi.  So I said, okay, you're Yoshi now.  So I took the blame for it.  Yeah, he is Yoshi now.  He is, that's it.  And actually it was a good move.  I mean, that's much better than Josh.  Yeah, Josh is a good person.  Get him on, get him on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Brentano gets pissed when you call him Josh.  It's kind of funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
