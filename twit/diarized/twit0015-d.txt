Transcript:  This is TWIT, This Week in Tech, Episode 15, for July 26, 2005.  Now, Gizmo's working too. I mean, I'm able to talk to John, although I don't know how...  It's hard for us to tell how good the quality is because John's microphone is so lousy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think we ought to all pitch in on some headphones. I'd certainly go for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Get John a headset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where is he? Is he there? Hello, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think he wandered off.  I know we're still on because I hear the echo coming from him, but I don't...  I'm over here!

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, if you guys ever want to start the show, let me know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're starting. This is the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is why John doesn't use a headset. He uses speakers.  He doesn't want to hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, you need one of those ones that the DJs use where you wander around.  That's actually what we're using.  Me and Tom Lycus.  Yeah, Lycus uses that.  Weren't you like a regular on Lycus' show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I've been on his show, the old show, when he was in LA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He had to dump me. I said a bad word and he had to dump me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Those days are over. He probably want you to say bad words on his new show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now he's like a woman hater. What is he now? He just like hates women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He's got this new persona, which is hilarious because when he was doing his other show,  he was like this liberal, kind of beyond you liberal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He was touchy feely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now he's kind of a right wing woman hater. It's just like, obviously,  I mean, this guy's just whatever, wherever the money is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's pretty much the way he was. I can't really hold it against him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He always was. The only thing I didn't like about Tom Lycus is he always talked like a DJ.  Tom Lycus show. Does he still do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Not as much. Not to that extreme.  We call that a puker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I don't even know who this guy is because Robert Heron is the biggest fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He talks about it nonstop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Robert's a little bit of a misogynist.  A little bit.  Yeah. We could talk about him because he's not here.  That's cool.  He's in Cabo San Lucas. We should tell everybody he's in Cabo San Lucas.  Patrick is in Florida, Key West.  Oh, nice.  He's not in Baja.  Huh? No, he's not in Baja for the first time. He's in somewhere with water.  Kevin Rose is somewhere. Key West. Yeah. I don't know if it's exactly.  I know what you're thinking, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kevin Rose is stranded on the five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I know exactly what you're thinking.  What's next on the agenda? Fire Island?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was right. It was exactly what he was thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  For some reason, Google Earth has horrible resolution of Key West.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It'll take a while. Don't do it now while you're talking to me.  You'll kill your bandwidth, dude.  I'm not doing it now.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I just remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because they're not allowed to have any. What were you looking for? Beach pictures?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I was just looking for, I don't know. It's, you know, Google Earth.  Monumental waste of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's somewhere. He's having concavrita somewhere.  But meanwhile, let me introduce the panel because it's kind of an unusual panel today,  but I'm thrilled we've got them all. Roger Chang is in the studio with me.  That's cool. I'm considered unusual.  No, but it's unusual that you're sitting here. I haven't seen you in the flesh since January.  In the flesh? Yeah.  And he is, well, it's a little hot in the room.  John C. Dvorak via Gizmo. This is the first time we've used Gizmo.  I don't think we're going to blame Gizmo for the sound quality this time.  We're going to blame the Plantronics headset that John has had in the bottom of his closet.  He found it. But hey, we can hear you, John, and it works, and Skype never did.  That's good. Also with us, David Prager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Still waiting to be arrested for stealing the neighbor's Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are you still on somebody else's internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, it's a great signal, great bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And he's moving anyway, so why should he start up anew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Even after that guy got busted in Florida for this, you're still willing to take a chance, huh?  Yeah, but he's going to stay without me and without a Bush.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  A few million others, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And well, I'll tell you who's unusual because everybody else has been here before,  but we've never had this fella, and I'm really pleased to have him.  Steve Gibson is joining us. The man behind Shields Up, grc.com spinwright,  former InfoWorld columnist, and just an all-around great guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And John and I did the column side by side for years and years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's really where John, where I first heard of John, was the back of InfoWorld.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Inside Track, was that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Was it inside track, a classic?  Yep.  What a great column. Both of your columns I used to read religiously back when I was just a...  Kid.  Little kid. No. Let us get to the news of the week.  Oh, I got one.  Yes, sir. Mr. Roger Chang, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Rockstar. Rockstar's game.  Hot Coffee?  No, San Andreas.  Yeah, but the Hot Coffee mod, that's what it is.  Yes, yes, yes.  So that was kind of big because I actually heard about that through an insider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You didn't listen to our show last week, did you?  No, because I was in San Diego at the time.  So we talked a little bit about it, but there is news, which is that Rockstar,  the ESRB renamed or said it's now Mature Only, MO instead of AO.  And they pulled the games off the show?  And...  We pounded the topic.  Well, but here's the deal. It's going to cost Rockstar $50 million,  they estimate in the next quarter because it's an adults only title.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they'll lose that much sales?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They say they'll lose 50 because they have to pull...  Many stores won't sell it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But then you just got to wonder, were they disingenuous?  They hoped that people would find it and not expect...  They didn't expect a rating change. What happened?  I mean, it seems to me that surely they didn't expect this outcome.  Other big story, and I think it's huge.  Ladies and gentlemen, clear, confident, connected.  Bring clarity to your world.  No, I'm not talking about Twitter 15. I'm talking about the new Windows Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hostile Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's...  By the way, I heard they made a last minute change.  It's going to be called Hostile Windows Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Baby.  Aren't they being sued already by...  Somebody told me that they were being sued already.  I don't know who...  The name?  Yeah.  Well, there's a number of Vistas in the computer biz.  There's Vista Print.  There's Vista...

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  They should have just went with something like...  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Are they going to call it...  Windows 9?  Is it going to say Windows Vista on the box?  That's just another code name?  No, that's the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It doesn't sound like anything.  It's now the official renaming of Longhorn.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Windows Vista.  Vista.  It actually sounds like a desktop app.  It's an RSS...  It's probably what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And what's funny, as with everything, a few years from now,  we'll be talking about it like it's just been called Vista forever.  Right.  Well, remember we called...  Just like XP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We were calling 95 Chicago until they came out with 95.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So how long ago did development begin on Longhorn,  aka Vista now, about four years ago or so?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Five, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact, it was supposed to have an object-oriented file system.  Oh, yeah.  That was like a decade ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  WinFS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  RIP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then remember we heard it was going to be some 3D thing,  so a completely different UI where it was like totally immersive 3D.  That all went away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, they still have that technology is built in.  I mean, I've seen videos.  But I don't know how important that's going to be.  If that's going to be the user interface or just the capability will be...  What do they call that?  Some other lame code name.  How about this?  Microsoft came out on Thursday.  The US Patent and Trade Office says that Microsoft's trying to patent the smiley face.  Oh, geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I thought they belonged to AOL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No.  Here's the patent.  It covers, quote, selecting pixels to create an emoticon image...  Oh, tell us you're kidding, Leo.  Assigning a character sequence to these pixels and reconstructing the emoticon after transmission.  That's exactly what Mark Taylor from the Open Source Consortium said.  This sounds like the kind of prank patent you might see some immature kid put up on Slashdot.  But it's not.  It's real.  Yeah, it's not going to fly.  I don't know.  You trust the PTO to get this right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It doesn't make any difference.  Just get the last minutes and...  It's just goofy.  Is it a land...?  I think somebody's going to roll over somebody's eyes at Microsoft if they think, you know...  I mean, this is just going to leave the company open to ridicule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, let's ridicule them.  They're doing all right.  Profit's up 37% this quarter on strong PC sales.  But that kind of looks weak compared to Google.  Do you see what Google's profits were?  400% jump.  Geez.  Wow.  From last year this time, they earned $342 million in three months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  What's the bulk of their...  What are they doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's the stock valuation doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  John, you had a new target price?  Yeah, $500.  It's going to make it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't...  Everyone laughs at me when I say it.  There's no evidence that it's going to stop going up.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought your discussion last week about the notion that Microsoft was sort of stalling out.  I think Microsoft's dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The other thing is once the Mac OS comes over to the side, the x86 side, which is going to do  and become just a dominant operating system, I think Microsoft's got nothing but problems.  I think the whole world's going to be divided up.  Microsoft doing apps through Office Suite.  The operating system's going to be the Mac operating system.  And then Linux is going to be the server operating system.  And they're just going to have to live with it.  And where does Google fit in all this?  I think Google's going to be like the probably an app company.  They're going to be the search engine company, at least for now.  Isn't that the killer app though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, that's the app, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but I don't see them moving.  They're not going to do anything about the server software.  They're not going to do anything about the office software.  And they're not going to do an operating system even though they have GoogleOS.com registered.  I don't think they're really going to manage it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This week, a lot of privacy advocates brought up the issue that Google's database contains  now so much information about all of us that they present the biggest privacy threat of all.  Yeah, I think so too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and remember when they were, what was the short-lived thing Google did a couple  months ago where they were proxying all of our, you know, anyone who did it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, the Google cache.  Yeah, the Google cache.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you know, it was beginning to screw things up and people were finding themselves logged in  as other people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, so I mean, a single misstep.  Fortunately, they pulled that off within 24 hours.  But they have so much power, a misstep on their side could really have some impact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know, with the reputation that Apple has so carefully built for the Mac over the years.  I mean, if in fact it was ever possible, as John suggests, to buy, you know, Mac OS something,  I mean, at retail, it fries in a box and it ran on standard PC hardware.  I mean, who especially now with all the multi boot stuff we have, I mean, who wouldn't get one to  screw around with it and, you know, end up maybe migrating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But is Apple ever going to let that happen, Steve?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, on one hand, you say, okay, they're a hardware seller.  And so they don't want to, you know, offering their premium OS on Intel platform,  sees would clearly destroy their hardware.  But, you know, look at the price pressure they must be under in order to sell this stuff  against the commodity PC market.  And, you know, Jobs has got to look around and see who the richest man in the world is.  And that, you know, he's in the software business, not in the hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, what do you say to that?  It's true that Microsoft looks a lot healthier being in the not worrying about the slim  margins in the PC world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, and you've got to know too, that the idea of the Mac OS hosted on the standard  commodity PC platform has to be keeping Bill Gates up at night.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And how does he stop it?  And how does he stop it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I mean, you know, one of the constraints for especially for even with Apple's discount for  a lot of educational institutions and students in getting Apple hardware is always just spend  the price.  Well, you know, I know more than a dozen people.  I can only afford a PC because I'm right.  Now, if you can get a Mac for the price of, you know,  Wouldn't you prefer one?  Yeah.  I mean, most people would actually migrate because it's for the reason that Apple decided

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  to introduce the darn Mac mini is because they wanted the people that said they couldn't  afford it to all of a sudden be able to afford it.  And I don't know if they're selling as many as they wanted to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I think that's that's all well and true.  But I think the other aspect which keeps being overlooked here, which is the fact that I  think Apple in a market where everybody was using the Mac OS and the PC was getting the  Mac OS on at the cheap piece that Apple could sell their machine still in the same market  at a premium because I think people have been buying the Mac many times because it just  looks a lot better.  It's a lot cooler machine.  I really think that they could be a true option for these guys if they think gravitates.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Who wants a beige box when you can have a slick, you know, stainless steel, you know,  glowing machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If it's only a couple hundred bucks more.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Apple, according to ThinkSecret, Apple has announcements this week, a number of announcements  this week.  Some of them aren't that interesting.  They'll probably do low priced Mac minis, low priced iBooks.  Obviously, they've got to clear out their stock of G4 based products before they introduce  any Intel products.  It would be too soon for them to announce an Intel product this week, wouldn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah, because they've just now talked  about, you know, getting IBM to make what the power PC or no, I mean, sorry, Intel to  to do like a custom Intel core processor that their OS is going to run off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, you're not you think they're not going to use it as a stock Intel Pentium D?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the dialogue has been that it's not going to be a stock Pentium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I haven't heard this.  This is interesting.  Have you heard anything like that, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, and I don't believe it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You think they'll use stock Pentium?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't think Intel can afford to make a special part for these guys.  I just don't think it's it's it's cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's certainly I mean, Intel's chief interest at this point would be in selling  their stock parts, right?  That's just one more big customer.  What a good customer for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When you asked what what Microsoft would do, you know, my first thought is that maybe for  the first time we would see Gates on lumber or on limber rather some of their vast arsenal  of patents because they've got patents on some of the most amazing core technology  that almost any OS has to use and that everybody's in violation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, but you don't want to open that can of worms because then you go back to court and  Apple countersues over the trash can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I mean, it's then you know, there's also you have to I did some research on this  couple of years ago and Apple's got a ton of those kinds of patents to everybody does.  It's an arms race.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, IBM.  Yeah.  And SCO is going to find some reason to sue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I think right now we're in detente.  I mean, it's it's it's literally it's mutually assured destruction.  Nobody wants to be the first because it you're right.  It's a can of worms.  And it's you know, that's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It's a deterrent.  You know, you keep it around and just say, you know, hey, I might.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I have to say there nothing would put a bigger smile on my face than than Apple  doing a Mac OS that ran on a PC platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, today on the radio show, I was about to tear my hair out.  I'm looking at the board.  Every single call was Windows XP is broken.  I got the blue screen at that.  I got a virus.  I got spyware.  I'm looking for anywhere.  I'm looking for light that some interesting call.  I spent three hours talking about how to fix windows.  I can't imagine a worse radio show.  I'm you know, my Microsoft's killing my business here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and also remember now that remember when they when they first started talking  years ago about charging for tech support, how to how counterintuitive it sounded that  they would be charging people to fix the problems that, you know, they have in their system.  Now they're moving into anti virus and anti spyware again to to I mean, subscription based  to to sell to sell people subscriptions to fix problems that, you know, they haven't  addressed for years in their OS because now it's widespread enough that it just sort of,  oh, it's not our it's not our responsibility is not our fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a protection racket.  It's Vinnie Bomba.  He comes in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He says, you know, you could have a fire in your restaurant.  If you give me some money, I'll keep it from happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So wrong.  It is wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It really is.  It's so shit.  I mean, if you think if you did a parallel with the car industry and, you know, Ford  says, well, you know, yeah, the tires blow up, but you pay us the insurance money.  You won't make sure it won't happen.  I mean, come on.  It's protected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, just Wells Fargo last week made a similar announcement.  They said that if you pay extra, they'll do something about the fact that your identity  with Wells Fargo solved these guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, that's that's chutzpah.  That's that's the definition of chutzpah, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I have a very good friend of mine who's a computer illiterate realtor and she's wonderful.  She just wants to be able to surf the web and do eBay.  And now she she had to do her multiple listings now through the through the net.  She couldn't use what she used to call her modem any longer.  And and someone came over to her house the other day and was complaining that she was  running Windows 98.  Well, I mean, she's got a computer that I set her up with and and I tend it and keep  it running and it does everything she needs.  And she would she called me and said, Steve, you know, do I need something called XP?  And I said, no, Judy.  I said, the reason you've never had a virus and have no problem with spyware is that nothing  can infect your machine anymore because it's so old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the solution, the solution now is to have a computer so old that hackers have no interest  in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly.  Exactly.  It's sort of like having a Mac.  It's got a low enough install base that no one targets it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is that really the secret of the Mac success?  Is it just too small to be worried for anybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, I think it's that most of your typical script kiddies have windows,  expensive windows boxes.  And so so they attack what they own.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So Bill Gates got yelled at for making a quote, which I think he should have gotten yelled  at.  It was funny, but I think he still kind of had a point when he was saying our operating  system is more secure because more people hack it.  Yeah, he said that, didn't he?  I understand where he was going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It didn't sound good, though.  Yeah, it came out really bad.  It's a very bad sound bite.  So the other big Apple announcement, or I guess it's Apple related announcement, is  that everybody's expecting that tomorrow, Motorola will finally show its iTunes capable  phone.  Do we care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I mean, you know, I used to think that'd be great to have every piece of electronic  gadget, a PDA cell phone, MP3, all stuck in one.  And then it occurred to me at one point when I had my cell phone in my DJ MP3 player,  my DJ ran out of juice, but I still had in my phone.  And in those instances in emergency, I'd still rather have my phone working just for  that emergency.  So what if I can't listen to music, if I can't call someone when my car breaks and  I'm really kind of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't want to be the kind of guy that's got 18 devices hanging off my belt and has  a big butt crack as a result.  But at the same time, I think you're right.  I don't think that to put it all in one device, maybe not necessarily the way to go.  MP3 player should be an MP3 player, not a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  At minimum two devices.  And then you're set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How about not carrying around a bunch of garbage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I don't want a Scott Evest because I don't want to put crap in my pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like my Scott Evest.  I'm a nerd.  What can I say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What do you carry, Dvorak?  Do you have anything at all that you carry?  All I carry is a small pocket camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's it.  You don't even carry a cell phone?  Fairly.  I do.  I think I'm going to be driving around for a while, put a cell phone in the car.  Usually keep the glove box.  I don't carry a cell phone with me.  I don't want to be bothered all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is from a guy who only recently...  Maybe you still don't.  Do you have an answering machine?  Absolutely not.  Yeah, that's what I thought.  You call him, it rings.  And rings.  And rings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let me tell you my rationale for that.  I found out over the years that people get more angry with you if you fail to call them  back if they leave a message than if they can't get a hold of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's a good point.  Maybe I should get rid of my email address.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How do you handle that, John?  You must get tons of email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I get lots of email, but I got a great system.  Computer Time, Mark Pichel does a great job of keeping spam out so I get zero spam.  And the rest of it, you know, I just go through.  I figure it's going to cost me an hour a day to go through my email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've read these statistics before.  I don't think I've ever mentioned this group, though.  I have a spam service also called MailRoute that's a commercial service.  I get I'm real close now to getting a million messages a month of which 98 percent are spam.  I get eight, almost 900,000 spams a month.  And that's to all of the Leoville addresses, including spurious addresses like Leo's hair  at leoville.com, which gets a good amount of mail.  You actually have that?  No.  Oh.  Did your hair ever write back?  Never wrote back.  I never hear from my hair.  But I mean.  It's because you're wearing a tupac.  You got to have good spam filtering, clearly.  What I've started doing, I don't know if this is going to work.  In fact, it's not working yet.  But what I have what I do now is I go through my I do a triage thing, right?  So I get several hundred mail real mail messages a day and I flat I have a press the flag button.  OK, I look at a message.  If I need to answer, I press the flag button and the rest of my ignore.  The problem is now I have this massive folder with flagged mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that's not a solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I only I actually do a filter where if my name doesn't appear anywhere in the message,  I it just gets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you mean if I send you a message and I don't say Roger in it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  No, if it's at work, I get I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a lot of garbage at work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, there's a lot of garbage because they route all the group email through us as well.  So if none of the messages actually has my name in it,  then it just gets filtered into a standard and it's full.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I suggested something to Mark Thompson a couple of years ago that he adopted immediately  and that we've just recently done with our main sales and support accounts at GRC.  And that is to just append the current year after your name.  So he's Mark 2005 at analog X dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it changes every year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And the beauty of it is that if he if he doesn't set up a new account or if somebody  has his old address in their email address book and a little ways into 2006, the mail bounces back.  When you look at the address, you go, oh, it's 2006 now.  And you're able to sort of guess what the problem probably is.  He says that by the end he's done this now for a couple of years and there there's enough of a  latency and a delay in the migration of of email into major spam lists that he only gets a few  every so often by the end of a year cycle.  And of course, he loses them all when he starts the next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And if you send a message to Mark, you'll know just to always put the current year at the end  of it and that way you'll know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And if you don't, it bounces back and you get the reply to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Exactly. Speaking of analog X from Mark Thompson, has anyone used his new BitTorrent client  that he released?  No.  No.  He has a new BitTorrent client.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'll have to check it out. I knew he was writing one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's not quite released.  It says it's a beta release.  Download the installer here.  It says on his website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mark took off for a little three day Canadian fishing trip on on Thursday and announced in our  in one of our newsgroups because our groups have helped him in the past to pound on his stuff.  And he's calling it beta, but the UI is all finished and it's got a lot of nice features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'd love to migrate to it.  I'm using BlogTorrent right now for the tweet and it's it's okay, but it's not great.  I think Mark would probably do a better job.  Did he ever do the spam fighter that he was going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm the only one in the world still using it.  He was very early on the Bayesian bandwagon, but a bunch of other ones came out and he just  ended up not pushing any further.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm on the Bayesian bandwagon, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Boy, that bandwagon sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, speaking of, you know we have a new slogan now for the show.  What's the slogan?  Thanks to the New York Times.  This week in tech, combining a mind-numbing commitment to tech news.  With surprisingly valuable information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, I read that article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wow, I'm going to be baffling with that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is from Virginia Heffernan who wrote about podcasts in the New York Times on Wednesday.  Or I guess it was Thursday.  And she says the tech, I'm quoting her, the tech podcasts, including prominent ones like  Dignation and This Week in Tech, are especially prone to self-promotion.  Dvorak told me not to do that, so I'm not doing that anymore.  And though annoying for listeners, it evidently pays.  Both show up on iTunes' list of top subscribed podcasts.  The two podcasts compensate for the displays of self-love.  Have we displayed any self-love lately?  Oh, jeez.  I love you, Roger.  I love you.  The two compensate for the displays of self-love and their mind-numbing commitment to tech news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  She pulled out the thesaurus for that one.  It's got to be one or the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We can't be self-love and self-love, by the way.  I know.  You know what that's supposed to mean.  Yeah, we're owning this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She also called, she actually had, there was a retraction in the article because she called  another podcaster an addict.  But that's, and he wasn't.  But, and it's the two podcasts compensate for the displays of self-love and their mind-numbing  commitment to tech news was surprisingly valuable information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I just find it mind-numbing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love it.  I don't care.  Hey, we're at least we're in the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it's a great slogan.  It's our new slogan.  Mind-numbing?  Combining?  No, no, listen, this rolls off the tongue.  Just keep that mind-numbing.  Well, that's the short version.  If you go to the Twitcom, Twit.  What is our website?  If you go to Twit.tv or ThisWeekInTech.com, you'll see it right at the top.  Combining a mind-numbing commitment to tech news was surprisingly valuable information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't you think that's good?  So Twit.com was taken?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, it was.  I don't know who has it.  I think it's a Welsh theater group, as a matter of fact, a Welsh improv theater group.  I'll have to check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Why did you put valuable information since 1998?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's just when tech TV started.  I could have said it.  ZDTV.  DeVorek and I have been doing it since, well, DeVorek and I started in 1998.  May of 1998.  No, I think it's corny.  I think so.  All right.  I listen to John.  He's the one who said stop with the self-love already.  You know, he's proven it.  He's making a mess.  Get out of the kitchen.  Okay.  That's not what he meant.  No, you're making a mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  There needs to be more women on this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, we tried it and everybody complained.  Oh, they did?  We had Jessica on.  I remember.  I love Jessica, but I got so much hate mail, I just decided that's it.  No more women.  Maybe it wasn't women in general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You're turning into a Tom Likus.  I hate women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Women are a real problem with my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let me tell you.  So, but I will get Megan on sometime soon.  We got to get Megan on because that's a woman.  She's a woman.  Once in a while.  There's our new slogan.  One woman at a time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A woman once in a while is okay.  Combining a mind-numbing commitment to tech.  You're so lucky you're in the Bay Area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, this is heard around the world, don't you know?  We have an international audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  But people that listen that can actually, you know, come up and do something.  And beat me up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Global embarrassment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There you go.  Is global embarrassment worse than local embarrassment?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  Embarrassment is one of those things that's local, not global.  Don't you think?  I mean, it doesn't, you know, you don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Think local, be embarrassed globally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that's our new slogan.  That was another thing.  They said don't talk politics.  So we won't.  All right.  Or religion.  Or religion.  Mom was right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, then what do you get in the radio show then?  Nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Politics is a complaint to Windows XP, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, we have to stay with technology.  All right.  Let me, I'll tell you what.  One thing we do have is lots of questions for our, from our listeners.  And I could just play a few of those if you'd like.  Sure.  Sure.  You want to, you want to have these?  These are all vetted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  These don't have any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I haven't listened to them at all.  This is, this is called just playing it off the laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Hello, Twit.  Hello.  Cody from Tisdale, Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Hello, Cody.  I was wondering what you guys thought of the new Windows Vista out Longhorn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think we already talked about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Actually, you know, it kind of reminds me of the old Plymouth Horizon.  It does sound like a car, doesn't it?  The Vista?  Yeah.  A bad car.  Yeah, the Plymouth Horizon.  Like a K car.  Because it was a, yeah, it was.  It was a piece of junk.  Yeah.  Sounds like a K car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Hi, this is Brian in Austin, Texas.  You guys do a great job and I'm glad that you guys are all back together and doing the podcast.  And my question pertains to spyware programs.  I run Spyware Blaster and I'm wondering if I download and install the Microsoft anti-spyware  program, are those two going to conflict?  I know a lot of times you recommend having more than one anti-spyware program.  However, these particular programs seem to do, you know, similar memory resident things.  And I was wondering if they'd have problems knocking heads with each other.  So anyway, thanks for all the good information and you guys are doing a great job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, that's a great question and I'd like to direct it to Steve because  you're the spyware king, the guy who coined the term spyware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, actually, I don't have an answer because I guess I'm a little freaked out by memory  resident spyware testers.  I like Spybot Search and Destroy and of course Adaware and now Microsoft Solution.  And so, you know, I recommend people use all three if they're, you know, real anal about  making sure their system has no spyware in it.  But I just like to scan periodically rather than have something there all the time,  messing around with my system.  I just, you know, the more stuff you've got in there, the more opportunity for trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I would agree with you, except, and I hate to disagree with you over spyware,  your core competence here.  But the only issue I see is that spyware programs no longer are any good at removing spyware.  So by the time you're scanning for it, it's too late.  It's not like an anti-virus.  The only value at this point the spyware programs have is in blocking infection,  not in detecting and removing infection.  So that for that reason alone, I think that you almost don't you have to go memory resident?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And hopefully, and hopefully catch something while it's...  Yeah, before it gets there.  ...detected before...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what Spyware Blaster, that's the one that modifies Internet Explorer,  so it's a little safer.  Right.  You use Internet Explorer still, Steve?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I use IE, but I don't use any spyware scanners or anti-spyware or anti-virus or anti-anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, how do you not get infected?  Because he's vigilant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm really careful.  Actually, I've got IE locked down, and so that it's, you know, it won't do much.  And then when I go to a site that I decide I really want to use,  I add it to my trust and zones list.  And so I'm just very careful.  Yeah, so as you said, I'm just very vigilant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you only see the sites that you know are safe.  You can't go to a site that's not safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I go to a site, like for example, if I'm doing some e-commerce,  and I notice that I select a state that I'm in and the zip code doesn't self-populate,  you know, sometimes they have some JavaScript there that you do want to actually have running.  So I go, okay, I'll trust that site.  And I add it to my trust and sites list, and then it becomes fully functional.  But I don't surf around the internet, you know, going, you know,  sort of blindly clicking on links with IE in its normal condition,  because it's really just not safe enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  John, what do you do to protect yourself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I use Previx.  Yeah, I'm at a moment here where I'm getting a mediocre connection.  I use Previx along with about three of these other spyware scanners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Previx sounds like a male enhancement drug.  What is Previx?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  P-R-E-V-X.  Where did that question come from?  Huh?  I can't hear John at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's essentially a memory monitor.  It looks for anybody that tries to do weird installations out of the blue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  Have you ever heard of that, Steve?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm only hearing your audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, you're not hearing John?  Okay, John says he uses a male enhancement drug called Previx.  Can you hear him now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that M-A-L-E enhancement?  Yeah.  M-A-I-L.  Yeah.  Male M-A-I-L.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now I hear John loud and clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sorry.  I had to pot him out for you.  Huh, I never heard of Previx, but you like it, John.  It sounds like an IDS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It catches somebody that...  It catches systems that try to sneak and install on you.  It just basically monitors the registry and if it sees something weird going on.  And it sees any time it's trying to do an install at all and it tells you,  hey, guess what's going on?  And it pops up and it says this program in the Tampa file is trying to install something.  You really want that to happen.  Well, that actually makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's basically an ID, an intrusion detection system, though.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm sorry I missed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, it's all right.  You didn't miss anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's go on.  Hey, guys.  This is Caleb Allen in Merced, California.  And I'm basically looking to get started on a side of my own.  And I'm just kind of playing around with it, learning from the whole experience.  And I'm trying to get an RSS feed going.  Now, I don't necessarily know how to do it.  And I've been checking on the internet and trying to figure it out.  But nobody seems to give you any practical links on how to get it done.  So I was wondering if you guys had any ideas or any places to check out.  By the way, love the show.  And guys, keep it going.  It's a call for Chris Perillo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Does anybody do their own RSS?  I mean, every blog has its own RSS feed.  I have to say I've learned to encode my own XML RSS feeds for  iTunes purposes.  I do hand encode all our feeds.  How long does that take?  Oh, it's a pain.  But I found actually a really good program called Feeder.  I'll put a link in the show notes for this because it's a wonderful program.  It's for encoding RSS feeds.  So you can hand encode them.  It doesn't understand iTunes yet.  It's going to do that next month.  And that will save me an immense amount of time.  But right now, so I can't use it yet.  But right now, what I do is, you know, XML is not that hard to.  It's like HTML.  It's not so different.  You just need the patience.  You just need the patience.  There's a wonderful book.  I have it here somewhere on writing RSS.  PayPal hacks.  PayPal hacks is good too.  Yeah, that's you know, it's amazing.  O'Reilly does books on everything.  They have a book on hacking PayPal.  Who'd have thought?

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Hey guys, this is Tyler, Sean, and Paul from Los Osos, California.  We were just wondering,

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  whatever happened to Patrick's box of crap?  You guys haven't mentioned it for a while and I thought you were going to give it away as a prize  or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Mmm, cocoa butter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Anyway, so yeah, we like the show a lot.  Yeah, it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  All right, I guess we'll hear from you guys later.  See you, Chris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's three guys who need their own podcast, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, maybe you should address Patrick's pile of crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it's maybe being moved to his new home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, we have it.  And the real problem is that I have to go through all of these name submissions  and I'm not getting any help from anybody.  So as soon as...  I'll help you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You want to look at them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I pretty much know who our winners are.  It's just, you know, I'm just jammed.  It's sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'll get on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Recording conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Who did that?  Was that Gizmo?  Was that you, John?  What was that noise?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Actually, that wasn't me.  I'm recording this, if you can hear me, because the connection's gotten so crappy that now when you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, wait a minute.  What's that noise?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think he can blame us for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was a nice way file, though.  Recording conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that came across clear.  So we really know what the problem is.  It's not Gizmo.  It's John DeVorek's boomy voice.  It's his crappy microphone that he pulled out of the closet.  You know, I'm going to hang up on him.  That sound is not good.  I don't know.  As he fades away into the eighth dimension.  Yeah, that was not a good sound.  Let's hear some more questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  This is David calling from London, Ontario.  Calling from on my cell phone.  So this is going to be quite an expensive call.  So I think I'll monopolize my time and ask two questions.  The first one is I hear you guys keep on talking about backup software.  And I was wondering about a software that not only backs up my data,  but actually does an image file and would be network friendly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thanks for the call.  So I'm just going to pause it there because we don't have time for like he does.  There's another absolute favorite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What do you use?  Imaging software.  From a German guy.  It's called Drive Snapshot.  And what I like about it so much is it's both a Windows and a DOS app.  But from the Windows side, it does the whole job from within Windows.  There's a way that you're able to sort of snapshot an active file system.  I mean, so you can make an image of your running machine,  the main partition while it's running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, nice.  Supposedly a Chronos True Image does that too.  Although I haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Ever since Ghost got picked up Symantec, I've been looking for another.  Is this a German company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Drive Snapshot, which by the way means the same thing in English and German.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And what's really cool is that his file is then mountable.  So you can mount it as a drive and browse it just like you would anything else,  extract files from it and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Do you mount that image within the application itself or is it just like a...  Well, it must be some software stub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good question.  I don't know whether he associates the...  He has .sna for snapshot file extension.  But so it'll make an image of a running system.  I imaged our main GRC server that I recently set up in 45 seconds.  Wow.  So it's really fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How big, how many gigs was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the server is like 1.7 gig.  That's great.  That's got to be at full speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Does it also support SATI too?  Because I know one issue with Ghost before the update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no, see, that's the beauty.  Since it's running in Windows...  Anything Windows supports, yeah.  I mean, yeah, you could image any drive that Windows sees.  In the snapshot, it also records the partition table so that in order to restore it,  say that your system completely crapped out on you.  So you just boot DOS and manage to get this image visible to DOS somehow.  If it's on another hard drive, that's done easily.  You may have to install, stick it on a USB thumb drive or something in order for DOS  to be able to see it.  But then if you stuck in a new drive, it would say,  ah, you don't have a partition table.  I'll reestablish the same partition table that you had and then put the image back for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So you don't even need to prep the drive before you just image it?  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How much is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like 39 bucks or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Drive snapshot.  I have to remember that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Drive snapshot dot D-E slash E-N.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is really a nice piece of work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And I'm trying to see how much it costs and it looks like it's free,  but I don't want to say that.  No, I'm sure it's not, but it's not very expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, there's your Virginia Heffernan honorary valuable,  surprisingly valuable piece of information for the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  Hey, this is Zach from San Bernardino, California.  Man, I totally love the show.  I've been watching it since when you guys were on tech TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We've got to make some video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  I just recently found out about your podcast and I just want to say that I fully love the podcast.  And I was just wondering if you guys would give me your opinions on your  or just your opinions on G4 Tech TV.  Did that too.  Please criticize it a lot because I totally hate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You know, I have a I'll put this in if you don't mind.  I was at the Comic Con last weekend.  The Comic Convention.  In San Diego, the biggest one on the West Coast.  And I was there shooting something.  I had my old tech TV crew shirt.  Lots of sweaty guys there and vulcaneers.  Actually, no, no, the big thing is Star Wars.  Either a Jedi stormtrooper, Wookie, you know, one of the.  Oh, goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Nothing like being a guy, a heavy set guy in a Wookie suit in a 98 degree day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Hey, that was a pretty good looking Wookie suit.  Anyways, I was I was basically standing with my editor and we were talking to this guy  that we're going to interview.  This girl comes up with a phone cell phone on her and she watched it.  It's like, do you know Tommy, Tommy Tallarico?  And Tommy Tallarico is one of the guys who does that.  Guy in G4.  That's like, oh, no, I don't think I've ever met him.  And she said the rudest thing to me.  She said, maybe there's a reason why.  And she did this entire conversation without getting off the phone.  And it's like at that point, it's like, is this what she talking to Tommy Tallarico?  I don't know.  But she was one of those people that talks to you by not looking at you.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you meet a lot of them at the Comic Cons.  No, she was all staring at a point over your left shoulder.  No, no.  I mean, like literally, she wasn't even facing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  No, she was like, she was like talking on her phone.  She was like, was she angry about Tommy Tallarico?  Tony, I don't know.  I guess judged by by her comment, I assume that somehow I was not worthy  enough to actually meet him at some point.  And there she worked for G4.  Oh, my goodness.  I don't know.  But if that's the type of what's the point of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm trying to figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  No, my thing is, is this is if this is the type of people that come to Comic Con.  No, they get love.  She said that love G4.  Then we don't want to know them.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Hi, my name is.  And I got a question.  I got a couple of Kivos and a Mac running OS 10 for and I'm trying to extract the video from  Kivo because my girlfriend's sister's going to be on the TV show and I want to get it on TV.  So if you guys know the way of doing that, it'd be really cool.  I'm not too care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How long is this show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I don't care too much.  We're hacking into it.  It's up to you, isn't it?  I'll tell you.  I have to.  All right.  Thank you.  I appreciate your show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're the king of this, aren't you, Steve Gibson?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've got all this stuff nailed.  The bad news is the Tivo records in a format which is very nonstandard.  Although it's possible to extract the MPEG-2 files and put them together using something called  TyTool.  If you just Google TyTool and maybe Tivo together, you'll find it.  That's the best tool for doing this.  And then there are ways to change the default configuration of the Tivo so that the files it  does record and then are then subsequently extracted are much more standardized instead  of the strange resolution.  Well, it's also encrypted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You do have to do that at least because it's encrypted.  You can't use it unless you turn off the encryption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But the real, the right answer to this is not to try to do a pure digital extraction,  but just to play the Tivo back into any video capture technology.  Get the analog.  Exactly.  That stuff has come way down in price.  I use the Pinnacle card, which is a very nice board that captures to digital video.  But there are many, you know, little USB dongle-y kind of things now that'll just suck the video in  and stick it on your hard drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I still think that the Pinnacle's Studio is the best video editing software,  at least on the PC platform.  You still like that, huh?  I really do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm an Adobe Premiere Elements guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Have you used Premiere a lot, Steve?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No.  Premiere Elements, Steve.  Because that's what I hear everyone say about Premiere.  I was curious to see.  I got a copy right up there.  I'm going to send it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Premiere, no, Premiere Pro.  You know, ever since I started using Premiere Pro.  Premiere Pro's $800, though, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Elements is $79.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Adobe's tool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I did look at Premiere when I was choosing this.  And for what I want to do, I mean, I'm not doing fancy video editing.  I want to suck out a TV show and remove the commercials quickly.  And for doing that, Pinnacle Studio-  That's true.  Rocks.  It's very straightforward.  How much does it cost?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's cheap.  Does it come with the hardware?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It comes with the hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Because Windows desperately needs to have an iMovie.  And maybe that's the iMovie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It is the closest thing to iMovie on Windows.  It's pretty buggy.  I mean, it's been fairly unstable.  You've got it so it doesn't crash on you all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I stayed back on 7 because they started to destroy it with 8 and 9.  Or just horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You didn't mention that.  OK.  So 7, if you can find it, use it.  7's good.  I agree with you.  But the current version 9 is crash-sibbing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's all UI nonsense.  Because this is what we see so often.  Everybody does this now.  7 was a perfect product.  And in the same way, the Windows 98 second edition was a perfect product.  And then they ruined it with Millennium Edition.  I'll give you a better example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Nero.  Nero is great.  And talk about trashing a wonderful program by just putting in gooey sugar.  There's no reason to put that in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Although, when my dad uses it, I tell him to use it because it's simple.  Well, it's better than Roxy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, Roxy was even worse if you're going to talk about sugar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I don't even like the latest version of toast that they have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  With Pinnacle Studio, you take a video clip.  You basically chop it into segments somewhere during the commercials.  And then you just trim the ends of each one and put it together.  And in no time, you're able to reduce 60 minutes down to 40 by getting rid of the one  third commercials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Steve's given me some, actually, I have to say some great homebrew DVDs of shows that you love.  And they look, is that how you do them?  Because they look fine.  They look great.  They're very high quality.  American Dreams, I loved that show.  And I really appreciate your, I guess lending them would be the right directing you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm promoting you to watch the show.  No, it's actually legal to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The Home Taping Act allows you to do kind of personal copies for that kind of purpose.  I don't know if it applies.  The problem is nobody explicitly said it applies to digital media.  But for a while, the Home Recording Act lets you do things like that on tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I do all my labeling with crayons, so that's non-digital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Hey guys, Justin Teague here in Houston, Texas.  I love the show.  I've been a big fan ever since the early days there on Tech TV.  Just really mourned the loss of that.  Got a quick question.  I'm helping out a church here in Houston.  We've got a new property about a mile away from the school we're meeting at.  And the past must do a live feed from that location.  I mean, there's buildings and stores and stuff in between that mile there.  They're really set on it.  So I was wondering, maybe I can set up a couple of 18 or 25 DVI Wi-Fi antennas  and lift them, hoist them up and make that connection.  Maybe do a peer-to-peer computer thing there with  an Apple iSight or something.  Is that even feasible?  Should I just tell them they're nuts and stick to the Bible?  Just say, let me know.  Thanks.  Bye-bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, don't do a network at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Is he capturing and trying to stream it, or is he just wanting to send it  wirelessly over the one mile distance so he doesn't have to have...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it sounds like they have either a remote congregation.  Sounds what it sounds like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  FYI, Leo, if you wanted to talk to Kevin, he's on Skype right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, well, let's add Kevin.  I think he's here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it actually does sound like this guy's looking for an excuse  for doing his little Wi-Fi experiment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I mean, there's actually a couple of products that will allow you to send wireless over...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wouldn't do wireless.  I would call a phone company, get an ISDN line put in.  I mean, there's so many better ways to do this than trying to do it wirelessly.  Don't you think?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  No, the reason I say that is because I was looking at this thing for exactly a year ago.  I was looking for a solution so we could shoot down at E3 without  and send it straight to the booth without having to run back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you're talking audio and video, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's basically a gigahertz transmitter-receiver combo.  But the only thing is they're pricey, but they work pretty well.  Probably cheaper than a phone line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But ISDN wouldn't be able to handle video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You'd have to get a T1 for video, too.  That is an awful lot.  David, you said Kevin is on Skype.  I don't see him.  You don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Let me look again.  Contacts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's Kevin Rose connecting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm trying to connect to him, but he didn't show up as being online.  So we'll ring him and maybe he is.  So you see him there?  Oh, yeah, I see him.  All right.  Well, as soon as Kevin's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm the only one with a picture on Skype, aren't I?  You are.  I have a picture, except I'm up here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'll put a picture.  I don't see your picture, Steve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm staring at the screen.  He's a good-looking fella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't even know how to put a picture in here.  Let me see.  It's in your preferences.  You have to give a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, that silhouette looks sort of like you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It does.  That's my silhouette.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kind of that cartoon version of you on Call for Help.  Yeah, I do, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's move on to the next call here.  This is actually a fellow had a comment on our last episode,  just to show that we actually listened to comments on our episode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  This is Mark Anderson from Franklin, Tennessee, just outside of Nashville.  Keep up the good work, guys.  It's nice to have you back.  I wanted to comment on your coverage of GTA last week at the start of the show.  In my opinion, Rockstar added the code as a publicity stunt.  They locked it away, sent the finished product to the ESRB, and they got their M rating.  They knew all good and well some would find it and that they would get good press on it.  And if nobody did find it, well, they could always leak it when their sales started to sag.  In my opinion, if it's on the distribution CD, the ESRB should see it.  God of War got an M rating.  I am a gamer and I am a father.  I will play whatever game I want to play, no matter what the ESRB rating says.  If it's a good game, I'll play it.  However, when it comes to what I allow my children to play,  if I don't know the game firsthand, then I'm going to look at the ESRB rating.  Not so much the letter as the description of the content that's in it.  Though it's not that big of a deal, Rockstar should probably be chastised  for trying to slip something past the ESRB.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Valley, what happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, basically about, I'd say an hour outside of LA,  we had a hose break on the truck that we were driving up.  It was actually the radiator hose and it fell down inside of, what did it hit, Dan?  You know what it hit?  It hit some kind of pulley or something.  Anyway, it hit the accessory belt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, the accessory belt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know what it was.  I don't know much about cars.  Oh, the accessory belt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It's a giant belt that goes through the front of an engine.  Did you hit the data snapshot, Ben?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I don't know, but we were down for at least probably about three, three and a half hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Reminds me of my youth.  We were down.  The car was down.  That reminds me of my youth.  I broke down.  I was driving an Opel across the country, an old Opel Cadet.  Holy.  And I just outside, I was driving through Death Valley  or it was Death Valley just outside of Bakersfield, a hose blew.  And man, that was a mess.  I actually taped it up with electrical tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what did you do, Kevin?  How did you get going again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, basically the guy finally showed up and then they tried to  he tried to drive into town to buy another replacement hose for us,  but it turns out that they didn't have it.  So he got some type of like copper pipe with that was threaded,  was able to cut the existing hose, put the twins together,  and then finally just patches together and gets back on the road.  So very cool.  What a MacGyver.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you use chewing gum?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Now, did he was he from was he a representative from the rental company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, he wasn't.  He was like some kind of third party.  A fella.  Called the rental company is the people that brought him in.  But yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, so you're in San Francisco or in L.A., right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.  Basically, we moved our we missed our move in date,  which was yesterday into the storage facility.  So we just got down there and moved everything in this afternoon.  He must be.  Now we have to drive back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I really appreciate you're making yourself available.  Do you want to head out?  I mean, just or do you want to stick around for a little bit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I don't know how good my how's my.  You sound great.  I don't have everything hooked up.  So you sound great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You sound as good as anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  How far are you guys in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, about an hour and a half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We had John for a while, but his mic gave up on him.  He was using gizmo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We got him to do gizmo.  But yeah, in the gizmo is fine.  It was not a gizmo problem.  But John had some crappy mic that he fished out of his drawer.  Should we take some more questions?  This is from my my new favorite city.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, twits.  This is Carl calling from Stockholm, Sweden.  My question is concerning the Apple going Intel ordeal.  I'm a student.  And before the summer, I was sure I was going to get a new iBook.  So I've been saving up money.  And then this story comes along.  So what I'm wondering is if I buy one now,  will it be obsolete in a year when all iBooks ship with the Intel processor?  So I'd appreciate to hear what you guys think about it.  Keep up the good work.  Great show.  Thanks.  Bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Isn't that great?  We're getting calls from Stockholm.  That is really cool.  I just love that.  I don't think you know, I mean, look, all the software that comes out from now on.  Well, maybe not from now on, but soon will be dual binary.  They'll have a version for Intel and a version for G5 in the program, in the box.  So if you buy an iBook now, you'll continue for some years to come to be able to run software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For at least past the lifetime of the notebook.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And this might be a very good time to buy an iBook because you'll be able to get a great deal.  In fact, I think I would wait till next week when they announce new prices.  On the other hand, a Pentium M Mac is a much nicer notebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It could be.  We haven't seen it.  Potentially.  I think, I mean, the Pentium M is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What kind of prices are those going to be, I wonder?  Well, that's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the question is how long a wait from announcement to actual on the shelf.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And then the next thing with the teething issues with the whole new, you know, platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I would say if you don't have a current Mac, if you didn't buy one in the last year or so,  and you're ready to get one or you need a new one, buy one now.  This actually is a good time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I'm actually going to buy one in the near future just because.  Yeah, it'll be cheap.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And will they do an emulation layer so that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what they're doing.  They have an emulation layer.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.  So that's going to be slower running old style software on the new platform.  Well, very few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think many programs will come out that are Intel only.  At least for this for a few years during a transitional phase, every program that comes out  will have both will have binary for both processes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I'm thinking the other way around.  What about running existing Macintosh software on Intel?  On the new platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right.  No, they do have an emulation layer.  That's this transitive stuff.  And while they're claiming it's really good, it's emulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, exactly.  So it's not going to be no matter how good it is, it's not going to be as good as code  that's available for native.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Now, Apple does move on to a multi-core within the foreseeable future.  Would you be able to slave that emulation process onto a  That'd be interesting.  Separate core and perhaps speed it up so it'd be transparent to the user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's interesting because you have a penny empty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  We're looking for it to buy one brand new power Mac G5 for editing and  we're just going to go ahead and get it.  I mean, I don't want to have to wait and then you know there's going to be that transition period.  Just buy it if you want.  And you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Once you buy a Mac for that purpose, it's pretty solid.  It's not like down the road, oh, I need something.  It will serve you well in that capacity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Kevin, I was telling the guys that we were putting together a remote kit, right?  So we have a remote mixing board.  Because we're going to probably start doing this once you get moved up here.  Maybe mid September doing this with a live audience.  And by the way, a number of venues have come forward to offer effective.  I'm crossing my fingers on this brew pub that's come forward and said we'd like to host it.  If we get that worked out.  And there's a local radio station in San Francisco says once you guys get it going,  we would be glad to do a live broadcast on this local terrestrial station.  It's fun like it's making guys up to the sixth floor at CNET building.  Maybe we can.  In any event, what I was saying is I bought a PC for recording.  And I because I'm not going to schlep my tower.  It weighs about 80 pounds.  So I bought a shuttle PC with a FX86, 64 rather FX64 AMD and a Raptor drive.  And that's going to be a perfect recording unit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a perfect size to carry around with you too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There you go.  You don't have to have a Mac.  The right tool for the right job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  I say this is Jason from West Palm Beach, Florida.  My question is regarding pre-end wireless adapters and why you can't find them in the USB  form factor.  Thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  We lost of work because he's big on this pre-end thing.  Maybe I should try getting him back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Oh, so he's basically asking why there are no USB.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Adapters, they're all what ethernet or internal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I mean, I think they're all internal that I've seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's that's gizmo saying hello.  We're gonna call John and see what he has to say.  John is the one who told me only get pre-end stuff that's using the air go.  Hey, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Hey, remember he's going to let it ring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The call has been answered by an automated voicemail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I thought he didn't have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Dvorak has voicemailed.  Dvorak has voicemail.  All right.  That's what he told us.  He lied.  He doesn't know.  He just doesn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At least we know not to bother leaving a message because he'll never return the call.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Because he doesn't want to upset us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, he sent me three messages.  I don't know what's going on.  Should we listen to the messages and see what John's...  I don't know what's going on.  Maybe his system is kind of...  He's the one who said, by the way, on the pre-ends that the best way to go on the pre-end  is anything with an air go chip.  I mean, they're so fast.  Maybe USB isn't fast enough.  Maybe you can't keep up.  You're getting up to 100 megabits reliably on these things.  Here's John's.  I hope the USB 2 will do 480.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is John.  This is his voicemail.  Okay, there's one.  Wait a minute.  There's one.  Let's see.  Where'd you go?  What happened here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm talking here.  So did you guys see that there's a school in Virginia that is selling 1,000 iBooks?  Is this Virginia Tech?  No, it's a high school.  For $50 each.  1,000 laptops.  We sold the school warehouse on the...  What day?  What models?  I don't know.  They're white PowerPC 750s with 12 inch screens, 320 megabytes to memory.  What do I sign up?  That was 10.2.8.  First come first serve, you gotta show up.  Oh, you gotta go to Virginia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right, well, Alvaro left,  Twit listeners in Virginia, mass attack.  Twit Army, attack!

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Hi, this is Tom Schwartz from Newegg.com in Los Angeles.  This is more of a request or announcement than a question.  We're holding a huge LAN gaming event this July 30th and 31st  in Pasadena, California.  I was hoping for a mention on your podcast.  A little bit about the event.  LANFest 2K5, we're going to be giving away over 70,000 cash and prizes.  We've already registered 526 attendees for the main gaming events  and the Bring Your Own Arena.  We have a case mod competition with Jeffrey Stevenson and Paul Capello overseeing.  Paul Capello is famous in the community for his Doom 3 case mod.  We'll also have the infamous cyber athlete Fatality  to challenge anyone brave enough to try to frag him in Painkiller.  Our exhibit floor will include large booths representing AMD,  ATI, Microsoft, and Canon.  Please call me at 562-271-4106, extension 3389 for more info.  Thanks a lot for your time.  Bye bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm sorry, I don't do plugs on Twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's a serious Newegg.com plug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I like Newegg, though.  I mean, we should give them a plug.  They're nice.  And that sounds like a good event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it would serve them right to have their phone number there blasted all over Stockholm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think that's what they want.  Everybody in Stockholm, please call that guy now.  This is called completely unscreened questions.  And I prefer it that way, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are you going to edit this down, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I know, I'm liking it.  I'm liking it.  That's what I do on KFI.  I don't like to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Twit stream of consciousness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what people...  Look it.  Isn't that what people want with this show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, oh, you handsome Twit guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute.  I like that.  Let's hear that again.  That was a good one.  Let's play that one more time.  That's a female.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, oh, you handsome Twit guy.  This is Susie from Baltimore and I have a sad tale of networking woe.  I know Susie.  I'm trying to network with my home desktop PC running XDPro and my laptop running XDPome.  So you would think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, you know what?  I don't like this part.  I just like the beginning.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's just listen to that again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, oh, you handsome Twit guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The rest just sounds like your call in radio station.  It sounds like another K...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It doesn't work.  I don't want to hear any more of that.  I've heard...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hi, this is Alex from Las Vegas, Nevada.  I'm thinking of putting Linux as a second operating system for my computer.  I'm wondering, do I need Linux at all?  And if so...  You do if you want to put Linux as your second operating system.  I want to put Linux STD, but I want a Linux for my hard drive, not a live CD.  Thanks and keep up the good work.  Guesses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How old do you think that kid is?  Six, 15.  15, you think?  And his voice hasn't changed yet?  Did you sound like that when you were 15, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I did, actually.  He still does, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Little bit.  So does this turn into what's your favorite Linux distro discussion?  Yes.  Oh my goodness.  Well, it's either that or guess the kid's age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are you a Linux user at all, Steve Gibson?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I'm a free BSD guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hold on, this might be Opera.  Hi, this is Leo.  That's the CEO of Opera.  And I think we want to put him on, don't you?  Yes.  And he's gonna have to do the swim?  Well, that's what we're gonna ask him.  John von Tutsiner is the CEO of Opera, one of the founders,  one of the two founders of the browser company,  and the man who said he would swim from Norway to the US if Opera,  there were one million downloads of the new Opera 8 in four days,  and there were.  And John, you made an attempt, didn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Yeah, I went swimming.  Oh, you went swimming.  You didn't get all the way, though?  No, I had a slight problem with the guy who got me into all of this  by actually going out with his information.  He was going to be in a raft on the side,  and there was a hole in the raft, and he couldn't swim.  I had to save him, so I couldn't really let him die.  So that's how that trip ended.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's the PR guy's fault, as usual, right?  Yeah.  Well, I'm glad that you didn't drown, and he didn't drown,  and congratulations on the success of Opera 8.  That's been great.  You've been very outspoken about Microsoft,  and Microsoft's kind of counter-programming you.  For instance, they apparently have some code in their site  that looks for Opera?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  They have.  Well, they have had, at least, and I think they still do.  For instance, there was a case where people couldn't get into  the MSN site, where Microsoft would tell people  that if you're using Opera, that Opera wouldn't support standards,  and they wouldn't let you in.  There's been other cases where they've been sending us code  that doesn't work very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Boy, is that familiar.  That must make you pretty angry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Yes.  Obviously, we don't think this is the way things should be,  and we've taken this up with Microsoft a number of times,  and sometimes we try to do it in a funny way,  or even through the media.  But they're not really going out of their way to make things work  with Opera, or should we say it seems to be the opposite?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What would you like Microsoft to do?  Just get out of the way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  That would be a start.  I mean, if they would actually not look for Opera,  and they would just feed us the same thing as they do Internet Explorer,  well, then it would be more a problem on our side.  But even better is that they actually would start to adhere to standards,  and make the pages standards compliant.  That would be good for everyone,  and I'm sure that that would solve all problems, whatsoever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That MSN is detecting the Opera user agent header  and changing the pages it serves when it sees that that browser is using MSN?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  That's the problem that we've been having, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh my goodness.  Do you spoof the user agent, and then what happens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Well, we always spoof, but you can always find out it's Opera.  Actually, although in the latest Opera versions,  we've been making it possible to actually spoof totally,  so it's impossible to know it's Opera.  Right.  And that's sometimes needed.  It shouldn't be needed, but we've been having situations like this where,  I mean, one case was Hotmail.  Hotmail users couldn't delete their spam mails using Opera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But not because Hotmail was somehow standards compliant,  and you weren't, but mostly just because they were detecting you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Well, actually, what was happening, if you were using Opera on the Hotmail site,  there was a function, a JavaScript function,  that you needed to call for deleting the spam.  And that function didn't exist in the code that was sent to Opera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Oh, so they deliberately sent you...  They disabled it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Basically, yeah.  So it looked like Opera didn't work.  Again, we don't know exactly why this is happening all the time.  Probably, in some cases, it's someone doing a mistake.  But the thing is, when you're looking for the Opera in the string,  and then send us faulty pages, well, it makes us wonder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Opera's done very well.  Opera 8 is very popular.  There are issues with some pages Opera not working.  Are you fully standards compliant?  Is it that the pages aren't compliant,  or is it that you can't support all the standards?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  I think we are probably the most standards compliant browser on the planet.  I think it's more like the pages are using potentially something Microsoft specific.  Sometimes it's even a question of  Opera supporting standards better than the other browsers,  and then they're actually coding around problems in the other browsers,  which then give us problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So really, the issue is more that people design pages for Internet Explorer.  That's really the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  That definitely is a problem.  And part of that is that Microsoft never went out of their way to support the standards fully.  The fact is that they've been supporting parts of the standards,  and then it's very difficult for web design to know which parts are working, which are not.  Then they code it to make it work with IE,  and then there may be even programming around a bug in IE,  which then ends up not working in Opera.  Luckily, there's less and less of this, but it's still a significant issue,  and we are spending quite a lot of time in getting pages to work that should have worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're talking to Jon von Tuchner, who is the CEO and founder of Opera Software,  the Norwegian company that makes one of the three top browsers in the world.  I'll tell you, people who use Opera are fanatical about Opera.  You have your strong adherence.  On the other hand, it's been a struggle for you against Internet Explorer.  Then along comes Firefox and starts to really take market share from Internet Explorer.  Why wasn't that Opera?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Well, I think in a way the timing for Firefox was great.  If you look at it, Mozilla has been trying for very many years.  They've been working on this browser since 1998,  and it's great that they're having some success.  The browser is good.  I think in a way they came out with the browser at the same time.  There was a lot of focus on security issues in IE,  so a lot of people then looked at an alternative,  and they found Firefox around and they really liked it.  And it's a good browser.  It's not as powerful as Opera, but it is a good browser,  and I can understand that people like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So how has it been for Opera lately?  Has the success of IE, I mean Firefox, helped you succeed?  Has it kind of established a market for a non-Internet Explorer browser?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  I think there's definitely an increased interest in alternative browsers.  The fact that people are now downloading alternative browsers more  obviously also means more downloads of Opera.  We believe that we can stand the competition quite easily.  Like I say, people do like Opera.  The people that take the time to actually download Opera  and spend some time with it,  quite a lot of them find that it actually suits them better than any other option.  So the reality is we're getting more downloads.  This is a positive thing that there's more interest in the browser market.  I think also with Netscape's markets here going down so rapidly,  I think it was good that another alternative came out there,  and Microsoft is not having more than 90% of the market,  and the alternative browsers are on the rise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and it forces websites to consider other than IE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Basically quit being sloppy when they write a message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You've got to think of the rest of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  I think this is a very important thing.  Web designers really need to think about alternative browsers,  and they also have to think about the fact that the web is changing,  that you're getting not only PC browsers but also mobile browsers,  and this is going to be changing quite a lot.  But obviously the fact that Firefox also supports that is quite well.  So normally if you're designing for Firefox, it will work in Opera and vice versa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One of the things you did early on was move from a Windows-only platform  to a cross-platform strategy, and that's proven quite successful for you, I think.  I see Opera on cell phones and a lot of non-traditional platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Yeah, we've been working on this for quite a few years,  and if you look at it, last year we were on 8.8 million phones,  so that's up from then 2 million in 2003.  So there's a definite trend in the number of devices that are going out with Opera,  and there's going to be an increase this year as well.  And I think this is very important.  If you look at it, there's a lot more mobile phones and PCs being sold every year,  and in a few years' time all these mobile phones are going to have a full-blown browser.  And I think that changed the equation.  You can't really code for IE on the PC anymore.  You have to code for something that is working on different kinds of devices,  different operating systems, and different browsers.  The only real solution to that is to outhurt standards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Guys, if you have any questions, please don't let them.  I don't want to monopolize John.  I'm thrilled that we get to talk to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Did you experience any resistance from mobile phone manufacturers  when you approached them, or did they approach you about using Opera on their platforms?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  There's definitely been no negativity.  I mean, they've been wanting Opera.  Opera has been gaining momentum quite a lot.  Actually, in the beginning, it was more of a, is this really possible?  I mean, a lot of them really didn't think it was possible to have anything else but  a separate mobile internet.  But the separate mobile internet hasn't really taken off.  And then when people have seen Opera on the mobile phone,  they've seen that it actually is possible to use a full-blown browser on the mobile phone.  I mean, it is the same browser we put onto the mobile phone as we put in the PC, the core of it.  So this has been educating the market.  And so if you look at the market four or five years ago,  people were thinking this is not going to work except on some high-end phones.  Now the trend is that we are moving into mid-range phones.  And I think in a few years time, this is going to be the default.  You're going to have a full browser on your phone.  And hopefully, quite a lot of these phones will be having Opera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Opera on Symbian is great.  There's no close second.  I mean, you really dominate on Symbian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Now as a gamer, I have a question.  Are you or will you be considering a browser for the PSP?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  That is a question that is difficult for me to answer.  This is decided on market demand, market contracts and the like.  So you never know.  We will port Opera to any platform that gives us volumes and users.  And that may well be the PSP in the future, but we have to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How easy is it to port for you?  What technologies are you using to make it so easy to go cross-platforming?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Well, we've been doing these kind of ports since like 99.  So over time, we made it a lot easier.  Normally, we can have Opera as a prototype up and running on just about anything that  can run anything at all.  In the space of weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are you using a virtual machine?  Are you in C?  How are you doing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  This is written using C++, but we made our code very simple.  I mean, we've always followed this kind of, okay, let's not make use of any Microsoft  libraries or any other libraries that kind of tie us into a platform.  We just try to make more and more of the code ourselves.  And this makes for efficient porting.  So what brings you to the US?  Well, it's a combination of vacation and work.  I decided that this year I've been doing a lot of trips to the United States.  So doing the vacation in the United States is going to save me a few trips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So you kind of kill two birds with one stone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  And you're in Las Vegas right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Currently, I'm in Las Vegas.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Beautiful circus circus.  Probably the worst hotel you could have chosen, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Well, you know, I mean, I'm with a family and I was told that this would be an  nice place to bring the kids.  The kids will love it.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm hoping so.  There's a lot of these casino things down there and you know what, I'm not into gambling.  So, but I'm fairly certain the kids will love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Where else are you going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Well, I've been in New York.  I've been on the West Coast a bit in different places.  Mainly in San Diego.  We have an office in Carlsbad.  It was a natural choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did you take the kids to Legoland?  Yes.  That's fun.  And are you going to the Grand Canyon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  I've been to the Grand Canyon.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You got to do that.  If you go to Vegas, you must go to the Grand Canyon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Yeah, the Grand Canyon is very spectacular.  It's a great view and I would recommend anyone to have a look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've only seen it through Google Earth, so I really have to make a trip there.  Well, what's ahead for Opera?  Anything you'd like to talk about?  Opera 8, of course, is a huge announcement and I think I've been using it and I'm very happy with it.  What's ahead for you guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Well, we'll continue to strive to amaze, strive to come out with something that  is better than anything else in the market and better than ourselves.  So that's always a focus for us.  We have to do this and we want to do this.  So you'll be seeing more interesting technology coming from us.  At the same time, we just continue working on the browser.  We are building up the company quite rapidly.  We added a lot of people during the last year and this allows us to do things faster.  So we will be coming up with a lot of cool stuff in the year to come.  The same applies to the other markets.  We're doing a lot on the mobile side.  I think there's going to be a significant increase in the number of phones going out  with Opera this year and next year.  Then there's all these other types of devices like set-top boxes and even cars and planes.  There's a lot of things that you probably will be seeing Opera in the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, one of the reasons Microsoft is so adamant about taking the browser market is ultimately  in a networked world, the browser becomes the most important application  on your computer, on your cell phone, on your devices.  It's what you see the world through.  It's your portal.  So that's an exciting area to be in.  Let's talk briefly about spyware then I'll let you go because I'm sure you'd like to  get back to your family.  How do you deal with the issues of spyware, malware and so forth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  One benefit of how we do things is that because Opera is not so tightly integrated in the  operating system, spyware has a little bit more difficult task with Opera than maybe  with Internet Explorer.  So that's one thing.  We just focus on security in general.  All these spoofing things and all the things that we have, which is the main thing that  we have to deal with, is to make it as difficult as possible for anyone to do damage.  We've been doing a lot of these things with Opera and we will continue to do so.  Just focus on any little item that we can do to increase security.  And this means that I think if you ask third parties, you'll find that Opera is the most  secure browser out there and part of it is not having ActiveX and not being tied into  operating system, but also just the fact that if there's an issue and there are issues in  all browsers, then we fix them quickly and that's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Opera has always been in the lead in features.  You were the first to do tabbed browsing and multiple window browsing.  You've got WAND, which of course fills in passwords and so forth.  You've got voice activation.  Great UI.  Any innovations you want to share with us that are coming down the road?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  I think you'll just see new items popping up all the time.  It's very difficult for me to talk about features before they're out.  We don't really want to tell the competitors about what our next step is going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's great is there's cross-pollination.  Everybody looks at what everybody else is doing and obviously says,  well, we'd like to do that one better.  Certainly, thanks to your implementation of multi-window browsing, tabbed browsing became  kind of the common way to do it and I think a huge improvement, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  I think a lot of people are seeing that using tabbed browsing, people are still,  not everyone has found the sessions functions that we have in Opera yet,  but I think that one is also good.  I love it. I found it.  It's a definite requirement.  I think in a way when people start to use that, they don't understand,  okay, how did I do this before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sessions allows you to save open pages as one kind of thing that you can reopen and go back  to your session again and it really is a great way to work.  I have a session up and right now in front of me with a bunch of pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Can you really imagine the time before you just had a single page?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was hard. You had all these windows.  John, I really appreciate your time.  I hope you have a wonderful visit to the US and thanks for providing an alternative.  Thank you.  Yeah, Opera is a great product.  Opera 8 is available now from opera.com.  John S. von Tetschner, I got it right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It's always good to hear those stories because Lord knows that we-  There's a chance.  Yeah.
