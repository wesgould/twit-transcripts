Transcript:  I could do that behind me with MacBook Pros.  And mostly MacBook Pros that are barely used because the keyboard was so crappy.  Apple stunned this week when they announced not only we're going to give you a new 16 inch,  which, by the way, I had given up on.  I thought, oh, because Ming-Chi Kuo, the analyst said it'll be next year.  They they they slipped it out.  There's little press release.  But not only that, it has this as far as we could tell.  I fix its teardown.  It has pretty much the same keyboard as the classic 2015 MacBook.  As somebody said, it's the un-Johnny Ive keyboard.  I don't think you could blame Johnny Ive for those terrible keyboards.  But but anyway, Marco Armin on Marco.org is so excited.  He he had a list of things he wanted with the MacBook Pro,  none of which he got it except the better keyboard.  He said, that's enough. That's all I need.  A decent keyboard, scissor, key switches.  It's not cheap.  But you can go up to 64 gigs of RAM.  You can go up to eight terabytes, which I don't know.  I don't think anybody, Daniel, no Windows machine has eight terabytes of storage, does it?

Start time: 425.68
End time: 435.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, most I've heard is two or you can do.  There are computers now that have dual SSD slots in them.  Some even have three. Those are really rare.  And you can like make a raid.

Start time: 436.52
End time: 449.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could do that on my Lenovo.  One of my, the Think Bad Extreme, I think, had two extra.  So I could put two drives in and plus the M.2 drive.  So, yeah, you could, you know, but even then, eight would be you'd have to really jam a lot.

Start time: 449.28
End time: 461.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I haven't seen many like SSDs they can buy that would,  I guess, if they're even rated, you need four terabyte ones, which I haven't seen.  I only know two terabytes, which are pretty rare.  I don't know if that's impressive.

Start time: 461.68
End time: 481.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if it's it probably is a special Apple part.  They're known that they're known to do that.  They're also using the newest I9 processors,  which is actually not any different than the last MacBook Pro,  except this time they're properly cooled.  So Apple says it can actually be faster now.

Start time: 484.46
End time: 519.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's impressive, you know, in terms of specifications,  I know developers are really excited about that.  I mean, having 64 gigs and eight terabytes,  even a videographer, video editors are going to be really happy with those stats.  And as someone who obviously covers Windows PCs, you know, a little jealous.  I mean, we don't have that much that goes up that high in terms of specifications.  I mean, the Dell XPS 15 will be the closest, but even that,  you can now do 64 gigs.  That comes with the latest Intel chips.  They allow you to go that high.  So you can do that. But yeah, that's yeah,  this is some impressive numbers for for a laptop and six grand.  It has a physical escape key.

Start time: 522.65
End time: 523.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, right. Yeah, I'm so excited.

Start time: 525.66
End time: 579.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do want to say, you know, this one, the biggest differences  between Mac laptop and a Windows laptop is the implementation of OpenGL,  which is inherently less efficient on Mac.  Every test of Apple's abandoned.  Oh, Apple's abandoned.  Apple's abandoned it.  They don't do it at all anymore.  But then you have to go over to metal for everything.  And of course, the implementation that is limited.  This is my 2015 MacBook Pro, which I will never give up.  The classic. I still have one.  It's got that discrete GPU in it.  You know, they've moved to integrated with the 13 inch.  And this is the first laptop I've seen in a long time.  If I were not writing for Congress and I was developing games,  I would really be tempted to go buy this.  My 15 inch laptop, it's lasted me for four years.  It's a great machine.  And, you know, at this price, yeah, you should be able to use it five or six years.

Start time: 579.74
End time: 633.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is a reasonable replacement for that classic 2015,  which I also used for years because it was the only it was the last decent keyboard.  They do have a discrete GPU in these new ones.  They have, of course, an AMD Radeon Pro.  You can get the fifty five hundred with eight gigs of GDDR,  or you can get the step down from that.  It's if you if you max it out, it is a six thousand dollars.  But and Daniel, maybe you can comment on this.  Somebody in our in our community mentioned that is that he got the same one I did,  which was thirty six ninety nine.  But he said, but if I got the same specs in Lenovo, it would have been over four thousand.  So is is as expensive as these are.  This is a high end machine and these aren't completely out of line for for a high end  Windows machine either. Right. Yeah.

Start time: 634.02
End time: 650.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's one of the ever since the surface has came out,  their whole push has been to drive OEMs to make higher quality laptops.  And, you know, back in 2015, I have the MacBook Pro because they were so good.  You've been putting Windows 10 on.  It was still sometimes a better experience.

Start time: 650.40
End time: 655.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mossberg and the Wall Street Journal famously said the best Windows machine out there is the MacBook Pro.

Start time: 656.54
End time: 726.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's true. And in 2015, you can make that argument, you know.  But I would say because of Microsoft's pushing surface, now you have HP,  you have Lenovo and Dell, who all make some really killer laptops in terms of quality,  performance and hardware that rival the MacBooks.  And then you had Apple themselves screw up right with the keyboards.  And four years almost of really negative coverage of these keyboards.  And you combine that. It's no surprise that they saw a dip in sales.  Now they're you know, this is good. They're making a comeback. Right.  This is going to be, I think, a really popular laptop.  I think a lot of people will buy. I think exactly like Brianna, like people from the 2015 version  will definitely want to upgrade to this. And that's actually a nice upgrade path.  I mean, four years is a long time.  But if you have the 2015 version, that is what most people hold onto laptops for four or five years.  That's normal. It's not like people like me who gets one every three weeks.  So I think this is was a good move by Apple.  But they didn't hold a press event. Right.  And I think the reason for that was obvious.  They would have loved to have shared all this stuff.  But half of it would have been we're walking everything back.  That's not a good story to tell.

Start time: 727.36
End time: 756.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's so that's the amazing thing.  Like kudos to Apple for having walked this tightrope that we all knew they were walking,  that they never had to admit that they screwed up, that they never had to do a recall.  They just said, oh, you know, those magic keyboards that we ship with IMAX.  Yeah, we put those in laptops now because those are really the best keyboards.  And so they got to paint it as progress as opposed to admitting mistakes like that.  That's chef's kiss sort of PR.

Start time: 757.00
End time: 786.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, to be fair, they kind of admitted a mistake because they do have a it's not a recall,  but they do have a repair program for the replacement, replacement for the butterfly fiasco.  But you're right. And also, they and by the way, to Apple's credit,  they admitted they made a horrible mistake with the last Mac Pro.  They're not above admitting mistakes.  But you're right. If this is just corporate PR, if you can avoid saying you were wrong,  they are, let's not forget, still selling the butterfly keyboard on every single other Mac laptop.

Start time: 786.28
End time: 803.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's what I was going to say. You want to talk about pent up demand when they bring this to the airs,  especially, but also the the 13 inches and things like that.  Like there's so many people, myself included, that have waited on the sideline.  I'm sitting talking to you on a 2015.  You know, so wow. Right.

Start time: 804.26
End time: 811.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And all three of you are using 2015.  Because I don't currently use one.  I have one. That's amazing.

Start time: 812.18
End time: 841.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hold on to it. Never give it up.  No, I am very disappointed.  They did not get rid of the touch bar.  You know, Apple moved this year.  They got rid of 3D touch, something I used.  I have literally never used the touch bar in a way.  I went that improved my experience.  It feels like a solution in search of a problem.  It eats up battery life. I cannot tell you how many times I've just wanted to turn the volume up and down  and you find yourself going through some menus.  It's terrible. Just get rid of it.

Start time: 841.56
End time: 897.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's they in a way they they did the same thing.  They didn't admit it, but they kind of acknowledged there were issues.  They moved it a little farther away because one of the problems I know you have, I have,  is I hit, you know, Siri launches every time I'm trying to hit a backspace.  So they made it a little and they separated the escape key and they separated the the fingerprint reader.  So the touch bar is I have a feeling it's going to slowly shrink away to nothing.  There'll just be a little touch strip and a little a little touch slot.  And then now we don't have touch. There's no touch.  What do you mean? Because there is nobody's really taking advantage of it.  I think you could perhaps say to Apple, well, say on their behalf.  Well, they were hoping that this new user interface, people with lots of apps would use it  and it would become a very valuable tool.  But no, not really. That happens sometimes.  That's not completely Apple's fault.  Yes, it is. It's a piece of crap. I'm sorry.

Start time: 898.66
End time: 903.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The weird thing about the touch bar is we just look at it.  It seems like a cool idea.

Start time: 903.56
End time: 910.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, it's really cool if you do the kit, if you make it from Knight Rider,  if you have the kit thing going back and forth, then it's cool.

Start time: 911.32
End time: 931.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's why I always find weird about tech is sometimes like you see something in photos  and obviously Apple is very good at graphics.  But if you were to show anyone that in like 2015,  I think most of us would be like, oh, that could be kind of interesting.  That's kind of cool. But then it turns out that in practical usage,  yeah, it turns out it's not a good idea.  It's a poor substitute for their lack of touchscreens, which is.

Start time: 932.76
End time: 953.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's really what it was about, wasn't it? Yeah. Yeah.  But again, I don't know if Apple knew that it was going to be stupid and useless.  And so you you got to give them some credit for at least trying stuff, right?  Well, that's that's the Knight Rider, man.  That makes it so cool.  You'll even play the Knight Rider theme if you if you want to.

Start time: 953.12
End time: 970.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and in their defense, all it would have taken was one app  to have made a killer use of it, you know, some Adobe or somebody had used it.  And oh, my God, it's transformed how I use Photoshop or whatever.  You know, if one person had been able to do something with it,  then we'd be having a different conversation. Yes, exactly.

Start time: 971.78
End time: 1016.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this is one of the benefits with the PC world,  because you have so many manufacturers and OEMs like you have Lenovo.  I've been giving a lot of credit to like it makes it really wacky stuff.  Right. We have like the yoga book.  The thing with the dual screens and in keyboard.  Now, they weren't expecting that to sell a ton.  And it was kind of an experiment for them to put it out there.  And it's neat that they can do that and not have to like  be their entire reputation.  Whereas Apple has so few laptops that when they commit to something,  it's the only version that's going to be out there.  So they either take it away the next year, which is just an obvious thing,  or they try to ride it out for a bit.  But at some point, they have to make a decision as to its future status.  I think this time they're going to wait till they do a significant redesign  again before they pull it out.

Start time: 1016.82
End time: 1064.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, yeah, I think that's fair.  I mean, 3D touch.  I remember I had a column in Mac Life about this talking like you think about it.  In theory, it makes a lot of sense.  I could imagine racing games where it gradiated your acceleration and break  versus how hard you're touching the screen.  You could imagine a lot of interface uses for that.  But just year after year went by and there was no real use for it  other than as a keyboard shortcut.  And I just I think Apple should look at that and say,  is this increasing our users experience?  Because if I'm trying to turn my screen brightness slightly up or slightly down,  it's easier to just hit that key once or twice versus, OK, let me tap this.  Go to the slider, move it over.  It's just it's it's bad UI.  And I just I wish Apple would admit that it's not working.

Start time: 1065.58
End time: 1114.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you're right, Daniel, though.  Daniel's right that  because Apple is the only manufacturer of Apple computers, Macintosh computers,  they don't have the luxuries that I mean, God, the best thing about the PC.  I hate Windows 10.  And I'm sorry, Daniel, you have to cover it.  But it's all right.  I mean, what's going on with Windows 10?  1909, people are saying all sorts of horrible.  Microsoft can't seem to get put out an update that doesn't break.  Maybe that's because they're a billion and a half users.  I don't know, but they seem to have problems with the software.  On the other hand, the great thing about the Windows ecosystem  is the variety of hardware you could find a laptop, no matter what crazy thing you want.  You know, if you want a great keyboard, you get a Lenovo ThinkPad.  If you if you want thin and light, HP's got those great new specters.

Transcript:  What's your is there is there ever going to be a surface book three?  Yes, they said they said there's going to be.

Start time: 1122.26
End time: 1150.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they haven't said publicly, but I mean, we're expecting definitely  there's always two surface events, right?  There's usually a spring one.  And of course, the October event.  I would not be surprised if we see something come around for spring.  I think the holdup is because Intel attention they want to use.  But that class of tension that they use or want to use that actually out yet.  I think only release a quarter of the Intel tensions to market.  So I think there will have that along with so RTX.

Start time: 1150.44
End time: 1184.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For those that aren't following the ins and outs of the of the surface line,  the thing that's unique about the surface book, it's a laptop,  but it has a special hinge and you can detach the screen.  So it could become like it could undock.  And it was always I had this first one.  It was a source of a lot of difficulty because the GPU was in the keyboard.  So all of a sudden you have a machine where you've disconnected from the GPU  and the operating system just goes nuts.  And it took them a long time.  It took more than a year for them to solve that problem.

Start time: 1185.58
End time: 1206.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep. And they're still occasionally issues.  It's definitely a tough engineering problem in terms of just even a durability of that hinge.  But also, as you mentioned, electronics of disconnecting the GPU while you're active  is pretty crazy. Yeah.  And it's a weird device.  I mean, they have to have telemetry on this.  Most people probably aren't actually using it as a tablet. Right.

Start time: 1207.22
End time: 1222.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I never detached it. Not once.  So all of that all of that pain was pointless.  Now, I think the Surface Laptop, which is a laptop,  but it doesn't detach, is actually a very nice device. Yes.  And I think they're getting very good reviews on the new one.

Start time: 1246.12
End time: 1265.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's it's an OK chip.  But even I feel like Microsoft oversold its performance.  And this is really comes back to, you know, getting to the Mac, too.  So when you look at the 16 inch MacBook Pro, I think it's a beast.  It's a serious, serious graphics power.  It's comparable to the Dell XPS 15 in terms of just performance ability.

Start time: 1265.52
End time: 1270.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, it's comparable to an iMac Pro.  Yeah, it's a pretty high end Mac.

Start time: 1271.54
End time: 1280.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But when you look at the surface laptop, three to 15 inch, you know, they're like,  oh, it's the fastest and it's class.  And I remember I smirked when they said that because I was like, it's class.

Start time: 1280.48
End time: 1283.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Class is that machines without Contara keyboard rests.

Start time: 1284.56
End time: 1364.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's class.  It's it's basically a 15 inch ultrabook.  So ultrabooks are defined by their processors.  Yeah. In 15 watt, not a Dell XPS 15 has a 45 watt chip in it.  And so those are it's a world of difference.  So when you say it's the fastest in its class, there's barely any 15 inch ultrabooks.  And there's a reason for that, which is when people go to 15 inch,  they tend to then commit to a four pound device.  That's going to have serious performance.  And I get what Microsoft was trying to do here.  The 15 inch ultrabooks do have a role.  Some people just want that.  But the AMD, it's just it's a generation behind the Intel's in terms of CPU performance.  It's not nearly as good. It's not as efficient on battery life.  They weren't able to do things like use DDR4X, which helps with battery.  It doesn't have Wi-Fi 6, which is weird as Wi-Fi 5.  And so it just it's and you can compare it to the Intel version.  Like you can go buy the Intel version of the Surface Laptop 3 15 inch.  You just go to a Microsoft store and ask for it in the back and they'll get it for you.  If you directly compare those, the Intel version is just faster.  The GPU for AMD is slightly better, but not world's difference.  But I feel like this is a long term play for Microsoft.  They're spreading the love around. They got AMD now.  They got Intel, they got Qualcomm.  They got ARM. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Transcript:  Oh, the Surface Pro X? Yeah.  X rather. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  My review goes live actually, probably Monday, Monday or Tuesday.  So how are you liking it then?  I like it, but it's it's very nuanced.  It's for the right person.  It's a perfect device.  It's but for a lot of people, they're probably better off with the Surface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have the Surface Go, which I really like.  I like the size. I like the fact that it's always on.  I would love longer battery life.  Its performance is not great.  But I'm and I did buy the HP Nvx 2, which had the ARM processor,  and that was unusably slow.  This is supposedly a little faster because they're using a faster Qualcomm.  It's significantly faster.  So it's usable. Yeah. Except you have to use ARM

Start time: 1411.44

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  apps. That's where it gets the nuance. Right.  So apps that are recompiled for ARM 64  or UWP apps that are found in the Microsoft store run very well on it.  We're talking even with the GPU.  It can be an 8th Gen Core i5. Really? Even with graphics.

Start time: 1427.30
End time: 1435.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's very good news.  Yeah. The bad news is that that the non ARM,  not recompiled apps run terribly. Right. They're very slow.

Start time: 1435.50
End time: 1474.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wouldn't say terrible.  It'd be equivalent to about a Core i3 for an 8th Gen.  That's not bad. That's usable.  No, it's quite good.  What it is, though, you're going to you'll take a little hit on the performance  and a hit on battery life.  And that's the trade off.  But so, you know, in my review, I talk about what I use it for.  I use it for Office, right, which is recompiled for ARM.  So Office, Word, OneNote, Excel.  I use Slack. I use Teams. I use Skype.  I use GroupMe. I use Todo.  I use the new Edge browser, which has been recompiled for ARM 64.  I use Hulu, Netflix, Sling, Disney Plus.  I use as a PWA.  So I do all this stuff and it runs perfectly fine.

Start time: 1474.92
End time: 1483.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's designed for those apps.  And if that's what you're going to use, you're going to be fine.  So Slack is Electron.  Are all Electron apps recompiled for ARM?

Start time: 1484.90
End time: 1511.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They will be. So Electron actually did get converted to ARM 64.  But I don't think the store app has been updated for that.  But that happened over the summer.  That's good news because there are a lot of Electron apps out there.  Yep. And Unity too, which is interesting.  So you're seeing this.  It's about the ecosystem building up.  And so this device is really about sort of getting it out there  and sort of driving it. But yeah, it depends on that one app. Right.  I know a lot of people are like, oh, I need Adobe Lightroom.  Yeah, good luck.

Start time: 1517.94
End time: 1557.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And that's where I feel like this is the issue that PCs have,  which is the beauty of a PC is it can do anything technically.  You can run like I have these little mini PCs with the little seven inch displays.  I could install Adobe on that if I want to.  Does it run well? No.  That's a separate question. Right.  And everyone has a different threshold.  Some people are happy with the Surface Go's performance.  A lot of people aren't.  Whereas a Mac doesn't really have this much variation.  And so that's the issue is when people look at the Surface Pro X, they're like,  oh, I'm going to do everything on that because it's a Windows 10 PC.  And you're like, there's a casual, there's caveats. Right.  So if you want to game on it, it's terrible.  You don't want to game on this.  No gamer would buy an X.

But at the same time, to say it's a really nice experience if you do do that.  So that's coming in early 2020.  You can stream your Xbox games, play Call of Duty on it.  Is that a solution for all people?  Probably not. Is a solution for some people?  Yeah, totally. Actually, it's going to be a really interesting alternative  that gets around this, where you still can carry around a laptop  that weighs two pounds and gets all day battery life.

Transcript:  They're in a little bit better position because of the fact that they manifest.  Well, they designed. They'll design their own. Yeah.  And those their chips are really impressive and probably. And  you know, they're all 64 bit.  Yeah. And they have the iOS ecosystem, right.  And the iPad OS ecosystem.  So in that sense, they're a little bit better positioned.  Their issue is they need to get their stuff.  So it's more like a PC instead of, you know, iPhone apps on the larger screen.  So they're coming from a different problem where Microsoft's trying to get their stuff  a little bit more like iPhone apps, casual games and all this kind of stuff.  So they're both coming from different areas.  But interesting. Yeah. I mean, the industry is moving to arm, right?

Start time: 1657.94
End time: 1668.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  Go ahead. I'm sorry. No, no, no, it's fine.  I was just going to say, I think I think Microsoft is a really interesting  position with their streaming service.  If you look at Google Stadia, which I got to play tomorrow this year.  Yeah, they've got 15 games announced for it.  I probably shouldn't say this, but I have friends of mine on the Xbox team  and they saw Stadia when they came out in the lineup for it.  They're working on Microsoft streaming solution.  They're like, whoa. All right. Oh, yeah.  But that's so much.

Start time: 1708.40
End time: 1711.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 1711.20
End time: 1767.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Of course it does. And I will be honest, I you're making fun of it.  But I'm the exact kind of person.  I'm like, if I'm buying a Windows machine, I want steam  because there's a limit to how many games I can get to work on Mac.  The Surface X Surface Pro X, I thought, was the most interesting device  to come out of that surface event.  The hardware looks great. The device looks great.  I got the Surface Go and I took it back because I'm like,  there are too many compromises with speed on this.  So if you look at Xbox, it's got the infrastructure there  to really bring forward a streaming solution that works on those kinds of devices.  So I'm thinking about where Microsoft is going to be five, six years from now.  And I can really imagine they're streaming Xbox game service  working well enough that you could say, OK, I can move to ARM.  I can get that battery life and I can place it when I need to do that.  I just think it's it's really looking very promising.

If you look at it, it has to do with the streaming technology.  Why is that? I assume it's like looking at a game through a through a filter.  Like if you haven't cleaned your glasses, it's just it's off.

Start time: 1801.12

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it has the most potential.  It'll be the last one to come out.  Yeah. And what I hear from game developers over and over,  think about from their point of view, you're asking like an Ubisoft can go and say,  OK, we're going to spend a couple of million dollars  porting over Assassin's Creed Odyssey to this because we're freaking Ubisoft.  Right. Right. And it's a game that already exists.  But if you're asking a developer to bet on a platform  when Google has such a long history of just destroying platforms  in a very short amount of time, that's not something a lot of game  developers are going to do.  If you're talking about Xbox streaming, it's still X86.  I assume it's going to work with the same tools.  If you're doing Xbox development, it just it's easier for the game  to have pipeline. It's an easier sell.

Transcript:  If you're going and buying a switch on day one, you add a certain number  of titles that you could play and enjoy.  PlayStation three, PlayStation four.  You expect that when you go plunk down that amount of money.  The buy in is less for Stadia, but it's not even about  it's not even about who buys it.  It's about getting buy in from the developers.  Yeah, I literally have never met a game developer in my life that's like,  you know, I've met my company on Stadia.  Yeah, that's just not happening.

Start time: 1929.82
End time: 1941.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's just too much competition.  There's also let's not forget there's Apple  and you can make money in an iOS game pretty good, pretty easy.  So I think with Google, Arcade is great, isn't it?  And you can play that on your Apple TV.

Start time: 1942.18

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Google's issue also was just the way the messaging came out for this.  So they announced it.  And I met like when they announced it, I was like, oh, you know, like  this could be a big deal, you know.  But then what happened was the details came out.  Over the next few months, little bits are trickling out.  Oh, you know, only 15 titles.  Oh, it won't work on this hardware initially.  Oh, it only works on the Pixel three.  And so all the oh, and it won't work on the PC, like all these little.  And so the story got worse and worse and worse.  And that's usually not the way you want to do any kind of announcement.  Right. So it was about expectations.  And I think expectations were a little bit of a mystery when they first announced  it, but it looked pretty positive.  And then as we got closer, closer to launchers, it's like one let down after another.  Now, they could still recoup from this.  I think this is still early days.  But, you know, I think Brandon is right here.  I mean, in fact, as much as I've been thinking this, we start reporting on them  doing cloud streaming and experimenting with it in 2013.  That was our first story on it.  So they've been they've been thinking about this for a really long time  and architecting it.  And when you tied into the Xbox game pass and the low cost of entry  and the options where you can stream from your console or from their cloud,  you know, it does have sort of a better story, I think.  And they have Azure around the world.  They're just kind of set up for this.  But, you know, I want Google to actually kind of do well here  because I want to see the competition, you know, go back and forth.  I think gamers want that as well as consumers will benefit from it.  But right now, Stadia looks a little bit disappointing.

Transcript:  Sometimes I almost feel like these are more demos  for the cloud infrastructure that Google and Microsoft can offer  than the actual gaming experience is like, oh, no, we can do, you know,  scalable, massive networks look.  And it's really it almost feels like Cloud X and  other things are just a show off for Azure as opposed to kind of.

Start time: 2059.46
End time: 2068.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Actually, we'll get into that because there's some little  little fight going on over Jedi, which we'll get to in just a little bit.  And I, you know, I'm glad because we have, you know,  brands, a game developer going way back.  So we have brands expertise.  Does Stadia comes out tomorrow, though, doesn't it?  Is that right?

You know, because in most in most species,  it is the male of the species, the peacock that gets the feathers,  the plumage gets to look good, lets to get looks too fancy in the human  of all the species, the human species.  Men, we don't get much.  We wear business suits and white shirts and we're boring dress.  There's only really two ways men can show their plumage.  One is with a necktie.  I'm not wearing a necktie.  One is with your socks.  And I am now of I am convinced  that getting a great, fancy, cool looking sock  is the key to style for men.  That's why I'm a bombas subscriber.  I love my bombas socks.  Do you know about bombas?  Bombas make socks that are super soft, crazy cozy and styling.  They look great no matter what the occasion, whether you're athletic,  dress or casual socks.  They have all kinds, including and Lisa saying I have to try these.  I've never done this. I always like socks that show, but they also have.  This is what all the kids are wearing these days, these no show socks.  So you see people wearing loafers and it looks like they're not wearing socks.  They're wearing bombas. See, no show.  You can also get ankle socks.  I happen to like quarter or even calf socks.  I do not wear knee high, but they have those as well.  They're all made from super soft natural cotton.  Every pair comes with arch support. Yeah.  When you try your bombas, they're the most comfortable socks.  They are not merely a liner to to keep your foot from touching your shoe.  They are a part of the entire shoe architecture.  A seamless toe, so there's no lumps.  The cushioned foot bed is comfy, but not too thick.  But you will notice the difference.  I got a 12 pack here, but you can choose singles, three packs,  and even 12 packs with many colors, patterns, lengths, mix and match.  They look great no matter where you are.  Guys, we need a way to show our style.  And this is how I show my style with bombas.  Also, by the way, a great company to give back to their community.  The socks are one of the most important things.  If you're homeless, they are the number one most requested item  in homeless shelters for every bombas purchase you make.  They donate a pair to someone in need.  So this is a great way to give a gift of socks for the holidays  and give to others as well.  You can do both.  B-O-M-B-A-S bombas dot com slash twit.  Who knew there was so much tech in socks?  But I can tell you as a bomba swearer, there is no better sock.  You can get 20 percent off your purchase right now.  If you go to bombas dot com slash twit, 20 percent off.  So buy a lot.  Buy a bunch of them, give them to friends.  Bum bus.  Thank you, bombas, for your support of this week in tech.  All right. I guess we've talked about I was going to save this  stadia conversation, I guess we've done it.  Last week, there was conversation about the Apple card being sexist.  And actually, people took it seriously.  I laughed. I was reading David Hennemeier Hanson's DHS's  at DHH's tweet where he said his he and his wife filed  for Apple cards and he got a 20 times higher credit limit.  And he says it's sexist.  I don't know.  I don't know if I buy that.  The New York Department of Financial Services is opening an investigation.  Goldman Sachs says it's going to reevaluate credit decisions  for those who got less than they thought.  I got to point out Lisa, my wife and I both applied for Apple cards.  Her credit limits like twice, three times mine.  I didn't tweet, oh, it's sexist.  Women get more credit.  These things are complicated.  Is there in the aftermath of this, I know we talked about it last week,  but in the aftermath of this, is there any?  I mean, the Apple's taken it seriously.

I think it's more complicated and nuanced than that.  And that is a data point of one.  Now, Woz also tweeted.  But again, Wozniak made a little bit of money on Apple.  His wife, Janet, I love Janet.  She came from Apple education.  I don't take it.  The fact that I got less credit than my wife, I don't take that personally.  That's just what you get.

And admittedly, it's a black box.  There's a lot of factors.  But is gender, would gender, why would you put gender in there?  You want to lend money.  You're there to give people credit.

Transcript:  Absolutely.  And I'm just saying there's a discussion to be had about how the algorithms affect our lives.  Is this something we want to waste our precious national attention on?  I would be honest with you, Leah.  When you run for office, you have a team that does social media.  I was so disappointed to see my team tweeting about this as if it was a feminist outrage because I don't care.

Can I point out to her credit, Jamie, JHH, his wife, did a blog post where she said, quote,  This is not merely a story about sexism and credit card algorithm black boxes, but about how rich people nearly always get their way.  Justice for another rich white woman is not justice.  Oh, yeah, by the way, to their credit, they're aware of that.

Transcript:  We should say that that she was her credit limit was raised as soon as he tweeted about it.  Although you can always do that.  You can appeal. I've often appealed my credit limit and got more credit.  That's a pretty common thing. I don't know. I don't know.  Is this bad for Apple that they partnered with Goldman Sachs and this is going on?

Start time: 2625.86
End time: 2684.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I think it's just bad that they partnered with Goldman Sachs.  Bad enough.  I just don't like I just want banking just to be normal.  I feel like banking is sort of like the cab industry, which it was so bad that it gave rise to like Uber and Lyft.  And now we have Uber and Lyft solved a lot of problems and spurred innovation, but it's also created some other issues, too.  But like the only reason Uber and Lyft were so successful is because the cab industry was so bad.  Right. There's like no reason why they couldn't have been doing these things themselves years ago.  I feel like banking is the same way where it's just like the banks just, you know, there's like really no reason why you need to physically go into a bank anymore and all this kind of stuff.  So you're seeing this rise of just all digital stuff.  And I'm OK with that. But now you're getting into this like I don't even understand why there's an Apple credit card like or why Google wants to give me check.

Start time: 2685.07

Start time: 2712.20
End time: 2759.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. I think that's what was so surprising to me.  I mean, if you think about Apple, the experience bottom line should be joy.  Right. When I go into an Apple store and I buy the new headphones or new iPad or something, it should just be an experience of joy.  And I understand why they did this.  Did you know that Sony today, their number one most profitable division the last time I looked was their financial services division, their number two month.  Specifically insurance. Yeah. Right.  And then it was the the PlayStation. Right.  That is what is holding Sony together these days.  So I understand Apple. You have to diversify.  You have to. Right.  I understand that move, but it just feels so counter to the emotion.  I just Apple doesn't need the cash.  I don't understand why they would take this kind of hit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd agree with you, except I said exactly the same thing about 15 years ago when Apple there was rumors that Apple was going to make a cell phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to say tech, though, like techy of innovation and like you go look at the iPhone.  And what we all got wrong was we didn't really see how far they were going to push the model really changing.  It comes to financial services like like I mean, the reviews for the Apple credit card were hilarious.  Like people were going off about how the gradient changes in the end.  Like this was like innovation, like in a sense of like, you know, like technology or even like the iPhone.  So like I don't know.  I just don't see this as this is a play for money.  But I feel like consumers are getting more and more pressure for all this kind of stuff.  And it's not really making our lives better.  Right. Actually, there were opportunities in FinTech.

Start time: 2822.90
End time: 2830.12

Yeah. All online. And, you know, I'm with you, Daniel.  I said on my show this week that like I sorry, guys, I only want to do banking with a bank, even though I hate my bank.  There's nothing that they do well for me.  But I'm going to give my money to a bank because, OK, why does Apple need to do this?  They're not in for in with the data.  Why is Google interested in giving you a checking account?  This is a quote from the Wall Street Journal.  Checking accounts are a commoditized product and people don't switch very often, but they contain a treasure trove of information, including how much people make, where they shop, where they pay.  Right. So you want to talk about innovation, the innovation that tech can bring to things.  The innovation that Google wants to bring is, again, a checking account.

Start time: 2885.84
End time: 2895.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's nuts.  I mean, there's got to be something better.  This is 18th century technology.  At least I'm sure Google will make us write checks or maybe they will.  I don't know.

Start time: 2897.48
End time: 2908.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Forget that.  They'll probably the innovation will be that you never have to write a check.  All they care about is knowing how data, what your monthly spend is on entertainment and blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Start time: 2908.86
End time: 2924.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's very easy to look at anything Google does and say, well, it's about the data.  I mean, they give us a lot of free services.  Look at Google Photos.  I'm constantly amazed by what you get from Google Photos for nothing, including unlimited photo storage.  And I have 40 or 50 thousand photos on there.

Start time: 2924.56
End time: 2947.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it is. But they use it. But it is.  Photos themselves. Right. That's for their own algorithms and training and all this.  So, I mean, everything they do, I don't want to hate on Google necessarily, but everything they do is to benefit them for their larger picture.  You know, it's like I know they're like and we'll talk about this later.  We'll talk about now about the health stuff with Google.  Right. Between them, let's talk about this.

End time: 2975.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And so this is just another like, yeah, I don't doubt that they can contribute to the health care industry and use their algorithms and detecting in x-rays.  And like, there's definitely a discussion there where this technology could be helpful.  But let's not forget the fact that Google wants to do this because it benefits them on a larger scale, too.  It's a market for them. It's not like we're going to donate our servers to help cure cancer.

Do you think we should worry if you're a Fitbit user and who isn't,  I mean, who didn't at some point use Fitbit?  Should you worry that Google now has that entire database of health information?  Or who cares? I don't care if Google knows how many steps I took in 2008.

Transcript:  It's an interesting discussion. I've been a huge fan of Fitbit,  covering them for years. I've always recommended their stuff.  Once this news broke out, I know a lot of Fitbit users are just dropping it.  And even I've stopped using it. And it's an interesting question, right?  Part of me is the concern over health stuff. I don't want Google knowing that info.  And it's not so much like I'm worried about anything in particular.

In fact, the New York Times today,  in its Sunday edition, could you get the New York Times magazine from my office,  has a wet grumpy cat on the front and saying, what went wrong with the Internet?  We had such high hopes for the Internet. And Kevin Ruse has a long article about how  it's a horrible thing and only people who have money now can use the Internet safely and privately.  And we talk about it a lot. But in every one of these cases, I keep saying,  well, okay, but you can't deny there's a lot of benefit.  There it is. Online cesspool got you down. And there's a bunch of grumpy cats,  grumpy, wet cats with I don't know what's on them.  And it doesn't look healthy.

End time: 3237.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had when you run for office, you talk to a lot of lawyers.  And I've actually I'd never thought about this until a couple of weeks ago.  So there's a kind of asymmetrical legal warfare going on with defense prosecutors  where if the government is building up a case against someone, they have the power to go  and subpoena a massive amount of information. A really good example.  A mugging takes place in a park. They can go like cast a geofence and subpoenaed Google  and get the information of every single Gmail account that was in that park.  That's OK. You're right. There's a bad one.  So I'm just like we brought up Project Nightingale.  I also talked to a doctor this week that told me he spent 45 percent of his day  doing electronic paperwork on his patients.  They felt every single sister we'd ever used was broken.  And he wanted to see some unification and improvement there, which Project Nightingale could do.  That's a good thing. On the bad side of this, you look at this and you're like, OK,  if Google has all this information from Fitbit, does that mean they could eventually trade this  to your insurance companies? Theoretically illegal now.  Maybe it's not going to be illegal 10 years from now.  What if there's a case of the government building a criminal case against you or a civil case?  So I'm just saying all this stuff has very wide ramifications that we've never really had a discussion about in this country.

Start time: 3238.36
End time: 3287.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I agree we need to have the conversation and I agree we need more members of Congress like you  who have technical literacy so they can intelligently talk about this.  I think there's also a risk, though, just say, oh, big tech is bad.  We've just got to throw that out because we think there's real benefits, too.  And I just signed up for Apple's health research thing they released this week.  And you can do a hearing study, a heart study.  And I think there's a study for women on menstrual cycles and you contribute data.  There's a whole big thing you have to agree to.  But I did it not because I think it's valuable to collect this data and to get insights from it.  I'm not worried about, you know, somebody know. I even, you know, I think this is good. Right?  Is it that we trust Apple to do this and not Google?  I mean, I was just going to say, I don't think Apple's necessarily more trustworthy than Google.

Start time: 3289.66
End time: 3344.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but Daniel said Daniel said that Google is doing this for their own interest.  Well, Apple's doing everything for their own interest.  Of course. It's just that you we are Apple's customers.  The problem with Google is we're never their customers.  The advertisers are always their customers.  So in a way, this Google story with the health records,  it's almost like the quintessential tech story at the moment because, oh,  the rap on Google is all they ever do is their tech is only to serve ads to you. Right.  All the great things they give you is only serve ads.  So here's an example of them saying, look, health is a huge societal issue.  Health care. Let's make it cheaper. Let's let's digitize it.  So on the one hand, you want to be like, congratulations, Google.  You're finally you're doing something that's really going to put a dent in the universe.  But then on the other hand, you're like, but is are you only ever going to do this?  You're never going to do this not for us because we're not your customers.  You're really going to do it for your real customers,  which are always the advertisers and the marketers and all that stuff.

Start time: 3345.88
End time: 3362.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's the issue. Even so, here's the problem.  If there's somebody at Google who has, you know, wants to make the world a better place.  And I suspect there are thousands of employees and even management people at Google  who do want to make the world a better place. They just that's it.  You shouldn't be working at Google because of your business model.

Start time: 3363.50
End time: 3372.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have. I mean, do have an image problem, right?  If you were to scale this right now, who's at the bottom? It's Facebook, right?  Like if Facebook got into health, I think we'd all be like, OK, we'd all agree.

Start time: 3372.52
End time: 3374.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a bet. Yeah. Yeah. Right.

Start time: 3374.48
End time: 3464.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they got Facebook and then Google's above them.  I would say Google is not nearly as bad as Facebook, but their reputation is not so great here  for the reasons, you know, that just outlines.  And then you have like Microsoft and Apple who are angels.  They too have screw ups, but it seems like their interest is a little bit different.  And so I think that is a gradient. But it's, you know, what Brianna was talking about, too.  We really haven't had this discussion about data.  I'd also say Google has, you know, part of their history.  So like, first of all, it's called Project Nightingale.  I think anytime you call anything a project and it's secret and then it leaks out in the media, it's just not good.  And don't forget, Google is just reeling right now from their other project,  the Chinese search engine that they were allegedly working on.  And so was that Dragonfly? I think it was.  So when you have all these like secret projects and it comes out, it just sounds sketchy, even if it may not be.  And so but we need to have this discussion about data protection.  We have HIPAA, which is really nice because it does.  Google's not a signatory to HIPAA.  But HIPAA it is. And so that's like so supposedly they're going to inherit that.  But like we need to talk about this stuff. Who controls the data and who sells it? All this.  And I don't know. It's just I would feel better.  I don't feel safe putting myself with Google, not for any specific reason either.  But my other issue with like them and Fitbit, I just don't trust them as a company to maintain the hardware.  Like I liked Fitbit's hardware. I liked what they were doing.  And I feel like Google is just I don't know what they're going to do with this stuff.  Like Wear OS is a mess.

Start time: 3464.86
End time: 3483.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So some of the problem Google has is not about privacy or selling advertising,  but just about their kind of management failure to pursue these projects to their end.  So I'm just worried.  Freakiness. That's a better word.  Flaky. Flaky.  Oh, flakiness. OK.

Start time: 3483.62
End time: 3505.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they're flaky.  I feel like the Fitbit line will just fizzle out.  And I feel the same way like people were like, well, Microsoft should buy Fitbit.  I'm like that same issue.  I don't trust Microsoft to maintain Fitbit's business. Right.  And I don't know who would have been good for this.  I would have actually preferred Apple to buy Fitbit if only because Apple, I feel, I could really benefit from the health.

Start time: 3529.54
End time: 3548.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the issue with government is more about a general distrust in institutions.  It's really been spanning for the last 20 years, even going back to Reagan.  But if you look now at the current administration, it's like anti-intellectualism that's been going on.  We don't trust people in government to talk coherently about these topics because they're just not first.

Start time: 3571.00
End time: 3620.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I was just going to say I ultimately I think the answer here is we've got to have regulation about who can collect what and how they could use it.  If I remember correctly, Leo, for the health study you were talking about when Apple got on stage and they were talking about,  they were talking about how they are going to use their differential privacy technology to aggregate the total conclusions that they're going to draw,  which means they split up the end and the beginning.  So you can't track any one data to any individual user when they are drawing conclusions.  That makes sense to me. So I think ultimately, if we're trying to say, well, do we trust Microsoft?  Do we trust Google? Do we trust Facebook? It's a losing argument.  We need regulation that protects citizens.  And then that is an overall strategy for this rather than like being at the mercy of Facebook and Google and Microsoft.

Start time: 3620.58
End time: 3631.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, maybe that is the solution, the same solution the founders came up with with separation of powers.  Maybe that's the solution is that you do have private industry, but you have government watching.

Transcript:  If you have if mutual, you know, oversight for all for all the things that you dislike about government, at least in theory,  government is accountable. Yes. You know, and a key point that I want to make here from the article from the journal,  I think it was that brought this out is neither patients nor doctors have been informed that Google has this data.  It's because it comes from some ascension Catholic chain of 2600 hospitals, blah, blah, blah.  But apparently that's legal. So they well, there you go.  Right. Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996,  hospitals can share data with business partners without telling patients as long as the information is only used to help the covered entity carry out its health care functions.

Start time: 3680.06
End time: 3697.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So by the way, that law was written to benefit health insurance companies clearly. Sure. Right.  That's what it's all that was what that was all about is that health insurance companies needed to collect all this data so they could know who to deny coverage to.  So let's be clear. Maybe that's not the best law ever.

Start time: 3698.70
End time: 3706.48

Google's decided not to not to take it. There were two days before they were going to publicly post it.  They got a call from the NIH saying, yeah, maybe we better cancel that.  So, yeah, I just I would hate to lose the benefit of this stuff, too.

That's if you don't pay attention to it, it gets away.  You do have lobbying and interest, even like HIPAA, as you pointed out.  But in theory, we could organize petition the government and they could fix things.  That's really the only solution. I know people like to use this argument like with like Google, like, well, you know, it's a free market.  Just don't give them your business. But when you're you don't have a choice, you made the yeah.  I mean, Google's one giving away the product for free and you don't have much choice.  And somebody don't even know what they're doing.  It's hard to be that consumer who is making a decision to I don't know.  It's not it's a very complicated world. It's like saying I'm going to boycott Disney.  It's like it's a complicated world.

But I don't trust they're not going to raise the price soon.  I bet it's going to be like twelve or thirteen bucks within two years.  Actually, let's take a break because I need to take a break.

Transcript:  But I would like to talk about all these new streaming services before the show.  We were kind of going back and forth about it.  Let's put it in the show because it's getting expensive and lots of choices out there.  Our show today brought to you by Express VPN.  You know, I just saw a story that said Apple is going to warn you when you join an open Wi-Fi network and say, do you want to turn on the VPN?  You should have Express VPN on your iPhone.  I did on my MacBook, on my iPhone, on my Windows machine, on my Android device.  As we were traveling around the world, we're using a lot of open Wi-Fi.  Absolutely. You better believe I pressed that button.  That's the nice thing about Express VPN.  Those apps have a big button. You press it, you're covered.  You're secure. You're private. You're on the best VPN service there is.  Express VPN.  There are a lot of reasons you want to use a VPN.  This audience, I shouldn't have to explain to you.  There's all sorts of ways Wi-Fi security can be bypassed.  There's all sorts of ways people can attack your system if you're on an open Wi-Fi access point.  Flaws like crack.  There's privacy issues too.  Your Internet service provider, many Internet service providers sell information about what sites you're visiting to the highest bidder.  Some even inject ads into your Wi-Fi stream.  Express VPN blocks all of that.  Number one VPN provider, according to TechRadar, according to CNET, it's very easy to use, very affordable.  In fact, we've got an extra special deal.  If you subscribe for one year, you'll get three extra months free at expressvpn.com slash twit.  I tested it out. I brought it with me everywhere.  They just completed an audit by a third party that said, yes, Express VPN does exactly what they say they do in the privacy policy.  They do not log. In fact, they use a technology that makes it impossible for them to log.  It's called Trusted Server. They created it.  Those VPN servers you're logging into all around the world are running in RAM.  No data logs can even be written to the hard drive, even by accident.  So there's no way to keep track of what you're doing on Express VPN. That's what you want. Real privacy.  I'm a big fan of Express VPN. I think you should give it a try.  If you're not using a VPN, even Apple these days is going to start saying this is in the new beta.  You ought to be using a VPN. Turn it on.  Nice thing about Express VPN, as soon as you install it on your iPhone, it knows.  And it'll turn it on when you want.  Express VPN dot com slash twit to get started.  Get those three extra months free when you buy a one year package.  Express VPN. Really happy to have them as a partner on this week in tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're getting not just Hulu, though, you're getting that the television service, the live TV, the cloud recording, the commercial free, which isn't really commercial free.

Start time: 4163.92
End time: 4213.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It just allows you to fast forward through the commercials, which I appreciate.  That said, the reason I stick with Hulu is because they're supported everywhere, whether it's phone, their web app is very good.  They make a PWA now, which works exceptionally well.  It's on Xbox.  And so I can watch it wherever I am, basically.  So even in my home office here, if news is breaking, I'll just open up the Hulu app and watch on my computer while multitasking.  Sling was also good, but I found Hulu's streaming technology to be better.  And so you have to kind of pick and choose.  But yeah, I mean, it comes down to what these services offer for TV and all this kind of stuff and the quality of it.  Yeah, I liked YouTube TV. I thought it was really good quality.  I like the capabilities.

So it's back. We got it.  That's interesting. That is surprising.  AT&T's TV now is raised its price considerably.  But that is a struggling service.

Start time: 4236.25

Start time: 4244.62
End time: 4258.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also, there's the whole AT&T Time Warner HBO Max thing is going to replace theoretically.  So maybe they don't even care about that anymore.  They now have a...  Maybe it's one of those things where it's like they cancel you unless they think you're making money on them.

Start time: 4258.52
End time: 4263.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, HBO Max is not going to be their TV now.

Start time: 4265.74
End time: 4269.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 4270.39
End time: 4272.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or will they ever? Will we just keep buying them all?

Start time: 4274.67
End time: 4295.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think we keep buying.  It's like the same old game.  Before we had streaming services, it was like which Byzantine cable plan am I going to sign up for?  Do I want to watch E? Do I want ESPN?  You're paying the same amount of money.  At least now I can focus in on the shows that I want and cancel it without spending an hour on the phone with my husband.

Start time: 4295.48
End time: 4307.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It feels to me like we're in a bubble though of some kind.  There's too many shows. There's too much to watch.  I feel like people are just going to say enough and just going to stop watching TV entirely.  No, that'll never happen.

Start time: 4308.00
End time: 4339.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no way that we're all going to be signed up for six services.  So there's going to be a huge washout within the next five years.  There'll be winners and losers. Okay.  Right. Right. Right. Right.  So then somebody's going to go back to just being the feeder to the Netflixs and the Disney's and whoever comes out on top or whatever.  Actually to me the most interesting thing about this is that as we're all talking about these subscription services,  like there's a huge play that in streaming and it's still ad supported.  So you've got...  That drives me nuts.

Start time: 4339.68
End time: 4342.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like if I'm paying you, you should not be putting ads.

Start time: 4343.26
End time: 4360.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But see like that's why is it Peacock or it's one of those it's either Comcast or NBC's play.  That's just going to be the thing where it's like, well, whatever.  We're not. We might not charge you because right.  Right. Right. No.  But so it'll just be another app that's on your phone or whatever.

Start time: 4360.62
End time: 4367.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an ad supported network like this, like Twitter, like podcasts.  Like Hulu used to be.  Like Hulu used to be.

Start time: 4368.20
End time: 4395.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. So what if what if how it all shakes out in five years is that there's three or maybe even two big subscription players and then everybody else has essentially cable channels.  But they're just all apps because they're ad supported or whatever.  And that's essentially it shakes back down to what all we've really replaced.  It used to be HBO, Showtime, Cinemax.  And now it's going to just be Netflix.  And then everything else will be ad supported streaming on the other side.

Transcript:  We got it. We got our wish.  You can cancel. You just go online.  I can go cancel Hulu right now.  They're not going to call me. They're not going to bug me.  I just get canceled. It's done.  I could go back to sling and be online in two minutes.  You know, I do appreciate that.  I think things have gotten better.  I'd also say that quality of the shows have gotten better.  Like you came back to Disney Plus.  Like I'm all in all for the new Star Wars shows.  I think like we're getting really good TV now.  And so I think it's better than the network TV model we had years ago.  I agree. And so I'd rather have this.

Start time: 4456.50

Transcript:  They're also spending a lot more money.  Apple spent three hundred million dollars on the morning show.  What was it you were saying?  Sixteen million an episode.  Fifteen million an episode.

Start time: 4464.52
End time: 4501.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, fifteen million.  Fifteen.  Yeah. I probably should not admit this on your show, Leo.  But the thing I spend the most time of any of my subscriptions watching is YouTube.  I pay for YouTube Red, which doesn't have commercials.  And yeah, I was talking to one of the millennials on my staff about this.  And he was saying, you know, it's so hyper segmented that I just don't watch planned TV anymore.  And it makes sense.  Like if you're a car person, you can watch Doug Demuro.  You know, if you like tech stuff, you're watching, you know, your content or other shows.  It's so hyper segmented.  Maybe that's the thing.

Start time: 4502.16

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Obviously. Yeah.  So actually, that's an interesting change.  It's coming to YouTube.  They've they've announced and this is really they say it's the FTC making them do this.  That if you are a there's if you're a child targeted channel, this will very much change your advertising model.  And if you're a child attractive channel and you have to declare it and if and it's up to you to decide.  But if you do it wrong, the FTC finds you not YouTube.  So that that is in response to the problems people have had with YouTube.  Child focused YouTube content that's gathering information about kids that's targeting kids, it's doing all sorts of weird content for kids.

I think it's all going to change when the 25 year olds are dominant and and and it's going to be a very different world.  And I think hyper segmenting is a very interesting phrase.  Yeah.  Because I even remember a time when you would come to work and everybody would be talking about what Johnny Carson did last night.  Sure.  And that's how old I am.  And that is that still a little bit like game.  I remember the last episode of Game of Thrones.  Somebody said, remember this.  This is the last time everybody will be watching the same show.  And at the same time, that's gone.  That's going away.

Start time: 4668.87
End time: 4751.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think my other concern is the fact that these companies are still combining.  So like Hulu was Hulu and then Disney and Comcast and what you're having is like all these and like with Hulu, it's like Hulu ESPN plus, which I use because of UFC, which they made a deal there, which I wasn't happy about.  And then I have this Disney streaming service.  So you have all this stuff coming under one roof.  And at first I was like, oh, this may actually work out because they offered a deal.  It's like, oh, if you already subscribed to some of these, we'll give you a discount.  I'm like, OK, that's kind of cool.  And that was cool right up to Hulu raised a price by ten dollars, which is like, oh, that's probably how you're subsidizing the Disney plus stuff is you're offering it so low by jacking up the Hulu cost.  And I feel like this is going to be this cat and mouse game.  So it's only as good as when there's actual competition.  But like what happens with sling, right?  Like so sling is an interesting one.  I actually like them.  I think they're a good company.  They make some own dish, right?  Yeah, I believe so.  But who knows why I said that?  I mean, AT&T can come and buy that or Disney might buy them.  And, you know, it's like you could totally see that happening, in which case you start losing this competition and then the real upside for YouTube.

Start time: 4752.24

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Start time: 4782.22
End time: 4797.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Except for the fact that is Leo, are you saying that because they are almost crowdsourcing all of the talent that they can almost be their own eventually all of the talent bubbles up from YouTube.  And so then in theory, they could just I think they can own it all.  And I think it's the Spotify argument.

Start time: 4799.57
End time: 4847.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's more than that.  It's about it's about really what it's about is the fracturing of the commons.  And I and I worry in the long run that this may not be good for the world, that everybody has their own little slice and niche, doesn't know anything about anybody else.  And so as long as YouTube gives me the whatever is the car content I want or you want or whatever it is, you're going to watch that.  And you're going to be satisfied with that.  And eventually, because of the great expense of buying all these different channels and all this premium content, I think people are just going to turn their back.  I think there's a whole generation coming up that never spent money on premium content.  They're just going to turn their back on it.  They're going to say, look, I get everything I want right here for free.  Yeah.

But that sounds so old fashioned, doesn't it?  It does. But there's you know, you look at I remember in the 90s thinking, oh, it's going to be great when we can segment it out.

One of the best things about traveling is you meet people who you've been told things, especially in the Middle East, about.  Yeah. But then you go there and you meet them and you realize everything you've been told is wrong and that they're humans and you get it broadens your horizons.  And the people who never travel don't you know, they can have those illusions about the other.  And I think we're getting in a world where it's so fragmented.  You read the news that agrees with what you think that we can have.  We literally now in this country have different sets of facts.  Yeah. And and my fact may not be the same as somebody else's fact.  In my day, a fact was a fact, but we don't agree anymore on what is a fact, what's true.  And so I worry about what the world looks like with that kind of fragmentation in the long run.  I just I feel like that's a risky proposition.  Yeah.  Stevenson talks about that.  The doomsday machine. Yeah, right.  And in the fall, he talks about it very directly.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm just I'm just wondering.  I don't know what the answer is going to be.  I'll be dead before that happens.  So I don't care.  Go ahead. You could say it.  OK, boomer.  No, I wasn't thinking.  Sure you were.  OK, I love that.

In fact, Pax.  So I was bringing them up, P-A-X.  They're one of the most interesting companies in this area.  They're a company I was like, I should have been in on this like five years ago.  They were in Vegas at CES.  They were giving out their their little vaping tool, which is like 30 bucks.  And then you can go to a dispensary and get a free vape thing from them.  It was they're giving away free weed, basically.  It was crazy.  And that's how I got into it.

I was so traumatized from the death threats and bricks through my window that my my specialist in PTSD was like,  look, marijuana is legal here.  I'd never tried it before.  You've never used it before.  I'd used it like one or two times.  I didn't like it.  And she was like, this is a path for you to get better.  It did help me.  I don't do it often, but it was a miracle drug for me.  That said, Daniel, I gotta say this.  I tried vaping twice and it is it is hell on your lungs.  And I say that as a runner and it's I it's your choice.  It's obviously better than smoking.  But I think it's got to be said just to be responsible that this is you're introducing any contaminant that might be in there directly into your your bronchial system.  And if something is, I mean, smoking cigarettes is not good either.  It's very bad.  I would think vaping is preferable to smoking, especially if you're getting real stuff from a from a lab like you can get in Massachusetts.

So, I mean, I smoked a lot of pot, used a lot of drugs when I was a young man.  And I don't know, I might have actually been a success had I not.  But I'm not doing it now.

Start time: 5729.23
End time: 5754.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's OK. So this is the story.  Apple removed 100 on Friday, 181, 181 apps that allowed people to control the temperature settings on their vaping device, social networks, games.  They never did allow the sale of cartridges through those apps.  They were apps to control the vaping device.  Do you use an app, Daniel? Yeah.

Start time: 5754.86
End time: 5796.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So this is why I found Pac super interesting, because I was the same way I was like, I was like, wait, it's Bluetooth and it connects to your phone.  I'm like, come on, this is more like Internet of part of my language.  But like, you know, like we don't need this.  But then the app. So this is why the app is good.  One, you can set the temperature, which affects the intensity of it.  You can also control the density of it.  So the dosage. So you can choose micro, small, medium or large.  And so you can actually give this to someone with the Pax cartridge and set it to micro.  And then when you inhale it, there's a little meter that will go across your smartphone screen telling you how long you should take the hit for.  So it's a way. Oh, my God.  You're kidding. No, no.

Geez, Louise. This was super exciting.  I was like, this is the way this industry should go forward and be more mature about it.  And I agree with Brianna. I mean, we don't know a lot about vaping, long term health effects.  And that's where like we need to have, again, an open discussion.  There needs to be research on this stuff. I brought out there to health risks mentioned.  I do believe, you know, if you're an adult, 18, if we want to have alcohol and cigarettes still legal, like, right.  Why not have pot? I don't have a problem. This seems to be.

If you're using it for medical purposes, I think it just feels because that's the strongest argument for legal marijuana to me is, you know, there is a medical use for it.  I talk to veterans all the time that they use it to treat PTSD.  And I'm I'm glad to see our fine Commonwealth of Massachusetts leading the way.  But it just seems to me like Daniel said, you can dose it out very specifically for what you want.  I've never smoked it before.  I had no idea what it would do.

It was the old Petaluma Bank, 10,000 square foot store  where they were selling seeds like tomato seeds.  And I thought, well, you I know what the rent is on that place.  You couldn't possibly. And it found out, turned out their whole plan was,  well, once pot's legal in California, which it is now,  we are going to become the number one source of seeds.

You just you really don't want to do anything.  Go ahead. Be my guest.  Our show today brought to you by World Wide Technology, WWT.  They've created this amazing advanced technology center.  In fact, I think we're going to I want to do an event out at this in St. Louis,  because this is amazing.  Half a billion dollars of enterprise gear in this ATC from hundreds of OEMs,  key partners ranging from the big guys like Dell EMC to VMware, Intel.  They've also got the little guys, the disruptors like titanium and Equinix and Expanse.  It's all in there because if you are in business and you are buying business technology,  you got to know that everything is going to work the way you expect it to.  You've got to be able to get everything working together.  And that's where you do it at the ATC.  Now, the engineers at World Wide Tech have been using the ATC to create proofs of concept,  to spin up pilots, to let customers select the best solutions.  But now you can do it too. And that's what's totally amazing.  That's right. WWT has opened their advanced technology center to everybody  with on-demand and schedulable labs like Dell EMC VxRail or Xtream IO or X2 or Isilon.  These labs represent the newest advances in primary storage.  There are hundreds of labs that you can use to explore things like multi-cloud,  hyperconverged infrastructure, networking, secondary storage, data analytics, AI.  You don't have to operate in mystery.  You can use the lab to find out exactly what it will do for you.  They offer Lab as a Service.  It's a dedicated lab space within the Advanced Technology Center  where you can perform your own programmatic testing using that vast and beautiful ecosystem  of enterprise tech that WWT has built.  And because it's virtual, you don't have to go to St. Louis.  You can use the lab anywhere in the world 24-7.  And I have to tell you, this ecosystem creates a multiplier effect of knowledge,  of speed, of agility, anytime, anywhere around the world for all WWT customers.  That should be you.  You'll get access not just to the labs, but articles, case studies, hands-on,  use of these products, other tools that make a difference in today's fast-paced world.  This is really a revolution in buying and using and understanding enterprise tech.  Learn more about WWT and the Advanced Technology Center.

If you've played Minecraft, you'll recognize it.  Wow.  Dirt, cobblestones.  But watch.  So I can now build...  Let me build something here.  So this takes a little while.  It's early days.  I think it's kind of a beta, but it's going to give me an augmented reality view of this  table and I can build a little Minecraft castle right on this table.  And it'll persist.  When I come back, it'll be there.  Any changes I make will be there as well.  I think it's a really...  I think this is another Microsoft Azure show off thing, Daniel.  I feel like...

Now it's going to stay there.  And there's a little duck and I can dig in it and I can build in it with the stuff that  I've gathered.  I could put...  Let me just put a pig on there.  Look at that.  There's a little...  That pig will never move.  I put him on top of a pillar.  So this is Azure Places...  Anchors, rather.  Yeah.  I think that's cool.  Yeah.

Transcript:  So it started off originally as HoloLens as one of the experiences where they could show  off the technology of what HoloLens could do.  Right.  And that was back when they didn't...  When they first announced HoloLens, they didn't know how to market it because it originally  grew out of an Xbox concept.  It was going to be like this sort of gaming thing.  But then Nadella kind of came in and they seemed like they weren't just pushing towards  enterprise and real world things.  So they never created the full Minecraft experience, but the technology used there did turn into  this, which is probably a much smarter use of it.  I just tried it for the first time last night.  I was kind of impressed, but also bewildered.

Microsoft has turned out to be quite a good steward.  I thought they would ruin Minecraft.  In fact, they've done much better than Mojang ever did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I often think about how for our generation, my generation, at least on Gen X, Super Mario  from 1985 is such a huge game.  The number of people, kids that have played Minecraft is like 10 times bigger than that.  I try to process that and I just can't.  Yeah, Dana, I do have to say, I feel like HoloLens is...  I can think of no Microsoft technology that deserved more success that did not get it.  And I think it's just the moment it came out, VR just got so much more of the attention  and specifically the dev focus and the fact that you could only code in it with C sharp  and not languages like C++.  I feel like it has so much potential still and it just, it needs...  I want to see Microsoft come back and push it again because it is truly amazing.

Transcript:  Well, they just shipped HoloLens 2 on the last week.  So that was a big milestone for them.  But yeah, they're taking, I think, a safe and realistic approach right now to it, which  is it's geared towards enterprise, professionals, line workers, engineering architects,  and even the military, right, which is a little bit controversial.  But that's probably a safe spot for it because there's no external pressure to report numbers  in the sense like if they ship these to consumers and they can just go down to Best Buy  and get them where they probably wouldn't sell, you would physically see them not selling.  We'd have a lot more data and I think it's too risky right now as the consumer play.  But I think we all see the potential for augmented reality in the consumer space.  But the technology's got to shrink down in size.  It's got to come down in price.  And a developer story's got to build out.  Microsoft is cooperating with iOS and Android in terms of making this Azure technology  open source to them.  So whatever platform you're building on, you can use Microsoft's own technologies there,  which I thought was also smart versus a walled garden proprietary approach.  But yeah, still early days.  But who knows, five years from now maybe we'll actually have these simple glasses,  you know, like the company North makes them now where we have overlays of the real world.  I was bringing this up at Ignite where I was talking about how Microsoft obviously owns  LinkedIn.  LinkedIn is a social network built for professionals.  It's like Facebook, but serious.  But how cool would it be to be at a conference where you have your glasses on and where  you're walking up to people and you're getting their bio information just like a video game  would overlaying people so that you know who you're talking to.  This is part of vision.  What Microsoft sees as the power of LinkedIn is it's a directory that introduces you to  professional people.  And with AI can bring up information based on like what that person has interest in,  where it overlaps with you and all this kind of stuff.

Transcript:  One of the things that I like though, in theory as a feature was that if you were using it  with theoretically with the glasses, I can't remember who said this, but if you were using  it, your, your glass part would go dark.  So you could alert other people that you were using the augmented stuff.  Yeah.

End time: 7111.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  There's also the people don't like the idea of a camera recording, which I think is still  something that needs to be addressed.  But yeah, I mean, even Alex Kipman, who does Microsoft's HoloLens has talked about this  tension between augmented reality and virtual reality and how you solve it.  Because one of them is very good for gaming virtual reality, but one of them is good for  the rest of the world, which is augmented.  And one way you do that is you do have this class that shifts from light to dark.  Microsoft's working on this technology.  Other companies are working on this.  We've seen it.  There's electrostatic windows on airplanes that can do this.  So that technology is the next evolution.  So everybody's kind of planning this stuff out, but we are years from it before it's  a, you know, we are just wearing glasses.  But I point out a company in North, a Canadian startup, have glasses with a little pop-up  projector on the inside.  It doesn't have cameras on the outside, so it's not recording anything.  You wear a little ring that allows you to control notifications, connect up to your  phone. But it's literally a little heads up display as you're walking around, you can  see notifications, weather information.  And it's this nice sort of hybrid between what Google Glass was trying to be and what  we can actually do today.  But I think this stuff is definitely, you know, people need to talk about it, plan it.  What Microsoft is doing is basically building a foundation out for it so that when it  arrives, they're not caught flat footed because you got to build up the ecosystem around  it. And that's where they're doing right now.  So, I don't know.  I do think this future is going to eventually happen, but we're definitely years from it  being reality.

Transcript:  You're not paying attention, are you?  Yeah. Yeah.  I mean, I think there'll be a market for it.  I don't know. I don't know.  Here's a little campaign tip for you, Brianna, for your Congress run in  Great Britain. The Labour Party, which has been struggling for, I don't know, decades, I  think, is saying if you elect us, we'll give every home and business in the UK free, full  fiber broadband by 2030.

Start time: 7149.34
End time: 7159.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm thinking through that problem.  There's a big movement in Cambridge to have municipal broadband.  But like for a nationwide thing, I don't know.

Start time: 7159.64
End time: 7179.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This would require, I believe this would require nationalizing BT is part of the deal  here. So I think it's one of those empty campaign promises.  Although I have to say, I would vote for any candidate who said broadband for all, you'd  have my vote.  I mean, the Labour Party has a...  It's a little easier in the UK.  You can't do it in the US.

Transcript:  Because I know when I was in Long Island for a long time, and I can't believe I was  taking a side of Verizon here, but Verizon was going town to town trying to get Fios.  But they would have to go and get approval for each town.  And who was there finding them in each town?  Cablevision.  And so what ended up happening was Verizon would start building out the infrastructure.  They could start to do that, lay the fiber.  And then they were trying to get approval.  And then what happened when the towns were becoming cognizant of this, like, oh, wait,  Yuri built everything.  So now we can charge you a little bit more for it.  And so this is one reason.  And I don't know if Brianna knows more about this too, Massachusetts.  I know Verizon's pulled back its Fios plans here in Massachusetts pretty significantly.  As far as I know, there's no plans to build Fios anymore, especially out here in Central  Mass.  And that's the problem.  It's not like Fios is about to be installed.  No one's doing fiber optic, period, installation.  Now, cable has gotten better.  I use Spectrum here and they've actually been pretty solid.  But I would like to at least have the choice or knowing that someday I'll have fiber optic  routed to my house and there's just no no inclination that's ever going to happen.  That's I find that disturbing.

And I think broadband and access to it, that is a it is a it is you need it for your job,  you need it for your work.  It's it's it's not an optional thing in 2019.  I would say I would be very hesitant about giving government the power to to do that  in the way I would like to see it is encouraging more competition because we essentially  have a duopoly with Internet service providers in the country.

Well, did you get it yet?  No, but they have to trench and they have to get it.  Yeah. Oh, they're going to put it on the polls.  So that's the other thing that people are talking about is access to existing polls.  Brianna, is that is.  And some people, you know, telcos don't like this too much because that's competition.

Transcript:  Last story.  This kind of goes back to our data collection.  A health care provider in Pennsylvania.  Took one point seven, seven million EKG results from nearly four hundred thousand  people, ran it through an artificial intelligence and came up with an AI that could  accurately predict your chances of dying within a year, even if you have a completely  normal EKG, according to your physician.  The physicians have no idea why it works.

Start time: 7390.96
End time: 7408.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, actually, if a little problem is you had to have your EKG, but a point eight five  percent score, which is a perfect score, would like getting 100 percent correlation would  be one. If you just guessed, you'd have a point five.  So point eight five is actually better than any model physicians are currently using.

Start time: 7409.16
End time: 7436.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But we were we were talking about this earlier on something or else about about black.  Oh, the algorithms.  The whole black box thing with AI is the problem is that so it's like a glass is half  empty, glasses have full situation.  So AI is better at telling us if you're a healthy person, you could die within a year  of heart trouble or whatever.  However, the machines are not able to tell us how they're better than we are.

Start time: 7436.56
End time: 7468.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Because machine learning doesn't make rules in the way we understand it.  It makes a model.  And you're right that what the problem with this is a doctor can't figure out from what  the AI is doing, how to better diagnose heart problems.  They said the AI accurately predicted risk of death, even in people deemed to have a  normal ECG.  The findings suggest that the model is seeing things humans probably can't see, or at  least we just ignore and think are normal.  But it can't tell us.

Start time: 7469.64
End time: 7489.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The quote from the doctor is that finding suggests that the model is seeing things  that humans probably can't see or that we just ignore and think are normal.  It's still unclear what the pattern the AI is picking up, which makes some physicians  reluctant to use such algorithms.  Right. AIs can potentially teach us things that we've maybe been misinterpreting for  decades if they could tell us.

Start time: 7489.50
End time: 7507.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a flaw in humans because we say, oh, we don't want to use it if we don't know  how it works. But that's just the nature of AI and particularly of these giant machine  learning models.  It doesn't generate a human readable rule set.  You say don't use it because we can't determine what the rules are.

So there's like this sort of assumption that humans have, which is, well, we can  understand the universe.  But there seems to be this other issue of we don't know what we can't know.  So we think we are smart enough to know everything.  But it's sort of like how dogs can't talk, but they don't know they can't talk.  Yeah. And so there's just like this foundational issue with what the brain can do.  And related to that, getting to this AI stuff, in theory, we could create machines and AI  that someday could surpass us and know things that we can't possibly understand what they  know. And this may be an extension of that.  We don't we don't know.  Let me give you a thought experiment.

Transcript:  What if we could, using machine learning, create an AI that had perfect diagnostic  capabilities? Right now, you rely on your physician and your physician's imperfect  memory of everything she learned in college and medical school, reading textbooks, reading  journals. And of course, memory is far from perfect.  So she might well miss a symptom.  It happens all the time.  But the AI never does.  It's 100 percent perfect.  But you don't know how it works.  Which would you choose?

Transcript:  OK, let me let me give you one more, though.  What if that continues to happen?  And this is what we're talking about about computers getting beyond us.  So, Leo, you say I trust the AI, I trust the AI for A, B and C and D.  Then what happens when you're a decade down the line and you have absolutely no idea how  anything works?  You're a human being and you're basically in the Wali universe where the computers are

Transcript:  I often think about that. If you go back in time, say, 50 years and just explain the  technology we have and then it's like like people like, that's awesome.  Tell us how it works.  No idea. But you don't stop doing it just because you can't explain it.
