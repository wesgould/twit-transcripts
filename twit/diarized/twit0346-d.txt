Start time: 454.84
End time: 488.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's obviously very troubling for a company like Zynga who and they make a lot of different kinds of products  They make a lot of products that are very similar to products that already exist out there  So I think tiny tower clones right example so for them to take on something that's pretty original in the space  I think he's it so it's just pictionary it is but  Idea but it's it's I think it's I mean, please correct me if I'm wrong because I don't play a ton of iOS games  I know you stop playing looking at that. Yeah, we have an issue first one  That's really broken out. I think in that kind of space that's that's kind of captured people's hearts and minds

Start time: 512.22

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was good, so let's let Dan Hendricks who is our chat moderator I  Drawing the word model. So let's see. So this is part of why I do a great time  banks as well, by the way, this is why it's very successful because  you get to watch as  He tries to figure out what the hell it is. And sometimes I can't help laughing because I'm so bad

Start time: 547.34
End time: 567.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm such a terrible artist. I find really interesting is that a lot of could be a cello or a person  For example, he uses it to animate things  So he will use the and watch it in real time watch the drawing happen to use it  That's clever. That's an amazing. Oh, that's whoa mini movie of things happening. I'm like, wow, that's really novel

Start time: 567.32
End time: 579.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Start time: 583.36
End time: 589.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

End time: 626.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Variety of colors. Well, wait a minute now. Give me a break. I have to say I got really frustrated because I was lighting  I was playing around with Tom Merritt and he drew something so  Incomprehensible. Yeah, every time I go back to it. I can't figure out what it is  I just closed the app start over and play someone else  Why won't you play my game?  I am not going to

Start time: 629.02
End time: 674.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not going to this is another very embarrassing thing. She knows its model or he knows his model  But he won't put the L in he wants to see  So, okay, I'm gonna make some  Hypotheses first of all, that's one of the reasons it's successful because of this animation and this kind of  There's a little bit of a fun that's added just by being watching somebody  Yeah  And the other thing is because now there are some platforms like the galaxy know where you can use a stylist  But basically you're doing this with a big fat finger. No one is a good artist  No one is a good artist even good artists aren't good. Our Johnson is a very good draw something player

Start time: 677.88
End time: 683.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's the fun of it too is that  Part of the fun is being like that was the worst drawing I've ever seen Leo of a model

Start time: 684.56
End time: 695.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because we're working together with a competition in fact, I've actually had people on the next word, right  That was the worst thing I've ever done and then erase it and then start

Start time: 704.28
End time: 749.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The other thing that I think they did right is the Merv Griffin thing, you know  Merv Griffin is famous for Wheel of Fortune because he had this brilliant insight  That would be a fun game to watch if we made it if we design the game in such a way that the actual  Players had an incentive not to solve the puzzle the longer they go the more they make but the people at home  Quickly can solve the puzzle  So it makes the morons watching Wheel of Fortune feels smarter than the people playing it, right?  Right, and that's why it's successful because you go it's it's waste not want not waste not and they're  W I'd like to buy  Why you buying a valve so you feel good about yourself watching that show so there's a little bit of the Merv Griffin in there  This is too easy. I mean it really isn't a hard game. They give you the letters  It's not hard really right the only functionality

Start time: 749.86
End time: 758.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would like to see added and I think they said they were hoping to do this is to have a have a gallery  You can actually save your images, right? They just disappear so fast

Transcript:  I think you get a screenshot real crazy right to use against people later. Yeah

Start time: 763.76
End time: 769.56

Start time: 781.44
End time: 804.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They have a fairly small that's neat to draw the album art is pretty cool. I've seen people do that  They have a fairly small  Vocabulary, I think that's also intentional because the truth is they don't want this to be hard  If it's hard, it's no fun  It's like you not doing Tom's puzzle because it's like I don't know what the hell that is  So they did some things right? I mean, there's no question about it. It really was viral. It's only what six weeks old, right?  Yeah, how many downloads?

Transcript:  No, I'm just kidding Zynga has a history of buying properties. They did this with words with friends

Start time: 917.68
End time: 920.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They bought that into 2010 and they've converted that one

Start time: 920.78
End time: 943.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although if you look at their user base in like six months and it was already a very successful program  So it's like this makes perfect sense draw something, you know might not be the as popular as it is right now in a year  But for this year Zynga can promote all their other games  They can introduce little in-app buying stuff and they might convert people who come in to draw something

Start time: 944.34
End time: 948.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who haven't tried other games they might convert them into more gameplay. Yeah

Start time: 948.76
End time: 961.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you think it's at all suspicious that Mark Pinkus the founder and head of Zynga is spelling selling 15% of his stock  Or is that just well, I want to cash in I want to get a little money and he's 227 million dollars worth of stock

Start time: 962.95
End time: 964.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can imagine that they probably

Start time: 965.36
End time: 973.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Pay out from this right sometimes it's seen when I went out when a officer sells a big chunk and 15% is a big chunk  It's seen as a lack of faith

Start time: 974.12
End time: 982.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not really that huge though if you look at the  His voting power has a lot of control his control goes down less than one one percent

Start time: 982.92
End time: 1004.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's point four percent. So yeah, he's still kind of a stock. He's still pretty much in charge  Yeah, just with more money. Yeah, so this may be cause for concern its top three games accounted for  83% of its revenue in 2009 78% of its revenue in 2010, but only but 57% in 2011  So they are getting more diversified

Start time: 1006.24
End time: 1038.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because people get tired of games pretty quick, you know, yeah how long I'm kind of done with a draw something. Are you done?  I'm I'm well close to done so many games. I can't get around to opening up the app because I just panic. What's your  Complex yeah, it's like my one uncompleted game that I can't move past on so yeah, but I think it was smart for them  I just hope they don't change it too much change it for the worst  I think that's always the initial fear that fans of a game have when someone like Zynga they did with words with friends

Start time: 1038.22
End time: 1279.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They kind of got it felt a little bit got a little bit greedy. For instance. They added features that you could buy  How many tiles were left in each letter and all of that stuff which kind of spoils the game?  Yeah, and it was just a way to make money. Obviously. I'm sure they'll add some you know microtransactions to oh, yeah  Well, it turns out that's how you make money you give away the game and you do in-game  Transactions, that's where all the money is and in all of these games now  Which is good because it gives us a free taste of everything and then you can decide if you want to buy the fish  You're not we're gonna take a break. We've got we've got lots more with our great panel. Dr. Kiki Kirsten Sanford is here  Is Veronica Belmont is here Sarah Lane  So nice to have all three of you. I just feel like  the bump on a log or something  That doesn't mean anything don't try to analyze it too deeply  We're brought to you today by Ford the  Fort there's a new book about Alan Mullally that I've got to get is it American icon?  It's about I think that's the name of it about him as CEO coming into this company  Essentially a company that was a little bit on the rocks, let's face it  They were solvent but they but but tough times are ahead for the American car industry. That was very obvious  He was an engineer came from Boeing and really had an engineer's focus on  The business he structured it in such a way that they never had to take a hand out  They took no funds from the American government. They were the only one of the big three not to take money  Immediately kind of changed Ford's manufacturing focused on technology and boy what a result they've done such a great job  They've made Ford cars among the most reliable among the most high-tech  They've done such a great job and I think a lot of credit  I mean, it's a great company and I know Alan would be mad at me if I said a lot of credit goes down  I'm a lally, but he really is quite an impressive guy and one of the things he brought to the company  Here's the guy who designed the triple 7 cockpit the 767 cock all of the current Boeing cockpits were under his watch and you now  you take a look at what they're doing with Ford's and you can see the same kind of eye to  technology in the new Ford vehicles all the technology inside and  Also, and I've asked him about autonomous vehicles  He said no people want to drive their own car  But what he did point out to me said, you know in aviation what we do is, you know, you always have a pilot but you add  Technology to help the pilot fly more safely to fly better and that's exactly what they're doing  Take a look at the 2013 Ford Taurus for example and the curve control the car computer a hundred times a second  Looks at roll rate yaw rate acceleration lateral acceleration wheel speed steering angle  It's trying to figure out at all times  Are you trying to turn the car faster than it can physically turn because if you do it'll break free you'll lose control  And when it does happen when the curve control and it's very subtle  You're not gonna you're not gonna feel something happen. But when it does happen the curve control immediately  Changes parameters to make it safe. It reduces engine torque. They can apply four-wheel braking if need be in fact  They have the capability of slowing the car down 10 miles per hour per second  Which is quite a bit if you think about it that means from 0 to 70 in 7 seconds  That's a that's a big difference or 70 to 0 I should say  And it works on wet or dry payment  I mean, this is really sophisticated stuff and yet you won't even know it's operating except that you you have complete control on the curves  There's a good video on the site. If you go to ford.com slash car slash tourists. I can never find this  It's here somewhere of a car cornering with and without curve control and significant significant difference  You'll find it here ford.com  slash cars  Slash tourists as part of what makes the new Ford vehicles so amazing and I invite you to drive one at a Ford dealer near  You ford.com slash cars slash tourists to find out more.

They had a call and they said we're gonna we got 100 billion in cash  And we are going to do a dividend.

So it's not a huge  Amount of money Intel 3% Microsoft two and a half percent Texas instruments 2.1 percent  So Apple which has never wanted to do a dividend is still being kind of  Chimsy for people who own stock, right?

I thought it was gonna be complete  hokum bunk pseudoscience, but it's actually  really possibly true that the  that  The moon and the Sun had an influence on the wreck of the Titanic no yes  Okay, so here's how it worked the  At that particular time for some reason not some reason but that particular time  We just happened to be right in between the the Sun and the moon at the closest  And the moon was the closest that it had ever been before so tides were higher. It was a perigee  Yeah, so it's something it's like higher tides that makes sense  The closest that we that the moon was in some like like over a thousand years wow it was like a really close  orbit that year and  Additionally we were close closer to the Sun as well  So the gravitational pull the Sun and the moon had we had incredibly high tides  And so when the tides go out in the northern areas where there are icebergs  You know icebergs have the majority of their ice beneath the surface a lot of them get grounded  And so a lot of icebergs just kind of sit they get they they're on the ground the high tides  super high tides probably lifted a  Larger than normal number of ice and brought them back into the shipping lanes  and so because of the movement of the Sun and the moon and the planet and the tides  That there was a higher probability of the Titanic wrecking Wow and of course people who had

They did the same thing they sure did and they said they got a bunch of money from Google  So this is like people there are a lot of people saying oh, yeah, whoo wow so pathetic  It's like this isn't the first time that Yahoo's done this and it's certainly not the first time that other companies have done this  You know they're they're not the only company that's relying on a healthy patent portfolio to get some cash  But what's weird about it is Facebook buying  patents Facebook doesn't actually  Have rights to very many patents relative to other companies of its size  I think they only have about 65 before this purchase hmm got a bunch of patents that Facebook  Or I'm sorry the Yahoo is already licensing so they're not gonna get this is not ammunition

There are a lot of laws in place  For stuff like this that prevent companies from buying patents then to say hey, you know company B. They can't do that  They can't do that legally  But again these sorts of patents are just you know there's so many gray areas every patent needs to be treated differently  And there's such subtle nuances in the wording of things we don't know enough about it to know  What why Facebook is doing this but you can bet that they think that they can screw over Yahoo or at least get Yahoo to

End time: 5536.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

It started out as a 50 friend maximum social network  So now it's 150 still not big they have made some concessions based on you know user feedback  But it took him about a year to launch version 2 of path which took off like a rocket  I mean I always try out new products because part of my job and I like doing stuff like that  But I didn't like path until version 2 came out. No, I had no incentive to use it and now I have to remember to use Instagram  Hmm. I mean honestly, that's how much I like path. I'm in there all day. Will it change? Yeah, I am too

End time: 5735.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well the the way that it the way that it works is  Sustainable as well so that they wouldn't need it's just it's  powered by  Oxygen basically hydrogen oxygen and it's like a fuel cell. It's like a fuel cell and it and it and it  The platinum on the surface it it is maintained  So as long as that platinum is not degraded in any way there is a consistent fuel source  That's the catalyst to cattle yet to catalyze the reaction and the energy that's that's  That's released heat gets released and it's the heat that actually propels it propels it so it's a metameter  It's using metamaterials and so  Jellyfish have a band of muscle that they use to squeeze their cone and  That pushes water out of the cone that allows them to move and in this case  They're using a metamaterial that changes shape when it heats up Wow and then  When the heat goes away it goes back to its original shape and so the design is actually really smart because it could  last  For however long years just years it could keep going in the environment forever. Do you think it's

Yeah, just  And even if even if it was true the messages become so muddled over time that that like you said no one believes it  So I think I don't even believe it half the time. It's it's so it's such baloney  I think I'm totally behind Nick on this one  You know that we need some reform in this area and we need more information and we need more testing  I know it's difficult to test because you have to test each device on an empty aircraft by itself  Right and that is a lot of money. That's a lot of fuel costs. That's a lot of people time  That's a lot of using airplanes that need need to be used elsewhere
