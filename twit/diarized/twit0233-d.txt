Because maybe they could find something else to talk about.  Tom Merritt, he's an expert on the tech news because he does buzz out loud every day.  Hello Leo.  Hey Tom it's great to see you.  It's good to be here thanks for having me on.  I saw you at the launch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah that was fun.  I actually never got to touch the thing.  You didn't?  No.  Because you got too busy?  No I wasn't allowed in.  They restricted the number of people from CNET that could go in.  So Molly got to touch it but not you?  No no Brian Tong, Donald Bell and Erica Ogg.  Who the hell are they?  Brian Tong from CNET TV is our Applebyte host.  Erica Ogg News and Donald Bell Reviews.  They're like we'll let one from TV, one from reviews, one from news that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay I'm not going to say anything.  Go ahead say something.  I would put my celebrities on this one wouldn't you?  The big names.  It's like NBC got to go in and Fergley got to see it instead of Brian Williams.  It's like what the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's probably what would happen.  They wouldn't leave Brian Williams on the anchor desk.  That's where Molly and I had a lot more fun sitting in the studio making comments.  Yeah I can imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tell us how does it feel?  Does it feel sensual?  It does.  Like touching the supple ankle of a A-list movie star.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That ladies and gentlemen is the amazing voice of Mr. Patrick Norton who is also there in  his little bear hoodie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes I've gotten a lot.  That's from tadgear.com.  It's a bear hoodie and yes it is expensive because it is made in America by American  laborers who charge more than slave labor overseas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh man come on you're wearing some slave labor outfit right now aren't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is American Apparel.  I have no idea where this came from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is American Apparel actually made in America?  Mm-hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  LA.  It's a squirrely company for other reasons but they do employ workers in LA.  They strongly prevent them from organizing unions but hey who doesn't?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they pay them 50 cents an hour.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So really which is worse being a slave laborer in America or in Thailand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thailand.  Well technically you can't be a pure slave laborer in America depending on what you define  slave labor as.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess you're right.  John C. Dvorak probably would have something to say if he weren't so appalled by this conversation.  Oh it's terrible.  Shocked.  Shocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Paid laborers for their work.  Crush them.  Crush them now.  Crush all slaves.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that the right way to go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you're right Mr. Marks.  So we're actually not going to talk about the iPad at all today.  It's boring.  It's done.  It's over.  I don't care.  All right maybe a little later on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let the market play it out.  See what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well you know that was an interesting thing that David Pogue told me.  He said you know because what surprised me is how much hatred there was spewed.  Vitriol.  Vitriol.  Like Apple stepped on somebody's cat.  I mean people were pissed off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this was the point in my market watch column that ran on Friday for all of you out  there who want to read something decent.  What was the point?  That was really the point.  Why do you think people were peeved?  I think everybody had their pet little thing they wanted on the machine and it didn't deliver.  Everybody I talked to and everybody had their own pet little peeve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there was no way Apple could respond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a problem.  This reminds me of the time if anybody wants to remember way back but this happens every  so often.  Texas Instruments pulled something like this.  When they came out with the TI-99-4 you remember that Leo?  Sure.  Love that sucker.  It was missing a control key or something.  I forgot what it was.  There were some keys it was missing.  They just weren't on the keyboard and they were important keys.  And it was like had they rolled it out to show people the thing in advance like months  in advance and not made it such a big secret they would have gotten enough feedback right  there to fix all these complaints.  If Apple had rolled this thing out to everybody pretty much like a small beta.  So it got out, people saw pictures of it.  It wasn't really finalized and it wasn't really fully announced.  And people could come back and say hey I'm not going to buy this if it doesn't have  a camera or I need a stylus I can't draw on this thing or a million of these other complaints.  They would have fixed it.  They would have had a perfect pad but no they had to keep a big secret.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They wouldn't have had a perfect pad.  They would have had a tablet PC like there's 300 other ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The TI-99-4 was missing a backspace key.  That's pretty critical.  I don't think that the iPad is missing anything quite as critical as that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would say that was a backspace key.  It was stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The camera is not, you know what I tell you here's what I think is missing.  I think stylus no of course not.  See you have your one thing too.  Yeah but stylus is crazy.  I don't think lack of multitasking is a huge minus.  Frankly I've got multitasking on the Nexus One and it crashes it more often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was Hitler's complaint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah can I ask you this too often.  Godwin's law.  And the camera, okay it would be nice to have a camera but I don't think this is so much  a content creation device as a content consumption device.  It means that my biggest question is why they didn't do a 169720p device because movies  look like crap on this because they're so letterboxed.  That's to me that's the biggest minus.  See my position is it's not to replace a netbook it's to replace a Kindle.  It's a content consumption device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah or a Kindle or I'm trying to use my iPhone on the couch at home and the screen is too  small and I'm getting frustrated but I don't want to have to go pull my laptop out.  This is that device.  It's a pretty small niche.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah it's kind of an iPhone for senior citizens.  I think it's a good niche.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's a niche.  It may not be a bad niche.  I'll be watching, I'll be reading the New York Times on it, magazines.  I think it's going to be a great book reader.  Some people say they well LCD.  I don't know I think it looked like a nice screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I understand why they didn't put multitasking in because they don't want it in the iPhone.  This is the iPhone OS.  They may put multitasking in iPhone 4 when they finally figure it out.  If they figure out how to make it they may not.  Multitasking doesn't belong in a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know a lot of phones have it but I think it causes problems almost always.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I get why it's not in there yet and they could roll it in later.  In fact all the Apple guys apparently were dropping hints like crazy.  Like there will be more features in this before it actually launches.  That's interesting.  It sounds like maybe there will even be an OS rev.  They could put a backspace in it.  I don't know if it will be 4 but if it will be 3.5 or something before then.  But I don't understand why they didn't put a camera in.  Was it just keeping the cost down?  Yeah.  Is that all there is to it?  I would say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think putting that $499 price point was tough for them.  And I think they're right to hit that price point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Some of the people spec in parts are saying there's only $250, $275 in parts in it.  So that still leaves Apple a fairly healthy amount of profit in there.  That's true.  And it's an unsubsidized device.  So from what everybody is saying there should be money to be made on this.  I think I've got to go back a step Leo and say multitasking does belong on phones because it belongs on personal computers.  These aren't phones anymore.  This is far beyond a phone.  And case in point, this is not a phone.  I don't think it's a personal computer either though.  Well it may not be a personal computer either.  But the idea that if I have something going it's annoying to have to restart everything from scratch every time you launch an application.  You know what I mean?  It's got a good old fashioned DOS terminate and stay resident program kind of feel to it which is really annoying on the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We should point out that there is multitasking on the iPhone.  It's just that only Apple gets to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah and they only get to do it with the phone and to a lesser degree the GPS and to a greater degree the iPod.  The iPod does it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can listen to music and play a game.  I do it all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah no and it's great but it's only kind of like the lockdown stuff that Apple allows you to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well and I think that their point in that case would be it's nervous for us to make a phone that can be locked up.  I locked up my Nexus One for 45 minutes yesterday which meant I couldn't make a call because I installed a pod catching client that decided to want to download all of this stuff at the same time and I couldn't use the phone.  And so I can understand why you would make that argument a phone.  I agree with you Patrick.  The tablet is less of an argument.  I think the tablet has more power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I mean I've had my iPhone lock up without doing anything other than using the regular features that were put in there by Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's gotten more reliable though right?  It doesn't lock up really well.  Absolutely.  So I think that they're looking at reliability.  I wouldn't be surprised to see multitasking.  But I don't think multitasking, lack of multitasking is killer because I think really this is like, here's my use case.  I sit and I'm reading in bed.  Maybe I want to check my email real quickly or look at Twitter.  Get up.  I want to read the New York Times at the breakfast table.  Maybe look at the New Yorker or a magazine or the US or something.  Take it to work.  I have the chat room running on in the background.  You know you can watch movies and TV on it.  If you have a sling box, it'll put TV anywhere in the house.  You put the sling application on it.  I think that's a pretty compelling content consumption device.  That's my point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but people, they're on Facebook.  They're on Flickr.  They're moving photos.  I think basic web usage to this point for a lot of people involves content creation.  I mean if it didn't, they wouldn't have.  If they didn't expect it to be used for a significant amount of email or Facebook or whatever,  they wouldn't have basically launched it with their own keyboard adapter in place on that one.  Well, that was what puzzled me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought that was a mistake.  I thought that launching iWork and the keyboard kind of implied something that it's not.  They implied it's more of a computer.  I thought that was kind of a mistake to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, having used that keyboard on the screen, I mean it's not bad for an on-screen keyboard.  You're not going to do much typing.  I can type 80 words a minute on a real keyboard.  I can type about 15 on that screen.  So, you know, by having the keyboard, even if it is optional, it would be nice to just use a Bluetooth keyboard or something with it.  But by having the keyboard there, people who type and do entries, and there's a whole lot of people out there, moms and dads.  You should get a netbook then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you want a camera multitasking a keyboard, isn't that a netbook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But didn't you just, didn't Steve tell us that netbooks are pieces of stuff that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that could be Steve's opinion, but I don't think that's really where this market lies.  If you buy a netbook, you want all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the difference here is that it seems like Apple is making an appliance.  Yeah.  They are making a...  My point exactly.  They're making a blender.  And internet appliance for camp.  This is not for geeky people.  This is for folks who just pick it up in the store and go, oh, it does that.  Oh, it's so fast.  Oh, you know.  Exactly.  And then want to take it home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they spend a lot of time on MySpace, and they spend a lot of time on Facebook, and a lot of time on other...  You could use this with Facebook, I think, just fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This keyboard's good enough to do Facebook for Crying Out Loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or three or four characters at a time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you know what Facebook's going to have to do though is they're going to have to replace Farmville and all those Flash games and something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Calcans has the second version.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would replace Farmville.  It would be a good Farmville device.  I don't understand why...  I understand why Apple is...  Basically, Apple has said we're going to take a little hit because we want to kill Flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and that's interesting because a lot of people that I've talked to say they won't get it because it doesn't play Hulu.  And the reason it doesn't do Hulu is it doesn't do Flash.  So what's the answer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple says we're going to make it so that none of our portable devices support Flash.  We make...  There's 75 million iPhones out there.  What do you think Hulu's going to do?  Hulu's going to figure out a way to do it in H.264.  Hulu does crazy stuff though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like, we don't want it in Boxie, and we don't want people to watch anything older than five episodes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm certainly, as a content creator, making sure that we have a version that works on the iPad.  Wouldn't that be the smart thing to do?  Yes, because you're smart.  Well, that's Hulu then.  You can't...  I think Hulu will cave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Steve...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But weren't you just savaging the networks for not being able to make an intelligence decision about smart consumers to save their lives at a certain trade show a few weeks ago, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they are. They're morons.  And so Hulu could conceivably do something stupid.  That's what I think they could do.  I think Apple's point of view is...  Well, in fact, let me read to you.  Steve Jobs had a town meeting with Apple employees late last week.  This is from MacRumors.com following the launch.  Actually, it's from Wired.  Wired says, two of the things that Jobs talked about, Jobs says,  Adobe is lazy and blames Adobe for a buggy implementation on Flash on the Mac as one of the reasons they won't support it.  Quote, Apple does not support Flash because it is so buggy.  Whenever a Mac crashes, more often than not, it's because of Flash.  No, Steve, that's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No one will be using Flash, he says.  The world is moving to HTML5, and I do agree with him on that.  And I think this is clear.  That's what Apple's trying to do is get...  They don't want one company, Adobe, to have so much control, so they want to go to an open standard.  Unless it's them.  Yeah, unless it's them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Part of what's so sad, though, is especially so many large corporations, because of the level of perceived control,  it gives them over the content on the website, run everything in Flash.  And it's desperately unfortunate because it makes the pages load slower, especially the initial...  Accessibility goes to crap?  Accessibility goes to crap.  Depending on how good their programming is or their designers are, the accessibility across different screen sizes, waxes and wanes,  it's unfortunate.  And it's also an absolutely abysmal resource hog, especially if you tend to do silly little things like have 25 windows open.  100% CPU.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  YouTube has an HTML5 beta going on right now.  You can join it by going to youtube.com slash HTML5.  And all the videos will now be H.264 without the Flash wrapper.  Just do it and see what the CPU difference is.  It's like night and day.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, I know everybody who watches our live stream is watching Flash because our providers do it in Flash.  But if you watch on the iPhone or the Android platform, you stream stuff is not Flash.  It's H.264.  That's why it works on the iPhone.  We'll be sure to include that kind of a stream into an iPad application.  And I would imagine that everybody else, except maybe somebody stupid enough to say,  I mean, why would Hulu care about Flash?  They're not in the Flash business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't care about accessibility as much as they care about making a splash.  And so as long as people can watch it on their computer limited, they're fine with that.  They actually don't want it on the mobile platform.  They want to use it as a barker to get people to watch the broadcast.  So that's why they're not wanting it on Boxxy.  That's why they don't really care about it.  That's why they haven't come out with a mobile app that makes Hulu easily accessible on a bunch of different mobile platforms.  So they're fine with Flash because it locks it down for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't they understand that real competition is not mobile platforms?  The real competition is BitTorrent.  It's the pirate bay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they should.  And they should understand.  And actually, Hulu themselves understands this and wants the networks to understand it.  Right. It's just Fox and NBC that doesn't.  But they're fighting an internal battle about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John, you've been so quiet. What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just listening to you guys. You guys are all full of crap.  Oh, good. That's what I thought.  Tell us how it really is, John.  So essentially, all I'm hearing are excuses for the iPad as opposed to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I gave you a use case, not an excuse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, yeah, a use case. But it's like, you know, that's you.  I mean, you're like one of the most unusual people on the panel, considering all the fact that you're a tech maven junkie, as it were.  You're also doing probably the number one podcaster in the country.  And you have a lot and you are creating content all the time.  And you probably would be reading the New York Times at breakfast rather than talking to your wife and kids.  No, I don't want to talk to them. They got nothing to say.  And reading the thing in bed, you know, rather than sleeping.  You know, I just don't see a lot of people doing any of that stuff.  I mean, I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree. You might be right. I mean, we'll find out in two months if there's a market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I know. I mean, I could be dead wrong.  But I first, when I first discussed this thing on the Cranky Geek Show with all the other guys who had seen it,  it was like, well, you know, I think it's probably going to be successful because Apple is really good at marketing stuff.  But then after I started hearing the grousing, which is very unlike Apple mavens,  complaining bitterly about one thing or another, mostly little minor things,  and then realizing that this is essentially not a computer like I agree with you on that.  It doesn't run the Mac OS. It wouldn't run Microsoft Word.  It's essentially a giant iPod touch for senior citizens who the icons need to be bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think Apple is the Obama of the tech world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think that it's going to be interesting to say.  I'm now skeptical whether this thing can be as successful as they were they were hoping.  Nobody, by the way, no one's ever done well with this model anyway.  And I don't think they did anything outrageously different in terms of, you know, yeah, maybe reads books a little better.  But nobody has made a pad work.  I mean, Microsoft threw a bunch of money after it would just happened in the 80s and the 90s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but none of them were nearly as usable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, the user interface on this is really is very close to the only thing I see people really jacked up about is the Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what to me this is the competition for the Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's I don't see the right light shining in my face when I'm reading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, that's the problem I have with the Kindle is you have to have a light on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but it's like paper. You have to have a light on paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the Kindle is less fatiguing.  I mean, I've been reading books on on on LCD screens literally for like 15 years now.  I think the first one I read was a Neil Neil Gaiman Neil Gibson one of the Gibson sci fi book back in like 92.  It came on a three and a half inch floppy.  I ran it my my core to duo.  But it's you know, it's fatiguing on the eyes to read on an LCD screen.  I mean, we do it all day at work, but it's it's it's it tends to be people complain about it more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, somebody said that they said that, yeah, we read them all day at work.  But the last thing we want to do is come on and read more on the LCD.  We read at work. We read in a different way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't we're skimming around a book for a couple hours at a time.  We you know, we look at it. We look away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We read I don't think we'll know until I get it home, but I plan to replace the Kindle with it and then see.  I'll let you know. But I'm you know, you're right.  If it if it's fatiguing, I won't be happy about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I mean, Leo, don't take this the wrong way, but you're not going to replace the Kindle with it.  You're going to put the Kindle in a drawer.  Well, you're going to be selling it on Craigslist.  No, no, no. The Kindle.  Well, it's a fail. You'll be like buying a new Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't. Yeah, I don't.  I think the kid I've been ready for something to replace the Kindle.  Kindle is not a long term satisfying proposition to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I keep the Kindle right next to my bedside and I read paper on it in the morning.  I read books on it in the evening.  How is it for reading the paper?  I'll carry it around the house.  It's good if all you want is to read the couple of top stories.  Linearly. Yeah, it's not good for skimming or jumping.  It's not good for flipping through the paper.  It's not the same experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why I'm looking for the iPad. I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the iPad is good for that.  I think it's going to be a middling success.  I think it's going to be a little more popular than the Apple TV,  but it's not going to be nearly as popular as the iPod or the iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's why I say that Apple pulled on Obama.  Obama's pissed off people on the left because he's not progressive enough.  The right hated him because he's too liberal.  So everybody hates him.  Apple's done this basically.  What they've done is it's not geeky enough for the Apple fanboy geeks.  So it's pissed them off.  And then the Apple haters already hated it anyway,  and they're just as glad to jump on this bandwagon.  So you've got about 80% of the public going, this thing sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's a compromise solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but let's look at it from another perspective.  For one thing, the Apple fanboys do not,  and I don't know when this ever happened the way you're describing it,  but I've never noticed that they're discerning as a general public.  I think you're right.  They just jump on anything that, you know, Steve Jobs says it.  I don't know if they would have what they were eating or drinking or smoking,  but whatever it is, it's fine.  And they usually rave about stuff, and they jump all over people who are critical.  It's just not happening with this thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, I think it has been happening some,  or maybe we've just been reading different stories,  but I've heard a lot of,  Steve's giving people what they need, not what they want,  which is like one of my favorite marketing quotes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know it's funny because I said the opposite,  which is, this is not a device you need, but it might be a device you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And by the way, Steve, generally speaking,  historically, he's the one who coined that you should be selling the sizzle,  not the steak, back in the 70s.  Really?  He's always the guy who's giving people what they want, not what they need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the iPad is more sizzle than steak,  and I think there might be an analog to it in the Nintendo Wii,  where people said it's a horrible name.  Bad name, just like the iPad.  It doesn't do anything.  Right.  It's crappy compared to the competition.  Yeah, sure, it's cheaper,  but why would anyone buy a Wii over a PS3 or an Xbox 360,  and look who dominated the console market in the past three or four years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe. That's a very apt analogy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to disagree with this, too.  I guess I'm going to be disagreeable today.  Go ahead.  The Wii had some phenomenal new input devices.  I mean, the gyroscope and all the things you could do with that controller were astonishing.  People were just seeing something that was totally new,  so they started being hypercritical.  And it still has some of the best games you can play  and some of the cutest things you can do,  and it's always been oriented to younger people,  so kids love it,  but older people can play it without feeling too humiliated.  I don't think that the comparison is the same at all.  This thing is not designed for young people.  It's got nothing really special and unusual in it that the iPod Touch doesn't have,  so I'm not seeing this comparison as being valid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute, though.  Nickname is saying in our chat room,  and I think this is an apt question,  which do you think a child would gravitate towards?  Which would they prefer, a touchscreen device or a notebook or a desktop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Touchscreen device.  I'll tell you what, John, let's do a bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait. Stop.  Wait, wait.  I want to stop this question because it's specious.  The fact of the matter is I already said,  and they probably would gravitate if you said the same thing about a kid and an iPod Touch,  what I was saying about the Wii is I was introducing some new paradigms.  There's no new paradigm here.  It's just a big iPod Touch.  So this is not a valid thing to throw at me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but what if you say the iPod Touch and the iPhone were the promise  and that the iPad delivers on the promise simply by virtue of having a bigger screen and a faster processor?  That would be a laughable proposition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think there's a lot of people that are using iPhone applications that might actually welcome the larger screen.  I mean, there's been situations where I've said, you know,  if I could just connect a stupid keyboard to my iPhone, there's a lot more I could do with it.  You know, is it worth $500 or $630 to have that larger screen?  You know, I'm a little less stoked about it than I was on the day it released.  You know, but it's a nice piece of hardware.  The screen looks good. Everybody's wanting about 10 by 7.  It's very elegant.  They didn't need to do a paradigm changing interface because they already did that with the iPhone.  I didn't say that they had to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just saying for the sake of this argument that you've artificially created,  they would have to if you're going to compare it to the Wii.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you're right, John. I think that's where the analogy falls down.  I mean, there are a lot of similarities though in the appeal to different age groups  that don't normally buy this sort of thing and the fact that it's got a stupid name and all of that sort of stuff.  But I think you're right. I think you hit on the key difference, which is what is the wow factor?  There was a wow factor with Wii in the Wiimote,  and I'm not sure I see one with the iPad where people look at it and go,  wow, wow, I've never seen anything do that before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like what you said, Patrick.  The innovation already happened on the iPod Touch and the iPhone,  and because there's such small screens, you really don't see it.  I think that, John, there is innovation here. It's just that it's not new.  It's just bigger.  Bigger makes a difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just going bigger as innovation. I think that you're mis-defined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know that there's innovation. I think it's taking...the innovation was absolutely done on the iPhone  and to a much lesser degree the iPod Touch.  They've got a large application base in place.  They've got a lot of people looking to make money on the application base.  They have a huge population of people that understand and trust the interface,  and they basically...all the development for an entirely new platform has already been done on a freaking cell phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look, I mean, how many times you launch a new computer with 140,000 apps ready to go?  Every hundred and thirty-three thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw it as moving, it's unlimited apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was unusual. That's the most unusual thing about this launch.  That's never happened before.  No, that's huge.  Every computer you buy has more apps than the iPad and the iPhone.  Again, if I want to be argumentative, which apparently I do,  let me say that you're talking about 140,000 phone applications for a little handheld device,  and now all you're doing is just blowing them up as if that's appropriate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you're right. I played a game, Assassin's Creed, that was designed for the iPhone screen,  and when you blow it up, they say 2X on the button, but really it's 2X each dimension.  It's four times bigger and jaggy as hell.  So application developers are going to have to rewrite.  I don't know how hard it is to rewrite, but to really take advantage of that real estate, they're going to have to rewrite.  On the other hand, I think of a few applications that I love on the iPhone that would be great on the iPad.  I'm thinking of my Sonos remote control for the Sonos zone player would be great.  I'm thinking Mint would be fantastic, especially if you wrote it to have more information.  There's a lot of applications that would be very sweet on that.  Imagine what you would do with TweetDeck.  TweetDeck is too big for the iPhone.  You don't get those columns, but it's just a little more real estate.  Wouldn't that look nice on that screen?  I think that there's a jeweled, peggled...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because those things don't carry if it gets jaggy, it doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but jeweled would be beautiful on there.  It would be a great jeweled device.  Crossword puzzles, wouldn't it be great?  It's made for Sudoku.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't think it's going to be that hard.  I would love to hear email from people who are developing iPhone applications, but I don't see...  In some cases, they may have to do new texture maps, but I don't see a lot of applications having difficulty scaling to a larger screen.  Yeah, are they going to have to do a point release to do it? I don't doubt it.  It can't be that hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, I think if people in the chat room are moaning that we'd be laboring the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look, they hate everything.  We talked about Twitter, and they hated it.  Twitter? I'm supposed to tell you to stop now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no evidence that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the biggest story of the month, maybe the year.  Come on, we got to talk about it.  Yeah, but I think the subtopic is what they're complaining about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, we'll move on to the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do want to play SimCity on the iPad, though.  There you go.  And you already own it.  Because that gets really cramped on the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you already own it.  And when you plug in your iPad for the first time, all of those apps are going to transfer over.  Yeah.  I think it's going to...  Look, I don't care if it doesn't sell.  I'm not trying to argue you and convince you that this is a great thing.  I see a use for it, and I think that there is a market for it.  I don't know how big it is.  I loved the Apple TV, and that's been a bomb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I'm a big fan of the Apple TV, but I know it's not successful.  Oh, it's a huge flop.  It's a horrible failure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, according to TechCrunch, the Kindle sold three million units.  I don't know how accurate this is.  Millions is all Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was Amazon that was saying they've sold three million units.  No, Amazon said millions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amazon said stuff that led people to read the tea leaves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then Mike Arrington said, according to my sources, which have been accurate in the past, three million.  Well, three million in two years is not anything to write home about.  And this is an interesting point because Amazon is acting like they're in the Kindle business,  not in the book business.  Amazon has reacted very badly, in my opinion, to the iPad and has really started a turf war.  How is this?  Well, McMillan. You heard this whole McMillan story, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm not following this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, okay. So I'll talk about it in just a second.  We're going to take a break and come back and talk about it.  Good teaser, Leo.  You know, there's a problem, as I mentioned before, with teasing in a podcast.  It just makes people skip the ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but it was still you. You're a natural. You can't get away from being the pro that you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't help it. It's built into my radio DNA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nothing makes a tease better than pointing it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, you've been teased.  Now, please, don't fast-forward to the ad. What I was talking about is not that interesting.  This is much more interesting. We've got a brand new product to tell you about from the folks at Carbonite.  You know, I talk about Carbonite Online Backup, and one of the things I hear all the time from people is,  That's great, but it's for one computer. I would love to see something like this for the enterprise.  We, I'm very pleased. This is the first time anybody has ever told you about a brand new product from Carbonite.  I've been talking with David Friend and the Carbonite team about this for a year.  I'm really excited to introduce Carbonite Pro for small businesses.  You can take a look at it by going to carbonitepro.com.  Now, you're familiar with Carbonite Online Backup. It's the automatic PC or Mac backup designed for individuals.  It'll allow you to back up everything on your computer, all the personal files and everything automatically over the internet.  It uses AES 256-bit encryption. You set the key so it's private. 128-bit SSL to upload it so it's absolutely secure.  It really is a great service for individuals. We've been recommending it for a long time.  This is a new package for small businesses. Carbonite Pro. Don't need any extra hardware.  Now, you already have an existing backup solution, I presume, in your business.  This works hand in hand with it to give you off-site backup.  You get a centralized admin dashboard with backup status, as many computers as you want.  Each employee can access their own backup files, if you let them, of course. You can be notified.  Your office can be up and running in no time because each employee can go, okay, I'm getting my files back.  It is very affordable. It starts as low as $10 a month for your entire office.  I'm going to tell you how you can do it free for 30 days in a second, but let me give you an idea of how the pricing will work.  As an example, let's say you have five gigabytes of backup spread over eight computers, $25 a month.  Eighteen computers, five gigabytes, $50 a month. We're talking $10 to $50 a month for peace of mind for you and your employees.  That's less than if you got carbonite for each individual machine.  The additional admin features really make it a great solution.  This is a perfect solution if you've been avoiding this whole problem of off-site backup.  You didn't want to deal with it in your business. If you don't have an IT department and you don't want to have to become an expert in this stuff, a great solution.  I want you to try it free for 30 days. There is no coupon code needed for this because we're the only people talking about it.  They know if you go to the website, it's because you heard it on Twitter. Go to carbonitepro.com.  I really want you to try the 30-day trial and give them feedback.  This is really a preview for the Twitter audience and a chance for you to really take a look at what this new product from Carbonite is.  I'm just thrilled. I immediately installed it for our office.  We bought a $20,000 SAN storage area network. I thought that was very expensive and it died and lost all the data.  That's expensive.  Then I was told, oh no, you want it to be absolutely reliable so you don't lose data. That's the $100,000 version.  Oh, how could I have been so cheap?  I'm looking for a way to back that up and to back everything else up on our network and this is the solution.  Thank goodness. I wish I'd had it two weeks ago. Carbonitepro.com.  I'm really thrilled to be able to bring it to you for the first time anywhere on Twitter.  Here's the story, John. I think you'll be very interested in this.  I can't remember all their imprints. Henry Holt. Is Random House a McMillan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody's owned by Pearson.  Except McMillan.  No, I think McMillan is too.  So it's a division of Pearson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Simon & Schuster is CBS. That's the only one I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's so confusing. There's only three big publishers, right?  They're all gone.  So here's the deal. McMillan says to Amazon,  we don't like it that you set the price on our books on the Kindle. We don't like $9.99.  We want to charge $15.99 and oh, by the way, Apple's letting us charge whatever we want in the iBook store.  So on Friday, Amazon's response was to pull all McMillan books from the Amazon website, including print books.  And the only way you could get a McMillan book on the Amazon site is to go to a third-party seller.  You could not get it from Amazon.  Well, there you have it.  McMillan wants to go as high as $15.  This is the same battle that Apple had on the iTunes store with the music industry.  Remember, Apple wanted to keep it at 99 cents.  The music industry said, no, we want three-tier pricing, $1.29, $99.79.  And now the way Apple got it worked out was they went, they said, OK, we'll do it, but no DRM.  So when the iTunes Plus started without DRM, the new tiered pricing, everybody was happy.  We got rid of DRM and the record industry got their buck because basically everything's at $1.29 now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's really what they did.  Well, the story that everyone in the chat room says, Leo, Leo, Leo, Amazon cave, they cave, they cave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  According to TechCrunch, this is the latest.  And again, consider the source, Lena Rao writing on TechCrunch just minutes ago.  Amazon just posted an announcement saying it gives up, it gives in, you win.  Dear customers, Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, this is Amazon's old trick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, they did this before, didn't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Macmillan has a monopoly over their own titles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they publish them for crying out loud.  Macmillan, one of the big six publishers, has clearly communicated to us that regardless of our viewpoint,  they're committed to switching to an agency model and charging, I don't know what that means, $12.99 to $14.99  for ebook versions of bestsellers and most hardcover releases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That means Amazon doesn't get to be the wholesaler and the retailer at the same time.  That's what that agency model is about.  You're not a bookstore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You are a bookstore, in other words, because that's what happens in the bookstore, right?  Is it Macmillan says, this is the price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the price. That's why it's printed on the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and the bookstore does. If the bookstore discounts, it comes out of their pocket, not out of Macmillan's pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who pays the MSRP on a book? I mean, Borders does 30% off. Even the small bookstores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the way it works, as I remember, and John, you probably know better than anybody,  but as I remember is that the book publisher sets a retail price and collects half of that price as its money.  Whatever the retailer wants to charge above that half is the retailer's profit,  which could be a full 50% or if the retail wants to discount.  And in fact, Amazon discounts some titles and makes less money.  But I think what's happening here is when Amazon charges $9.99 in the Kindle, it's not it's cutting Macmillan's cut as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right? Yeah. And I didn't think that was the case. But that's what this implies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Amazon says we have expressed our strong disagreement and the seriousness of our disagreement by temporarily ceasing the sale of all Macmillan titles.  You know, can you say antitrust action? I mean, this sounds like this sounds legal to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where's the trust? You know, it's going to be questionable. Well, there's there's a the antitrust issue is the fact that they're vertically integrated and they have a device that nobody else has.  Yeah, they're not really a bookstore. But with the Apple machine coming out and and the and there's competition. Yeah.  You know, I don't know if you could make the argument is just mean spirited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't Amazon just change its pricing so that anybody who agrees not to put DRM on a book gets to keep 70 percent or whatever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They did. They flip flopped it. It used to be 3070. Now it's 7030.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. You just have to enable text to speech and not have DRM. And then you get the same model.  You can set whatever price you want. You keep 70 percent of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Amazon continues on to say we want you to know that ultimately, however, we will have to capitulate and accept McMillan's.  This is like the the cable war in New York City over Fox five.  This is like this sounds more like Guring.  Yeah, we will capitulate and accept. You just wanted me to do it in German, didn't you?  Oh, yeah. And accept McMillan's terms because McMillan has a monopoly over their own titles.  Well, of course, they publish them for crying out loud.  What does that mean? They have a monopoly.  Well, you can't buy a McMillan book from anyone else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Because and books are different in that way. Right.  Because, you know, once you if you write a book, you have the rights to sell that whole book.  Right. And that you could. But they don't have to agree to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, right. But they don't. Of course not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we will want to offer McMillan books to you, even at prices we believe are needlessly high for ebooks.  Now, that's a good point they're making. There's no print here. There's no truck. There's no ink.  There's no no remainder system. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to take returns and resell it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they're saying this is 15 bucks too high for ebooks.  Amazon customers will at that point decide for themselves whether they believe it's reasonable to pay 14.99 for a best selling ebook.  Apple, Apple. We don't believe that all of the major publishers will take the same route as McMillan.  And we know for sure they will now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you know, I have still a lot of friends in the publishing business back there in New York City and they hate Amazon.  And one of the things is not so much the the fact that, yeah, there's no printers, there's no trucks and there's no the rest of it.  But the problem is that what you have is you have a bunch of grousing writers and agents because the the typically especially with best sellers, which is what we're talking about here,  they don't take the kind of mediocre little royalties that you and I would get of maybe 10 to 15 percent of the wholesale price.  They take a piece of the retail suggested retail price and it's a big chunk.  Well, now, if the retail price goes from forty dollars to nine ninety five, well, who's going to be complaining the most?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. Now the writer gets what? Nothing.  Math is hard. I don't know what who the authors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK. Yeah, I mean, that's it's a fight that Amazon's been in since the 90s when they started undercutting the prices.  I mean, they they sort of were the leaders in this this business of chopping down prices on stuff, in some cases selling niche books for less than they paid for them.  Well, in order to grab business and independent booksellers were crying foul back then because they're like, look, we can't compete with this because they're just they're not going to be able to do that.  They're just they're not taking a profit on some things and driving us out of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me tell you a little story I heard today.  The last night, a major author was about to appear on a major network radio show and was shocked to learn that his book was no longer available on Amazon.  He couldn't list it on his website with his Amazon affiliate link, which, by the way, is a hell of a lot more money than we ever got for royalties.  And was furious and said he's you know, he's talking to other authors about a class action lawsuit against McMillan because he lost a ton of money because when he made that appearance, he didn't sell any books.  I mean, there's some authors want to be on Amazon, John, regardless of the cut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but you're talking about a guy if you guys make him most of his money on affiliate sales, he's not the same kind of he's not a Danielle Steele, I can assure you.  And the publishing business is just like any other media business where the big names, I mean, this is like the record industry, the show business model for the recording industry where Britney Spears brings in more money than almost everybody else and everyone else is a lost leader.  Well, these people, the Daniel Steele's and the Tom Clancy's and all the rest of the Grishams, these are the guys who these are the guys who wag the tail.  And what they say goes these other guys who are moaning and groaning, they sell 10,000 books, maybe maybe 50,000 books, it's nothing.  And they have no influence whatsoever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What if? What if Apple did on the e-book store what they did with the iTunes store and let authors sell books directly without a publisher?  And and let them set price as apparently they're going to do for publishers.  Wouldn't authors prefer that model?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you can already do that sort of by putting your book out as an app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could do that on Amazon, on Amazon even.  Oh, yeah, as an app on the iPhone store.  Right.  In fact, a lot of people do that.  In fact, I think the iPad might be a really good way to do that because you could do multimedia, you could put video and audio in an app.  You could make it a really cool book.  A book.  A book.  Well, that's the signage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think there's a future in that.  But not for these big names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, Danielle Steele doesn't know how to do multimedia.  Well, it's similar to the music business, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where the big, the big huge stars like John is talking about are really the ones stand to lose the most from the new system.  But the new system's coming.  And so all the battles are how do we get to keep as much of the money that we used to make under the old system in the new system?  Because this whole supply chain and publishing is just getting torn apart.  You don't need to have all of that stuff that Leo was talking about with the warehouses and the trucks and the middlemen.  Just like music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the same thing that happened in the music industry.  Anne Rice, by the way, according to who me and our chat room has posted on the Kindle forum saying she's thinking about doing that, going direct.  If you're a name like Anne Rice with a huge following and you said I'm going to put my next vampire book out by myself, she writes Jesus books now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if they're popular, put your name out and sell it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Didn't Stephen King have a and I believe it was pre Kindle.  Yeah.  Didn't Stephen King have a rather dramatic failure with this recently?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but you're right.  It was pre Kindle.  He published a chapter at a time and he wanted people to pay for it directly.  And he said, as I didn't make nearly enough money.  And so he chapter at a time when there wasn't a book reader, he also had a blackmail scheme because he said, like, I'm not going to finish the book unless enough people buy.  It was a real Laurel Roberts kind of.  Yeah, I don't know.  I like the idea of disintermediating the publishers.  But I also think that Amazon poses a real threat because this is fairly monopolistic.  They're trying to set the price.  And it's interesting that they're doing it now when the iPad, when the real competition is appearing from Apple as well as Barnes and Noble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and Sony's got a wireless Sony device now.  They're in the game again.  You know, they're not not behind the curve.  So then and the nook is out there too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if you can, I think the iPad sales will in the first year dwarf all three combined.  Yeah.  It doesn't mean people are using to read books.  Well, that's what Jobs said, isn't it?  He says who reads anymore?  Yes, right.  I'm not going to build a device for people who read.  That's like 20 percent of the population.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He also said video didn't belong in the iPod.  It's a little disingenuous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm again getting back to the iPad, I think, as a content device where you read a book or you read a magazine or you read your newspaper, you know, I mean, this can be pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's better for magazines, for periodicals.  Great for periodicals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Magazines and news.  And the Kindle really falls down on periodicals.  It's not color.  You can't skim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the news about Twitter today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We haven't pissed off enough people.  What's the latest from Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You need a bumper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Twitter bumper.  Let's see.  There must be some other stories.  I'll tell you what.  Let's take a break while you guys search for something to talk about.  Go to meeting friends.  Go to meeting from the folks at Citrix.  This is the way that I get out of traveling all the time.  You know, they're let's face it.  My ad agency wants me to go meet these clients all the time.  Right.  They say we got to go to New York.  We got to go to the jersey.  We got to visit people.  We got to meet them.  We got to press the flesh.  They just say haven't you heard of GoToMeeting?  Of course they have.  They sold the ad.  And they say oh yeah, GoToMeeting.  We should use that.  Yeah, you should use that.  GoToMeeting saves you time, trouble, and money traveling.  That could kill your company's profits with GoToMeeting.  You could do more and travel less.  Make those sales presentations.  Do the product demos.  Train.  Collaborate.  Just about any conference call is better with GoToMeeting.  I hold all my meetings with GoToMeeting.  I don't leave this room.  GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  You'll find out why.

We're going to, you know, I'm doing a big presentation at Macworld.  Macworld Live, in which we have a bunch of performers.  And we're trying to figure out, we don't have rehearsal time.  They're all over the place.  And I suddenly said, what do I mean rehearsal time?  GoToMeeting.  We'll do a GoToMeeting with everybody.  This is the best way to do it.  GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  You try it out and you tell me what you think.  We thank them so much for their support of This Week in Tech.  Is that, did John blank out his screen?  It's foggy.  It looks like a piece of, it's foggy in the, in the Vorak cottage.  He does that.  It's like he's, it's like he's going off and doing something in the same room.  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got a story.  Yes, sir.  Anybody catch the articles that Comcast is starting IPv6 trial?  Cause they're finally running out of IPv4 addresses.  No kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sky has slowly been falling for a decade now.  It's getting closer to our heads.  Slowest ever.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I know like the, the, you know, pretty much all the government sourcing,  and this has driven, I think, a lot of the IT industry to follow.  That basically they've been, everything has to be IPv6 ready.  That's been purchased by the federal government for several years now.  But yeah, there's a, I was technically, I was reading an article that basically says  they're looking for volunteers to be in IPv6 trials.  So they've been playing around with it for a while,  but now they're actually getting serious about rolling it out to end users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What the hell is Santa Claus in the house?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, dog tags.  The dog finally woke up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So how does that work?  I mean, is all my hardware and software ready to go and IPv6 compatible?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it depends.  Actually, John, it really depends on the hardware and software.  Anything you bought in the last couple of years in all the Microsoft and,  Do I just check a box?  and pretty much all the major operating systems should be IPv6 ready.  I don't think they're actually going to have to change the cable modem box.  It'd be interesting if they had to.  Or if they could push a firmware.  But they basically said they're running out of IPv4 addresses.  So, here we go.  Comcast plans four trials.  This is from the Ars Technica article.  The first one we use a transition technique is still under development called 6RD.  It's an automatic tunneling mechanism similar to 6 to 4 available.  That's available in Windows.  The difference is that R6D only tunnels IPv6 packets across an IPv4 only part of the service provider's network,  which is kind of interesting.  Then they're actually going to go to native IPv6.  The third trial will be basically IPv4 encapsulated in IPv6.  Oh, it's encapsulated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that means it'll still, I don't have to change anything.  Right, you don't have to change your router.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although it seems to be more on their network, the test for their network, more so than the end users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the issue with IPv4 was it had too small an address space because it's four dotted quads.  So that means 65, what is it, how many?  No, two trillion, I can't even know.  I don't even know.  Two billion addresses.  And that's not enough if everybody has an address.  But we kind of put off the problem because we were using routers.  So it wasn't like my refrigerator needed its own address.  I just had it on my local network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The providers themselves minimize the number of IP addresses.  They pooled them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But with IPv6...  There's a lot of shared addresses.  Right, because they have a pool.  You don't need network address translation because everything does get an IPv6.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's enough, Vince Cerf said there's enough.  I remember he talked about this on the screensavers, Patrick.  I remember that too.  There's enough IP addresses in IPv6's space for every molecule in the galaxy to have its own IP address.  I guess that's enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well they were saying, I guess from what Comcast was saying is like between, they've got like 25 million TV, 15 million ISP,  6 million Comcast digital voice subscribers.  And so the 16.8 million private addresses they're sitting on in their network space, in their assigned space.  No wonder they're running out.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This doesn't sound too urgent though because when you go to sign up, they say,  note that submitting this form does not guarantee your participation.  So they're not sounding a note of like, please, please hurry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you think about Comcast buying NBC?  I mean, here we are.  We all worked for a company that was purchased by Comcast.  Watched it go down in flames.  It didn't go down in flames.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it still exists in fact.  And there's some great shows out there.  There's some people that, you know, there's still...  Oh, you're being so diplomatic, Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, he's looking for work.  I must be. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I'm happily employed right now, John.  But I mean, it's also because I've still got some friends that still work on Attack of the Show.  And it's people say nasty stuff about Attack of the Show because it's not the screensavers.  It was never meant to be the screensavers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it was when it was first named the screensavers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but I mean, when they shut it down and relaunched it in Attack of the Show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I have to say, I resented that just the slightest bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But steering the ship towards the original question, do you think...  What do you think the problems with NBC being bought by Comcast are?  I don't think you're going to be analogous at all.  Because when Comcast bought Tech TV, they wanted the carriage.  And they bought it for G4.  It was like a little present for G4.  And with NBC, I think what Comcast is up to is they want someone to take over their channels.  They've got G4, of course, and they also have E, the Comcast Sports Networks, Golf Channel.  So they want NBC to run these channels.  I think they're like, look, you know what? Take these. NBCUniversal, run them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is an outstanding theory. I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but I don't buy it because the...  First of all, I think Comcast channels, some of Comcast channels are actually doing better than some of NBC.  And I'm grossly oversimplifying.  But NBC itself, NBC's subsidiary, the smaller channels on the network, are doing a lot better than actual NBC.  Yeah, but that's the point. They do that well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's a perfect example of what you take that model, doing that what you just described well,  and then dropping it on top of all these other Comcast properties.  Same management structure should be a winner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is they doing it for that, or are they doing it because they want a movie studio  and they want to be a larger presence on the entertainment side of things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's true also. I don't think it's an either or question.  Yeah, I agree. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, in fact, Comcast has had trouble with its content arms.  Remember Liberty, they spun that off. That was the content creation arm for Comcast.  They didn't want to really be in that content business.  So you're saying that they still don't want to be in the content business.  They're going to run NBCUniversal as independent, spin all their content stuff that they're trying to get rid of into that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think they want to be in that business, but they don't want to be the ones having to manage it.  So they buy the expertise by buying NBC.  Right, the core competence.  Similar to what CBS did when they bought CNET Networks was,  we want people who already do this to be the interactives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And just kind of let them go off and do their own thing.  Well, that would be very good for NBC.  Until next Friday's firings.  Yeah, we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll see, we'll see, we'll see.  But do you think there's a Comcast-NBC conflict coming as far as carriage on the internet?  If you've got a Comcast ISP and they start, I mean, are we going to have a net neutrality battle coming after this has happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if I were CBS, I'd be a little unhappy about the nation's largest cable company owning a television network.  Because don't they now have pride of place in there?  And don't, I mean, they're going to get sweethearts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, some people already have almost all of NBCUniversal channels, almost all of them are in primary.  They're in basic cable, not all of them, but certainly quite a few of them.  I mean, NBC, Telemundo, Bravo, USA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just hate it when I see companies merge like this because it just seems to me it's just going to be bad for competition.  I agree with you too, Leo.  Wow, John, you're a nice guy.  They're going to pull out a Hulu?  They might as well, right?  Because they've got Comcast as the fan.  What does NBC need?  The truth is, all of the people who are participating in Hulu, it's a very uneasy relationship.  They don't like Hulu.  They want to do it themselves.  CBS does it themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, because CBS has TV.com.  Right.  And so Hulu is like, no way.  No way.  You don't belong over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And NBC, I imagine, will just move to the fan.  Of course, if you're not a Comcast customer, that's not such a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or that TV Anywhere thing that Comcast is doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, right.  They're doing that now.  I can subscribe to my TV on the internet basically.  And any channel that I get as a Comcast customer, I can stream.  I can watch I Dream of Jeannie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's pretty compelling when you're just, you know, you get the thing, Mailer, and you look at it,  and you're like, oh, really?  It keeps me as a customer of their high price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you go to Comcast.net and you look and you can see almost anything that you can see on your television is now streaming on Comcast.  Which to me, it's not very good.  It's like Hulu.  It's like everything else.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, for the actually the made to the regular cable service, has it gotten better?  Because it used to be pretty atrocious here in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How's the HD quality of television shows on Comcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, on the on the regular cable, not the streaming online stuff.  The actual cable stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It looks OK. I haven't really thought about it.  It looks fine to me, but I'm an idiot.  I know. I can't tell.  I'm you know, I, I, I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you're not looking at it recoiling in horror.  No, it looks like high depth to me.  That means it's better than it used to be in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I haven't recoiled.  OK, there's no recoils or recoil lists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He does hold the remote to his shoulder though.  Oh, you're very important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't want to have the TV hit you in the cheek.  You get some real bruising.  I just a note from our chairman.  I think this is really cool.  You know, I have an old PC sitting right behind me that I've never really used.  I bought it when they did that two for one deal and I donated, you know, an old PC to some poor kids somewhere.  I don't remember where.  And and you get one for free, right?  Because I wanted to look at the old PC.  Well, there is now at Laptop dot org, the the the home of the old PC, a opportunity to do that.  Opportunity to donate your unused, even if it's unworking, old PC to Haiti.  I think that's a really cool idea.  If you have an unused XO laptop, you can give it to a displaced student in Haiti.  As we know, most of the schools fell to the ground.  A lot of students, even if they survived the earthquake, have nowhere to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you can still do the the buy and donate as well.  Oh, that's neat.  But yeah, I think it's a smart idea to say, hey, there's probably a lot of people who bought this to play around with.  They don't use it anymore.  Let's get it to somebody.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to I'm going to do this tonight.  This is really I'm really thrilled to be able to do this.  So if you go to Laptop dot org, their wiki wiki dot laptop dot org, LPC for Haiti and they give an address.  You can ship it there and the LPC core field volunteers in Haiti will distribute them as part of rebuilding around Port-au-Prince.  I think this is really neat.  This is really neat.  And they don't.  And is the original cardboard box required?  No.  XO XO laptops are quite tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They are pretty.  It's pretty hard shell around them.  I'll give them that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're not going to be able to give you a tax receipt.  You're not going to get a charitable deduction here.  Really?  Now, that's interesting.  Why not?  It says, you already do the legal reasons on a personal level.  We strongly appreciate your gift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think because when you bought it in the first place, you could take a tax deduction on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Charitable deduction then.  I don't know.  I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How much is it worth?  It's a good question.  It sounds fishy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John, you're such a cranky person.  You should do a show.  The good thing is we didn't know again the show this morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it turns out that right in, apparently Haiti is now sitting on top Saudi Arabia oil  reserve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really?  Well, that's good for us, isn't it?  Actually, you know what?  Oh, wait a minute.  This goes back to Adam's original conspiracy theory that the whole earthquake was created  by a giant machine under the ground so that we could march in, save Haiti, and then own  the country so when the oil reserves are discovered, we'll be sitting pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm the one who came up with the oil reserves and we're going to take over the country.  Oh.  He was the one with the earthquake machine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  It was a joint effort.  Another reason to listen to the-  It was a joint effort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Without joints, I might add.  That's surprising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's amazing.  And I'm not sure it's true in the case of Adam Curry.  It is.  It's amazing to me.  But anyway, he's always token on something.  Is it just a cigarette?  Yeah, he rolls his own.  Uh-huh.  So every time I've ever talked to Adam on Skype, just with audio, there's always this  going on and then matches laying.  So that's just tobacco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's a fact.  He used to, in fact-  He lives in Holland.  It's not illegal, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, he used to smoke a lot of dope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He stopped smoking it a couple years ago and he used to, even when he came over, would  mix dope in with his tobacco because he's a smoker.  That's a very Dutch thing to do.  And one time I was walking down the street with him, I said, what the hell?  How much marijuana you got in that thing?  And so he toned it down a little bit, but now he's got nothing.  Good.  Yeah, I think that is good.  Including no brain cells left.  Once you're past 20 years old, you shouldn't be smoking weed.  Noagenda.com.  Yeah, right.  Noagendashow.com.  Sorry, Noagendashow.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you guys run that whole thing on donations, and somebody told me that you're both making  a good living on donations.  That's what I thought.  That was actually my reaction exactly.  It might pay for the papers anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Should we talk about the Anti-Counterfeiting Treaty Act?  Acta, which has nothing to do with counterfeiting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or a trade agreement, not treaty act.  Well, it is treaty, and that's one of the reasons Acta is going on.  Michael Geist has written a lot about this.  He's the Canadian Larry Lessig, basically.  He's a lawyer, teaches law in, I think in Ontario, and writes a great blog.  And he was the guy who discovered the terms of this Acta Treaty, because they're secret.  This is a treaty that gun trees are being asked to sign, become signatory to.  And then, of course, because it's a treaty, it will be rubber stamped by Congress.  And it's a very clever backdoor attempt to get the three strikes law enacted, not just all around the world,  but here in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they already had three strikes laws.  Not that kind of three strikes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The three strikes I'm talking about, the Acta Treaty, this is so...  Oh, you're kidding me.  This is so horrible.  If you are accused, not convicted, not proven, just accused by a rights holder,  in other words, the record industry or the movie industry, of piracy on your internet connection,  three times, so they write to your provider once, you do it again, they write again,  you do it again, write again.  They have, without recourse to a court of law, without due process, according to the treaty,  they'll have the right to cut you off, your internet service provider be required to cut you off,  and then publish your name to a blacklist so that no other internet service provider can sell you access forever.  So accused three times of piracy, accused three times of piracy,  you now no longer have access to the internet for the rest of your life.  Isn't that good?  That's good.  Now, they passed it in France, and the only difference in France, the French parliament or whatever they call them,  Assemblée nationale de parlement de France, oui, said,  we're going to add one little, Philip, that third time a judge will have to review it before we cut you off for the rest of your life.  But the treaty, the way the treaty is written, they would prefer not to have that court thing, it just slows it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And also, the British one that they were talking about was particularly creepy,  because they were talking about a 50,000 pound fine if someone in your house is accused of file sharing,  starting, what do they call it?  I don't know if they had a name for this agency that was basically going to use RIA cronies or whatever the British equivalent is to go basically like RIA cronies.  Yeah, to go after anybody they want and enact new laws, having to deal with silly things like the legislature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this is a real clever backdoor attempt, because if it becomes a treaty, then the US just kind of rubber stamps it and it becomes the law here too.  So now they're having hearing, secret hearings in Mexico.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The seventh round of negotiations happened in Mexico this week.  You have to have secret meetings.  Yeah, because they don't want anybody to know what the rules are.  They claim that it's because it's a national security, that's what the Obama administration says, it's a national security issue.  Terrorists, terrorists, the downloaders.  We can't conduct fruitful negotiations on this important anti-counterfeiting agreement unless we do it in secret.  And we are doing it with the best interest of the United States in mind and all of that sort of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if it was just about counterfeiting currency, I would have no objection to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's supposed to be about counterfeiting goods, like DDIs.  Chinese counterfeiting, you know, DaVidians, various Louis Vuitton persons.  Yeah, they're slipping in all this IP enforcement that applies to the Internet that would actually make it a DMCA worldwide.  So you would have the same broken process where anyone can accuse anyone of copyright infringement  and have to have stuff taken down and used as a club without any kind of court supervision worldwide.  Anti-camcorder rules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the one where, that's also where they can search your laptop as you cross the border.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Border enforcement measures would go into place.  Statutory damages, which Jamie Thomas' case is actually fighting against right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She got cut down to $54,000.  But it doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just making available a file would mean that you could own hundreds of thousands of dollars per file you were accused of bringing across.  And it would not only have every country that signs under the treaty have to have these laws in place,  but also any country that's not part of the treaty would then come under a lot of pressure to join if they want to keep their trade negotiations.  And they don't even get to be a part of the secret negotiations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So right now Australia, Canada, the European Union, Jordan, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates are involved in these negotiations.  Switzerland and Japan as well.  And they're all being held secretly.  Thank goodness for Michael Geist, who has really kind of revealed this information.  Yeah, this is a nice website he's got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm looking at it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's great.  Really smart guy.  We interviewed him when I was up in Canada doing Call for Help.  And I just, people should read up on this.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation has an ACTA page as well, EFF.org.  And the more you know about this, the more appalled you will be.  You know, one of the things, I'll give you an example in Korea, South Korea, which was famous.  I know, John, you were just there.  Famous for its high speed Internet and its kind of open Internet.  They passed ACTA in the Republic of Korea.  And if they passed it, yeah, I think they have passed it.  And one of the things they ban is Internet hard drives.  So things like Carbonite, things like SkyDrive.  What?  Things like S3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That could potentially be used for naughty things, John.  We have to make it illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because pirates would use it to store content, you know, off of their system.  Well, that's dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And opposing ACTA or opposing the secret negotiation of ACTA or the provisions in ACTA doesn't mean you support piracy.  It means that you don't want to have people accused of piracy without actually having some proof.  And you want the punishment to fit the crime.  That's the way I feel.  It's not about saying, hey, we think piracy is cool.  And that's sort of the message that the RIA and the MPA want to put out there is if you oppose these sorts of measures, well, then you're obviously supporting the terrorists.  You're supporting the pirates.  And that's not what it's about at all.  It's about having fair rules that the way the DMCA works right now is ridiculous.  If I just don't like Leo, I can go and send takedown notices against him without any basis and hope that he doesn't have enough money to come back and prove I didn't have any basis.  And then I pull his content down.  I'm not going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've got to really fight this stuff.  These guys are nuts.  Just nuts.  Anyway, find out more EFF.org.  You can read about it.  You can read about and help fight it, too.  I'm a sustaining monthly donor to EFF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't send takedown notices against Leo.  That was just an example.  Please don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Please don't even mention that, that it's possible.  I'm not going to do that.  Please.  Hey, as long as we're unhappy with the Obama administration, here's some more good news.  Who's unhappy?  Leo is.  I'm unhappy.  Okay.  Well, let's just, because of ACT, and now this, with the release of the president's budget request, NASA will get the marching orders from, this is from the Washington Post, the new administration's marching orders, and there's nothing in there about going to the moon.  No more budget for the moon.  I thought they were going to go to the moon.  No, the budget kills the Constellation program.  This is the one that George W. Bush, my hero.  It doesn't fund it.  It doesn't kill it.  It just doesn't fund it.  You can go to the moon, but we won't pay for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's kind of what they're saying, right?  Yeah.  They're saying, privatize it.  If private companies want to go to the moon, we encourage that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It also kills the Ares I rocket, which was a successor to the space shuttle.  Already we've spent billions developing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that undermines Mars, because the point of going to the moon was not so much just to return to the moon, but to develop the ability to leapfrog onto Mars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Former NASA Administrator Michael Griffin views the Obama budget as disastrous for human spaceflight.  It means essentially the US has decided they're not going to be a significant player in human spaceflight for the foreseeable future.  The path they're on with this budget is a path that can't work.  I mean, yeah, I guess we're in economic trouble, but boy, it just seems like that's it's so little money really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they never wanted to do it in the first place.  I guess not.  I mean, there's that that latest thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's that?  Oh, you mean the puffin?  No, the latest thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want one of those.  They're going to privatize the whole space program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's all right.  Maybe that'll work.  The budget is boosted by more than a billion a year.  And that's what you're going to hear, of course, is that, well, wait a minute, what are you talking about?  We're increasing the budget by a billion a year, but they need three billion to pursue the human spaceflight program.  So it's underfunded, I guess.  But, you know, Paul Allen could just give them a couple of bill fund the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bill Gates, another couple of bill.  And that is kind of what they're hinting about is like we would like to push this into the private sector more.  You want to go to the moon?  Fine.  Get the rich people to go to the moon.  The rich people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the problem.  They're going to leave us here.  They're going to leave us.  We're all going to be alone.  All the rich people be living on the moon in their special moon penthouses, having super moon parties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I tell you right now, they're going to be freezing their butts off those people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, Paul Allen built that big yacht just so he could be the king of the party.  Right.  I think Paul should build a little moon unit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it is scary how little science we fund right now when you consider that we let the LHC go to Europe.  We have killed the space shuttle program.  So we're now relying on Russia to get up into space and back.  And now this where we're underfunding the one major project that we had going on.  Other than some very important and very good telescopes and surveys and missions like that, I'm not sure what we're up to and how we maintain a lead.  In scientific advancements and scientific exploration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I understand people say, oh, no, you got to spend the money here on Earth.  We're in crisis.  We've got a fiscal budgetary crisis.  And also we've got, you know, poverty and we should spend this money, you know, to support people at home.  But I think there's also some.  Is there not some benefit to the thought that you might want to leave the planet, find out more about the planet?  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, we've also got a, you know, we've also got a Congress that for several years managed to, you know, and it's just an administration that was against stem cell research.  We've got a population divided on what's appropriate medical research.  I mean, it's it's sad.  A lot of the advancement in science is just, you know, can't afford it.  It's not as popular.  It's not even it's not even not a for the people are outright against it, at least until so angry.  And then suddenly, maybe it's not so evil after all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We seem to have an anti-science bias that's kind of crept into the conversation largely because the educational system and I've argued this.  I've always thought Obama should have emphasized that to begin with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a vicious circle, too, because the less you're educated, dummies and then they don't understand it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, they just read this country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This country going back to Adlai Stevenson has always been anti-intellectual and anti egghead.  Right. That's that's kind of for way before Stevenson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Go back to Andrew Jackson, I think.  Was he an egghead? Yeah, he was.  He was the first of the presidents.  They're like, I'm not part of that liberal.  I'm smart pants.  I'm going to let my friends into the White House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He was complaining. He wasn't an egghead.  I think the first real egghead we had in office, which is a term, by the way, an enduring term that was used in the fifties by our parents, was Woodrow Wilson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was he was a professor, Princeton.  Actually, Adam is the president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Adam was an egghead on some level.  He was a functional lawyer.  John Adams was very smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I saw I saw the HBO TV show.  I know all about it.  It's a lot like Russ.  But Tom, I mean, look at this.  It's like Russ Pitts.  Exactly right.  I never thought of that. Paul Giamatti looks just like the producer, the web producer.  We used to have Russ Pitts.  It's the sideburns and the grouchy and the grouchy attitude.  Yeah, the demeanor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But but I mean, the Thomas Jefferson was was certainly he founded the University of Virginia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was studying architecture.  So when so so do you think we have the kind of do you think we have a bipolar relationship to intellectuals or do you think we the country is always killed them?  Kill them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We've gone from like 80 percent of the population living in rural environments to 80 percent of the population living in cities to to like 80 percent of the population living in the suburbs.  Now, I mean, the country has always been divided.  It has always had radical differences.  Even the founding of the company, the company, the country was one.  There's a Freudian slip was was like if you read about the battles that went on between the you know, the the northern states.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I say this as a parent about to have a senior in high school and to enter college and then another one shortly thereafter.  You think we could ever in this country do as say Sweden does and and and have free higher education or is that just really crazy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, we did have free education in the state of California.  And then the responsible for it decided it was much more important to preserve.  And there's there's two arguments.  This proposition 13 right proposition 13 was put in place in California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it was a property tax cap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's because they were killing us with property tax jackups.  Well, it was it wasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Which was because the value of the land was going up.  Right.  So people and I've seen this happen.  You know, you know, case in point like ranchers and there were a couple of ranchers near Vail, Colorado.  And because Vail would, you know, and suddenly like 1969 or 1970, they start this ski resort property values became astronomical.  So people have been ranching there for 100 plus years.  Suddenly there was absolutely no possible way to pay the property taxes on their ranches.  So they got pushed out.  Right.  It here in California, people who had been living in L.A., you know, in in Berkeley and San Francisco and all these other cities, Orange County, San Diego,  the property values started going berserk.  So people, especially people on fixed incomes, could no longer pay the property taxes, but have to sell or lose their homes.  So the idea was that, OK, we're going to lock this down.  We're going to in the end, we're going to lie.  We're going to cap the cost of property taxes.  But they did it for they did it for this for civilian.  They did it for people.  They did it for businesses.  So there's businesses that are sitting on unbelievable amounts of property that the property taxes haven't changed on them since.  What was it, John?  Seventy six, seventy seven when this was what was a while ago.  Yes, I might say, you know, and then you have all of the other expenses, the population explosion in California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, you had to stay on the property to get that deal.  You couldn't, you know, be jumping around.  I mean, you if you move, you know, you get reassessed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. But I mean, most of the people, if they move, they were moving to significantly less expensive places and more rural sections.  It made sense for older people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It made sense for fixed income people.  People were being taxed out of their homes.  I understood that.  But it also killed higher education.  I don't think so.  Here's another one for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They decided to come up with the lottery.  Remember when they started the lottery, it was going to be for education.  Our kids win too, was the slogan.  And so they bring up the lottery or the lottery or we're going to be a lottery state now and all the money is going to education.  So what do they do?  They yeah, they all went to education.  But the money that used to go to education, they just pulled the plug on it.  The education ends up getting less money.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If we go from hyperlocal to hyperwide, I don't think any intellectualism is a US problem.  It's a global problem.  I think it's always been there.  There's always been this sort of like bring down the eggheads sort of mentality that waxes and wanes over time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking as an egghead, I resent it.  Eat the rich.  It really bothers me when you say like, oh, you're so scientific about something.  Like that's an insult.  You're too intelligent.  Can you just dumb it down a little bit?  And by the way, folks, what you just heard for the last 10 minutes, that's what happens when we don't talk about Twitter and the iPad.  I just wanted to go crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We go crazy.  Let's talk about football.  Pro ball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good idea.  Bad idea.  How about anti virus tools?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You'd love to do a sports show, I bet.  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I worked on K and B R when it went sports.  The station I worked at in San Francisco, the last radio station I worked in.  No, not the last, but one of the last.  It went all sports and I just felt like a fifth wheel.  Man, I didn't know anything about sports.  That was a great tackle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  That was a great tackle.  So embarrassing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I had to be president of the Giants, San Francisco Giants fan club.  And we went up.  But you like baseball.  Well, I had to like baseball.  I made that my...  Baseball is a great sport.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got me the ball, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got you a special assigned ball?  Yeah, I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got my dad a Willie Mays autograph.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was cool.  Well, that would be cool.  We were campaigning to get the city of San Francisco to build a stadium for the Giants  because they were in the world's worst stadium, Candlestick Park.  And we got one of the faux trolley cars, the motorized cable cars.  Party cars.  Party cars.  And Willie Mays and I, and we went to every sports bar in town, and Willie would come  in and the crowd goes crazy because it's Willie Mays.  He's very recognizable in San Francisco.  And he'd say, vote for Prop W. And they'd go, OK.  And then we'd leave and we'd go to another bar.  It was fun.  That was fun.  That's a good night, man.  Yeah, it was a blast.  It was really, really fun.  And then I'm there, I said, Will, could you autograph this ball for my dad?  And he did.  So that was kind of fun.  How did we get to the rails?  Way over there.  Where the hell are the rails?  Can we smarty pants take a break and we'll come back and we'll find one more story or  two, I don't know, to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Perhaps even tech stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Please, Lord, give me a tech story.  The iPad sucked all of the news out of the room, didn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We could talk about Google dumping IE6.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think the Google Book deal is again on the rails.  But, you know, that's like talking about Acta.  It's another one of them subjects.  And it's like, let me talk.  This is a tech story.  This is something I like to talk about, audible.com.  I loves my audible.  Audible is the audio bookstore.  You know, it's funny.  I don't even know why they need to advertise because there really isn't any competition.  I mean, is there?  If you want to listen to audiobooks, it's like a no brainer.  You just go to audible.com and you're listening to the best audiobooks in the world.  I used to when I first started commuting to San Francisco, actually, it was before then,  before I did the tech TV in 98, I was commuting to Cupertino in like 94, 95 doing a TV show  for Ziff Davis.  That was a two and a half hour commute each way on a good day.  And I started, that's when I started listening to audiobooks.  But in those days, it was books on tape or recorded books and they were coming cassettes,  like 20 cassettes in a box.  You'd have one month to listen.  And if you didn't finish the book in a month, you'd have to send it back and get it back again.  Oh, it was a pain.  I was, when audible came along in 2001, my life changed.  And now I just, I am such an audible addict.  audible.com slash twit two.  You can try it.  If you've never done it before, you could try it.  Two books free.  audible.com slash twit two.  You'll go to the platinum signup.  That's two books a month.  The first two are free.  And because the Grammys are tonight, they've got a list of Grammy nominated books.  Yes, they do have a Grammy nomination for audiobooks.  So this would be, these would be the best books to look, listen to, you know,  according to the Grammy committee, Michael J. Fox's, always looking up the adventures of an incurable optimist.  Oh, how about this?  David Stratham and Richard Dreyfuss reenacting the Lincoln Douglas debates.  Now, now there's something for eggheads everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Distinguished record of service in the Illinois state legislature and had served a term in the lower house of Congress as a member of the Whig party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd love to listen to that.  So that's nominated for a, oh, how about the dramatization with Edward Herman, Sandra Oh and Michael Madsen of the Maltese Falcon.  I got to listen to that.  This is all from Audible and you get two of these for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you could say he was tall and pliantly slender, angularity anyway.  Talking about you.  He was erect and high breasted.  Her legs long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I didn't know the Maltese Falcon was so racy.  Wow.  Jimmy Carter narrating his own book.  We can't have peace in the Holy Land.  I hope that's not racy.  Oh, here's something very racy.  Carrie Fisher's novel book.  Is it novel or memoir?  Wishful drinking.  She's got a one woman show, the same name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it must be a memoir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's see what it says.  Carrie Fisher tells the true and intoxicating story of her life with inimitable wit.  Yes.  You can only imagine what Carrie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You want to fit in.  Hell, I still want to fit in with certain humans.  But as you get older, you get a little more discriminating.  Well, my parents were professionally committed to sticking out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's either all the Grammini nominated.  How about Nelson Mandela's favorite African folk tales?  Samuel L. Jackson, Whoopi Goldberg, and Matt Damon.  One of these guys is not like the other.  Dean Pitchford, Captain Nobody.  I never heard of that one.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what that was.  That can't be Captain Nobody there.  Sorry, Tyler just woke up.  Oh, hi, Tyler.  For kids too, this is a great thing, Patrick.  They've got kids books.  So you can put on a recorder and the kids can listen.  And studies have shown that kids who are listening to audiobooks read at a higher level sooner.  They get the chapter books sooner.  It's really a great resource for everybody.  I want you to go to audible.com slash twittoo.  Take a look at the Grammy nominated books.  Pick a couple there.  Maybe the January customer favorites.  This is one of the great things about the audible site.  It's a great way to browse.  It'll play on all your devices.  By the way, they will work on the iPad.  So you can move your books over as soon as you get your iPad, iPhone, Zune, Kindle.  Audible.com slash twittoo.  We thank them so much for their support this week in tech.  Are you doing, is the sword and laser book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we're finishing up Cory Doctorow's Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom.  That is not audible.  We'll be doing a new selection this month.  And it's open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you let your fans help choose the sword and laser stuff?  Yeah, we go back and forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sometimes we put it up to a vote.  Sometimes we take open recommendations.  Sometimes we get dictatorial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So how does it work?  You read Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom, which is a great book, and coined the term wuffy.  So you read it, and then do you have a book group of the year?  What happens next?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we have one episode where we set it up.  We talk a little bit about the background of the book and how it came about.  Maybe a little stuff to prep you for reading it.  Then you read it.  The next episode we do a wrap-up where we take comments from people who read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got an interview with Daniel Suarez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then sometimes we'll do an interview.  In fact, we're trying to get Cory to come on.  Oh, Cory will do it.  I'm sure. Yeah.  If he has time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, he'll do it in a minute.  Daniel Suarez. Wow.  Who's Daniel Suarez?  Demon and Freedom.  Demon and Freedom. Those are the next two books.  I just downloaded them. I can't wait.  You know him?  No.  That guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should read Demon, John. I think you might like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't wait. I'm so excited.  I know reading is hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can barely read the newspaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why you got to get audible, John. They read to you.  It's like having servants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When you get older, you can't read.  I can't read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He can't read anymore and he can feel his legs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, that's why I like the Kindles because I could make the type size.  Like every book is a large type book.  That's good.  One word on a page.  I take it to Denny's for the early bird special.  I fit right in. It's great.  A bunch of people like me.  More coffee, Mr. LaPorte.  I can't have any more coffee.  The progete is acting up. It's great.  It's really a pleasure to go in there.  I flash my AARP card and I can have all the bacon I can eat for $1.99.  You said Graminy Awards.  I did? It is the Graminy Awards, isn't it?  Isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the Graminy Awards.  Seven Graminy Award winning authors.  Graminy Hall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wasn't that where Tippecanoe and Tyler Tu sang their famous song?  Boss Tweed.  Boss Tweed, very good.  Shannon Tweed's dad.  You can't fool John with the American history references.  Founders of Tweeter.  Tweeter?  We just descended.  So the Google Book deal looks like it's down and out once again.  When is this going to end?  Never.  Never.  Because Google's got more money than God and Amazon is fighting it.  Everybody else is fighting it.  Basically the fight is over Orphaned Works.  Everybody agrees that if it's a public domain, Google should be able to scan it, sell it, do whatever they want.  But what if it's a book that's not in the public domain, technically, but nobody says, I own it?  Or even if...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is an issue.  Even if it's not orphaned, but you don't speak up, Google gets the right to sell it.  That's the problem.  And if you don't come forth to get the royalties within five years, the royalties get split up amongst Google and all the other authors in the business that have spoken up.  It's an opt-out situation for every author on the planet, whether you're part of the Authors Guild or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Ursula K. Le Guin wrote a letter on behalf of I think 60 other authors saying exactly that.  It should be opt-out, not opt-in.  You should be opt-in, not opt-out.  You should be by default.  You should retain your rights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Authors Guild should be able to make this deal with Google for their 8,000 authors, but not for every other author on the planet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that there's still a problem with these orphan works and it's very annoying.  These things need to be...  It's not as though...  Let's face it.  There's some book, let's say, it's written about 1945.  It's an economic book that's kind of interesting.  It might be of value to people studying the science.  And you can't make any...  It might be worth republishing a small run of maybe 1,000 copies.  This is not like something that's going to be a runaway bestseller.  It's not going to break anybody if they don't get it.  But if the thing just stays buried with one last copy rotting away in some library basement, I think it's ridiculous.  They have to be able to bring these books out.  It's not as though they're getting... that anyone's going to really get ripped off.  Who's going to get ripped off by some old orphan work that nobody cares about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If we didn't have copyright law extending for like three times the life of an average human, we wouldn't have an orphan works issue.  That's the problem. We need to fix copyright law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree. That's absolutely the case.  That needs to be changed.  But if Disney goes out of business, that'll be a possibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and now, of course, with the Supreme Court ruling that corporations can basically give all they want to campaigns, that's it.  Copyright law will now never change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because they'll push all of their candidates in that they want and it'll protect copyright law?  Yes, stooges.  Use the right word.  But yeah, it makes it harder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's been... the general rule of thumb is that the more money you have to throw at a particular political issue, the more likely you are to win in the age of television and other mass mediums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought it was an interesting debate though with the Supreme Court because it is a form of speech to give money to a political campaign.  Sure.  And I mean, we do protect speech. Is a corporation somehow not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Back in the golden age, in the golden... excuse me, the Gilded Age, but back in the 1870s, 1890s, I mean, the people that...  If you scale the amount of money that Bill Gates' work, it's a pittance compared to a bunch of the people that were running the railroads and the oil industry.  The Vanderbilts and you look at the amount of money that was going around back then, it's already was decided over 100 years ago that corporations had the same rights as American citizens in the courts.  So, you know, in some sense...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's the problem. Are corporations really people?  Corporations being treated as people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If they're people, how can we can't arrest them and throw them in jail for murder when they kill people with their crappy products?  They're made of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Therein lies the rub, John. They have all of the upside of being a citizen and none of the downside and the ability to let the corporation can move on while the officers of the corporation get to take the rap for the decisions made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why I'm a corporation, baby. You better believe it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, even the officers don't have to take the rap. In some cases, if a corporation like John says conducts murder, it's just a fine. And nobody is at fault.  Nobody goes to jail for murder because it was a corporation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And if they really start to declare bankruptcy and shut the corporation down before they get viable for what they've done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which they shouldn't be allowed to do because that's euthanasia, which is illegal with a person.  I'm just saying this is a classic example of a stupid idea.  It's bizarre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it may be a stupid idea, but it's been the law of the land for over 100 years.  It's been the field law of the land.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a 5-4 decision. It's not cut and dried. Obviously, there's more to it.  And it did overturn several precedents, previous Supreme Court precedents that said corporations...  Which is a little weird.  Because money as speech is a tricky issue.  Well, we all know conservative judges are not activists and in fact are not making law.  They're just upholding the Constitution as they see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if I have more money than you, I have more speech than you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you have a lot more speech.  So the Supreme Court is saying speech isn't equal.  You've got millions of dollars of speech.  That's a good point.  Tough luck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the flip side is this is also America.  You can start a company, become rich and then use that money you've made to be as free speechy as you want, Tom.  Want more speech? Succeed.  Well, that's fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Except that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We should be the ones talking.  Of all the people that have a lot of extra free speech compared to the poor guys in the chat room...  We've got an infinite lead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look at speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, you may have free speech, but if you cannot go to Gmail and create a label named Buzz...  Yes and no.  Well, look, see it says you cannot... I'm doing it right now.  It wouldn't let me do it.  You can't create a label named Buzz.  It's a reserved system label.  Oh, there's a good backstory there.  But I created a label named Buzz.  No, look at mine. See right there.  I know. I'm looking at mine too.  Please try another name.  Well, you're... because you know why you can do it?  Because you're the host of Buzz Out Loud.  Okay, here's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When you do it in the way you just did it, it says no, but if you just go up into labels and say...  Oh, you found a label loophole.  And press create new...  What are you guys talking about?  It says the conversation has been labeled Buzz and then it's labeled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And now you have a Buzz label.  Yeah.  What is bizarre.  But why would they care? Why would Buzz be a reserved label?  Why would it be a reserved... I think there's something going on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the new programming language.  Although when I click on that label, I say there are no conversations with that label.  See? See?  See?  There's a column there for you, John.  It could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have one called Go.  Maybe they're really going to do Go Buzz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I understand deleted messages would not be a good label because the system should have that reserve.  Right.  Are they planning on putting some Buzz label in the reader software that overlaps with Gmail or whatever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe it has something to do with ringing the phone or shaking it.  The Buzz tag just left. It just disappeared on its own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mr. Google found you.  No kidding.  That was weird.  How dare you create a label?  The Google police.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The folks who discovered this were the folks at Google Blogascope, which is an excellent blog about the Google sphere.  He says, looking up the word blog, Buzz in Google, we get several definitions.  I don't know how that helps.  What does it mean? Does anyone know why this could be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They better be careful how they use it because CNET has a trademark on some users.  Really? Buzz Out Loud?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The word Buzz by itself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yahoo had a Buzz Report.  You can't do that.  CNET has a show called Buzz Report, hosted by Molly Wood weekly.  It's a video show. They had to stop it.  Very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe Yahoo should get out of the house more. Everybody knows that show existed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All they had to do was Google search on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't Buzz like a generic word? How can you really own Buzz?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the actual just the word Buzz. Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People always ask me, and I like to answer this once and for all, if they can use This Week In for their podcast.  Of course they can because Mel Allen says it's all right.  Mel Allen?  With This Week in Baseball, which predated this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  Mel Allen. How about that? How about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not quite.  No, I'm working on it. I haven't heard Mel in years.  That's pretty good considering I haven't heard him in a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know who took over for Mel Allen on This Week in Baseball?  Here we go again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Buzz Bre- Oh, there's a tie-in.  A tie-in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Off the track once again, ladies and gentlemen. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This show is never on the track. Google says you can't use IE6.  They're phasing it out for Google Apps, Docs, and Sites.  So France, Germany, and now Google say IE6 is verboten.  And stopie6.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there a website?  Yeah, there's a movement.  Good. It's about time we stopped IE6.  Really, IE6. What is the point of anyone using that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what? Google's stepping up and doing no evil.  First they're nuancing their relationship with China. Now they're dumping IE6.  I think it's all under the do no evil banner.  It's all good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who is it that's saying Google is evil? Apple.  Steve Jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What he's saying is that the stuff in China was BS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It may not be a direct quote.  That is a very huge interpretation of secondhand article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is that wired story. We're getting back to that one.  It was so good we want to do it twice.  It's the burrito of stories.  Jobs says on Google, we did not enter the search business.  They entered the phone business.  Make no mistake. They want to kill the iPhone.  We will not let them.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also, MacRumors is saying we heard the same story so we know it's true that Wired reported.  And we heard some other things from this town hall that was Steve hosted on Friday.  Apple will deliver aggressive updates to iPhone that Android Google won't be able to keep up with.  Ha ha.  iPad is up there with the iPhone and Mac as the most important product Jobs has been a part of.  Asked about the Lala acquisition.  Apple says they were interested in bringing those people into the iTunes team.  This is a Steve Ballmer quote, if I ever heard one, from Steve Jobs.  Next iPhone coming is an A plus update.  Is that a what?  A plus update. Is that a term?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A plus update. A plus update.  That Steve Ballmer said this?  No, Jobs said that. But it's the kind of thing Ballmer would say.  What's going to happen? Well, Ballmer's got the Zoom phone coming out so that'll save the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is a little rumorage that that's going to be the case.  Somebody found some Zoom phone-ish kind of code in the kit and so forth.  I think that's not a good basis for anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think that means that they're going to manufacture advice.  It means they're trying to work the Zoom software into a phone system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. What Paul Therotte thought is it merely means that the media player in Windows Mobile going forward at some point will be the Zoom software.  And that makes sense.  Microsoft's already said that, so there's nothing new there.  New iMacs for 2010 are going to take Apple to the next level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really? Big news.  The next level.  I guess Jobs' quote was actually, don't be evil is a load of crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Wired article says, I want to go back to that other question first and say one more thing.  He says this don't be evil mantra, quote, it's, I can't say it on a bowl of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if you go down to the update at the very bottom of the story, there's a person from the audience who disputes the BS quote and says, all he said was don't be evil is a load of crap.  Well, that's close enough.  In some way, he related don't be evil to feces.  We're not sure exactly how at this point.  Now we're turning into CNN.  To poop.  He wore a black turtleneck, Tom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you think this is a significant extension of the Apple policy?  How do you feel about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is from the Wired article about Adobe.  They're lazy.  They have all this potential to do interesting things, but Adobe just refuses to do it.  This sounds to me exactly like Steve Jobs.  I mean, if it's not, it's exactly how he talks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, on one hand, like, yeah, it sounds like Steve firing up the troops to get the to gird their loins and go into battle and take over the universe once again.  But the reality is, is flash has been getting now is basically been heavier and heavier load on the system.  They've had the opportunity to offload a lot of the CPU processing to graphics for quite some time now, and they're just now getting around to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say that in some ways I'm really encouraged to hear Steve talking like this.  Clearly he was really pumped up from a successful launch.  What he considered is deemed a successful launch on Wednesday.  Obviously he wasn't reading the blogs and felt good was a fine fettle.  And it sounded like he just really kind of he was he was in a good mood.  This is Steve. This is how Steve talks when he's in a good mood.  Feeling good again.  Yeah, he's feeling his oats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so he's black.  He laid down a gauntlet in the iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, he basically, you know, we were talking about this last week.  He laid down a gauntlet earlier this week.  He basically said, Look, we're the biggest mobile device manufacturer in the world.  Go suck at Nokia.  Look at the amount of money we made in Q4.  We're doing great.  I mean, he threw down against the entire mobile industry right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He did it with some some suspicious numbers, but he did it.  You know, you know, but good for him.  Good for him.

It was right after the release of the Macintosh.  And Apple was trying to reassure the Apple II faithful that they were not abandoning  the platform.  So they had an event called Apple II Forever.
