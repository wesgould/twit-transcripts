Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They sold four. I know some people who bought these because this was a very fast tablet designed to, for gaming primarily, Android tablet.  And a lot of people were singing its praises.  But those sold between July 2014 and July 2015, which is now, might have a little problem.  You should look for the battery section and see if it's B01.  If it is, you can use it.  If it's Y01, you should arrange a replacement as soon as possible.  Our public service announcement on behalf.  I have the Nvidia Shield Android TV and I love it.  It's great.  That's the newer one, right? It's kind of like a game console.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've played it. It's pretty good. It's not bad. It's mostly like PlayStation 3 games like last year.  It's older games, yeah.  But they're fun and there's not a lot of hiccups.

Transcript:  I have to say, I think Microsoft finally got a version of Windows that is as good as Windows 7.  Windows 8 was a little bit of a disappointment.  Huge. Massive.  This is pretty good.  Now, they said 67 million people so far.  14 million in the first day did the upgrade.  I think that that's limited only by...  Yeah, this is a touch.  That's limited only by Microsoft's bandwidth, I guess.  Because there are roughly 600 million people who would use this.  This is the new Edge browser.  Not really ready yet.  Doesn't support plugins.  And so for that reason, Microsoft continues to include Internet Explorer.  And everyone will still use Chrome.  And immediately, what did I download?  I downloaded Chrome, of course.  It's one of those things.

Start time: 356.97
End time: 369.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You have infinite funds.  Just work on it and get it ready when you launch something.  Because making someone use something else in the meantime is going to make them forget about whatever new thing you're going to do.  Once they already put it out of their mind, when they get something new, they're going to forget about it.

Start time: 369.73
End time: 396.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it's an interesting question.  Because when they first announced that they were going to release Windows 10 in 2015, they said fall.  They said later in the year.  And then all of a sudden, contrary to everybody's expectations, they said, yeah, July 29th.  And I have a feeling that they still intend to finish it and fall in the fall.  You know what I mean?  Threshold 2, which is the big service pack that will still be out in the fall.  Mary Jo Foley said this on our Windows Weekly show.  It's probably really the final version.

Start time: 398.19
End time: 412.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's some things that I'm kind of a little irritated by.  There's like no real compatibility between Office and Windows 10 itself that is any different than Windows 8 and Office.  It's just kind of like they haven't leveraged all of their OneDrive cloud system.

Start time: 415.10
End time: 417.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently OneDrive is still troubling too on Windows 10.

Start time: 418.46
End time: 426.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just seems as though the Microsoft Windows team and the Office team aren't really quite communicating the way they should.  It's kind of a crappy user experience.

Start time: 427.89
End time: 477.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Microsoft did want to ship it with Skype built in.  Still doesn't.  You have to download a copy of Skype.  I think the next version probably will.  And I already took the Candy Crush Saga tile off of here.  But good news, Candy Crush Saga is not downloaded.  It just puts a tile up saying, do you want it?  And you send it.  They'll then go to the store and download it.  It feels fast.  It's snappy.  It probably should be at least as fast, if not faster, on any machine that can run Windows 7 or 8.  I think it's beautiful.  I think it looks good.  And I really think bringing back the start menu and getting rid of the charms bar does a lot towards making this a very usable Windows.  Instead of the charms bar, now they have an action center which has customizable little icons in the bottom so you can customize it to do the things you want.

Start time: 477.48
End time: 482.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How often do you find yourself with that machine actually touching it in day to day use?  You know, surprisingly a lot.  You see, I'm touching it now.

Start time: 483.00
End time: 486.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm touching it now.  And you even reached out to touch it.  Yeah.  And this is a Dell XPS 13.

Start time: 487.02
End time: 496.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's a nice little gimmick to be able to touch it.  But I've played around with the Chromebook Pixel a bit over the last year or so.  They've got the touch built in, but I almost never use it.

Start time: 607.00
End time: 680.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There were two big stories and I suspect we're going to see a lot more.  We're not done seeing these.  Complaining about two things.  One is Wi-Fi sense.  And Brian Krebs, who is, you know, I think a great security guy and very trustworthy  in his blog Krebs on Security, I think kind of got it wrong warning people that  Windows 10 shares your Wi-Fi with contacts.  Now he did write this story July 15th, which means he wasn't using the final version of Windows.  So let's give you the rundown on Wi-Fi sense.  First of all, this is an interesting technology.  The idea originally was to log you into captive portals, those hotspots that require you to see a start page and log in.  And they were going to fill it with dummy information.  So it's kind of automatically getting you on open access spots.  But the other thing it does is it shares or says, and Brian says will do, is shares your Wi-Fi password with friends.  So when friends come over, they don't, you know, in the password you'd have to do if they wanted to be on your Wi-Fi.  We do this with visitors to the studios.  We either say the password is and now they have your password or you if you want to be kind of protective of it, you take their device, you log them in.

Start time: 681.30
End time: 687.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or in most people's homes when you get there like to read it off the back of the router, like when they go behind the TV.

Start time: 688.44
End time: 725.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so the idea of Wi-Fi sense was that you could turn it off.  First of all, you'd have to turn it on and then it would allow anyone who's in Skype or Outlook or Hotmail or but you'd have to have a Windows 10 device, either phone or a Windows 10 computer would automatically get onto your Wi-Fi network.  They wouldn't get your password.  It wouldn't store your password.  It would be a kind of a token that allows you that could be revoked by you later.  But what Brian got wrong is, first of all, you have to turn this on.  It is turned on by default by Express settings.  But then you have to go network by network and say, yes, share this network.  If you don't do that explicitly, it doesn't do anything.  I think this is not an issue.

Start time: 726.08
End time: 761.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's maybe a little bit maybe a little bit alarmist.  It's still a little unclear.  This is actually a feature that debuted in Windows 8.1 and really wasn't ever very popular.  They kind of refashioned it in 10.  And I think the passwords and all that stuff is just shared over encrypted networks anyway.  So I don't know if it's a super, super big deal.  But I mean, this is Microsoft is promising continual security updates downloading in the background of your operating system so you don't get like alerts all the time.  So if there was any issue, you know, this should be something they've already addressed.

Start time: 761.08
End time: 777.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I just I don't think there is.  And anyway, I'm not sure there is.  I can tell we talked about a little bit on security now.  Steve Gibson wasn't sure.  And, you know, as I've played with it, I just feel like this if you if you have to opt in twice for this to happen, if you have to opt in twice, plus it's all sent over encrypted.

Start time: 778.01
End time: 779.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a token and secure.

Start time: 780.52
End time: 789.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Now, if somebody comes up with an attack, I'll say I was wrong.  Maybe that's what Brian is assuming is that there's some sort of fundamental insecurity that might be taken advantage of everything.

Start time: 790.18
End time: 809.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Everything can get hacked.  First of all, and second of all, I don't even really know why you need that besides the fact of just one to happen really quick, because normally most people know their passwords.  You say if you got to go to that one person's house, you know, at the back of the router, whatever.  But why even give someone the opportunity to find a hole to drill in to get in through something else?  Like we don't have enough holes already in things.

Start time: 810.74
End time: 853.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Brian does update his blog post with a rebuttal from Ed Bott at ZDNet.  And I think that Ed wrote a pretty good rebuttal about this.  We've had it on many times.  I think he's smart.  I think Brian's smart.  And Brian, I think points out probably prop properly that there are potential problems here.  But it is you have to opt in several times.  You're asked several times.  You want to do this?  You want to do this?  The other one that we're going to see a lot more of and is a little bit more insidious.  It started with the Boy Genius report.  It's about the Windows 10 EULA.  Here's an example of the kind of headline we'll be seeing a lot of in the next few days.  Windows 10 is spying on almost everything you do.

Start time: 855.36
End time: 860.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As is Facebook, Google, the entire Internet, your phone.  Like the NSA, your moms.

Start time: 861.08
End time: 863.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Like everybody's spying on you.

Start time: 863.06
End time: 898.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There definitely is a tendency across the technology industry to do more sort of crunching of data within the cloud.  And like, you know, your operating system in places you thought traditionally would just be sort of an offline experience,  like all done locally on the machine.  And we're now offloading a lot more of that to the cloud.  Like there was a big blow up when the newest version of Mac OS 10 came out  because the spotlight search now sends all of your inputs to the cloud,  even if your intention is to search for documents on your machine.

Start time: 901.52
End time: 984.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so I use Siri or Google Now or I presume Cortana.  All of that is sent to the server.  So I think that that's the point.  And here's where it's a little deceptive.  So Boyd Genius Report quotes a paragraph from Microsoft's EULA that does sound scary.  Finally, we will access, disclose, and preserve personal data,  including your content, such as the content of your emails, other private communications, or files in private folders,  when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to, one, comply with the applicable law,  or to respond to valid legal process, or two, protect our customers from spam,  or three, operate and maintain the security of our services,  including to prevent or stop an attack on our systems or networks, and four,  and this is kind of interesting, this comes from an actual case that Microsoft had,  a problem with protect the rights or property of Microsoft.  They had a Microsoft employee who was leaking to the press,  and they went into his email and got in a lot of trouble for doing that.  They said, no, we won't do it again. We'll have some third party do it.  In fact, they say this, we will not inspect a customer's private content ourselves,  but we may refer the matter to law enforcement. That's in regard to piracy.  So what's deceptive about just reading this paragraph is you're reading it out of context.  They're referring to OneDrive. They're not referring to your personal hard drive.  They're referring to networked stuff. And so I think...

Start time: 985.26
End time: 989.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's completely standard for all types of Dropbox, Box, iCloud.

Start time: 991.63
End time: 1015.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they have access to it. They're required to give it to law enforcement, period.  So in a way, this is upfront of Microsoft to point this out.  But at first, when I read this at first, and I even talked about it yesterday on the radio show,  I'm kind of embarrassed because I said, oh my God, they can look at our hard drive.  No, there's no evidence that they can look at your personal files.  This is stuff that goes across the Internet. But you read it at a good point, Mark.  More stuff goes over the Internet than maybe people realize.

Start time: 1017.16
End time: 1044.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. And it's just that's the direction that everything is going.  I mean, even Apple, which is almost made like a marketing stance out of we respect your privacy and your data.  Even they're moving more toward sending more data to their cloud to sort of give you a better profile and give you better answers.  But the trade off is that it's going to the Internet, which you're giving up some privacy in that process.

Start time: 1045.02
End time: 1091.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. I think the question is really if it's going to that company, if it's going online, if it's going to their cloud,  I think really the question should be what are they doing with it once instead over there? Right.  If you want Spotlight to search both the Web and your computer locally, it's going to have to.  It has to. And if you want Cortana to do the exact same thing, if you want Google Now to do this,  they have to know what those search terms are so they can reconcile whether that's something online,  on the Web or that's something locally on your laptop, on your phone, on your tablet, whatever it is.  Right. So I don't really think it's the question of are they doing it or not is a bit of a moot point.  It's like, OK, they're doing it. What are they doing with that data once they get it? Right.  And like you said, Apple's made that stance. We're going to be you know, privacy is going to be number one.

Start time: 1092.08
End time: 1112.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're not going to exploit you. The only way, though, you can do that as Apple is by not having access to it in any way.  Because if you have access to it and you are presented with a legal subpoena or warrant, you don't you're doing business in the United States.  You have to give it to them. You can't just I mean, I know Twitter and others have said, well, but ultimately they always have to give it.

Start time: 1113.06
End time: 1120.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Twitter has gone to court to protect certain people off and they lose. You always lose because that's the law.

Start time: 1120.86

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But wouldn't it be nice? I mean, OK, so with with all the prism stuff, with all the NSA stuff,  what we kind of found out is that almost every single one of these companies at some point was complying with the NSA in some respect,  whether we like it or not, whether they fought or not.  What would be nice is if they just tapped us on the shoulder and said, hey, Nate, the NSA wants to look at some of your stuff.  They're not allowed. We're going to do it with a national security letter. It says specifically you can't tell anybody.  But you can't speak on it. But these are laws that are made by our lawmakers. These are laws are made by our well, we need to go to lawmakers,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  not Apple and Google and Microsoft would go to lawmakers. I think this is Microsoft properly saying, hey, you should know they're doing what they need to do.  And I think they're doing as much as they can. Law enforcement asks us, we have to turn it over. You should know that.

Transcript:  If you don't want to get caught with something, don't put it on your device and don't put it on the cloud.  Don't put it on the cloud is the case. I don't understand how people just don't get this anymore.  Like when people get hacked for things over and over again, you hear about celebrities, all these things.  Even dumb people can see at some point someone getting hacked. If there's something you care about, don't put it on a place that can get accessed online and don't send it to a place where it's stored online.  And if you want to change it from murders last week to puppy kittens. So when it comes to a search filter, it doesn't get red flagged or something.

Transcript:  Well, and if you and if you want to preserve your privacy and you want to put stuff on the Internet, there's only one way to do that, in my opinion, which is to encrypt it before it goes out of your machine.  Yeah, yeah.  Encryption is the solution. Strong encryption. A lot of that's a disinconvenience. I can't send Owen a message unless we've exchanged keys ahead of time.  Actually, it doesn't have to be ahead of time, but you have to have a mechanism for getting my key to read messages I send to you, vice versa.  Phone call, a text message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Privacy.  But there are companies who are trying to do things like BitTorrent has an application called Sync, which is peer to peer file sharing with encryption on both ends and an exchange of keys.  They're not actually ever seeing the files. They just create the protocol so you can send stuff.  Although that's a consumer friendly application.

Start time: 1242.14
End time: 1281.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's never been open source and nobody knows how BitTorrent Sync works.  This is so you're trusting that BitTorrent. I do trust them.  I wish they'd open source this or at least let somebody audit the code because they've never.  Steve Gibson has asked many times, well, how does this work?  And they've never revealed that.  No, they haven't.  But there are things you can do to encrypt your data.  I probably wouldn't use Microsoft's BitLocker.  Use an open source encryption program.  I wish TrueCrypt were still around, but something like TrueCrypt.  And you can protect yourself.  I think the other thing, though, is tech companies have to make a strong effort not to have this information to share with law enforcement.

Start time: 1282.89
End time: 1299.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what does that mean?  Because if they're providing services where we store our files and our information, we rely on them for both our personal lives and our work lives.  What don't they store to give us better services so they can more quickly recognize what we're asking for and give it to us in a timely manner?

Start time: 1300.57

Transcript:  They should encrypt the messages end to end and they should encrypt files.  But when they want to sort of be able to analyze our information in order to do the types of things that Google can do that everybody loves with Android and show ads.  But also sort of some of the personalization stuff.  They need to be able to look through the contents of your email and your contacts.  Google Now is worth it.

Start time: 1322.62
End time: 1338.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As far as I'm concerned, have at it, Google, because I love Google Now.  It's worth it for them to take my stuff.  But just understand, anything I'm giving Google is available to anybody, including the government.  Just don't give them stuff I don't want them to have.  So you're right, Nate.  In order to give you these services, they have to do things like that.

Start time: 1339.26
End time: 1376.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In order to build the things that we're asking them to build now, we're still using for free, largely, even though we complain about the privacy issues.  It's a bit hypocritical for us to use this stuff and then be like, oh, I don't like the way that you aren't respecting my privacy and the way that you're not...  You're complaining with the government.  It's like we should be pressuring lawmakers to be more transparent and to be more straightforward.  And then if you don't like the privacy compromises you're making, you shouldn't be using the things in the first place.  But it comes down to a better consumer understanding.  I think a lot of times we give up more than we realize that we're giving away.  Maybe that's why these articles are important.

Allegedly.  Allegedly.  I'll add allegedly on it.  But to the point when I'm just giving the other argument for what other people say, well, what about the criminals?  They're hiding in the Internet and they're in your Facebook and they're in your inbox.  There are times where they do catch people doing things online, allegedly or not allegedly.  So, you know, if we create all these laws where no one can get information and there's bad people out there doing stuff, you know, like I said, I was just giving the other side of it.  I agree.  Privacy.  I'm just saying that when something bad happens and you catch somebody, now it's oh, thank you, Jeebus.  But when you don't like the shady stuff going on in the world.  So, right.

Transcript:  Well, it goes it goes both ways.  But like, like, kind of as you brought up somebody saying Owen played the Jared card, which is difficult.  I mean, it just goes down to transparency.  If a cop wants to come into my apartment, they have to go and get a warrant.  And then when they knock on the door or knock down the door, they have to present that warrant.  Yeah, due process.  That's all we're asking for.  I don't get to see the warrant.  But if I am, I do.  Right.  They can still come into my apartment and rifle through my stuff.  But I have that layer of protection.

Transcript:  Judicial oversight.  We can have that for online, too.  And to say that we can't, I think, is just just a bit lazy and disingenuous.  I mean, we don't have that now.  And the people who are rifling through our stuff online don't want that extra layer to be there.  So if we want that as consumers, I think we have to take a stance.  Right.  We have these protections exist in some of our offline worlds.  If we want some of these things on online, I mean, you know, our lawmakers aren't going to be doing this for us.  It's going to have to come from us.  It's going to have to come from.

Transcript:  We need the same time subpoena where the cop shows up at my door and he shows up at Facebook's door like, look, we're about to rifle through your stuff.  Same time. So everybody knows what's going on, because I do understand that point extremely.  Right. So I'm not knowing.  Yeah.  So figure out that at the same time thing where it's like, look, you want his information, call him or send somebody out there right now.  Let him know that we're about to do this and let's do it.  Yeah.  If they're going to knock down my door, they don't just tell my landlord.

Transcript:  Actually, this is fun.  I'm excited about this.  Our show today brought to you by Whispersync for voice.  It's an innovation from Amazon and Audible.  Amazon sells ebooks.  You read on your Kindle.  Audible sells audio books.  And I did this with the Goldfinch and I loved it.  You can add narration to your Kindle ebooks.  So this was so cool.  I'm reading on my tablet.  I downloaded the Goldfinch in text and I downloaded the audio on my paper white.  And as I'm reading, I'm listening and it's highlighting the words.  By the way, great for early readers, for young people learning to read.  But it's also cool because you can switch where you left off.  So if you're in the car listening to the book and then you get home and you want to pick up your Kindle,  you could pick up and read it on your Kindle.  It knows where you left off.  So you're always going to pick up right where you stopped reading.  It's a great way to enjoy those books you've been meaning to read, but you haven't had the time.  I like Kindle.  I like Audible.  Together, it's awesome.  You can learn how to add narration to your Kindle ebooks by visiting a special page we set up for you.  Amazon.com slash twit.  You can do it right on Amazon.  You buy the Kindle book and you'll see Add Audio Companion.  By the way, it's usually less expensive to buy both than it would be to buy each individually.  You switch between listening and reading on the Kindle app as well as on your Kindle tablet.  And there are now 60,000 Kindle bestsellers and popular titles with WhisperSync audio built in.  I like doing this and I do it a lot now because I do sometimes like to read it and sometimes I like to listen.  For those who like to do both, WhisperSync for voice.  Learn how to do it at Amazon.com slash twit.  And once I figured it out, I kind of started doing it more often with a lot of books.  It's a really great way to go.  We're talking tech.  Mark Millian, Nathan Oliverus Giles, Mr. Owen J.J. Wilson.  I think enough about Windows 10.  We kind of covered it, right?  Don't have to go obsessive about it.

Windows 8 was a massive pile of a word I can't say right now.  So why would they charge you for 10 when they've just burnt a ton of bridges  with 8?  I mean, I feel like they had to give it away for free or 15 bucks or something.  I mean, charging $300 after all of that.  They last a long time of charging people when they shouldn't have.

Transcript:  This really is a new era for Windows.  We talked to Terry Meyerson, who's the head of Windows, for a story in this week's  Business Week.  And he told us about how this is, I mean, he said, let's just say nobody's working  on Windows 11 right now.  That's fascinating.  Here's Windows 10, and we're going to keep iterating on it constantly.  And you should expect.

Transcript:  But this is the last version of Windows as a statement, because I've heard Microsoft  say that.  I've heard a lot of tech reporters say that.  I don't really understand what that means.  It sounds really, really great.  It sounds really cute.  I don't get what it means.  In fact, with HoloLens, which is going to run on Windows 10, that thing's not supposed  to come out, I think, maybe until.

Transcript:  But you think this time next year, Microsoft isn't going to say, hey, we have some really  hot new stuff for you.  We have a new big upgrade.  I think we're going to give you 10.1.  I mean, you know, like to say it's the last version of Windows 10 ever.  They'll do 11.

You can't just tell me, oh, I got a new, the condom's not the same car, I mean, but it's  new.  But its features are different.  Like, you've got to name it something.  You've got to change it.  Yep.  It's going to happen.  Regardless of what they say, which again, sounds awesome, they're going to change it  to something because people need to hear new because the human brain now is accustomed  to new.  It might still be called Windows 10, but yeah.

Transcript:  They'll be in a, you know.  It's the last version of Windows in one sense, which is that desktop operating systems are  much less important than they ever were.  It's much more like, I don't care what operating system I'm using.  Can I, maybe Office becomes more important just because of that, because that's what  you use as a tool.  And in fact, they're doing that on any operating system, including Android, iPad.  Maybe that's really the solution is, because we don't, you don't ask what's the  operating system of my car.  What's the operating system in my microwave?  It's a, technology has become an appliance.  Although people I think do know the difference between iOS and Android, don't they?  I mean, that's a very clear distinction.

That's not going to, that's it.  You are official owner of Windows 10 as if you had paid money for it.  You'll get forced updates, by the way.  You have to update it from now on.  You can defer an update, but you can't defer it forever.  And then I do believe after a year, I think on July 29th, 2016, you'll get a free update.  They're going to start charging.  They've said that they will.  I think they are.

It's shrunk, and it's basically the field of view is just within a rectangle in front of you.  There's no borders line.  It's like you're looking through a cereal box.  So if you see something in front of you, you're like, oh, wow, look at this cool digital image.  And then you turn your head slightly left, right, and it falls out of your peripheral vision.  And it kind of just takes away from the whole experience.

I was saying AR is going to be the thing, the HoloLens style thing where you impose images on a real world.  But now having used VR a little bit with the Galaxy Gear VR,  I actually bought the thing with my Galaxy S6 and watching movies and stuff.  The cardboard?  No, no, no.  I have it.

Yeah, Oculus is using, I didn't know this, but the Note was the engine for the Oculus.  So it's not like they ported it.  That's actually how it works.  And cardboard.  Did you do the virtual press conference that OnePlus did for the Galaxy with the OnePlus 2?  I did do that.  How was that?  It was cool.  So you put on cardboard?  Yeah.  And you're looking around?  Yeah.

No, not quite.  It still feels like you're just watching kind of a 360 degree video.  It doesn't quite feel like you're there, but it's cool.  It's cool.

Have you played with it?  Have you used it?  I've only used it one time and it made me sick, but obviously all that stuff's been fixed, apparently.

Start time: 2650.00
End time: 2735.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no.  It still makes people sick.  In fact, on my Gear VR, when you download apps, they actually have a nausea rating on it.  Like, okay, for most people, no, this is going to make you sick.  Seriously, because I get a little queasy.  What I find is I get more queasy if I'm moving around, if I'm sitting still.  It's because my body thinks that I'm...  My eyes are saying I'm moving and my body's not.  Or vice versa.  Yeah.  I think that's what causes it.  So when I'm sitting down and like there's a Cirque du Soleil video and you're being surrounded...  The performers are all around you and so you can look behind you.  And if you look at them, they act as if they suddenly are performing for you.  They're looking right at that, whatever that is, that ball camera.  Position.  And it's really cool.  Now, Nokia announced a new one called Ozo this week that is a ball camera that's coming out in the fall.  Of course, GoPro has one.  That they're made with Google?  Google Jump technology.  The Ozo's interesting because it does a live version of low stream, low bit rate live version.  And then you can also save it and do an on-demand version after the fact.  And I'm told by people who played with it that the audio is spectacular.  They have microphones all over it.  And that's something that I think is going to be a big improvement is that when you turn your head, now I can hear what's over here or now I can hear what's over here.  And the jump I think is only horizontally around.

I've used it a lot.  No, not for adult stuff.  But I've used it for...  There's a limited amount of content.  It's kind of like when HD came out.  But there's enough content that you really like this Cirque du Soleil thing.  There are games.  There's a really fun game where...  And I haven't played it yet.  I've downloaded it.  I'm trying to get people to play it with me.  Where you, as the victim, you're disassembling a bomb.  Disassembling a bomb.  But you don't have the manual.  Your friends who are not wearing the helmet have the manual.  But they can't see what you're seeing.  So you're saying, well, should I cut the red wire?  And they're going, well, let me look.  And there's a paper manual.  And they're going, well, let me look.  That's cool.  Isn't that fun?  I think that's a great idea.  So I think we're starting to see some very interesting uses for this.  It is immersive.  It's not perfect yet.  Far from it.  In fact, I can see there's a screen door effect.  I can see the pixels and everything.  Virtual tour city.

You know, the GoPro is probably a few thousand bucks.  The Ozo was about 5,000 bucks.  This is relatively affordable.  You can make these videos and you can put them on YouTube now.  YouTube works with cardboard.  So if you have cardboard, which is inexpensive, you can really do this.  I feel like we're very close.  I don't know.  I just feel like in the next...  I'll check.

Act as if this is a real room with, almost like theater, right?  And I can imagine watching a movie where I can look around.  You kind of do that on a big screen anyway, look around.  Imagine somebody starts talking, you look over here, they're having a fight.  Wait a minute, the guy's got a gun over here.  I mean, that would be very exciting.

Glass.  Glass is dumb.  Actually, this kind of makes sense.  It's aimed at industries like healthcare, manufacturing, and energy where you might,  for instance, let's say you're new at surgery.  And you go, is the hip bone connected to the thigh bone?  And you have the little manual.  You can look over your eyebrow and see.

Start time: 3623.82
End time: 3703.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But really that was kind of the premise of Seth's article, which is that the whole point  of Google+, Vic Gundotra went around Google until he could finally convince the executives  that Facebook was going to eat their lunch unless they did a social network.  And so Larry Page, who had just become CEO, said, all right, we're going to go all in  on Google+.  They did.  They made it part of, I mean, one of the things that has changed, it used to be that if you  had a Google account, you had a Google Plus account.  That's not going to be the case anymore.  But I don't think that's necessarily going to hurt Google+.  It just means those inflated numbers about how many people are using it will go away  because that was really just people signing up to use Google.  Anyway, it's a good article.  Mike Elgin, as one would expect because he loves Google+.  Of course, our news director here at Twitter wrote a counter piece in the computer world  in which he said, no, no, it's far from dead.  Unless the premise is Google Plus didn't beat Facebook.  E-Week, I guess.  OK.  But of course, Google Plus didn't beat Facebook.  Nobody has beaten Facebook.  Facebook, as we know now from its quarterly results, is unstoppable.  They now own everything.  It's over.  Which is a good reason to use Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's a game changer.  I kind of feel like the question of whether or not Google Plus as a destination is dead  as far as a Facebook competitor is a little distracting from what is an actual genuine  success of the Google Plus effort.  I agree.  Which is just tying all these products together, getting you to agree on one user agreement,  sharing all of your information from siloed products all into one, letting Google have  a better idea of who you are as a person.  Then Hangouts, which was already successful, was rebranded for Google Plus.  Now, that's more successful.  Google Plus Photos was really successful.  Then now they spun that out.  It's a shame because that...  Yeah.  So Google Plus as a destination never really caught on.  I'll point to that just like a lot of other folks in this echo chamber of tech journalism  and say that was a failure.  You're not Facebook.  Ha, ha, ha.  But there's so many other things that Google got out of this that everyone's ignoring by  focusing on the fact that Google Plus is not a destination that a lot of people go to.  I think it's kind of missing the point a little bit.  Well, and I still go there.

Transcript:  You know where I think they went wrong?  I'm probably the only person in the world saying this.  They never created a third party API.  You could read Google Plus, but you could never write to Google Plus.  I understand that they were probably reluctant.  People used Buzz as kind of a dumping ground for their tweets and posts.  Maybe now is the time to do it.  But create a right API so third party developers can create Google Plus apps, can use Google  Plus in new and innovative ways.  That was great for Twitter.  It really allowed Twitter to explode.  Obviously, they turned it off, but they allowed Twitter to explode because people used it  in interesting and new ways.  They gave people a chance to use Twitter in ways that they wanted to, not necessarily  the Twitter homepage.  Maybe now is the time for Google to create a right API for Google Plus.  I think it would be a great thing.

But it's never really going to go away, I think, in some way, because there is now a  social spine uniting all of Google services in a way that didn't exist before.  So they can get rid of the Plus, and you might feel like you're not using Google Plus anymore,  but they got what they wanted to get from it, and they still have a ton of users.  And, okay, maybe they aren't Facebook, but I don't know if that was ever...  That might have been one goal, but I don't think that was the end-all, be-all mission  of Google Plus.  No, I think what it...  I think it's a simplistic view to think it was.

Transcript:  I think what Vic was probably telling Larry and the executives at Google was  Google has no social input to its search.  Facebook...the kind of search Google does, spidering the net and making an index,  is in the long run doesn't have much of a future, I think.  It's not enough.  People want some social inputs.  Guess what Google Now kind of did is it started to take additional information.  Facebook has all those signals.  It's ironic because Facebook never really made a very good search.  They tried the graph and stuff, but they never really did a good job.  No, they've miserably failed at the graph search.  In fact, Google didn't need to worry.  No.  But I understand that four or five years ago there was a reasonable concern that,  hey, maybe Facebook's going to become a better search because of all the things they know  about their users.  All right, we're going to move on.  We can talk a little bit about the new phones.  Do you care the new phones that are coming?  Very exciting.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We haven't mentioned Apple.  I think there's nothing to say.  But if you can come up with an Apple story, we will.  And then we're going to talk a little bit about the robots and how they're losing.  This is good news for humans.  Humans won.  Robots, nothing.  Actually, humans too.  Robots, nothing.  Our show today brought to you by actually a good thing robots can do for you.  Invest your money.  It's called Wealthfront.  It's an automated investment service that is using very sophisticated algorithms to  invest your money, not only to make you more money, but also to reduce your tax losses.  Sophisticated strategies like tax loss harvesting and direct indexing.  The point is to optimize your after-tax returns.  This is the kind of thing computers do really, really well.  And because it's being done in an automated fashion, Wealthfront is inexpensive.  Traditional investment advisors, you know, I mean, part of the problem, of course, is  they often have their own axe to grind there on commission and so forth.  But even after that, if you eliminate that, they still charge you between 1 and 3% of  the money you have under management, plus hidden fees for transactions and changes.  It can really add up.  With Wealthfront, it's one quarter of 1% a year, and that's it.  25 basis points.  No commissions, no hidden fees.  As an example, you're investing, say, $30,000.  That's five bucks a month.  And there are no additional charges.  They are current.  They've grown 20 times in the last two years, now managing over $2.4 billion because it  works so well.  The very simple thing you could do right now is go to Wealthfront.com slash twit, and  you'll get the investment, a personalized investment portfolio.

I mean, if you're wanting to buy a phone off contract, I think this is the first phone you should consider.  If you're a student, if you just don't want to spend 600 bucks for an iPhone out of contract,  this is a great place to start.  The display in direct sunlight, I didn't think was great.  It's LCD, right?  Yeah, but in direct sunlight, it kind of washed out.  But the camera, which is a 13 megapixel...  It's the same as in the Nexus 6.  It's based on the Nexus 6, but I like the pictures I took with the Moto G better than when I shot the 6.  Even better.  Yeah.

I mean, I could basically fall asleep, not charge my phone, and still have 10 percent in the morning.  Which is pretty crazy.  But it's also a massive phone. It's what I'm using right now because I dropped my iPhone 6 in the toilet shooting that video.

End time: 4675.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Apple has an advantage too because they really lock it down.  There's no real multitasking on an iPhone. There's kind of pseudo multitasking.  But that's what kills Android phones is all these apps waking up going, hey, I want some juice. Hey, I want some juice.  And by the end of the day, you're drained.

Start time: 4676.02
End time: 4698.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if multitasking is the right word. Is that multitasking or is that things running in the background that you don't know about that are taking your battery life?  Because to me, when I think multitasking, I think like, okay, I have my desktop. I have multiple windows up.  I'm doing multiple things at once. Your smartphone display, even at six inches, is only so big.  And if you're looking at Twitter and YouTube on your phone at the same time, I mean, do you really need to do that?

Start time: 4699.00
End time: 4719.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no. I mean, technically it's wake locks. It's the things that wake your phone up while it's off to download more Twitter feed stuff or get more email.  And that's really out of control.  They've you know, lollipops tried to fix that and they do seem to have improved it a bit.  But iPhone, because Apple has such control, really does a better job.

Start time: 4719.00
End time: 4723.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe that's why they lock it down so much.  That's why they don't allow flash. That's why they don't do a lot of things.

Start time: 4726.24
End time: 4740.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because they know that those are all battery killers and they've really improved battery life as a result.  And boy, Android phones are suffering as a result because none of the top of the line Android phones are worth anything.  The last good battery life I had was the OnePlus One.

Start time: 4741.38

But I actually OnePlus stopped by my office a week before the launch.  So you played with it.  So you played with it. Yeah, I got to see it, got to use it.  It looks like the camera is actually going to be better.  It's still a 13 megapixel unit. But instead of being with a source by Sony, I think this time it's a different company.  Oh, interesting.  Yeah, it looks like it will take a better picture. I don't know if it's going to be as good as...  Gosh, everybody uses Sony.  A lot of folks do use Sony. Apple uses Sony.  Apple uses Sony amongst some other folks.  But yeah, Sony is one of their suppliers, not exclusively.  But it still has the same five and a half inch display. It still has that kind of sandstone feeling back.

Start time: 4804.00
End time: 4844.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People are raving about it.  I sat down on an iPhone right next to it and it was faster than an iPhone and unlocking every single time.  And more reliable.  Well, I don't know about more reliable, but in the hour I spent with it, it was quicker.  No NFC. Does that surprise you?  It does, considering that it's being used for mobile payments like crazy and they're running a damn near stock version of Android on the OnePlus 2.  So why wouldn't you want Android Pay when it relaunches as Android Pay later this year?  Why wouldn't you want to have that? I mean, that being said, the phone does start at $329.  That's one of the ways they save money. They also don't do fast charging. They also don't do wireless charging.

Start time: 4844.06
End time: 4848.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we can live without that if the battery life's good.  They've increased the battery 10% over last year.  Yeah.

Start time: 4849.26
End time: 4883.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you should get pretty good battery life on the OnePlus 2.  It's slightly thicker and it's barely noticeable. I mean, I had both hands set side by side and I could barely notice it.  And I actually really, really applaud OnePlus for doing that because most every other phone company is going to try and sell you a thinner phone just for the sake of it being thinner, just so they can give you one more bragging point to your friends.  And it's just not necessary. I mean, give us something that's slightly thicker and if we get better battery life, I'm all for it.  What do you think of the Type-C charging?  I mean, it's where things are going. Is it a little bit ahead of its time? I don't know.  It's early, isn't it?  If you have one phone, you have that one cable.

Start time: 4884.02

Transcript:  You know, Monoprice has some. I've got card readers. I've been able to find a lot of stuff.  And the nice thing about C is it's fast. I don't know if...  It's very fast.  Lollipop or OnePlus will be able to take advantage of all the things C can do. They're not doing the fast charging.

Start time: 4914.96
End time: 4942.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they're not doing the fast charging, but they have... One of the things I like is they have a USB-C to old school USB-A cable.  Oh, it comes with it?  Yeah, it comes with it and it's reversible, which is the first time I've ever seen a old USB cable that's reversible.  And then they're going to sell these for like five bucks on their website.  So let's say you do have that new MacBook that you spend a lot of money on. Instead of buying the $50, $80, whatever dollar Apple cable,  OnePlus will sell you that cable for five bucks.

Start time: 4943.68
End time: 4951.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One thing that worries me, I've heard from a lot of people who've had problems with their OnePlus One, and it's hard to get support.  Have they addressed that at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, the first OnePlus One was running on signage mod, which is great if you're a hacker or you're a modifier.  I like Sam, but...  Yeah, that's awesome. But what they're saying, what OnePlus is saying is that now their version they call Oxygen OS...

Start time: 4966.17
End time: 4968.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love Oxygen. I put it on my OnePlus One. It's pure Android.

Start time: 4969.92
End time: 5001.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's basically pure Android with a couple small tweaks. There's something where you can basically drag your thumb down on any part of the display,  and it'll pull down the notifications tray so you don't have to go all the way up.  That's a nice tweak.  Which is good. If it's such a big display, you're going to not want to... So it's like small ergonomic stuff like that.  And there are a few other changes, but...  The V thing for turning on the light and knocking.  Yep. You can draw the flashlight on and it'll turn on.  So basically, because it's so close to stock Android, they're saying their updates will get out there quicker, because they're pushing them through themselves.  But what about hardware support?

Transcript:  You're probably going to have to buy a new one, or you're going to have to mail it back to the company.  How long is that going to take for it to get back to you?  It's interesting, though. I bought my dad one of the first Nexus 7 tablets, and I thought, okay, it's from Google. I bought it. It's going to be legit.  It broke on him. We went to Asus to get it repaired. We went to Google to get it repaired. No one wanted to fix it.  We never just threw it away and getting him an iPad Mini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the way we cheat things that aren't an iPad Mini, because I still got my iPad Mini 1. It's been rocking and rolling until the cows come home.  So it depends on what you buy and the quality of it.  Yeah.  Some things are disposable. That's the way life is. Some cars you could buy, buy one, get one free. I wouldn't buy one.  I'd give you two or three, because it's disposable. It's a piece of crap.

Start time: 5065.04
End time: 5105.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think it's a fair question, though, of as these things become lower priced.  The OnePlus 2 is genuinely really kind of a flagship-worthy phone from what I've seen. The OnePlus 1, I think, was.  It was absolutely competitive with every other phone in the market.  And that starts at $330, which is a great, great price. So how much is that worth to you?  You can look at Chromecast. That started at $35. That's part of why it's so popular and why it's sold so many.  You can get an Apple TV for $80. It's awesome because lower prices mean tech is more accessible.  But most companies don't have a recycling program set up where when you're done with that gadget, it'll be handled responsibly.

If not, it'll send it to your app and then put it in the cart and then you can have to manually approve it.  It has debounce.  So if you've got a toddler that pushes it a hundred times, it still won't make multiple orders.  It only will let you repeat the order once the first order arrives.  So you're safe on that.  I think it's kind of cool.  I can't believe that I'm paying Amazon for the right to order more stuff from Amazon.  How much are the buttons?  Five bucks.

I think there was some Apple stories.  There was a rumor that the Apple TV will be coming out in the fall with the iPhone announcement.  I don't know if we should give these any credit at all.  But App Store on the Apple TV.  SDK series support.  Well, John Padukaski is legit.  He's really good.  He went to BuzzFeed.  That kind of took away some of the credibility.

Start time: 5599.04
End time: 5611.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some of his credibility.  The only thing about this, and I don't discount that Apple is planning to release the product in September, but I feel like they've been trying to do that for like two years now.  Well, I think that's what's going on.

Start time: 5612.72
End time: 5616.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's the issue is they haven't been able to make the deals, right?  They probably have the hardware ready.

Start time: 5617.18
End time: 5636.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It feels like every time that there's an Apple announcement, we hear the rumors of, oh, this is going to be the one.  And I think there are a lot of legit journalists have said, OK, this is going to be the time when we see the new Apple TV.  So I think, well, John's good reporter.  We can take this with a little bit of a grain of salt saying, OK, this could get delayed.

Start time: 5636.42
End time: 5651.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe the deals aren't going to be right now because John's source are bad because Apple has just not been able to deliver this product.  And it seems like they really wanted to do it alongside the new subscription Internet like TV service with live TV.

Start time: 5652.38
End time: 5696.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If I was a media company, I would not be trusting Apple either.  I think that's the problem.  Apple flipped the music industry over on its head and now they're getting flipped back over on their back.  And if you know just the fact of when the iPad first came out and how many companies lost out because they didn't have their own streaming app for their shows and things like that.  Apple's trying to sell episodes.  They're like, well, wait, we don't want to sell to them.  We want our own. Just come to me.  And like so they started actually figuring out the fact that we can't just give you this deal because we need to make our own money.  If we can make our own money using you without having to go through you, let's try that first.  And Apple's like, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Just give us a cut and everybody makes money, baby.  It's just you and me, everybody.  And they're not falling for it this time.  So good luck with that.

Transcript:  You know, the Apple TV, though, is really out of date.  It I don't use it anymore.  I very rarely use it because it's just the interface is clunky.  It doesn't it's just it's rising.  Are you Roku now?  The Android TV, the Nvidia Shield.  Frankly, I use my Xbox one as much as I use anything.  You love that Xbox.  I love my Xbox one.  It's a great media center.  It has all the apps.  It has Netflix, Amazon, Hulu.  The only thing it doesn't have is the only thing the Apple has exclusively, which is iTunes, which is still still a big it's still like the largest media store online for music and movies.  But they're selling the same TV shows and movies as everybody else.

End time: 5758.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's also one place where it's safe, per se.  You know, it's the same thing when people sell it.  I'm like, well, why should I buy something through Verizon?  I'm like, I don't know if I move somewhere and it rises in there and I own all these movies on Verizon.  That's why I buy from Amazon.  Again, that's why people buy stuff through Apple.  You know, I got all Apple TVs in my house and I use it because Apple you can only use in the Apple ecosystem.

Start time: 5759.00
End time: 5770.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's always going to be the case.  And that I find very limiting.  I feel like the reason I use Amazon is because I know I'll be able to buy it to watch it on a variety of devices, not the Apple TV, but everything else.

Transcript:  Just just throwing this out there.  Apple Music is going to come out for Android.  Right. It's going to be one of the rare things that Apple's making for.  And what's that going to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if they're showing a little bit of loosening there, if they make these deals to have a streaming TV service, why would we think that they wouldn't have that on Android at the very least?  And they, you know, technically Apple Music is going to be on Windows 2 because of iTunes running on Windows 10, not Windows Phone, but Windows 10.  So I mean, to me, if they sign this deal up and they actually have a competent TV streaming service, something that will be an alternative to all of the apps from those networks like HBO Go or Netflix, Hulu, whatever.  I think they're going to have it on Android at the very least.  I think they're going to have it somewhere else.  Oh, that's very intriguing.  Hmm.

Start time: 5828.22
End time: 5833.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I just don't see Apple getting that deal, especially right now when you look at Xfinity Go or Comcast Go and they show you live TV, the HBO Go, all those things all encompassed in their channel.  That's why Apple is having such a problem.  They're like, look, bro, why are we going to give you this money when we're already running our own ship over here?  We're not trying to parse meals with you and give you any more free food.  I mean, it's happening in P.

Start time: 5864.98

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're not quite there yet, but the cable industry is changing very fast.  And, you know, Showtime has their over the top app now you can get without a cable subscription.  HBO Now is available.  I mean, I think really once Disney takes ESPN in this territory, it's going to be like the floodgates are going to be open from there because everybody's waiting for this.  Very, very tight.  Very, very tight.

Start time: 5889.32
End time: 5909.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think Apple's trying to make a deal with Comcast.  They're trying to make a deal with the networks directly.  And even the local stations.  And maybe even them.  So, I mean, just like Mark said, it's about pulling apart what the cable bundle is.  Right. So now you're trying to reassemble the cable bundle.

Start time: 5910.26
End time: 5918.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're scared because you're in the bundle.  You worry about Comcast getting pissed or falling apart.  I mean, you're making a big transition that you might not be ready to make.  Yeah.

Start time: 5919.50
End time: 5943.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that's why I'm bringing up the cable companies because they have a lot more equity and money in it to where they'll make the deal sweeter for those places not to go to Apple.  That's what I'm saying.  There might be conflicts behind the scenes going on with that because they don't want to give up that market.  Not so much the individual channels, but if you're saying like, look, if you just keep it exclusively with us, we can make this money.  Don't go to Apple.  Apple's going to take all your money.  Like, I don't know.  Apple just seems to have a problem getting it done.  So we'll see what happens.

Father Robert Balasero will be headlining our coverage.  He goes every year.  He talked a little bit about it on the new screensavers yesterday.  What happens is the week before, the weeks before, a lot of security researchers reveal almost for publicity purposes the stuff they're going to talk about at the conferences.  That's why you've seen now three, not one, not two, but three auto hacks.  There's the hack we saw in Wired of the Uconnect in the Jeep.  Yeah, Jeep.

Transcript:  But it's not just cars.  It's everybody.  I mean, Apple doesn't fix a flaw until somebody reveals it.  How about this stage fright?  Now, actually, the problem Google has is that they can't fix it at this point because there's  so many phones out of their control.  Stage fright, according to, and this is another one I'm sure we'll learn more about at Black Hat  or maybe Def Con.  Stage fright is a vulnerability in the media playback engine on almost all Android phones.  That means a carefully crafted MMS message could either at best crash the phone, at worst  allow a bad guy to take over your phone silently and without your knowledge.  Google has fixed, of course, internal code branches.  They've got to fix on their own phones.  I'm sure they've pushed out a fix by now.  But they're reliant on the manufacturers and the carriers to fix all of those hundreds of millions  of devices.  And you've got to think there's a lot of devices that will never be fixed.

Transcript:  What's kind of fascinating to me is this really affects Android phones running Jelly Bean and earlier.  Yeah.  So if you have...  Up to 2.2.  Yeah.  So if you have...  I mean, this year's, right now today, your phone should be on lollipop.  Last year, Kit Kat was the big release of Android.  But the problem with what Google has to put up with every single phone, it's like your Samsung Galaxy  isn't going to get that new software update for nine months later.

It's what Samsung, it's what Motorola, it's what Sony, it's what HTC, it's what Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile,  Sprint, all the carriers can do because they get Android from Google.  They want to skin it.  Then they go back and forth between each other, the hardware manufacturers and the carriers.  And then they add on their bloatware.  And then they have to...  And so by the time it comes to you, and so it's like I'm not even really mad at Google about this.  I'm mad at the carriers and the hardware manufacturers for skinning and bloatware and just taking so long  to get the software updates to us.

Transcript:  One thing Google has done, and unfortunately it doesn't help you here, but they've done quite a bit of  is moving stuff out of the system and into apps so that they can push updates through the Play Store.  They have control over that.  That's helped a lot.  Yeah.  In fact, you'll see a lot of Android services now in the App Store.  And you'll get updated through the App Store.  That's why, because they know they're not going to get updates on gingerbread phones sold by HTC in 2011.

So it does a whole bunch of other stuff, too.  Like it gives me updates on my phone.  I mean, it tells me where my car is.  I can geotag my car.  I can limit the speed and the geofence.  So if I go travel to L.A. and my buddies drive my car, I guess they alert me if he drives  over 55 miles an hour or if he leaves Gloucester County or whatever.  And it'll ping me and do all kinds of stuff.  So it comes with a whole bunch of features.

They aren't saying how many. Is that per month? Is that per year? Is that total?  Oh yeah, they left that part out, didn't they?  So they can't give false information, but they can give you not the entire story.  Which is what a lot of companies do, right?  It can be manipulated.

No. I think, like Mark just pointed out, Square is about to go public.  The board at Twitter just said, we don't want to have a CEO who's part-time.  I mean, and come on, I don't think that board didn't talk to Jack before making that announcement.  I don't think that was...

Start time: 6704.10
End time: 6744.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, their revenue growth has not been the thing that investors in Wall Street have,  like, had a problem with.  It's been mostly the user growth, which has really stalled quite a bit in the last few  quarters.  And so you put a sales guy at the head of it, maybe he'll...  Solving the wrong problem.  Well, that's one way to look at it, for sure.  I mean, that's also one of the arguments for Dorsey is that he invented the product and  sort of has an eye for new features and leading the product.  So maybe he can find a way to increase user growth so they can come anywhere close to  Facebook.

His goal is to make government transparent.  Among other things, one of the things he does at his public.resource.org site is publish  state laws.  Those are the laws of the people, the people's laws.  Apparently, the state of Georgia says those laws are copyrighted and they're suing Karl  Malamud for publishing the Georgia code, the official code of Georgia, annotated.  They say this is copyright.  These copyright protections are there to incentivize the state to create annotated copies of the  law.  Without the copyright, Georgia's law would remain unannotated.  Furthermore, this guy is equivalent to a terrorist.

Transcript:  So there's a lawsuit going on.  Good morning to you productions.  File the Clash Action lawsuit.  Two years ago, she was told she'd have to pay $1,500 to use the song in her Happy Birthday documentary.  This is a lawsuit that's been going on for two years.  They found a smoking gun.  It's kind of complicated, but they found a song book that had the words of music to Happy Birthday in it without a copyright mark.  Then those days, it's not true anymore.  You're copyright automatically.  But in those days, if you didn't have a copyright next to, you know, your stuff, it wouldn't be copyrighted.  And so it may be that this this whole thing is is going to go up and smoke.  Warner Chappelle had the actual document, the song book.  It was submitted in Discovery.  The other side got it, but it was smudged.  It's really a great story.  So watch carefully, because soon it may be that we can finally free at last, free at last, sing Happy Birthday on this show.

You wouldn't think that you could buy a mattress on the Internet, but you can.  You may say, well, wait a minute.  I don't trust you, Leo.  I got to lie on this mattress to know if it's comfortable, because my needs are different than yours, Leo.  That's true.  That's true.  But whoever said lying on a mattress in a showroom for five minutes is any way to buy a mattress.  It's not.  So Casper does you a little bit better.  How about 100 days?  You can buy a Casper mattress and you'll get free delivery and painless returns within 100 days.  You can sleep on this for 100 nights and decide on night 99.  You know what?  It isn't the mattress for me.  They'll come and they'll get it.  They'll take it away and you'll pay nothing.  I love my Casper.  I think you're going to like it.  It is latex and memory foam.  Comes in a box.  That's great.  I got it for my son too for his dorm room because it came in the box.  They could get it up to three flights easily.  When you open it up, it's wrapped in Tyvek and they give you a little opener and you open it up, it goes...  And suddenly it's a full-size mattress.  That's a queen-size mattress.  Came in a box the size of a dorm refrigerator.  Whoa!  Now try that on your mattress at home.  It is comfy, free delivery.  It's made in the USA.  They're revolutionizing the mattress industry by cutting the cost, selling direct to you.  $500 for a twin, $950 for a king-size for the best mattress you ever had.  That's about a third what I paid for the mattress I got rid of that I didn't like all that much.  And by the way, all you have to do is use the offer code TWIT and you'll save $50.  So that's even more affordable.  Even Ozzy loved it.  Casper.com slash TWIT.  Use the promo code TWIT and save big on your brand new mattress.  No risk to you.  Casper.  Casper.  We love my Casper.

He's not going to make it across the United States.  He left just a week ago.  Left and went through Boston, much of New England.  See, there he is going from Halifax to Victoria.  No problem.
