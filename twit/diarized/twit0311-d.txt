Transcript:  Welcome to TWIT from the new TWIT Brickhouse. I'm Leo Laporte and we are going to have a  great show today. The first show we've ever done.  From our new studios to my left. I brought in all my old friends.  My old tech TV buddies. Starting with Kevin Rose to my left. It's great to have you,  Kevin. Now at milk dot, milk.  Milk. Inc. Dot com. And to my right,  my old friend Patrick Norton, host of techzilla.com.  My old partner from the screen savers and of course John C. Dvorak.  Over on the far right, Steve Gibson stuck in traffic. He'll join us in just a little bit.  But I thought it would be fun because this place looks a little bit like the  old  screen savers set. A lot of rust in here.  There's a lot of rust. It's kinda neat, isn't it?

Can we get a paper bag for the bottle, please?  So we also invited some close friends in here. My sister Eva  said, well, are you going to have a studio audience? I said, yeah, we could have a few  people.  She said, how about fifty? I said, okay, so we have about fifty people, maybe more.  Thank you for joining us. And I think we're going to have fifty people for every show in this first week.  Because so many people have come. One hundred. All the way up to Petaluma,  California. Boy, a lot of thank yous go out,  especially to our set designer. The guy who did this studio is the same guy who  did the screen savers,  the last screen saver set, Roger Ambrose. Where is he? He's watching us in LA. He's not here.  No, he quit already.  He quit. We threw him out.  He said, I can't take you people anymore. Also, Brent By, who is running this  silly little jib camera. He's running it. Wait, wait, wait, wait. A couple minutes ago it was the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Brent is an amazing lighting guy. He did this, the whole lighting on the set,  just did a great job.  Ken Marylees, as you probably know, Ken, he's been around for a long time,  a consulting engineer,  helped us choose these cameras. We're using just inexpensive consumer grade  camcorders, but you know the consumer camcorders are so good now.  These are Canon Vixia HF G10s

Look at all these people. Isn't this great? Oh, cool. We got people all around us  because everybody wanted to be here. So what did I miss? You didn't? We just started. Oh, cool.  Your timing is excellent. I was just kind of thanking people who helped us design the set  and build it and make all of this happen. And it hasn't been easy, but we've got such a great team.  Liz Romero in the back there. You could just see her. Hey, Liz, wave.  Lin Fu, who put together the live event today. Of course, my producer, Eileen Rivera,  who's back in the console. Do you see this is our console back there?  You got to be an octopus to run that thing. You've got everything at your fingertips. One  person can do what basically 22 people had to do to make tech TV happen. So how much is done?  It's pretty, it's pretty, I don't know. Is it done? I think it's done. Yeah,  the architect bailed out already, moved back to LA. No, it is pretty much done. The only thing  is left is I just finished my show in the old studio. I came over here. So now we dismantled  the old studio and it's going to fit in that little room over there. That's my office over

It's just two  blocks down the street. Yeah, it's great. Yeah, but we're really glad you could all be here because  it's really, it wouldn't, for me, it wouldn't mean anything if I didn't have my pals here to celebrate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if you guys remember this, but I offered Patrick and Kevin, I said,  look, we'll make this a three-way LLC. You can, we can have, you could partner and we'll make Twit.  And they said, are you crazy? Patrick said, I need to make a living. I gotta feed my wife.  Kevin says, I gotta dig. I don't need that. And so unfortunately you guys, I own it all,  but that's okay because you can come visit anytime. We're really, actually, we're really  thrilled to be here and we're thrilled to have our audience. And the truth is this couldn't happen  not only without these guys, but without our amazing community. And we see, we see the people  in the chat room. We, there's so many people, we have a live stream. How many people are watching  the live stream? I think it's about 30,000 now watching the live stream. Nice. Not quite.  We don't, we don't have another. No one has a clue. And there's more than 1500 people in the chat  room. It's just, it's a, it's a, it's a great response from our community. And we have sold  over a thousand bricks. The brick wall is not visible right now, but it's right behind me.  On the other side of that gear, when you first walk into the entry lobby, we haven't put the  bricks in yet, but the bricks are going to go in. We're going to get the first ship in about two  weeks. And before the opening party, which is August 21st, wait, by the way, you're all invited.  We'll have the bricks mounted on the wall. Aha, I guess I was right. Well, that's just the opening

Like, oh, um, is I wanted to make this a working office that we can also do shows out of. So

Start time: 576.58
End time: 586.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 587.58
End time: 591.92

Start time: 592.38
End time: 616.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I should mention a couple of things. One, you're, uh, you know, Burt Monroy has got that big picture  posted in San Francisco for the first. Did you go see it? I didn't. I understand. I'm in it.  You actually, your name is in it. One of the only two names that actually has a name and Pat is the  other one. That's awesome. Burt, of course, is the only going to be there for a couple of weeks. And  then you're never going to see it again. Why not? Because there's only the backlit. This is the full

Start time: 616.30
End time: 626.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  size backlit version. This is the world's largest Photoshop illustration. He took four years to do  it. Burt, of course, right. Eight hours a day, eight hours a day, not just eight hours a day for

Start time: 626.72
End time: 637.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  four years. This thing backlit is fun. I've seen, I was, I'm down the street from Burt. So I see  him all the time, but backlit. This thing is spectacular and he would go see it or else.

Start time: 637.68
End time: 640.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I will go down and see that. If you're in San Francisco, you must see it. Burt's, uh,

Start time: 641.84
End time: 649.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  well, he was a regular on Photoshop day or something. What's the name of this? Yeah.  550 Sutter street, San Francisco. If you're in the Bay area, find a way to get over there. And

Start time: 650.02
End time: 697.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's called Time Square is the name of his painting. I'm going to pull it up here. Yeah,  I've got it coming up in a second. It's so big. It's taking an hour to download. The thing is  huge. It's like, it looks like a photo. The thing is, it's, it's a photo realistic. So if I click,  I can zoom in on this. Oh, look at this. It's photo realistic scroll, scroll down. Where are we? Oh,  there we are. There's the twit logo right there, right in the middle. Look at that.  Wow. That's cool. That's the old twit album art with Leo, the poor Patrick Norton and friends.  That's the only, uh, that's the only text names in there. That was nice of Burt to include that.  These are not pictures. They look like pictures of people. They actually are real people though.  He has many of his friends, uh, in the imagery here. You can go over to the far, uh, left there

Start time: 698.26
End time: 708.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and you'll find me and, uh, JC. Are you in it? Of course. Well, there's Burt. See his back right  there. Yeah. Where? Keep going. Move over a little more. The other way, other way, other way.

Start time: 709.30
End time: 804.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, there's Burt. That's his ponytail. I recognize his ponytail anywhere. That's his wife.  And there's his wife. I recognize her. So none of these are photos. These are all, this is photo  realistic illustration that he's quite famous for. Uh, and the detail in this. There I am right there  by the cab, right? Oh yes. Let's zoom in on John C. Dvorak. That's as close as I can zoom.  Is that you right here? Yeah. Wow. You know, it looks bigger in pictures.  Wait a minute. That's Sal Segoian right there and his wife, Naomi.  Look at that. So this is pretty cool. That, uh, that is called Times Square and it is in  San Francisco right now for just a couple of weeks, but it's touring. It's going to be New York,  Chicago, Los Angeles as well. B E R T M O N R O Y.com. All right. Let's talk a little bit about  the tech news. I guess we really, I don't want to, I don't even want to mention it, but I guess we,  we can't start the day without talking about really the biggest news story of the week,  which was the horror in Norway. Um, that's tech news. It isn't, but I think if I don't mention it,  it feels like we're not paying attention to it. And it is tech news in a way because, uh, the guy,  this, this horrendous guy who did this, uh, wanted to go back to a more primitive society in which,  and he mentioned piracy as being one of the software piracy, as being one of the veins of  modern existence. And the guy's a nut. Uh, what's interesting, what was interesting to me is I found  out about it first, not on Twitter, but on Google plus. And I think that that's one thing that has  changed quite a bit. How is that for you? The first place you go now to Kevin? Uh, you know,

Start time: 804.68
End time: 830.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm checking it, uh, definitely two to three times a day. Yeah. When it first, I live on it.  It's very sticky. Yeah, it is. It is because you have a real conversation with the audience,  you know, the people are going back and forth and you can actually like people's posts. It's just,  it feels like a real community versus, uh, you know, when you're on Twitter, you're just getting  these at replies and it's a lot of work to reply back to someone. And then you miss some of them  and it's just not sticky is as much as Google plus is. And I'm going to reshare. So this is how easy

Start time: 831.04
End time: 850.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it is to in effect, retweet your tweet or what do you call it? Plus plus your plus. Uh, and so I just  reshared that and you'll see the amount of engagement you get. I mean, you, you shared this a few minutes  ago, 261 pluses, 29 reshares, 169 comments. You've replaced this, uh, your blog with this. This has

Start time: 850.80
End time: 883.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  become your blog. Well, I mean, it has all the social features that I want in a blog, but I can't  really find in blog software. You know what I mean? Right. It's like, if I post something on my blog  and it goes live, yes, it's going to hit all the RSS readers. Some people will come in and comment  that once they get it via RSS, but it's not really real time. I'm going to have to go out and promote  it. I'm going to have to tweet it. You don't have to promote it here, do you? It just shows how people  start commenting on it right away. And it's, it's awesome. And then I can go back to them right away  and answer their questions. You know what I mean? I don't have to sit around and wait and check it at  the end of the day. I can start having that conversation. Do you worry though that the, the

Start time: 883.54
End time: 888.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  problem with this, of course, is that this isn't your site. This is Google's site. I mean, see,

Start time: 888.42
End time: 901.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that's, that's the problem because there's a lot of people out there that, um, they monetize their  blogs, right? They have ads on them. I haven't done that in a while. And so for me, it's, it makes sense,  but a lot of people out there are going to want to keep their existing blogs because they, that's

Start time: 901.58
End time: 905.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  how they make their living, you know? There is a bigger issue though. And in fact, it surfaced

Start time: 905.38
End time: 938.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this week. Google started deleting accounts. Well, it's, it's not just, it's not just Google.  Right. There's kind of two stories here that have been bounced around this week. One is that Google  plus basically they're like, no commercial accounts. Goodbye. They killed Mashable. Of course, Pete,  Pete Cashmore's brilliant. They said that from the beginning though. I get, I understand that. I'm  with you. I am totally good. Google said no commercial accounts. Fine. And then Pete Mashable  went, that's not Mashable's account. That's my account. And I like, I met him once. He seems  like a nice guy, but no, it's, it's Google went, oh, okay, we can take care of Pete. And then I see,

Start time: 938.78
End time: 979.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that's a problem because, but it's, it's not a problem with that. It's a problem. How do you,  how do you enforce this? No brands. What is a brand? Is Kevin Rose a brand? Not just no brands,  but no soon enough. Is Leo La Porta a brand? It's a brand in a way. What about people? You're also a  person. Right. I mean, that's what Google's saying is it has to have a first name and a last name.  Right. But Pete Cashmore is Mashable. You know, Boing Boing did that. They had an intern post  Boing Boing posts. I think it becomes very difficult. And I think when Google is deleting  accounts like this, it's very risky. You know, it didn't delete my account or your account,  but they, they deleted some pretty important accounts. But I think that they, they're planning

Start time: 979.48
End time: 984.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  a business solution here, right? They plan to have, they do. I think they're going to be attached to

Start time: 984.10
End time: 1026.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  accounting. I did what I think Ford and Mashable and all these other companies should have done,  which is I didn't, I created a Twit profile and I applied for the business account. And I said,  I'm not going to post anything on this Twit profile until you say, yes, business accounts are  launched. They've also said, if you create a business account, a Ford account, we will not  migrate that data over to a real business account. So you're running the risk of losing  all the engagement you had up to this point. And yet there's so much value for a company like  Mashable. I mean, look at, look what Mashable has gotten out of this or, or somebody like an  individual like Trey Ratcliffe, he's put himself on the map with Google+. You know, we all knew  who Trey Ratcliffe was, but boy, when he started posting on Google+, or Tom from MySpace, Tom from

Start time: 1027.02
End time: 1035.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  MySpace, it's, it's reactivated. Tom Anderson is suddenly a good guy. He's awesome. He's been,  always been a good guy. But nobody knew it until he started posting on Google+.

Start time: 1036.98
End time: 1043.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's still a closed system though, right? I mean, I'm seeing people tweeting,  asking for invitations in, so- It's not so hard to get an invitation.

Start time: 1044.06
End time: 1085.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You guys are all in it, right? I think they're just trying to, I think they're trying to scale,  not that Google really has problems with computing power. In the same way that Gmail was originally  18 million people now. Yeah, they're scaling fast, but I think they're trying to keep, you know,  I think they're trying to keep a giant mess of suddenly, you know, half of, you know, New York  City decides to sign on at once. So they're trying to trickle out invitations. I think it's  also been interesting, is coming up again this week, is some people have had their regular Google  accounts have been suspended. Well, that's the thing.  And they've lost, and so if, if you didn't know about it, the dataliberation.org is a bunch of  Google engineers that are actually working to help you get your information out of Google so you can  store it offline. Should for some reason your account disappear and you suddenly find out all  of your contacts, your calendar, you know, and so many years of your email.

Start time: 1839.88
End time: 1894.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is weird.  Because on the iPad, when you want to scroll, you're just sliding paper up and down.  So it makes sense, right?  Right.  Up means the paper goes up.  Down means the paper goes down.  But on a mouse, it's the exact opposite.  Right.  You scroll down and you're going down the screen.  And you scroll up and you're going up the screen.  Right.  So.  Why do you think they're doing this?  There's something to this.  On Google+, I said, great.  Steve Jobs spends 27 years teaching us that you scroll this way and then,  ha ha, and switches it around on you.  Like.  That's how awesome he is.  That's it.  It's like, I am so awesome that I could just make everybody do something different.  Right.  You can't turn it off.  I think there's actually a deeper lesson here, which is that Apple, and Microsoft is doing this, too,  really kind of got swayed by the success of these tablets and these touch interfaces.  And they even want the desktop to kind of echo the touch interface.

And then I four finger swipe over.  Let's say I have full screen on my email.  So this is very, this is a, think about it.  That's a tablet like experience.  I'm swiping.  And you have that on your iPad, right?  But that's very tablet like.  This is also about.

Start time: 1919.92

ARM is the future.  There are more ARM processors sold in the last year than in the previous five years of x86 or some.  Isn't that great though too?  And it's like unifying the interface across the phones, the computers,  and eventually probably televisions and your minority report headset.  And so the idea is you develop ones.  And with Apple, like Apple sitting there going like,  yeah, we're going to release a new S.  We're going to do it through our new stores.  You're going to have to buy this version of the operating system to get the store  to download the new operating system.  And we're going to create this incredibly tightly controlled pool  that, or channel, or whatever you want to call it,  that controls access to applications and the applications running on the system.  Apple is trying to nail the operating system and the apps to the floor and control that experience.  I like it though.

That you only buy.  I rebuy apps just for that convenience.  That's the line.  Yeah.  It's retarded.  Stupid.  Stupid.  And yet they've got you.  And now what I worry about is that the ecosystem is so changed that a lot of very important stuff,  like open source apps, are gone.  You're not going to get handbrake on the app store.

They could buy NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox, and Hulu.  God.  They could buy anything they want.  Yeah.  But they are supposedly making a bit of a deal.  They're building a spaceship.  They could.  All things D said, don't hold your breath on the Apple-Hulu deal.  Actually, I think it's a bad idea for Apple to do that.  The deal was, I think, that Hulu said, we guarantee if you buy us,  we guarantee you a couple of three years of access to the content.  But after that, there's no guarantee.  And if it's Apple that owns the content,  do you think CBS and Fox and all the NBC, the content providers,  still maintain that agreement?  What are you buying if you're buying Hulu  and a contract for three years that runs out in three years?  You're not buying anything of great value, if you ask me.

Apple doesn't usually buy things.  In fact, the biggest company Apple ever bought was Next, $400 million.  They're not known for buying big companies, although that was a good deal.  They got Steve Jobs in that as the player to be named later.  Hulu Plus is $7.99 a month.  Netflix is $7.99 a month.  And iTunes, you buy a film at a time.  It's a la carte.

No landfill, no offshoring, they take care of everything.  Do they pick up?  They give you a box.  You put in a box, your mailman, a uniform member of the federal government will come and get it.  Aka your mailman.  I don't like that part.  And they put and they pay the postage and everything.

I think it's going to be a lot better.  You and I have practiced with it a little bit.  We're actually using their newsroom product,  which is called Vidyo Cast, V-I-D-Y-O-C-A-S-T.  Just in the nick of time,  because the CEO of Skype said at the Fortune Brainstorm Tech Conference in Aspen this week,  Tony Bates, said he might be putting advertisements in Skype calls.  Right in the middle of a talk?  Can you imagine?  We've got Steve Gibson doing security now, and suddenly,  not my ad, Skype's ad pops up in it.  In-call advertising.

Transcript:  I was talking to somebody who's a friend of mine  who has been working with a team of people in Silicon Valley developing some of these codecs,  and they wanted to compete with Skype.  And they claim that since Skype went to the VCs,  and now since it's been sold again,  that everything from the bitrate to the codec,  everything has been changed where you need more bandwidth than ever.  Why would that be?  He had some cockamamie theory about it.  He said it had something to do with compatibility,  down the road with something else, or who knows?  I don't know.  All I know is I was told that if you start looking at bandwidth requirements on a Skype call now,  and you actually get the monitor, put a scope on it,  you're going to get different numbers than you used to.

The average length of a video call is now 27 minutes.  27 minutes, and you're doing a lot of things in that time.  If we're talking, you're not just looking at me, so we have a lot of opportunities.  So he says, what, are they going to monitor the calls?  And oh, he walked away.  Hey, can I show you an ad for Pizza Hut real quick?  He says, why not?  Why not?  Because we have this intimate relationship.  At the end of the call, I share an ad with you.  And I hang up.

It happened very quickly for me, but it looked like there was a service that runs under Lion  that almost immediately runs when you first install Lion and says, hey,  you got to have Java.  And it was the very first thing-  Why wouldn't they just bundle Java then at that point?  Well, could be the lawsuits.  You saw that Oracle is not real happy right now with Google.

I can't remember the name of the company, but I had a long chat with the CEO who was a company  back East at Microsoft, basically lost a case to just recently for $260 something million or more.  And the guy had a long theory.  He said-  This is the I-4-I case?  I can't remember because there's so many of these cases Microsoft keeps losing.  Infinite.  He said that he's totally convinced that Microsoft just steals the patents  and then worries about it later.  And then he says if you do the numbers, they end up having to pay the fees might have been.  But meanwhile, his company's out of business.  He says we could have grown into be a billion-dollar company for all he knows.  Yeah, he's got $260 million now, but he could have been a contender, as it were.  And he thinks they do it overtly because the courts will not do treble damages.  He says they're too wimpy to do that.

It was an XML code issue in office.  Yeah, this was this guy.  And Microsoft, I'm sure, said, yeah, there's a patent.  Yeah, we could get sued.  Yeah, probably what happens is they immediately ask for a license.  Microsoft says sue us.  And at the end of the day, $300 million.  How much money does Microsoft make on office?  It's a pittance.

It's like throwing stuff against the wall.  He believes that you just steal a bunch of patents.  One of them takes off.  They get noticed by the other guys.  And they say, well, we're going to sue you.  I said, fine.  Meanwhile, they got to test a lot of different technologies.  Nobody else is going to sue them.  It's not worth the trouble.  And the company's ruined.  And that seems to be, he believes, is the Silicon Valley something that's floating around  in the ether that has been established as a way to do it.

Transcript:  So here's an interesting story.  So I would say you could argue that the open spectrum at 2.4 gigahertz,  which has been used for Wi-Fi, might have been the single most valuable incentive to innovation  in networking.  The fact that you didn't have to get a license.  You didn't have to go to the FCC.  You could just make a device.  We wouldn't have Wi-Fi, I think, if 2.4 gigahertz were unregulated spectrum.  You agree, Steve?  I mean, yeah.  There are a number of things that made this revolution happen.  But that's one of them.  Yes.  So Republicans have just proposed forbidding the FCC from allocating any more unlicensed  spectrum for Wi-Fi and other uses unless they give wireless companies  the opportunity to buy exclusive licenses first.  So there's a bill, in effect, that would end white spaces, that would end this kind of  growth in Wi-Fi because, in fact, public knowledge has issued an action alert,  because Congress is considering offering it to the wireless companies first.  These wireless companies, you know, I just saw the AT&T doubled its lobbying  in the last quarter.  Of course, that's because of the T-Mobile thing.  But these companies are very aggressive about lobbying.

And lo and behold, when the FCC finally comes out with its—  What a shock.  Really?  Yeah, with its speech, you know, we're going to regulate the Internet by not regulating  the Internets.  And by the way, the mobile Internet doesn't count.  It's like, don't tell me that there is no tie-in between spending $11 million in  Washington, D.C. and all of a sudden—  Getting the result you want.  Yeah.

A woman named Jennifer Ruggero posted on Google.  She said, let's see, can we make a public playlist that people can add to?  So she published the link.  This is one of the things I like about Spotify.  You can publish a URL to the playlist, which anybody can click on, subscribe to, and then add to.  So she picked a bunch of songs with the word circle for Google Plus in it.  And then look at all these people have added songs.  It's made this a public playlist by a lot of different people.  You can make a playlist and have people add to it.  And then you can subscribe to it.  And the beauty of this is I don't have any of these songs,  but because I'm subscribing to RDO, I could play this entire playlist.

But that's like 80 hours.  If I had to renew that every two weeks, I would never have finished it.  So it's really nice to have the kind of look at this as war and peace.

Who say that they with Harvard Connect, they invented Facebook.  They hired little sophomore Mark Zuckerberg to code it.  He put him off.  He put him off.  Finally, he says, you know what, guys, I'm going to do the Facebook instead.  And they were pissed.  You remember that this week, Larry Summers, who was the president of Harvard at the time.  And he's great in the movie.  Remember that where they go into the president of Harvard and he says,  you're men of Harvard.  Come up with another idea.  He says, what are you?  You're asking me to come up with it.  Apparently, that was fairly accurate because they were interviewing Summers  at a conference this week and he called them a-holes.  Ooh, a-holes.

And Isaacson said, was that scene in the social network true?  Summers said, oh, I've heard it said I can be arrogant.  If that's true, I surely was on that occasion.  This is your quote.  One of the things you learn as a college president, if an undergraduate is wearing  a tie-in jacket on Thursday afternoon at 3 o'clock, there are two possibilities.  One is they're looking for a job and have an interview.  The other is they're a boop.  This was the latter case.

And now basically we've got the same thing only with an actual idea,  not like a software patentable idea.  And I think because these guys are at Harvard and oh, so pretty.  So you think that there's a merit to what they're asking?  I think it's a messy case.  I think this is why there are contracts.  I think this is why there are lawyers.  I think this is why it's really difficult to start a business out of your dorm room  and not get stomped on if it actually explodes.

Start time: 4466.68
End time: 4520.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so four million documents over three months.  He was charged with wire fraud, computer fraud, unlawfully obtaining information for a protected  computer, recklessly damaging a protected computer.  Here's the issue.  First of all, I don't think this guy's a hacker.  He's a Harvard fellow.  He founded Demand Progress, which is an activist nonprofit.  One of the things that's in these JSTOR documents, this is a nonprofit research archive,  is a bunch of public domain scientific documents.  They've collected and charged for, right?  So it's possible.  In fact, according to the indictment, this was his intent.  He wanted to take those, liberate those articles, which are part of our scientific heritage,  make them freely available.  And he was going to put them on BitTorrent sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But he's also, he basically, there's nothing wrong with committing an act of civil disobedience,  but if you caught, you're still going to get punished.  That's a good point.  That's what makes it civil disobedience.  Because he went out of his way to create applications or have somebody else create  applications that would download an extraordinary number of titles off of this as quickly as  possible.  He was using multiple accounts.  What they're saying is he broke into a closet, grabbed a couple of IP addresses and was doing  alternate downloads to grab as many of these documents as possible, which is awesome.  Hey, let the information be free, especially if it's public information to begin with.  But the service, and I'm sure MIT are supremely pissed off about this right now.  Four million documents.

Transcript:  His argument is that these files all predate 1923, which means these files are in public domain,  and that JSTOR has been taking public domain documents and charging...  It's very expensive.  Do you know, sir, how much it costs to get a document from JSTOR?  I don't know, but they're electrocuting him back there apparently.  Is it very expensive?  We're putting a light on the guy.  Wow. Welcome to Twitter.  I think this is interesting.  Gregory Maxwell has posted a 32 gigabyte file on Pirate Bay.  Says that Aaron Schwartz inspired the document release.  He says, all too often, journals, galleries, and museums are becoming not disseminators of knowledge  as their lofty mission statements suggest, but sensors of knowledge.  Charging for stuff that ought to be free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no. No, no, no.  Get me wrong. I love public domain.  No, I know. I know.  But the lawyers at Disney effectively killed public domain.  And then after they killed public domain...  It's a disservice to the public at large.  No, no, but the best part is after they realized...  After they killed public domain in the courts, they turned around and realized all they had to  do was trademark the mouse and their other characters and they could sit on them legally  forever. So after they screwed up public domain for the entire nation...  Copyright.  And arguably complicating it for the world, and our government is spending extraordinary  efforts to try to put in extraordinary copyright controls in other countries to basically at the  behest of the RIA and the MPAA. And look, I want people to get paid.

Start time: 4723.24
End time: 4751.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's why this is a good test case, because all these documents are pre-Mickey  Mouse era. They're all true public domain documents.  JSTOR would argue, yeah, but we collected them, scanned them, made them available online.  Expenses and costs.  We made them indexable, and that's why we charge you $19 to get these documents.  I'm pretty sure that both Schwartz and this other guy, Maxwell, are, it says in fact in  this article on ours, Technicar, part of a broader campaign to open up public access to academic work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's exactly what Doctorow addresses. He says that that's bull crap.  Because you can't get access to it.  Once something is public domain, it's public domain, no matter how you get a hold of it,  it's still public domain, even if you took it off the JSTOR site.  This will be an interesting case, I think, because I think that that's going to be the argument.  I would think so, and it's going to be a precedent maker, and it's going to be interesting.  Luckily, he's got money.
