Thanks for your donations.  Ladies and gentlemen, what a great Tweet we've got today.  We will do a little bit of news, but really it's such a rare opportunity to talk about  how the internet is reshaping artistry, creation.  I want to talk about that too.  But let me tell you who we have here.  We're really thrilled to have Jonathan Coulton with us.  The guy who wrote so many great songs, Code Monkey, of course, many of you have heard  on our shows many times.  He just wrote, recently wrote Still Alive for Portal, which is the closing theme in  Portal.  And Jonathan, it's great to have you from New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's great to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Big fans.  Now, the truth is we're getting the band back together.  We played once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There were some rumors that we had broken up, but that's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not true.  With us also Merlin Mann on drums.  Hello, Leon.  From 43 Folders.  On lead guitar.  From, I don't know, from Leeds, England, Veronica Belmont.  Hello.  From Mahalo.com.  And I played the bass.  We'll talk about what we're talking about in just a second.  Also with us are groupies, Ryan Block, chief editor-in-chief at Engadget.  I'm a groupie, yes.  Hello.  And Tom Merritt.  Yes, Ryan and I were watching at least.  From Buzz Out Loud.  Yeah.  You were in the audience at this amazing concert that we did on Saturday night at the Great  American Music Hall.  Jonathan, you hate San Francisco and yet you keep coming back.  I don't understand it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't hate San Francisco at all.  I love San Francisco.  It's always so much fun.  I mean, you saw the crowd there.  They were crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, were they, you were making your DVD.  Yeah.  Were they by invite or how did that work out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, those are all ticket buyers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the reason I ask is because it felt like it was all your buddies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know.  Well, that's why I love San Francisco.  San Francisco is one of those cities where when I do a show, that's how it feels.  It's the craziest thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and I want to, we'll talk about this a little later on the show, but I want to  kind of address this whole notion of the niche because I mean, I'm a niche broadcaster for  sure and in a way, I think you're a niche musician.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I want to know if that's your choice or not, but we'll talk about that in a second.  And I even have a video.  Yes, go ahead, Veronica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't hear Jonathan at all.  Oh, of course not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't hear him either.  Thanks to the magic of turning him up.  Thanks to the magic of, see, Veronica studied this in college.  Veronica, why aren't you running the board?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  You should hire me to do it sometime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't afford you.  You're paying, you're getting Calacanis rates now.  You're priced out of my market.  Easy.  We'll talk about that in a second.  And there are a couple of things I want to mention in the news real quickly before we  go.  That's a good time to talk about our rock success.  But before we do that, I should mention a couple of things.  I asked Ryan Block, he said the big story, of course, HD DVD.  Finally really kicking the bucket.  This is a story we've been saying every week, you know, as we watch the dominoes fall since  it started at the beginning of the year with Warner Brothers deciding not to make HD DVDs  anymore.  Finally on exactly a week ago, Toshiba said, that's it, we're giving up.  Okay, we're giving up to no more HD DVD and Xbox 360.  So it's over.  Finally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Finally.  After years.  So I don't know about you, I feel really relieved.  I didn't really care who won between Blu-ray and HD DVD so much as that one format came  to the top and the other one away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unless you were just tired of seeing HD DVD on its deathbed since January.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was like hooked up to the IV, the catheters, the heart monitors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I got a really bad feeling for them when they basically packed up and went home  at CES.  Yeah.  Because the Warner announcement came right before CES and their response to that was,  we're going to cancel our press conference.  Isn't that when you knew it was over?  The worst possible thing you could do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we talked about it at the time and I think that's when you knew it was over,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  right?  You know, I had a feeling that they would actually try to draw it out longer than they  did.  If I was going to just estimate at the time, I would have said it might have gone through  the second half of the year.  So I'm a little relieved that they decided to just kind of cut it short and cut their  losses and let everybody move on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I saw a story today that said maybe Sony had actually laid out some cash for that.  Do you think that's incredible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I saw a rumor, 400 million or something got paid to Toshiba to back out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, the rumor was 400 million paid to Warner to go exclusive.  That I believe.  And the corollary rumor to that was that Sony paid something like 800, 900 million to Toshiba  in changing hands of an RSX, a cell chip plant.  And the cell chip is what powers a lot of, it's what powers the PlayStation 3 and also  what powers a lot of HD DVD players.  Really there's cell chips and HD DVD players?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  So I think that there's a lot of talk about moneyed interests.  I don't think that that was probably what decided for Toshiba.  They just, at the end of the day, they couldn't hack it.  They didn't have the ties in the entertainment industry that Sony did.  Nobody really thought about it as much years back when the format war was starting, but  Sony just has an almost limitless amount of cash that they can throw at entertainment  entities and Toshiba never had that.  Toshiba can never offer $400 million to Warner.  I have to congratulate Sony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sony did this with guts.  They said, we're going to put this thing in the, this Blu-ray player in the PS3, even  though it's going to cost us a lot more, it's going to, it's going to hold up our launch.  It's going to slow down our production.  But you know, it turns out it paid off for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was a gamble though.  It's baked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If Sony had the entertainment ties back during Beta Max, do you think that Beta would have won?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Beta was the superior format.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought they were Sony's.  Wasn't that their format?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I mean.  Like, but Sony didn't have all of these entertainment ties back in the late seventies, early eighties  that they have now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I see what you're saying.  Yeah.  They didn't have the movie studio.  Yeah.  All right.  That's one story.  We could say goodbye to HD DVD with great relief.  It's fine.  It's over.  I have two.  Can we play Taps?  I actually had something last week.  I played, I played Chopin's Funeral March.  Oh, right.  I could still play it again, but I, let's not.  It's a downer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to put my little HD DVD add-on player right up next to the Timex Sinclair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have two HD DVD players.  I don't know what I'm going to do.  And like 20 movies.  I don't know what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're still good for up converting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  My TV does that.  Or a door stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's mostly it.  You're just being polite.  I'm being polite.  I was mad.  Oh, that was a great list.  I saw that too.  In Gadget.com, you tell us a couple of them.  All right.  Well, you know, why don't you give me just a sec so I can pull that up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm also in the news.  And Merlin Mann brought this up.  And then we're going to get to JoCo.  I'm sorry, Jonathan, to bore you with all this.  Although, Jonathan, you used to be a computer programmer.  This is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, this is not boring at all to me.  Listen, I love this stuff.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You're a geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just don't feel smart enough to talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Merlin had that problem for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That doesn't stop any of us.  Yeah.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ready?  I'm going to drop a couple of things to do with your HD DVD player.  Yeah.  All right.  So one thing you might be able to do, number five on the list, is channel it through Whoopi  Goldberg and make some pottery with it.  I like ghost.  A little ghost reference there.  I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're too young for that reference, though.  A lot of the readers were like, I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, wait a minute.  Let me ask you a question.  Veronica, are you too young for that reference?  No.  Well, then who the hell is too young for that reference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like the 13 year olds that are reading in Gadget these days.  There's a five year old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the Dewey Defeats Truman reference, I understood some people being too young for.  It was also something.  But come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yeah, a lot of people can get that.  I Photoshopped HD DVD Defeats Blu-ray on the day of the death of HD DVD.  So many people were confused.  What are you talking about?  Did you have Harry Truman holding it?  No, no, no, no.  Yeah, the Harry Truman, the Congress Tribune.  That's so funny.  History 101, anybody.  I like buy a few dozen HD DVD players and build a hut for your Blu-ray player.  A little tent.  Yes, exactly.  You got to keep it safe.  I can't believe it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thomas Edison electrocuted an elephant to try and prove that HD DVD was better.  That just doesn't seem appropriate.  Just because you don't like Tesla, you don't need to go out and electrocute an elephant.  Youngsters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That one only the 80 year olds in the audience are getting that one, Merlin.  I don't know where you come up with this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This will be the last one.  This is actually the one I think a lot of people are probably going to try to do and  might even get in trouble for.  And that is buy the Blu-ray player of your choice, put it in a box, attempt to return  it as quote unquote defective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You mean HD DVD player?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, no.  You buy a Blu-ray player, return it with the HD DVD player in the box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's something wrong with this.  It won't play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It might work.  There's something wrong with it.  It's a dead format.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Look at it.  It smells it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's something wrong.  I spent all this money on this player and now it's no good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got me.  And then Merlin wanted to bring up the kind of interesting article about Ed Felton, who  is a great security researcher and has done a lot on this, pointed out and observed that  I didn't know this.  RAM doesn't lose its memory immediately.  That even after you've powered down the system, the RAM retains the contents for a period  of some undetermined period of time.  He further, I'm sure I could just see the graduate students working on this one.  He further found out that if you freeze the RAM using compressed air or something like  that, you actually have the time to take it out of the old system, put it in a new system  and read its contents.  Of course, if you've had an encrypted hard drive using TrueCrypt or PGP disk or a lot  of different full disk encryption technologies, including Microsoft's BitLocker and FileVault,  which is Apple's OS X encryption, that the keys are kept in RAM.  If you can get the RAM, put it in a new computer, read the RAM, you'll get the key and you can  unlock the drive.  In other words, this encryption stuff isn't going to be hackable.  But I have to point out, you also have to somehow get the laptop away from the guy after  he logs in, but before he logs out, before it goes back to sleep, you have to take it  over to your secret lair, spray it with Freon, pull it out, put in another laptop, read it,  put it back in, give the guy the laptop back.  So it's not an easy hack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Totally.  The reason I thought it was a little complicated than it probably is, and the fact is drive  encryption techniques are there to prevent people from reading it if they have physical  access to the machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it won't work unless you've logged in to the machine.  In other words, you have to unlock the drive before this technique will work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The key is in RAM until you give it the password, though, yes?  No, the key is in RAM as soon as you turn on the machine.  Is that right?  Huh, I didn't realize that part.  That was what they stated in the Exploit video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Merlin?  Well, I heard all these horror stories in the last year or two about in the UK and the  US, all these laptops disappearing.  And I think the panacea, people said, well, that's just because you hadn't locked your  disk down.  And so I just wonder, is it fair to say that this had been kind of the way that high security  folks were depending on their stuff to be encrypted?  I mean, it seems like, I don't know, if you've got it in your possession.  Well, yes and no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the way, if you're talking about CIA operatives, if you're imagining that scenario,  what you're going to be really looking at is a totally locked down laptop, but that  laptop is going to phone home and all the data is going to live in Langley.  I mean, it's not going to live on that laptop.  You're not going to have top secret documents or something like that.  You're talking about these really extreme scenarios.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What about if you, like a lot of people I know, and I'm trying to get in this habit,  is, so I'm on a Mac.  A lot of people I know are creating like sparse images or like making super encrypted disk  images inside the actual disk.  Does this hack affect that as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I don't think that it would.  Not unless you happen to have that drive open at the time.  So if people were worried about this, if people were worried about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why wouldn't that key also be in the RAM at boot time though?  Because you haven't opened up that disk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you're creating a virtual disk or a disk image or something like that, if you haven't  actually opened it yet, then you wouldn't have loaded that key into memory.  So the concept of this hack is you turn on your computer, you basically let it boot to  your login prompt and that key is in memory.  That's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If it is in memory yet or not.  If you're using a BIOS encryption technique or a TrueCrypt for instance, maybe there's  a key there, but you don't unlock it until you enter the password.  It doesn't automatically unlock.  And if it does, then you have a flaw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you're talking about drive encryption, and these refer to whole drive encryption  techniques as far as I know, which is the entire drive.  It's not like I'm going to encrypt this folder or that folder.  It's the entire drive is encrypted, which would mean that the second you turn on that  computer it has to go find the key so it can actually start the boot process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, it asks you for a password though at that point.  Look, if the drive automatically boots up and logs in without your password, they don't  need any of this.  Right?  It has to ask you for the password otherwise you're not secure anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, only assuming you could bypass the initial login.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Anyway, we'll look more into this.  I think it's an interesting story.  I think it's a little difficult to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Should we ask Jonathan, what's your password?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, you laugh, but it's funny because...  Just frees his brain and extracts it.  I asked the Secret Service this and I've talked to the FBI and Secret Service about this.  What are you going to do when encryption is common and bad guys use encryption?  They say, oh, they use it all the time.  We ask them for the password.  They almost always just give it to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  Isn't that what Kevin Mitnick says?  It's ultimately the best way to get access is to call a C level and ask him what his  password is.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, apparently crooks are so anxious to confess.  Either that or they're waterboarding him.  They may not have mentioned that part.  They might have said waterboard and then ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With this freezing hack, I was thinking, well, all you got to do is just stand by your laptop  for 35 seconds or so because that's about the longest that your key will stay in RAM  before it fades away.  But if it's there, boot up.  I guess that blows that out of the water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, three interesting stories.  We have one that is breaking right now and I don't have the details on, but I'm going  to possibly at the end of this show, we'll put we'll add a interview with a network security  expert about this because I'm trying to track it down.  Earlier today, YouTube was down for about 45 minutes to an hour.  I mean, really down.  No message saying, you know, our servers are down or we're fixing the servers.  Nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, the only thing I have to say about that that's kind of frightening is that the  whole time YouTube was down, those commenters were somewhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where were they and what were they doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where did they go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I want to quickly go to your blog, check your comments.  Well, there's a larger there's a larger story here and this is what I need a network expert  to explain to me.  And we are going to look into this.  And I imagine, you know, it's funny that it's funny how the tech press really has gone home  for the weekend. So there's no there's very little about this on the Internet today.  Tomorrow, I imagine you'll see a lot.  You might have seen a story that said Pakistan was going to block YouTube because of anti  Islamic videos on YouTube.  That story broke yesterday, apparently.  I've been reading some posts from network operators and and so forth.  And I'll give you links on the show notes so you can read these for yourself.  When Pakistan blocked it, they made some round simple router errors, routing errors  that propagated throughout the rest of the net and actually did bring YouTube down  globally because of what Pakistan did.  Wow. Currently, YouTube is being routed, as far as I can tell, with a traceroute  through Hong Kong.  So there so I think there's more to this than meets the eye.  There will be, of course, a lot of speculation.  Did Pakistan do this on purpose?  YouTube was able to respond quickly.  They got it back not universally, but they started coming back about 45 minutes  after I was I was doing the radio show the time I have chat room users from all over  the world. So I was seeing reports as it kind of slowly came back around the world.  It's as far as I know, it's it's up everywhere now.  But I think a very interesting story.  So there'll be more to talk about perhaps at the end of this show, if I can get some  network experts on, we'll we'll talk about that.  But that's that could be serious.  I mean, that could be a significant issue down going down the road if it's possible  to do that. Meanwhile, let's get back to the most important story of the day.  And that's the fact that we rocked 99 percent on Saturday night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We were 99 percent perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, you were very gracious, Jonathan, and you said that was OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's an A plus. 99 is an A plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, according to not according to the YouTube commenters,  some of the YouTube anyway, had some had some very pointed remarks about our performance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like I haven't read anything yet, but I know that I want to take full blame.  I cannot play the bass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We know that going in.  You were you were very upfront about that, Leah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You had a hat. You had a hat and you had a really cool shirt.  I had the best costume. I don't think anybody.  Although, well, OK, I had the best costume.  Jonathan had the best pecs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He looked ripped. Didn't he look cut?  He looks like he's been doing sit ups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where'd you get that shirt, Jonathan?  I want one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That shirt? I don't know.  It's just a plain cotton shirt.  You know, I don't I'm not a I'm not style conscious like you, Leah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, then I guess he's cut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I'm not. I just it's just maybe a little small for me was the problem.  Also, as I said, I was holding my stomach in the whole time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So well, we've got Vimeo video of the of the thing.  I'm sure there'll be more video, but we've got Vimeo video thanks to Chris  at Joystick, who was in the audience with an HD Canon, exactly HD 1000.  He's your camera guy, I guess, Victoria.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just called me Victoria.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good Lord, Veronica.  Vercano.  Victoria, Vercano, whatever happened to her inside edition?  Really? Is that where she is now?  Yep. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She was the question. I was reading the YouTube comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, dear. Are they that bad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, massive fail. Massive fail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, these are kids who play rock band day in, day out.  I'd never played rock band before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, we should have pulled a Stu Sutcliffe and just had an unplugged base  while somebody else actually was playing the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was on heroin. Does that help?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's definitely there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Always with the heroin, Leo.  Jonathan, I'm sorry. I'm an addict.  Jonathan, you want to explain what happened, what was going on there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I was I was in San Francisco playing a show  that I was also shooting in the hopes that I will  release it as a concert DVD or something like that sometime in the future.  And I wanted something stunty and exciting.  And when when they let me know that that song was coming out on rock band,  I said, well, I know I know what would be exciting.  So I I asked the people of of Harmonix if they could help out in  getting a special developers Xbox there,  which is the only thing that can run still alive because it's not officially  released yet. And they were very helpful in getting everything set up.  And then I wanted to invite a bunch of  local famous people, but they couldn't make it.  So I asked you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got the geeks, that's for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did. Well, that's exactly what I wanted.  I wanted a band of famous geeks playing a video game  in a place where people had paid money to see entertainment.  I thought that would be funny.  And I do think, you know, I think that even though we got the 99 percent,  I think the spectacle of it  is was worth something to the people in that audience.  They seem to really appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They gave us a standing ovation, which shocked me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My wife said it was the best part of the show.  She was her favorite part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your mother said that?  No, my wife. Oh, sorry. I misunderstood.  That's not my neurosis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sure you'll get to this, but it must be noted that despite everything  that Leo and I could do to ruin the show, it's Victoria, right?  Veronica. Why I ought to.  Veronica, man, she threw down.  She was throwing down some Ingeve style licks as Leo and I fumbled around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you guys, you guys would would would would sort of lose power  completely, fall out of the game, and she would pull that move and save you  and bring you back into the game. It was fantastic.  She was like she was the only one keeping us together, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We call her Veronica Overdrive Belmont. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I like that. I'm OK with that.  That's pretty good. Yeah.  I mean, you were waiting to practice.  I think we would have totally blown it out of the park.  But we did very well for ourselves. All things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We got one. We're one. We got to go through it once. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ahead of time. Yeah. Which is which is nothing.  Because that is a that is a complicated song.  I should know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The baseline begins a minute in.  I failed a minute 30 in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's no it's a brass in pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But, you know, yeah, I have to say my favorite thing is that is that  because 99 percent, you know, is very close to 100.  I don't think I have to tell you that.  But, you know, we we were sort of teetering on the brink of disaster  for most of the songs.  And I didn't think we were going to get to the end.  And then, of course, we did get to the end. Yes.  We appeared to finish the song.  We started high fiving each other.  And then I turned around and I noticed that that song failed.  So not only did we fail, but we high fived each other as we were doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just want to point out that I failed right at the point at the chorus  at the final chorus at the end, where you're saying, I'm still alive.  And I thought that was very fitting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other perfect thing about it. Yeah.  Actually, no, you're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm dead. And by the way, the cake is a lie.  I just want everybody.  This is I have to say, OK, now let's back up a little bit,  talk a little bit about what I the twit part of this,  which is what Jonathan is doing is absolutely fascinating as a business model.  And it became really clear to me going to that concert.  You have willingly or not  this chewed universal stardom  in favor of just going right for the niche.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, I'm not sure.  I'm not sure that was a choice necessarily.  I, you know, I think I feel like the niche found me,  you know, from my perspective, I just do what I like to do.  And then, you know, it just happens to be that it's it's really geeky stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's it's interesting to see this audience and they come bearing,  you know, creepy dolls.  They come bearing monkeys and ponies, you know, and they come  as zombies.  There was a guy dressed as a zombie with a badge and says, Hi, my name is Bob. Yeah.  I mean, they're so into your music there.  And you rarely you rarely see this.  I think in some ways you are genuinely an Internet's  one of the first Internet superstars  in the sense that you you get the kind of response from a very particular  group of people that any artist would want to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. But just just just on a small scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But well, I don't know how small it is because, you know,  as somebody who programs to the same niche, that's not a bad niche.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no, not at all.  I mean, you know, compared to I think that you would see  you would probably see the same number of people  in the equivalent of costume and in the equivalent of carrying half pony,  half monkey monsters.  If you went to an Aerosmith show, it's just that there would be,  you know, 100000 people there instead of on the order of hundreds.  You know, I feel you're saying I and it's true.  Like when I when I do a show like that, the audience really does  make me feel like a rock star, which, if you know me at all, is hilarious  because that's not how I feel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I must say one more thing and I'm going to let the panel join in.  But from a very personal point of view,  I think that from from the from the individual's point of view,  having 10000 fans like that or a million fans like that  is kind of indistinguishable.  I mean, you can only absorb so much anyway.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's probably true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you've got 50 fans in the lobby of your hotel,  you've got 50 fans.  It doesn't matter that there's a million others who would like to be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, that's a good point.  That's a good point.  It's like the sort of the the version of it that I have direct  access to that I can actually process is that's that's kind of how I feel about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If it got any bigger, I don't know.  My brain would explode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. You and me both, believe me. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's what makes this so so wonderful in terms of the  not just the business opportunities, but, you know, I mean,  what does it mean to be a corporation in America?  It means that you're you're legally obligated to constantly grow  whether you want to or not.  And if you're a one person show or say a five person show,  you get to make a lot of your own decisions about who you want to please  and for how much.  And I think that, you know, I guess one term you could use for this is micro brand  micro branding or whatever you want to call.  But what it comes down to is you have incredibly low costs of running  your business associated with serving exactly the people who you want to serve.  And I think once you start doing that, it's kind of intoxicating  and realizing that you can make a living by just talking to the people  that you really want to talk to and not having to serve an Aerosmith sized audience.  And I think that's apart from the fact that, you know, just the my gosh,  the enthusiasm of your audience, which is really completely intoxicating.  I think it's just really cool that you're doing that so well.  And I think it's a model.  I think I said to you at the show that night, I think you're going to be recognized  as patient zero in terms of like five years from now.  A lot of label guys wondering what in the hell happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's exactly and that's why we're doing a Twitter around this,  because that's exactly how I see it as well.  I mean, it's now Ryan, you and Tom were in the audience.  So you have I guess we were in the audience for a little bit.  But did you have that same reaction sitting there?  Had you been to a Jonathan Colton concert before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I had. Yeah, go ahead, Ryan.  No, no, I got. Oh, you be polite first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead, Tom. I'll vote, Tom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I just want to say I had never been to a Jonathan Colton concert  because he doesn't come out here as often because he lives in Brooklyn.  Now, it's very because he hates San Francisco and California, I believe.  But he said he loves San Francisco.  That's better. Yeah, that's better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a song, by the way. He hates California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. But it was interesting.  I have been to a Taylor Hicks concert as well,  who is an American Idol winner, right?  With a huge hype machine behind him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm curious to see where this goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and there were not as many people at the Taylor Hicks San Francisco show.  They were not dressing up as Taylor Hicks songs.  They were not as involved.  They were not as excited.  And they were mostly teenage girls  going to a Jonathan Colton song or Jonathan Colton concert.  You saw a sold out show.  And I know there were people who who talked about wanting to go to the show  who couldn't because it was sold out.  And so even if it isn't an Aerosmith size audience,  you think about comparing it to other smaller acts  that are sort of, you know, Sony's attempt at proprietary formats  is to just throw a bunch of stuff out there.  And every once in a while, one like Blu-ray hits and they make a billion dollars.  That's what the record companies do as well.  But instead of just like trying stuff and throwing it against the wall  and see if you get an audience.  Jonathan, I think, has developed an audience that is a much higher quality of an audience.  And you could see that there.  You could see that every single person there was really there,  really excited, really into the show.  You know, they weren't just there to be seen and walking around.  I mean, the bar was empty, for goodness sake.  It's never been to a show where there was nobody at the bar.  They were all watching the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, Merlin was at the bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually it's funny, I single handedly kept the bar open.  But also I noticed the inhaler table was getting a lot of refills.  Are you offering refills? What was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, Jonathan, can I ask what neighborhood of Brooklyn do you live in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I live in Park Slope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's nice. I love it.  So I lived in New York for like six years.  I moved out to San Francisco about a year and a half ago.  I lived in Williamsburg for a while.  And the reason I ask is because you're definitely playing to the audience,  I think, out here. And I'm just going to throw this out there.  Maybe I'm completely wrong.  But I feel like in terms of cities to play in America,  you're going to get the nerdiest, geekiest audience in San Francisco.  Pretty much hands down. I'm going to maybe I'm completely off base.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you're absolutely right.  This is why I love San Francisco.  There are a few cities that are really great for me.  And, you know, incidentally, New York is not one of them.  There are great crowds here, but they are not as insane  as they are in cities like San Francisco, Seattle,  Boston. Boston is very good.  Chicago as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you just name the cities where the nerds are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's exactly what it is.  And it's, you know, you talk about it, it's pretty,  it makes it very obvious to me that it is a really powerful niche thing.  And it's also, I think,  the other reason that it works out so well is that,  you know, geeks and tech people are fans of things in a way  that other people are not fans of things.  You know, that fandom in this world means a particular kind of dedication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're much more willing to put on the pointy ears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's exactly right.  That's my very definition of a nerd.  It's not that you're into technology or that you're into,  you know, whatever American Idol.  It's that you're whatever you're into.  You're just obsessed with it.  You can be a nerd really cool.  You know, you could be a nerd for fashion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Rare. It's the thing that makes it rare, though, is is.  Yeah, you'll see. So whatever somebody like from Star Trek, you know,  who will show up at a convention or something.  But the level of engagement, the I mean,  the lack of condescension toward your fans is really,  I think, really just awesome.  And the fact that you seem really into it and when they show up  with the pointy ears on, like you're you're not just like,  I'm here to pick up a check.  Like you're really into that.  Like you seem really into the fact that these people have gotten super engaged  with these songs of yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I saw Jonathan make so many people's night at that show, like the zombie table.  They were all like their heads were about to explode with glee.  They were so happy that you pointed them out and were talking to them.  And then Andy Bates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the story with Andy Bates? OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So let Andy Bates. I don't know.  Well, I'll tell you the story with Andy Bates.  So this is during the song Chiron Beta Prime.  I usually like to ask a volunteer from the audience to come up and  and sing the robot line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The very fact that you could do that without telling them what to sing.  And it works.  So I know tells you something right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Andy Bates, in particular, he told me he came up to me after the show.  And he said, this is the guy that got chosen.  And I chose him because when I said I need a volunteer,  he like stood up on his chair and raised his hand immediately.  He sure did. He was like 10 feet tall.  And I was like, OK, that's my that's my guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, Andy was wearing a bow tie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was so excited because he had he had been to, I think, two shows  before that and had volunteered and not been chosen. Oh.  And and he and he did not have a ticket to this show and it was sold out.  And he checked on he asked on the forums on my site.  And there was somebody who had like six extra tickets,  who was giving them out to all these singletons who didn't have a ticket  and wanted to come. So then at the end of the day,  there were a group of like six or seven people who didn't know each other,  who who all went together to the show.  And he was one of those one of those people.  And I just thought that was the I just thought that was the coolest thing.  And then when he came up, he was just so excited and he was so into it.  And he he made the show.  I mean, he made that that song.  It was like was the greatest thing to watch him do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So really, to make this of use to other people, I think, I mean,  it's it's wonderful to bask in the glory of our rock stardom,  Veronica and Merlin. And God knows, I'll never forget it.  But what I find interesting is is how this came about.  So, Jonathan, you were a computer programmer and you had a hobby of music.  What was the story there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I had always been interested in making a living as a musician,  but never could quite figure out how to go about doing it.  Also, I think I was afraid for a long time.  But, yeah, I was I wrote software at a small firm in Manhattan for  for about nine years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can I can I ask which firm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know if you've heard of them.  It's it's called Cluins.  They make they make database software for executive recruiting firms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you write log in pages?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was your code functional and elegant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, my God, we're we're just as bad as the people in the audience.  You guys are we're the people.  Oh, yeah, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I did write login pages and my code was functional and not at all elegant.  But it's got the job done.  And then, you know, I had done music on the side and  it was sort of a hobby thing.  I was certainly not making a living from it, but I had put a CD together,  you know, a sort of vanity, vanity press kind of thing.  And and and then it was after my daughter was born.  I said, well, geez, I'm I'm actually mortal.  I'm going to die.  This proves that because here is the generation that will take my place.  And I better get off my butt and do something.  And that was that was really the moment.  So I quit the job and just started  doing this song a week thing,  you know, recording a new song every week and putting it out on my side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And and you're giving and you were giving those away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it was just that it was basically it was a podcast.  They were all in an RSS feed.  And, you know, I kind of feel like I got lucky.  There were just a couple of songs that that got linked by the right people.  And and before I knew it, people were more and more people were paying attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We played Code Monkey like eight thousand times.  I felt like an AM radio disc jockey.  And now let's listen to that song one more time called Monkey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, you know, actually, I think that that speaks directly  to the meritocracy that is the Internet and the blogosphere.  Exactly. The theory of the standing theory is that like,  it's not necessarily about the resources you have behind you.  It's that great things, great content, great, you know, people and ideas will  will float to the top.  And and that's I think really, you know,  what's at the core of any success like this is, is, you know,  you can't fake goodness.  You know, that has to be something there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a fundamental question that I get asked all the time.  Well, OK, if there's a million web pages, how do I how do people find me?  How do they you know, is it really a meritocracy or can I just get swamped  by all the other content?  Will the best always rise and be discovered?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I believe so. Yeah, because it's not well, I mean, it's not just about being good.  Right. You can't be good once.  And that's it. Right.  You can't write one great song and then expect to be, you know, Aerosmith or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's it's a package.  It's a package, because if you think about it and just if you ever get tired of us,  just kissing your butt, Jonathan, you can just hang up.  But why would I ever get tired of that?  Here's what I think, because this is what makes Jonathan the perfect storm in some ways  is the yes, he put out stuff.  First of all, first of all, he had a container for it.  Right. Like what is one thing that makes something interesting to people is an expectation  of what's going to be happening, what's going to be coming along.  And Jonathan said, like, even if it kills me, I'm going to put out about a song a week.  Brilliant. And and and so really now that's created an expectation with people.  But then second of all, the elephant in the room is he gave it away.  So Jonathan understood that there was going to if there's going to be revenue  streams associated with this, it wasn't just something of going like, OK,  before I've even gotten your interest, you have to give me a dollar.  So he found this way of saying, I want to put this out there.  And now there's this audience of people who are buying box sets of stuff they already  downloaded for free because he's created a relationship.  And that's and that's a whole different thing from just saying, like, oh, how do I  like do SEO for my site so that I can kind of compel people to find me on Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I think I think it's interesting to think about, like, you know, for instance,  babies got back. Right. That was that was how I discovered Jonathan.  Right. It was linked by Boing Boing.  So somebody at Boing Boing finds it, thinks it's good enough to blog.  Enough people see it on Boing Boing and think it's good enough to talk about to  their friends and think about and and and other people started blogging about it.  And I have to say, like, I saw that I looked around on Jonathan's site.  I was like, oh, this guy looks really cool.  I think W's duty was the next song that I got, which I was like, OK, that's that's  kind of funny. And then Code Monkey came along.  I don't know when I found that. I was like, oh, it's that guy, Jonathan Colton.  So it's it's sort of, you know, it's I don't know that everything good rises to the top,  but I think it has to be good to rise.  In other words, there's so many bumps that you have to get over with people to really  get their mind share that you have to be good two or three times.  And that's when you're like, oh, wow, yeah, that's that's really something I'm  interested in. I'm going to go back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I would ask Jonathan, you did you gave him away because you didn't think you  could charge for him, right? I mean, it's not like you had a clever plan here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I really I wouldn't say it was a clever plan.  I did I did imagine that it was to my benefit to give them away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you did. So you were thinking along these the lines of building this career.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I was really I was really hoping I was hoping that this is what was  going to happen. People were asking me, what is your what is your plan?  What the hell are you doing? How are you going to make a living?  And I would always say, I don't know, I don't know.  And and really, I think I was my secret hope was that it would be like this.  And I couldn't even really admit to myself that that's what I was hoping was  going to happen because it seemed so crazy.  But the reason I gave them away was because, yeah, at that point, you know, I  figured I just wanted as many people to hear them as possible, you know, and under  the assumption that, you know, let's get famous now and then we can get rich later

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  on. There's another piece to this, I think, is  fascinating without saying too much out of school.  I chatted with one of your very cool harmonics buddies.  Oh, yeah. Just talking about. Yeah. Yeah.  And just talking about how I mean, he was really straight up about it.  He was like, well, you know, Jonathan put all this stuff out on Creative Commons.  Like we could sit around and do stuff with his stuff without having to talk to a  lawyer. And so and the thing is, if we wanted to go and do any of this stuff with  somebody to label, a we'd go there and they say they'd say creative what and then  B, we'd have to go through this phalanx of lawyers before we ever got to do  anything. And how much can we charge for the ringtone?  So, I mean, I think there's something that that's why I say it's a perfect storm.  It's a kind of openness that's about more than just money or just free as in, you  know, freezing beer, freezing speech.  Like you're throwing stuff out there and saying, like, I think to an extent you're  saying I have I have a, you know, a personality and a set of things that I  think might interest you beyond just trying to pick your pocket for this one  thing that's that's a hit right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So should we expect a Jonathan Colton rock band pack anytime soon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would be fantastic, wouldn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd buy it. I'd buy rock band just for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would buy it just just for Skullcrusher Mountain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would totally. Oh, I want to play and sing Skullcrusher Mountain.  Absolutely.  Creepy doll.  Can I be the henchman?  I want to be Starface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Listen, if it happens, if it happens, you guys, that's when we get the band back  together and do another show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. I'm going to start practicing now.  Maybe by then I'll be able to play bass on Eazy.  Geez. I actually am going to buy rock band, even though it's like 250 bucks with  all those instruments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not $180.  How much?  Oh, wow.  Actually, a Target, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to Target after the show.  No, I'm sorry.  We got to go to home for see Joan Rivers on the red carpet.  No, I think it's very interesting to see what's happened then since then.  Now, at this point, you're selling records.  In fact, I just bought the complete for 70 dollars.  You get like I mean, it costs less than the whole complete Led Zeppelin.  And there are more songs on there than I that I want to listen to, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was my Christmas present to myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a great. It's great.  So do you sell a lot of music online?  I mean, is this working out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I actually ran the numbers for last year and it was about 40 percent of my  income was digital downloads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the rest was performance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the rest was split between merchandise, which means physical CDs and and T-shirts.  Oh, that's interesting.  And and and live shows, you know, ticket sales from live shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So people still want still want the CDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And someone someone said it's true.  People will download everything.  And then when they're at the show, they'll just buy the CDs anyway.  You know, because what it really comes down to, I think, is and this is what I've  always believed with so misguided about the the the language around the the RIA  or a position that you know, the actually fans very much want to support artists.  I agree.  You know, and and the fact is that this is another part of what I was doing is I was  always very clear from the beginning.  I would love for you to give me some money like that.  I am actually trying to make a living this way.  And, you know, here's my mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I've never said that.  Nobody knows. I would love for you to give me money, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but I mean, I think I think that's that's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's that's part of the transparency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Just be very upfront.  You know, look, I'd like to be a professional musician.  And if you if you want me to keep making music, I'm going to need to be making money  from it or else I got to get a day job again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it also kind of goes back to what Merlin was saying, right?  Because because you're not a corporation, you don't have to apologize for making

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  money. That's exactly right.  To a niche audience.  Look, Aerosmith, they make plenty of money.  I don't mind stealing their music.  Well, Jonathan, no, I mean, he can't be making that much.  Look at his T-shirt. We got it.  We got to buy his music. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's also a question of the kinds of I mean, you can I've always thought that you  can tell a lot about a corporation by the kinds of problems that they're comfortable  solving. It's true about people, too.  But I mean, if you look at somebody like putting out a Michael Jackson album or whatever,  a superstar album or whatever the kids like today, you know, that's a very costly venture  just because of the same thing for movies.  You know, you go look at movies now and look at like year over year, how much of the total  budget for films is marketing now.  And that's fine. If you want to be in the business of making one hundred and forty  million dollar movies, that's OK.  But you've got to look at, as I say, the cost of ownership and the cost of doing  business when you're a very small operation is very attractive.  It's just not the kind of problem that a large corporation can solve.  So, I mean, there's all of this opportunity out there.  You don't need to be famous with one hundred million people.  You can be really famous with ten thousand people.  And if it's the right ten thousand people, you'll make a living from it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the question is, can you make a living from it?  Right. You can be famous with with niche audiences.  But is this enough to build a business or is enough to live on?  And the question I want to know from from Jonathan is, you know, without talking  too much about your personal finances, I mean, do you think that it's feasible?  Do you think that people can actually make this happen for themselves as independent  musicians working outside of the record label system as we know it today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I will I will tell you without getting into specific numbers, you know, I will say  that last year I made more money than I did the last year I wrote.  I worked as a software designer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's all you need to know.  I mean, you're making a better living.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And that that even wasn't that wasn't even an important goal.  I didn't want to surpass my income.  I wanted to to match it or get close to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you have you have a family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, exactly. So it was important for me to continue making money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Having a family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. But, you know, the real the real and as far as I'm concerned, like that's it.  That's it. Like that's the success.  I have no idea how long it's going to last.  And I don't know.  I'm not convinced that I'm going to become super rich off of that.  But I would sure be pleased if I could do this for a decade or longer, you know.  And and I have to say it's the numbers just keep keep on improving, you know, and  and it's the crowds are constantly getting bigger.  And I have like 50 percent new visitors to my website.  So it's it's still it's still building.  I keep waiting for the backlash and maybe all these bad YouTube YouTube comments at the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's interesting because we're talking about how these these kinds of like artists  such performer life cycles go.  And typically, you know, I've known a lot of friends and very successful bands.  And, you know, you kind of reach this threshold where you actually start making money from like selling rights  and doing things like what you did with Portal.  So, I mean, is that kind of like was that ever a goal?  Is that is that something you see as an eventuality for independent musicians is kind of get, you know, get the commercial play,  you know, like kind of as White Stripes made it really big early on, I guess, that that one single that was in every commercial ever.  You know, so I mean, how crucial is that that, you know, that kind of portal interaction?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think that I think that, you know, David Byrne interviewed  Radiohead for the for Wired and and and he was talking about the record industry and he said,  yeah, you know, your your your ownership of that music is your pension.  And, you know, I think that that's certainly true for a lot of super famous musicians from the old guard.  And I think it's also certainly going to continue to be true with independent musicians.  And, you know, the I haven't had the opportunity to to sell out in that way.  So I don't I don't know precisely how I'd how I'd navigate that, you know, if they wanted me to if they wanted to use a piece of music for a  a  four hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you feel like that's changed much?  I mean, because I remember a few years ago, just, you know, to be perfectly honest when the shins sold  new slang to McDonald's for a French fry commercial, I just about lost it.  I mean, I was really partly because they had this video that was about kind of  homage to all my favorite 80s bands and I was totally sucked in.  And then I saw it in a commercial during the Super Bowl and I was like, I was beside myself.  But I got to say now I see like, OK, whatever the apples and stereo can buy a van now or, you know,  you see that this is really an alternate revenue stream.  And if we're going to sit around and download music all day, I'm not saying I do.  I hear it happens.  But if you're going to do that, there has to be a way for the artists to get paid.  And it seems to me like the artists who have the highest levels of engagement with their fans and have  the stuff to sell at the shows are going to because I know all kinds of people that are like, yeah,  I'm going to go see them. I'm going to buy a ticket.  I'm going to buy some drinks and I'm going to walk away with fifty dollars with the merchandise because I really like this band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think it's maybe even if it doesn't just apply to musicians, it applies to bloggers.  It applies to podcasters, to everything, every other kind of internet creation,  which we don't necessarily have live performances.  But engagement is critical.  Building a community around you is critical and I think brings longevity in a way that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you think it's changing now, Jonathan?  Do you think do you see that attitude about like where five years ago, like if you had said, hey,  I'm going to sell like, you know, super chunks sold their song to, you know,  British nights and people call them sellouts or whatever.  Like what do you see that attitude changing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think so, only because I sort of feel that same change in myself.  It used to feel like something shameful.  And now when I think about it, it doesn't feel that shameful.  And maybe that's because I am the one who stands to benefit from it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're paying for your own insurance.  That's why it doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  But yeah, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It also depends on the context, though.  I mean, you're doing it for an awesome video game.  I mean, how much better can you get than that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wouldn't have said that doing Portal was as it all selling out.  I mean, I think that's really playing to the fan base.  How did that come about?  Did that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I just said.  Yeah.  Did Harmonix approach you, Jonathan, or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Portal thing.  Yeah, the Portal thing came about.  Valve.  Not Harmonix.  Somebody from Valve came to a show of mine.  Kim Swift actually came to a show of mine in Seattle and came up to me afterwards and said,  we're from Valve.  And I said, oh, I love Valve.  I love Tap Life.  You know, and then she said, would you ever be interested in writing music?  I said, sure.  They flew me out there and we talked about stuff.  And I played Portal and I met Eric Walpaw, one of the writers.  And it became pretty clear that we had a nice overlap of sensibility, you know?  And that's when we decided that GLaDOS should sing a little song at the end of the game.  Oh, that's so great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But of course, you couldn't have gone, I mean, you're not going to go to,  you know, Tony Bennett or Burt Bacharach to write the theme for this.  You clearly understand, and it's clear that you understand,  you're able to throw the references, appropriate references in.  Yeah.  You mentioned Black Mesa.  I mean, it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it was definitely the kind of thing where we could, we were working on the same,  we were working in the same creative direction.  And I think that's why it worked so well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did they give you some lines or was it all yours?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They gave me plenty of references.  We talked a great deal about the backstory and he said, you know,  she hates Black Mesa, so you can play with that.  And there's this thing about cake, so do something with that, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is the best ending of a video game ever.  Most of the time you beat the boss.  I'm thinking of Bioshock, which was a great game.  You beat the boss.  It's anticlimactic.  You play Portal just to get to the song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm doing that right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's actually something I've been wondering.  This is something that my friend Chris, who was Chris Granny, the editor of Joystick,  he requested specifically that I ask.  Are you familiar with Spike TV's Video Game Awards show?  Yeah, sure.  Okay.  So in previous years, they've done a best song written for a video game category.  And pretty much it's always been crappy because nobody writes any good music.  And then, so did they ask you to be a part of it this year?  Because they left that category out of the awards.  And this was like the one year that a video game had an amazing song written for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I think that, you know, I confess I did not watch the show.  And now I'm not certain.  I don't think anybody has said either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, I think they actually had me perform the song.  I know that I performed the song to tape for them to use, I think, on the show in some way.  But not in terms of it being an award, just in terms of it being related.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe because they knew there was no chance anything else could win against you.  They're just going to show the performance and, you know, to heck with the category.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You were robbed, Jonathan, you were robbed.  They wanted to spare everybody else the embarrassment of getting horribly frowned by me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, that raises the issue.  I can't buy Still Alive, can I?  I mean, I can listen to YouTube versions of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you can buy it from the Amazon mp3 store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can buy both versions, actually.  You can, yeah.  The one performed by Jonathan and the one from the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it didn't come in my...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Orange Box soundtrack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My $70 Colton Complete collection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, I can't sell it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not yours to sell.  No.  Well, I'm going to go on Amazon and buy it.  That's fine. I don't mind.  You should.  Yeah, I love that song.  It's funny. I mean, there's something about that song.  Maybe it's because you spent the last eight hours beating Portal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, you know, I really think it's...  I give Eric so much credit.  He's such a funny and smart guy and is the writer of GLaDOS, basically.  You know, and I think that the genius of that game is that character.  She is so wonderfully complex and beating her feels...  You feel guilty about it, kind of, because you sort of feel sorry for her.  She's just crazy, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. I don't feel that sorry for her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's murderous, but she's also...  She's kind of sweet.  She's kind of sweet and she's just messed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's like the guy on Skullcrusher Island.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You write a lot of characters like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's why it was such a perfect matchup.  It's because this horrible monster who doesn't see what the big deal is about.  Why is everybody so upset at me?  But that's why it works.  It's because there's this character that you've grown to know and hate,  slash love over the course of the game, and then she sings you a song.  It's like, what else do you need?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, and she's just as demented in the song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I found something, an idea that I'm totally going to steal from you.  I'd never seen this before, and I think it's the best idea ever.  If you go to JonathanColton.com slash Primmer,  he's got this excellent like, so you decided to listen to Jonathan Colton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's what you should know first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's got this awesome page at JonathanColton.com slash Primmer slash listen,  and he's like, okay, so here's some songs.  Here's my four most popular songs.  Here's four funny songs.  Here's four sad songs.  And here's four funny slash sad songs.  Very smart.  Here's four geeky songs.  And here's four sweet songs.  I thought that was such a good idea.  I'm very, first of all, kudos for that.  But I also, just quickly, I love the fact that you write these songs that have,  like you write about like, it's a squid.  It's like the Midas Touch, right?  You get this squid that wants to touch things, but he keeps crushing everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got all misty-eyed during the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You've got all these songs that are like these characters who are like horribly flawed,  like monsters that like have, you know, it's, where does that come from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  I'm sure it's in me, you know?  I'm sure it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Comes from 10 years of writing C code.  What are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a touch of parody in the songs where, you know, you're very good at emulating  a normal song, which would just be a boring old love song,  but you've thrown in these very creative elements like the squid,  you know, that lend them some depth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And like the one about, oh gosh, is it...  Charon and Pluto or...  The Future Soon is like a Harry Chapin song.  It's got the little twist in the end, which is that her eyes have been ruined  by the robots he created.  And I think it's just something sweet.  That's very Chapin-esque, isn't it?  But it's totally...  The Future Soon is a famous song Jordan Laser podcast also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For the web podcast?  Can I ask, Jonathan, if you get a lot of comparisons to Steven Merritt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, no, I don't get a lot of comparisons.  Not that I know of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It never struck me, but then you had the ukulele in Magnet Field.  She was great, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, she is terrific, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You did put out that triple record that was all about robots,  which is kind of like...  Was it 69 Robot Songs?  69 Robot Songs, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what podcast uses his song, Veronica?  Jordan Laser.  That's your podcast?  Yes.  Jordan Laser Pointer.  Don't sue us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I won't.  It's fine.  It's Creative Commons, baby.  Just kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I asked Jonathan's permission to, even though it was Creative Commons,  just because I was seeing him in person.  Oh, thank you, Tom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good. That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And he looked at me like, it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As long as you don't make any money on it, you can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We don't make any money at all.  Silence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not a hard thing to do in podcasting, as a matter of fact.  Yes, indeed.  So Jonathan, what tools do you use?  Clearly, you can't just be a musician if you're going to take this path.  You have to have some marketing instinct, which you do.  I mean, the primer is a perfect example.  I'm sure you wouldn't label yourself a marketer.  What tools, what skills do you think somebody who wanted to follow your path should have,  besides being a good songwriter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think on top of whatever musical stuff there is there,  I think that having the ability to set up a website and to run my own website  has been really helpful to me, just because I didn't have to pay somebody to do it.  There's no disconnect between what I want it to do and what it does.  That's been a really nice thing.  And on top of that, I've always been interested in tech and staying up on stuff.  So I'm constantly reading about all of these new tools that are out there,  whether it's like the 61 is a good example, this website where you can upload music.  And it's this crazy sort of voting scheme that people can give songs a bump,  and it costs you a certain number of points to bump the song.  But if people behind you bump the song, then you get more points back.  And it's just this attempt at creating some kind of meritocracy of independent music.  And I read about these things because I'm interested in them,  and I want to know about them.  And then I see them and I try them out.  I think that above all, the fact that I am interested enough in this stuff to just try  everything and watch for new stuff all the time.  And then I just sort of keep the things that work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The motto of the 61, by the way, is radio sucks.  So let's do something about it.  I think that's part of the issue is that the music industry  has very limited promotional tools, primarily radio and billboards on Sunset Strip.  And this is where you have a huge advantage by understanding technology  and having an affinity and interest in it.  You can use these tools that are brand new that I mean,  I doubt very much anybody at Capitol Records is looking at the 61.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  HW No, no. Well, they wouldn't.  Well, also because the music streams and you don't get paid for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  TG Oh, no.  HW You know, I know. Isn't that terrible?  TG What a horrible idea. How can we make ringtones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  HW Exactly. Oh, I hate ringtones so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  TG I was wondering why you haven't tried the, I mean,  I think there'd be some good, there's some good licks in your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  HW Well, I do have a, there's a ringtones area on my site,  but I just point you to a site called Mixer Tones where you can upload MP3s and make your own,  because I find the idea of selling ringtones very offensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  TG Now, this is an interesting issue because  if you're going to play to this audience, you have to tread lightly and carefully  not to offend them. And there are, you just echoed the absolute sentiments of most geeks  about ringtones. Were you to suddenly sell ringtones, there would be a group of people  would say, ah, he sold out. HW Yeah, I'm conscious of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It hasn't really, hasn't really been an issue because, you know, I kind of agree with...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  TG You share that sensibility.  HW Yeah. I mean...  TG But I worry all the time about doing something that's going to offend the core.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  HW Oh, sure. Well, that's the problem with being a niche artist is that if you,  if you piss off the niche, you got nobody. TG Yeah, you live and die by the niche.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  HW Yeah.  TG Can you be as successful in niche?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  HW You have to be of the niche, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  TG Yeah, you have to be of the niche. That's right. You can't make it up. You can't say,  oh, I'm going to go out and serve NASCAR fans and get it right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  HW You should totally do that, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  TG I bet I could do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  HW You should do it. You should like really get into like, I don't know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  TG That's what Eric Siegel did. You know, the guy wrote Love Story, who's a Harvard professor.  He said, I know how to write a bestseller. He studied all the bestsellers. He totally  formulaically wrote Love Story and he served the niche. The difference is that was in a day when  the audience didn't talk back to you. You could fake it for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  HW I think Leo would be a very interesting experiment if you actually tried to do that.  If you said, you know what? I'm going to court the NASCAR niche and I'm going to start a NASCAR  podcast and just started doing it and seeing what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  TG It would be interesting, but you know why I don't do it? Because I have no interest in it.  Who cares?  HW I guess that's true.  TG It'd be too much like work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  HW Yeah. Well, that's the problem. And that's the other nice thing about being in a niche that  you're a part of is that it doesn't feel like work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  TG You're doing what you want to do. Yeah. You're interested in these sites and these  tools and the music and so you're enjoying it. You like people coming to your audience  carrying pony monkeys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  HW Yes, I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  TG You don't mind that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  HW Can I ask Jonathan a 43 folders ask question?  HW Yes.  HW Jonathan, when we talked just about a year ago for the Merlin show,  we talked a little bit about your email. I don't know if you remember this.  HW I sure do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  TG Are you at inbox zero, Jonathan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  HW That's what I'm curious about. Now at the time, just for history, for backstory,  Jonathan was dealing with a very high volume of email and I'm curious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  HW Merlin, you're like a proctologist who asks everybody about their butthole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  HW Can I look at your butt?  HW Oh my God.  HW I'm not going to joke about it. I just want to look at your butt.  HW So Jonathan, my curiosity is like you're out there more than ever now.  Like how do you stay on top of all the folks who want to get in contact with you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  TG Tinkless GTD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  HW Oh, come on. Are you using it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  TG I am. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  HW You're on a Mac?  TG I do.  HW I thought you were on a PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  HW What are you talking about? Merlin, did you not notice the 12 inch on the stage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  TG Are you kidding? I almost yoinked it. I was going to like take it with the drums.  You don't know Jonathan, but like it's a topic every week on MacBreak Weekly to figure out where  we can find more 12 inches to acquire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  HW I'll tell mine for a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  TG I'm very happy to hear that. But so, and so as far as email and stuff like that, do you like,  obviously we talked at the time and you were talking about, you know, it's very valuable  and important to you to be able to keep that line of communication open. Is that,  is that something you still struggle with? Is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  HW It is. And it gets harder. It gets, it has gotten harder. I,  now I, I, the main, you know, I fall on and off, I'm on and off the wagon with, with, with  Kinkless, you know, I'm, I'm good about it for a while and I get the inbox down to zero or sometimes  20, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  TG Inbox 20 is perfectly legitimate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  HW Right. That's okay. And, and then, and then, you know, like for instance, when I just  went out to San Francisco, I was out there for a few days. I was very busy. I was very nervous.  I didn't touch my inbox at all, you know, and now today was a day of rest and tomorrow  I'm, I'm screwed, you know, tomorrow is basically going to be a day of moving things out of my  inbox into to-do lists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  TG That's my problem with inbox zero. You get no days of rest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  HW Yeah. Yeah, it's true. And, and so, and so, you know, it's very hard, you know, I have,  I'm behind on, on a category of emails, which are just, uh, fan mails that don't require  a response, but that I want to respond to anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  TG That's totally the hardest part. Do you ever think about getting help with stuff like that?  No, no, no. I ask, I ask guilty.  HW You sound like Dr. Phil.  TG Let me just admit now, Jonathan, let me ask you something. Have you looked in her eyes? Have  you really looked at this? Um, do you think, I'm curious though, because you, you know, at a certain  point, you got to build capacity. Do you, do you give much thought to getting help? Obviously,  you've probably got an accountant and stuff like that, but do you ever think about getting help  with some of the stuff?  HW That's a good question.  TG What is it? I'm curious, like, so running your own business can kind of suck. What are the,  is there stuff that you can afford to shed? And is that something that you have looked into?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  HW Yeah. And, and, um, there are some things that I have shed. You know, I have a,  I, uh, I now have a booking agent. I have a manager. I have a PR person.  TG Wow.  HW So there are, there are people that I have, I am subcontracting to various elements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  TG And I apologize for poking fun at you about it on the CNBC.  HW Yeah. Thanks a lot, Tom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  TG He's got a posse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  HW But yeah, I, you know, I, because at a certain point the business was taking over and there's  no room left for music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  TG You have to. If you're an artist, you have to shed the non-artistic stuff eventually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  HW Yeah. But you know, for me, I'm still such a control freak. And really the last thing I want  to touch is-  TG I don't know anything about that.  HW The last thing I would ever farm out to anybody would be, would be responding to people's  emails.  TG Oh, I farmed that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  HW No, you don't. You really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  TG No, well, I do for, I have-  HW No, he just doesn't answer them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  TG Hello, hello internet friend. Thank you for writing to me about something I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  HW That's basically what I do. No, I have a person who answers the radio show email because it's  just too voluminous. And fan mail is tough. I mean, you, you, you cherish, especially when  you work a niche. You cherish every one of those people and you know that each one of them  carries a huge amount of weight. And yet they also can overwhelm you with demands. And I don't,  it's a very difficult, that's part of, I think that's one of the big problems of scaling a  niche audience is very difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  TG It is. And I struggle with that every day because, you know, and it's not just,  you know, it's sort of easy to respond to an email where they say, oh, I love this song,  you know, or thank you for doing this and that, you know, that's, that's, it's wonderful to get  those. And it's really easy to write back something to them. But what's harder is,  you know, hey, I love what you're doing. I think it's a really interesting business model.  Here's my band, here's a link to my band. And what kinds of stuff do you have in your studio?  And also how, how did you build your store? You know, and so it's been for me,  that is the hardest stuff because it's, you know, well, actually a lot of that, it's sort of  solvable with facts and, and something like text expander, which I do use. But you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  TG Again, you've come a long way. This is really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  TG Well, thanks to you Merlin, honestly, really after our, after you shamed me in that interview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  TG It was very, it was very Dr. Phil, I have to admit. I kind of did confide, yeah.  TG He said, he said- TG We need to get you on,  we need to get you on Mail, Mail Template, which is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  TG Now Merlin, Merlin has asked his 43 folders question. I know each of you,  we'd like you, Ryan, think of an Engadget question, Tom, think of a CNET question,  Veronica, say hello question. I'm going to ask the twit question. All right. And then I'll  let you guys think of your, each of your particular websites, what you would ask.  I'm going to ask you, Jonathan, you ever listen to audio books?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  TG No, I don't.  TG Damn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  TG That would have been the best segue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  TG It is the best segue because I want to tell you about audio books from audible.com,  ladies and gentlemen, we'll get back with Jonathan Colton and our guests in just a moment. But first,  when's the last time you read a book without falling asleep?  I really should write like a Garrison Keeler kind of commercial for this stuff. We talk about audible  a lot. Audible is a- TG Sleep train.  TG Sleep train. Actually, believe it or not, you're close. My book of the week is Clue Train,  but I'm going to talk about that in a second. Audible is a place where you can download audio  books, get them all as soon as you think of it, you can get it and they're great. It's a great way  to get books read without falling asleep before you've turned the page. I listened, you know,  all those times when your, you know, two, your hands are tied up, you're in the car, you're at  the gym, you're working in the garden, you're, you know, you're filming Mahalo Daily and you just can't  use your hands. You want to listen to an audio book. That's the, that's the, I'm telling you,  it's a lifesaver. If you listen to podcasts, you're halfway there. And I do want to recommend  a book that's very apropos to this conversation, a book I read many years ago. In fact,  I gave 20 copies of this book, wasted my money giving 20 copies of this book to the guys who  ran ZDTV. They didn't get it. The book is the Clue Train Manifesto, The End of Business as Usual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you know I did that, Tom? Yeah, because I don't know if I, I like swiped it from one of them,  but I have that book from around that same area. So maybe I got it from you. Yeah, I gave it to all

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the management because it talks about markets as conversation. Now this book was written 10 years  ago and yet it really was exactly right on about how the internet and is changing commerce,  is changing marketing, is changing the way we as consumers deal with people who create like  Jonathan. It is a must read. It is fascinating. Doc Searles, Christopher Locke, Rick Levine,  some of the, some of the most interesting thinkers in this area kind of wrote it together.  There is a Clue Train website. David Weinberger, shouldn't leave him out. He's a big part of it.  There is a Clue Train website, but if you haven't read the book, you must. And this is a great way  to read it. This is how I read it first. And I immediately went out and bought 20 copies of it.  The Clue Train Manifesto, The End of Business as Usual. It's our Audible pick. Now the reason we  do a pick every week is because if you go to audible.com slash twit, A-U-D-I-B-L-E dot com  slash twit, and sign up there, you get a credit for a free book of the 45,000 that they have.  And this would be a very good one to start with audible.com slash twit. We do thank them for their  support of all the This Week in Tech programs. Because now thanks to Jonathan Colton, I'm willing  to say I need your money. I want your money. Give me. I did get the book. I just looked,  you signed it. Yeah. It didn't do a damn lick of good. I gave it to you. It was excellent. I loved  that book. You're the one person who got it. And look what you're doing. You're doing great.  But I gave it all the management at Tech TV. And of course I was trying, doing my best. So  Veronica, do you have a Mahalo Daily style question for Jonathan Colton? I would like to know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  about working with John Hodgman on the areas of my expertise. Cause I freaked out when I was  listening to that audio book. I loved it. Best audio book ever. You know, why didn't I recommend

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that? What am I thinking? Jonathan's actually on an audio book. But forget everything I said. Don't  get Clutre Manifesto. Get the areas of my expertise. We've recommended it many times on this show. So  that's probably all right. But Jonathan, yeah, you're a big part of that. Yeah. Well, John,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John Hodgman and I have known each other since college. And in fact, I met my wife through him  and they live just a few blocks away. He and his wife live just a few blocks away and our children  are friends. And so we've been friends for a long time. And we'd worked together on this reading  series that he did called the Little Grey Book Lectures, which sort of evolved into this book  and into its current status as international superstar. And so when he was asked to do an  audio book for his almanac of lies, you know, we already had this little, as he called it,  a two man, one man show where he would read from the book and I would sing songs that I had written  about stuff in the book while wearing a furry coon skin cap. And so it seemed a very natural  thing to take that and make that be the essence of the audio book. And it was all John's  brilliance, really. He had such a vision for that audio book. He knew exactly what he wanted it to  be, not just him reading from the book, because of course it's an almanac, which, you know,  how do you make an audio book of an almanac is a good question. And the answer is I don't normally

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  recommend people listen to the audio book over reading. By far it's better. I don't know what I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  was thinking when I started this. It's a really amusing book. But you know, and you think so if  you have read it, almost everybody I know had exactly the same reaction to the book, which was  this is incredibly clever and impenetrable. And even after like, oh, another table of werewolves.  I, okay, this is good. You need to hear his voice. You got to hear it in the air and then you got to  hear Jonathan's songs. You got to hear about the furry lobster. It's a real lobster. Yeah. Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John to his credit points out that the book is not meant to be read through in a sitting,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  particularly the list of 700 hobo names. Is that still available? That's still a free MP3, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is. Yeah. People are saying, oh, it's abridged on audible. Well, that's the kind of thing they  cut out. It's not like you're missing. Oh, no, that's intact. They read that he does. Oh, he does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. One entire disc, I think is, is that recording of us. You played, you played,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you played big rock, big rock candy mountain for 50 minutes. Is that correct? That's correct. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it was not fun. I think you can download that on the internet. Can't you? Yeah. I think it's,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it might be on his site still on that little, on areas of my expertise.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's an example of giving away something that really has no value. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you might as well give it away. You learn about hobo Joe Junkpan. I mean, that's,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that's, that's critical information. Yes, it is. He, in a way, he, he's talking to the same niche,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  isn't he? He is. Absolutely. Yeah. We, we, we have huge overlap in our audiences. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ryan, you have a, a, in a gadget.com style question for Joko. Sure. Yeah, I got, I got some

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  stuff here. First, Jonathan, are you an engadget reader? And yes, there's a right and wrong answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, I'm an avid engadget reader. Oh, nice. Sweet. Okay. Ask him about the Zen drum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ask him about the Zen drum. Actually, no, I, if, if I was a music thing, which is actually really  amazing music blog that I totally recommend, he, Tom Whitwell, who does it, used to, used to write  a column on a gadget, but it's basically a column about, or I mean, a blog entirely about  really interesting and kind of obscure music gear. I don't know. But anyway, no, I mean,  my question is totally obvious. Like what, what are the gadgets you use? You know, what's your  cell phone? What's your DVR? What's your HDTV? Which, which game consoles do you play if any?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so on. I have, I have a trio 700 P. Oh man, I'm sorry. I know, right? You're losing street cred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I felt, I felt like- No, no, no, no, no. You're allowed to have a palm device. I mean,  there are a lot of fanboys out there. It's a palm. That's true. It's cool. It's just, you know,  I mean, I feel your pain. Well, I have a Mac too. I have a Mac too. Let the man finish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Listen, it made sense when I bought it. Okay. And it actually, I was happy to have it when I  bought it and truth be told, it still does everything I need. It just drives me crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good. There you go. The thermometer went up a little bit there. And I can't stand it anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Excellent. Excellent. And that's exactly, that's why it's cool to have a trio. That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Listen, I would love to have an iPhone, but I need, I need dial-up networking in my life.  Gotcha. And I could, you know, that's, that's a turbo geek answer that actually puts you above

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the threshold. Yeah. So he uses it to access the internet. Yeah. Yeah. And, and what else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are other gadgets? Oh, my, my HDTV is a Panasonic 50 inch. Good. I can't remember the  model. Wow. I know that's lame that I don't remember the model. No, no, no. I'm out of the  club. It's just a bunch of numbers. Not now. Unfortunately, I am a Time Warner customer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yeah. No, there's a lot of games. And I have the scientific Atlanta,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  8,300 unhackable box HD piece of crap, which is the, not only a terrible user interface, but also  the biggest piece of crap I have ever seen that is supposedly a, a, a product for like grandmas and  stuff. It crashes all the time. It doesn't, if you turn it off and turn it on, the HDMI  signal doesn't get set right. So it doesn't, there's no picture until you turn it off and  turn it on again. I have to reboot a couple of times a day. It's worse. It promises you cake

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because it has a USB ports, firewire ports, ethernet. It looks like it does a lot of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As long as you're soliciting your audience for, for music here and there, I would say, you know,  throw it out there and say, anybody got a spare TiVo series three or a TiVo HD. Trust me, dude,  you really want, I've had that box. It is a nightmare. Yeah. And it's sort of, if ever there

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  was an argument for, for why we need competition in a market like that, it's the fact that that  device is allowed to exist because there's no, there's just no excuse. No. Other than the fact  that they don't have to change it. A device only a cable company could love. Oh God. I've only talked  about gadgets that I hate. That just goes to show you how my life is. No, I think it actually says

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  more about the consumer electronics industry. Yeah. Well, that's probably a little of geekiness,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  probably too. Yeah. I like that Zen drum though. That's a pretty, that's a gadget. That's very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh man. Merlin and I were freaking out over that when you were opening up for Fancy Pants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was, I was on that site today until I got to the price tag. I was so ready. I was so ready to buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I picked a sunburst Zen drum. I don't even play an instrument. I wanted one. But Jonathan, it was,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got a feeling you made it look easy. I, cause it was, it was a wonder to watch you play that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  thing. It's pretty hard. It's pretty hard. I, I, I'm lucky cause I actually play the drums.  For people who don't know the Zen drum is that basically it's a mini trigger device, but it's,  it's built like an electric guitar, sort of this beautiful, beautifully finished piece of wood with  like 40 trigger pads in it. And I was actually playing that, that was hooked up to a 12 inch  power book that was running Ableton Live, which is a sort of loop based composition software. And so  I was triggering samples with individual pads. And it was also at the same time hooked up to  a module called BSD, which is a, a drum, a midi drum library, essentially. So I am able to  play the trigger individual drums with individual pads and also to trigger individual samples in  different ways. So I can, I can play the drums along with samples and, and do sort of a live

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  remix in the middle of the song. It's the only way you could do fancy pants on stage. I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's, yeah, it's such a stupid song. It's a great song. It's the greatest song,  possibly ever. I love fancy pants. It's a very, it's a very silly, very small little tiny thing.  So, so having that device elevates it in an important way. Well, but it's, it's kind of a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lennon McCartney thing. Cause you start off so happy, you know, you do that Paul McCartney upbeat,  ah, the world is great and everything. And then it's really depressing. And that's like John Lennon.  So you're channeling Lennon McCartney on that song. I'm channeling both Lennon and McCartney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's amazing. It's amazing. And Ringo, you're playing drums. And Ringo. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true. Really. He's the whole Beatles in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I still need to hear what, what the rest of the gear that makes Jonathan Colton's life

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  go around is the rest of the gear. Gosh. Um, what else, what else do I really rely on?  Your 12 inch guy. Uh, I'm a 12 inch guy, but I actually, I do all my recording on a, um,  on a, on a Mac mini. Surely you have an iPod or something like it. I have an iPod. I have an  iPod. I have a, an iPod classic. Um, and I know look out, look out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it 60, 80 or 160? It is 80.  I don't know why I'm doing that. It was so cute. You channel all the people in the audience,  Veronica, who throughout the show on Saturday night, we're going, Oh,  Oh, there's a puppy dog thing about Joko that the girls just dig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That makes me non-threatening. Um, and what else I record on a Mac mini and I use, um,  I use Pro Tools, LE and a, a digit design Digi, 002. Oh, interesting. I haven't,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and the Mac mini is okay with Pro Tools. It runs pretty well. It is. Yeah. It runs,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it runs great for me. I mean, it's pretty, the LE only goes up to 32 tracks, I think.  And I'm not a huge user of software instruments or, or serious plugins. You know, I try to keep it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  pretty bare bones. Yeah. But the 002 has flying faders. That's pretty cool. Oh, that's exactly why  I bought it. That's why I bought it too. I have no use for it, but it's the faders go up and down

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  automatically. See that calls for it. Yeah, exactly. Uh, I bet that's the, that's sort of the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that's my, that's my inner circle of gadgetry. I think the Zen drum still is the coolest thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just, I just want that so bad. Hey Merlin, I'll go have Z's on one with you. I would totally

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  split a Zen drum with you. We could, we could split it up like a divorced couple. I think like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  alternate Sundays, we could each other. Tom Merritt, do you have a Buzz Out Loud or a CNET TV  style question? Well, you already got to interview Joe Co. Yeah, I was going to say, I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  he speaks West question and probably ask him something about the electoral college. So that  doesn't work. I mean, I don't know if you're reading Roger to channel, you could have Roger  ask something about maybe F15 fighters or something. Yeah. But I actually, you know,  the Buzz Out Loud question, because Jonathan is sort of the poster boy for what we talk about when  we talk about DRM on that show all the time. Like I guess what I'd ask Jonathan, if you were like  brought into the, you know, the ivory Citadel and the, the RIAA and IFP and the MPAA and everyone  was sitting there and they said, look, you know, we know we've been messing it all up. Tell us,  what should we do? What would you say? Well, that's a great question. How would I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  pick the record industry? Yeah, reinvent the record business. Yeah. Just, just a quick,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  quick answer. And by the way, Joan Rivers is actually coming out now. So if you could

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  hurry it up, that'd be great. Sure. Sure. I'll be quick. First of all, I would say  get rid of DRM forever. Don't, don't bother. First and foremost, I would say make, make,  make the music as available as possible. Make it easy to purchase the music in whatever format  or whatever channel you can and don't, you know, don't fight tooth and nail on percentages because  right now the iTunes store has got you over a barrel, frankly, and you're going to have to  play ball. Do you sell stuff on iTunes? You don't. I do, but it's through CD Baby. Right. Right. Right.  They actually do digital distribution to a number of different places. So for those of you who would  like copy protected versions of Jonathan's songs. Yeah. You can, you can go to the iTunes store,  but you can also get them from the Amazon MP3 store. Yeah. You know, I think, I think they've  already heard the message about DRM. You know, I, I would, I would, I would also say that  file sharing is not the enemy. I, and I really, I can't say this strongly enough. It, it benefits  all artists. I don't care how big or small they are to have their music floating around and  shareable. And really, you know, saving the industry is not something that we need to worry  about because there's still going to be an industry there. It's just, it's going to be different.  And they're not going to command the same deal making power that they had before. They're not  going to be able to get a larger percentage of everything. And they're not going to be able to  spend as much on recordings and marketing. And instead, you know, we're going to, we're going  to move to something where what used to be a record label is now a sort of conglomerate,  conglomerate of services that independent musicians can, can buy. I like that.  And it's already happening. You know, I mean, you look at something like network records and  what Terry McBride is doing, you know, it's this sort of package of services and what sort of deal  do you want to make with us? Yeah. Do you want to do distribution only or do you want to do a classic  label deal? Do you want a manager? What do you need? He's very smart. He's a, he does Bare Neck

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and Ladies. They have a lot of the big, a lot of big Canadian bands. Yeah. And you know, there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  still need for those services. I need those services, you know? And so it's just that,  it's just that the old model is dead and there's a lot of jobs are going to be lost and there's  going to be a lot of pain in that industry until the, until the shakeup is over. It's been so great

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  having you on the show, Jonathan. I really appreciate it. Well, thank you so much. I,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I, nothing is better than having four people blow smoke up your ass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Five, I think it was five. Five. Oh, fantastic. I didn't even log count.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, smoke, smoke. It's hard to keep track. How decadent it is in here. Would you mind,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess I don't have to ask you, I could just play it and let, let Valve sue me. I might play  Still Alive as we head out on this one. Absolutely. What a great song it was. And I want to thank the  members of the band, Veronica Belmont from Mahalo Daily, M-A-H-A-L-O dot com. What a great  daily show that is. It's getting better all the time. You do such a good job.  And Chris, your camera guy did some great video. If you want to see us perform on the stage of the  Great American Music Hall, that's on your- I wouldn't exactly call him my camera guy,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but he did an excellent job. A camera guy, a guy with a camera. Yeah. A wonderful guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You could also call him the editor in chief of joystick, which is when most of your game  technology sites out, but you know, camera guy works too. Oh that. Oh, mince words. Yeah. Oh that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can catch that on Veronica's blog. It's on YouTube now. I have it on my blog. In fact,  it's going to take over the world, I believe. And when is the DVD? Do you know, do you have any kind

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of ETA for a DVD, Jonathan, of that concert? Cause I don't, you know, we, we have to sort of see what  we have and we also asked fans to record the show and send us the footage. So it's going to take a  while to sort through it. I wouldn't expect it'll be, we'll have anything before a few months from

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  now. Can I just ask you, will you include our performance in the DVD or maybe that'll be a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  special feature? It could be an Easter egg. No, it'll be on the DVD. Oh, thank God. You kidding me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, man. Is there any way, any way at all we can talk you out of that?  I think it should be an Easter egg. I want to give, I want to give you money, Jonathan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It may not be in the flow of the show. I don't know. I, we have to see,  but it'll definitely be on the DVD. It's definitely not. The world has to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not in the flow of anything. Well, although I love it because you reach up,  you pull down a screen, which is hysterical and the crowd starts to go a little wild. They kind  of have a feeling what's, what's going on here. Yeah. Yeah. It was great. It was a wonderful  moment. It was really fun. Uh, Ryan Block is the editor in chief of Engadget and uh, always great  having you on. Thank you so much, Ryan. Thanks. I really appreciate it. Merlin man, 43 folders.com  and of course a regular on Mac break weekly. Uh, you're the man Merlin. Thanks for having me.  There's nobody I'd rather haven't played drums behind me. I'm just happy to be in the shadow

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of your very large hat. I have a very, I have a very adorable picture of the two of you by the  way, from that evening. I saw that also. Yeah. I saw that. I thought what happened in the tender

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  line, tender tenderness in the tender line. It's a special moment between the two of us. I admit  Tom Merritt at buzz out loud and CNET TV and it, and your interview with Jonathan Colton is on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  CNETTV.com still. Yeah, it's a, it's actually clipped out. You can watch the whole episode of  CNET live or you can just go right to the Jonathan Colton interview, which Jonathan actually very

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  kindly linked to from his blog. Good. Jonathan's blog is JonathanColton.com. C O U L T O N. You  can also get all of his songs there. I highly recommend the $70 complete set because you just  don't want to miss one song. Not one song. And by the way, if you're still alive, doesn't come on  that, but you could just start your recorders now, ladies and gentlemen, because we're going to be  listening to that as we go out. Another twit is in the can. This was a triumph. I'm making a note

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  here. Huge success. It's hard to overstate my satisfaction.  Aperture science. We do what we must because we can.  For the good of all of us, except the ones who are dead. But there's no sense crying over every  mistake. You just keep on trying till you run aghast. And the science gets done and you make a  neat gun for the people who are still alive. I'm not even angry. I'm being so sincere right now.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Even though you broke my heart and killed me. I'm torn into pieces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And threw every piece into a pile. As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you.  Now these points of data make a beautiful line. When we're out of beta, we're releasing on time.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So I'm glad I got burned. Think of all the things we learned for the people who are still alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go ahead and leave me. I think I'd prefer to stay inside.  Maybe you'll find someone else to help you.  Maybe Black Mesa. That was a joke. Ha ha. That chance.  Anyway, this cake is great. It's so delicious and moist. Look at me still talking when there's  science to do. When I look up there it makes me glad I'm not you. I've experimented too long.  There is research to be done on the people who are still alive. Then believe me I am still alive.  I'm doing science and I'm still alive. I feel fantastic and I'm still alive.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  While you're dying I'll be still alive. And when you're dead I will be still alive.  Still alive. Still alive.
