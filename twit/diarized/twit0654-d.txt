Transcript:  Christina Warren is here, film girl, now at Senior Cloud Dev Advocate at Microsoft.  But we decided that that does not in any way disqualify you  from covering the industry.  If you wish to recuse yourself, if any cloud dev stories  appear, you can. I doubt they will.  I know they won't.  But it's always a pleasure to have you, Christina.  I love it because she strategically placed  that Clueless movie poster  to hide a multitude of sins.

Transcript:  Actually, there's a there is this there is a tech story about Tom Brady this week  and not a good story, but it has nothing to do with Tom Brady.  A judge. Oh, has ruled.  That embedding a tweet.  With copyright material can violate copyright.  This was completely contrary to previous decisions in the Ninth Circuit  Court of Appeals, a federal judge in New York on Thursday.  Said that nine news organizations had violated  copyright by embedding a tweet that included a picture of Tom Brady  that was owned by somebody else, Barry Chin from the Boston Globe.  No, that's just the picture.  Oh, I guess I guess the Hollywood reporter didn't want to put  the copyright picture in their article because they didn't want to be named in the suit.  So that's somebody else's picture.  It was an image of Tom Brady  and Celtics general manager Danny Ainge and others on a street  two years ago.  Justin Goldman, the photographer, uploaded the photo to Snapchat.  The photo went viral.  Others uploaded to Twitter.  Subsequently, these nine news organizations  embedded the tweets with the image and stories about whether the Celtics  would successfully recruit Kevin Durant.  They better damn well not. But that's another story.

Start time: 364.80
End time: 381.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yes, I mean, that's another story.  This is really set the cat amongst the pigeons with publishers because it's,  you know, if embedding tweets and stories is now obviously a thing  and it's kind of, you know, where do you go with this?  Because if you get it wrong once, you can get sued to hell and back.

Start time: 382.20
End time: 422.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is the opinion from U.S.  District Court Judge Katherine Forrest.  She wrote when the Copyright Act was amended in 1976, the words tweet,  viral and embed invoked thoughts of a bird, a disease and a reporter.  Nicely nicely put.  Decades later, we should offer her a job at the register.  Decades later, these same turns have taken on new meetings as the centerpieces  of an interconnected worldwide web in which images are shared with dizzying  speed over the course of any given news day.  She basically implies that embedding  is something that coders do.  That it is a elaborate thing.

Start time: 422.70
End time: 425.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why Twitter provides the easy to use click button to do

Start time: 426.88
End time: 433.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  any option to embed either the video or the or the photo or the tweet.  You can just embed the video or the photo. Yeah.

Start time: 434.38
End time: 467.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She says the fact that the image was hosted on a server,  owned and operated by an unrelated third party Twitter does not shield  the defendants from copyright violation.  Now, in the past and the case that comes up again and again is the Ninth  Circuit's judgment in Perfect 10 versus Amazon dot com,  which was Perfect 10 had images.  I don't remember. I simply remember it.  Thumbnail images of naked models appearing in Google Image Search. Right.

Start time: 467.98
End time: 472.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then that's been like the kind of case law. Right.  Yes. Up until this point.

Start time: 472.94
End time: 495.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they call that the server test.  So let me see if I can.  The direct liability of a website publisher for copyright infringement  turns on whether the image is hosted on the publisher's own service.  In this case, it wasn't. It was it was an embedded link of a tweet.  But they but she held it was still copyright infringement.

Start time: 496.46
End time: 519.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I've read the report and I'm not entirely clear on this.  Maybe the maybe everyone's going to can help on this.  But I think the problem was that they'd used the image,  but taken not from the tweet of the person that had taken it,  but from the tweet of other people that just copied it.  Other people's tweets.  And I think if you take it from the original person, then you're in the clear.  But if you take it from something that's well, but it was never on Twitter,

Start time: 519.62
End time: 521.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it was on Snapchat. Ah, OK.

Start time: 522.66
End time: 523.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, well, that OK.

Start time: 523.94
End time: 528.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then I have an embedding feature.  Newly. OK, maybe if you retweet it.

Start time: 529.64
End time: 538.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And maybe if you retweet it, you could skate getting in trouble  because I didn't post first. They put I just retweet it.  Well, but no, I think these are well, OK, they're not retweets.

Start time: 538.16
End time: 542.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're embedded tweets.  Or but I don't think that's so different, is it?

Start time: 543.08
End time: 550.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Side note for the Internet is the Celtics.  I've been waiting to correct you. Oh, I said Celtics.  It's the Internet will destroy you all week for saying that.

Start time: 552.12
End time: 564.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Even though Boston mispronounces it, the Celtics.  It's the car wash.  It's the car wash.  No, I know it's a Celtics.  I just like to I like to troll people.  Just trying to get a job in Russia.

Start time: 564.78
End time: 640.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK. So in this case,  it was a Snapchat screenshot that was taken and then embedded.  Someone else embedded it in a tweet and then the news publishers.  People tweeted it. Lots of people tweeted it.  Right. Lots of people tweeted it.  That's interesting because I can kind of, I guess, maybe see the argument  if it didn't originate as something that someone embedded originally on Twitter,  even though it seems semantical, because, for instance,  you do see certain news organizations who have permission from  wire services like the AP or Getty or Reuters or whoever  to have permission to put those photos on social media.  When I worked at both Mashable and Gizmodo, we had those clauses  built into our relationships with those places.  And we could say definitively, you can use this image on, you know,  just a post or you can use it on a post and on social media.  And so in that case, I would assume that because we had  license permission to use that photograph of someone wanted to embed that tweet  someplace, it would still be licensed.  Although that's not really clear from this judgment.  But in this case, it seems like the original person who tweeted this  didn't have a license to the image.  And therefore, anybody who subsequently embedded the tweet without a license,  the judge is saying they're still violating copyright  regardless of where it was hosted.

Start time: 642.20
End time: 669.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, she it's actually it is very interesting.  She actually quotes the Areo case.  Remember, Areo was re-broadcasting local new local TV stations.  And the the their their loophole was that, well, the users  renting a little nickel sized antenna from us and they're watching  only their own antenna.  And how did that go down in the end?  Areo lost this.  I think it was the Supreme Court held the Supreme Court.

Start time: 669.40
End time: 675.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because I was there and I covered that case from the beginning.  And yeah, they lost hard.

Start time: 676.44
End time: 683.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, yeah, so Areo's argument was it's not us.  It's not our fault. It's the users violating.  Well, yeah, I mean, Christine probably knows more than that,

Start time: 683.78
End time: 691.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but it struck me that the argument was that we're just we're doing  whatever free public broadcasting does anyway.  That's exactly it.  We're just doing it on a larger scale.

Start time: 692.76
End time: 746.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was the Areo argument.  And the Areo argument wasn't even so much putting the onus on the users.  It was saying we have created this array and you are simply using  your following standard over the air things.  It just so happens that this antenna doesn't reside in your physical home.  It exists in a warehouse in in Jersey someplace or deep in Queens.  I can't remember where it was now.  And that's how it's being transmitted, not  so much that the users might be violating, you know, copyright or whatnot.  But I can understand why that case would be cited  because their ultimate argument failed.  So she's saying it doesn't matter where it originates.  Exactly. If you have a server argument, it doesn't matter.  Yeah, it doesn't matter, which is which is really scary to me.  I mean, putting aside whether or not people should, you know,  because a lot of places, a full disclosure, I'm sure that I've done this,  have gotten around the fact that they didn't have rights to an image  by simply embedding a tweet or video of that image or video.  That's been a very common loophole.

Start time: 746.46
End time: 769.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We should point out this is not the end of it.  This was merely a motion for summary judgment.  And the judge rejected that and said, no, no, you guys are going to trial.  And she pointed out that, in fact, there might be some legitimate  fair use protections because she says in this case, there are questions  about whether the photographer effectively released his image  into the public domain when he posted it to his Snapchat account.

Start time: 769.66
End time: 789.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Technically, even with that, he put it on the Snapchat because he's like, look,  it's going to be up here for a little bit.  Then it's going to disappear.  So he was expecting it to come down and he was probably going to post  to wherever else we want to later.  He was just in that moment because he put on Snapchat.  Hey, everybody, remember, stuff doesn't disappear when somebody screenshot you stuff.  I do have some I do have some sympathy for the photographer because

Start time: 790.22
End time: 815.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that's his image and he wants to sell it or he wants to make money off of it.  And all of a sudden, these big publishers are just using it.  In effect, they're using it without permission to promote their product.  Content. I kind of have some sympathy for him.  At the same time, you really do want to preserve this server defense  because you don't want all of a sudden anybody who does a retweet like,  should I worry about retweeting?

Start time: 816.48
End time: 827.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well, we've seen this with the Olympics, right?  Like the Olympics are an NBC and BBC and others are very, very stingy  about what you can screencap and what you can't.  And they will even take down people's personal photos and personal videos.

Start time: 828.76
End time: 847.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Somebody takes a picture of the lit up Eiffel Tower.  You can't copy the Eiffel Tower, but you can't copyright the lights on it.  Paris has.  They assert the right to that picture.  Now, now I you took the picture, you posted on your Twitter account.  They could go after you.  But if I retweet you, according to this decision, they could also go after me.

Start time: 848.82
End time: 876.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. Well, what I was going to say is what we've seen with the Olympics  and we've seen with the NFL is that oftentimes, you know, tweets will be taken  down and that people who do retweets, you know, sometimes I have I don't know  of any instances where people's accounts have received strikes.  But certainly, you know, if you've retweeted something and that tweet is taken down,  then it's gone. And it's been the same sort of thing where if you embedded a tweet  that is then taken down, that embed goes away.  I guess my big thing with this, because I'm with you, I have sympathy  with the photographer, I have sympathy for someone who's saying

Start time: 876.64
End time: 878.22
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I didn't license my photos to be used this way.

Start time: 878.38
End time: 940.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was taken by a party that wasn't licensed.  Now it's been embedded all over the place.  But, you know, it does make it very difficult if you are a news organization  or if you're an individual or if you're anyone to then say, well, how do I determine  if the person who posted this had copyright or had permission to post this?  Because presumably, again, if you have a license with Getty or whoever,  or the photographer to post on Twitter, then the terms of the embed agreement  should say, well, if I embed this on another site, this is allowed.  But how am I to know if you had the permission to do this or not?  So I feel like it's a really slippery slope to then say, well,  because you inserted this code that Twitter provides and basically  very much promotes the people used, you're now going to be responsible for something.  When to me, it should really be, OK, you know, you go to Twitter and you say,  I didn't I didn't license this.  They take it down and then the embed stops working.  Like to me, that that seems like more a fair solution rather than potentially  having case law.  And as you said, this is just a summary judgment rejection.  It's going to go to trial that would it could put a lot of things in jeopardy.

Start time: 940.80
End time: 952.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the judge said there are some affirmative defenses here.  You know, I'm not throwing your case out.  I'm just I'm just saying Florida Dude in the Chairman raises an interesting point.  Doesn't posting an image on Snapchat make that image the property of Snapchat?

Start time: 954.89
End time: 956.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that there's a story.

Start time: 956.52
End time: 961.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you look at the terms and conditions, it probably does.  They probably are.  Are they going to ever think it's dual license?

Start time: 962.18
End time: 962.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's a license.

Start time: 963.02
End time: 965.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. You own it still, but we now have the right to reuse it in other ways.

Start time: 966.04
End time: 1041.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. And in fact, that was a big thing after Facebook bought Instagram,  that people were freaking out, right.  They're reading the terms of service and they were saying,  oh, Facebook says they can do whatever they want with this,  including using advertisements or whatever.  And Facebook came back and was saying, no, no, we're really just saying that we  could show this in your feed to say people you might want to follow.  We're not actually going to be using your stuff in ads,  you know, like traditional advertisements like on TV and stuff.  But that was a big concern when Facebook bought Instagram,  that the users had is what's going to happen to my content.  So I'm sure that there are things within that agreement that basically give a  license for it to be viewed and potentially, you know,  Snapchat to do whatever they want to do with it.  But I don't know if that means that, you know, I wouldn't.  For instance, if Snapchat had maybe posted a tweet with that image,  then maybe that would be one thing.  But if a third party is screenshotting the image and has been posting it  to Twitter, a different service, I don't think that Snapchat, you know, could.  I mean, maybe they could claim a copyright  offence and on behalf of the user.  But I don't think that it would be one of those things where, you know,  that would be you're giving up all your rights to your images.  I think it's kind of a dual license thing.

Start time: 1041.34
End time: 1067.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You see, I kind of have a feeling that if you put publish something on social media  and people retweet it, that's just that's the point of social media.  I mean, I I've taken a couple of photos which I've then had sent back to me.  Have you seen this? It's like, well, yeah, I bloody took it.  But someone else has retweeted it and that's the way it goes.  And, you know, it's as simple as that.  If you're a professional photographer, you've got the right to defend your images.  But get some kind of watermarking on it before you put on social media.

Transcript:  It is not OK, however, to post this on Twitter.  Mark Hamill.  Apparently, there were rumors going around that he had passed away with Skywalker.  So he posted on Twitter, Mark Hamill 1951 to 2018 alive and well.  Hashtag don't rush me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The beard was not. But, you know, it's a movie.  He's got to do something.  So we have kind of not mentioned and it's so sad.  I hate to even bring it up.  And yet it is a huge tech story.  Of course, I'm talking about the shooting,  horrific shooting in Parkland, Florida.  But what I'm finding fascinating is how the students of the high school  are going to Twitter and becoming activists  and using Twitter to organize rallies, to respond to Twitter pundits  who are blaming everybody but the gun.  It's really remarkable to watch these young people who grew up in a Twitter era  use Twitter so effectively.

Start time: 1137.64
End time: 1154.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this is the way it's going to go.  This is how you're actually going to get some sensible change in this country,  because they're sick of it.  They've grown up with, you know, with shooting drills  and the rest of it in a way that we never had to.  And they're understandably sick of it.  And it's about if they lead the charge, I'm with them.

I'm sorry, I've never valued you enough and the rest of it.  And the guy just responds, my teacher's dead.  And it was just...  I saw they're reading it and it was just like...

Start time: 1178.96
End time: 1208.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's when Twitter has some real import and some real value.  And then, of course, there's the side story that Russian driven  trolls are now invading Twitter.  We're going to have to get used to that.  It's going to be a feature for a while.  To respond, to create disarray and discord.  And it's just in a nutshell, the Twitter story,  that it is both capable of amazing communication and information  and at the same time, such a cesspool.

Start time: 1208.98
End time: 1232.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  I mean, it's...  There was a tone deaf request to one of the students  who was tweeting about it from a journalist from an organization.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm not even going to go there.  Because the pop filter doesn't cover spit that much.  No, I mean, a journalist called up and said,  Oh, you're in the school shooting.  Would you mind talking?  And it's like, you know, slightly bigger things on my mind.

Start time: 1232.82
End time: 1272.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, that was a for-chan...  That was a hoax.  Really? That was a hoax.  So there were some fabricated...  This is another misuse of Twitter.  There was a journalist, I was at the post,  I can't remember which newspaper she was looking for,  who had tweeted, but her tweets had been edited, modified,  and then posted on Twitter to imply that she asked students  if the shooter was black and if there were any pictures of bodies.  Oh, OK.  And these were fake.  And this is another problem, which is, of course,  it's completely easy to fake this stuff.  Yeah.  And that's another problem is, you don't know whether you read...  When you read something on Twitter, what its provenance is.

Start time: 1273.20
End time: 1288.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think this is one of the key things Twitter's got to get sorted out,  is it's got to check sources in terms of where is this person posting from?  Are they using a VPN to do it from?  That will allow people a much greater remit to actually decide  whether or not what they're reading is worth reading.

And apparently, the people who are in the country don't care if the kids die.  It's not private schools that are getting shut up.  So it doesn't really matter to them.  And it's great that these kids are doing what they're doing.  You always got misinformation.  My big thing about technology is the FBI had information  that this kid was posting dead stuff, doing all this stuff on the internet.  So that's the technology story that gets me.  They're out here, the NSA, whoever it is, is combing all this information.  The Boston bomber, I could go list on and on.  FBI had these people under surveillance,  sent people out to home to talk to them.  And what do you do?  Oh, well, you know, he's messed up.

Now, I think it is the case that the FBI bungled this one,  that they missed it.  They bungled a lot of them.  They missed it.  But at the same time,  we don't live in a society where as soon as somebody says something like that  or tweets something like that, he's thrown into jail and the key is thrown away.

Write a bill that says no outside money.  The government says here, you're a senator.  You get 10 grand. You're a president.  You get 100 million dollars or whatever.  But the money has to come from us because outside money and I raise got the budget.  They're never going to change it.  The second thing is, I know this is a tech show, but about guns.  The fact that I can get a gun easier than I can get a driver's license  is something insane.  Just to take the whole DMV and apply it to guns.  You have to take a written test.  You have to take a test with an instructor to show that you can shoot.  You have to go and renew it every couple of years.  When you sell the gun, you have to have a bill of receipt to the person you sold it to.  And they get taxes on it so they know where the gun went.  So you can't say 10 years later, oh, somebody stole it.  I forgot to report it.  Like just use the DMV as a guide for gun control.  I'm a gun owner. I love guns.  I love shooting guns.  But I'm just saying, if you had real common sense, people still get their guns  and guns wouldn't disappear.  18 year olds wouldn't just be able to go buy a gun without anything.  It's just. It's annoying.  And then there's the then the governor of Kentucky, who, by the way,

And I would have hoped that 19 years after Columbine that we would have been  past this point where we're blaming media, we're blaming music or video games  or whatever. And we're actually looking at the problem, which, as you know,  doctor was saying is very largely easy access to firearms.  The fact that it's more difficult for me to get birth control pills  than it is for someone to buy a gun is insane to me.  You know, I mean, forget about even the DMV thing.  It's it's literally harder to get, you know,  contraceptives in this country than it is to get a firearm.  And that's nuts.  And the fact that the immediate place to go is blaming video games,  as if that's the problem.

The thing that cracks me up the most is the perception they put on.  This kid was an upset kid.  He's how's he a kid? He's 19 years old.  He just shot 17 people.  And my thing is, too, he wants to get out.  I mean, just execute the person.  Let everybody know you this what you want to do.  You want to play crazy. You want to be crazy.  You do this. You die to know.  Put him in jail.  I'm not spending four million dollars for this guy who's 19.  Actually, Owen, it costs more.

It's about a girlfriend.  All these dudes are lonely.  Nobody likes them. They're alone.  Maybe we need to get a girlfriend program.  Forget them playing video games being violent.  A lot of kids are playing video games and happy every day shooting up stuff.  The dude is the guy who shot the church.  No friends. A virgin never had a girl.  That's that's the thing.  If you're if you see a dude is lonely, walk around with a gun.  Somebody go up and kiss him.  That's how you stop this whole thing.  Because once you fall in love, your whole mindset change.  But when you alone and ain't nobody loved you, you get real squirrely.  So go ahead, continue. I'm sorry.  But violence is not a problem in America.  We've been violent.  We're OK with violence.

Transcript:  Left, right. Well, that's always the dichotomy here, right?  Is that is that we are very afraid of anything that is, you know, sexual in nature.  We're very prudish in that way, but we are very much embracing of violence.  And that is obviously the difference if you go to Europe,  where it's oftentimes the inverse.  And I but I do think that, you know, yes, but I will say, you know, I mean,  and the studies have proven this, that gun violence is a uniquely American problem  and and or that school shootings, especially like this, are uniquely American problem.  And it's because we have more guns, even if you do it down to the number of  population, you get the ratio correct.  And so but it's something we haven't really embraced.  And when you look at video games and do we have violent media?  Of course we do. But that hasn't really there's been there hasn't been any proof  and correlation in that.  But the proof and correlation has been has been access to firearms.  And and that's why I get angry.  You know, again, like I said, I would have really hoped that that nearly 20 years later,  we wouldn't still be having kids scared and and worried and having to have,  you know, shooting drills.  And in this case, you know, the shooter knew about the drills and kind of follow  that protocol to make it even worse for people.  We shouldn't have to have, you know, kids who were in the school watching their  their teachers and watching their fellow students, you know, get murdered,  have to be the voice of reason here. And yet they are.  And instead, the politicians want to talk about video games, which it's like.  And as you said, there's been no proof whatsoever that that he even played video  games or was even, you know, obsessed with that sort of thing.  And but just the fact that it's easier for us to go there and blame culture  rather than to look at the root cause, which is to me, access to to firearms.  That it's really disappointing.

All of them look like they're real Americans.  I don't know how you would tell the difference.

Transcript:  I thought this week's Wired article, the cover story on Wired  from Fred Vogelstein and Nick Thompson was so good  because it really kind of highlighted the internal struggle  that Facebook has had for many years now.  But it really covered the last two years of are we a media company  or are we a platform?  And and like you, and I've had many, you know, conversations  with people at Facebook on their news teams where they kind of wanted  to have it both ways.  And what I thought was really interesting, though, is that  Facebook has only started to even kind of investigate and maybe even take  ironically, a hands off approach, which only leads to more of this confusion  because they're so afraid of regulation.  They're so afraid of regulators stepping in.  And saying, OK, you have to be responsible  for some of the stuff that is happening on your platform  and some of the, you know, the way information is spreading.  And they're so afraid of getting into any of that  that the response has been to simply say, oh, well, we don't have any control  over this, which obviously is BS, because, you know,  as their own investigations have proven, they they should have known when  when Russians were making ad buys, you know,  were these, you know, although I have to say now after these indictments,

You know, if you buy a radio or television ad in this country  for a political candidate, you have to say who you are,  who's paying for this ad and digital ads don't have that requirement.

So I think you could almost have an argument that if they were to play  to place everything in a timeline that was logical.  Exactly. You could almost say, I mean, I would still think that it was rubbish.  As you say, and I would agree with you that they're still, you know,  it's B.S.  But you could make the argument that if it was a chronological timeline  and the algorithm isn't determining and, you know, highlighting or  low lighting what you see and where you see it,  that that would be part of it. But they control the algorithm.  They are controlling what gets more attention and what doesn't.  And by and if you're going to do that, I think that you also have  a responsibility to make sure that the things you are highlighting  that you are emphasizing in the feed are accurate or inaccurate.

You can have shell companies, American companies are going to be  sending people over and having to use their visa for like three weeks,  set up one of those twenty dollar bank accounts I was talking about  and do their ads going about their business. So, I mean,  I just don't know how you stop it, even when you're trying  now to look at it deeper, because again,  now these indictments went down. OK, they got on.  All right. Now we have to do it this way.  And when they do it the other way, then it circumvents all the stuff  that we just trapped them on and we're looking at, we're thinking about  what we should be doing with them.  So we'll see what happens with it going forward.

Helicopter crashes, according to the FAA,  after maneuvering to avoid a DJI phantom.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was it's called a Robinson R-22 helicopter.  It's a basic training light helicopter instructor and student flying instructor  told police the student was practicing hover taxi maneuvering over rough ground  on Daniel Island, which is near Charleston.  And they saw a white DJI phantom quadcopter headed towards him.  Instructor to control the helicopter to evade the drone.  But the tail rotor struck a tree.  He got the helo down onto the rear of its landing skids, but it turned over.  I don't think anyone was seriously hurt.  No, please fly responsibly.  Yeah, I mean, this is what scares me.

It's the it's it's an AI powered quadcopter.  It shoots 4K video.  You tell it, follow me, lead me, surround me, but don't hit anything.  It has 13 onboard cameras, does real time mapping, path planning, obstacle avoidance.  It's got an Nvidia Jetson TX one computer in it.  The brain.  In fact, many self-driving car systems use something similar.  And then it just and now this is a Verge review.  They did a demo in John McLaren Park in the city and it worked.  Didn't you?

You know, you've got to control not only the rudder, not only the direction, but also the throttle control.  So you've got your height.  You've tried to manage three things at once.

Hopefully, if they get the funding to finish the job.  But they want to basically build like an ATC system for drones, which seems perfectly sensible.  You'd have to get cleared and all that.  Yeah.  Well, you just have to have a chip in there that says I am here.  Don't hit me.  And that way you can award you can warn anyone else if there's someone else.  That's actually a good idea.  Yeah.  Because we're going to see these things that the numbers are only going to increase.  So let's just get in there and make sure it's safe first off.  Above all else, keep them away from airports.

For my use cases, and I am an Apple Music subscriber, but I also subscribe to Spotify  and other things for my use cases, I can't justify $350 for a speaker that only works  with Apple Music that I have to use AirPlay for everything else, which is a pain that doesn't  have multi-room until some date to be determined.  I bought the Sonos One set.  I've had Sonos stuff for years and I bought the two pack of the Sonos...

Start time: 3332.64

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

And no, I think that for most people getting two Sonos Ones, which together are $350, is  better than the home pod.  Now look, in the future, if SiriKit supports other services, if you can do other things  with it, great.  But that's not now.  And even though I think the sound is excellent, for me, I can't justify $350 for a speaker  that literally plays Apple Music and that's it.  I just can't justify it.

Start time: 3380.34
End time: 3385.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 3386.48
End time: 3484.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the thing is, is that in some eras, that would have been fine.  That would have been okay.  But I feel like people, to me, they kept arguing with me comparing it to, oh, when the iPhone  came out, people said this.  So when the iPod came out, people said this.  Apple people are amazing, aren't they?  Well, they are.  And I consider myself more deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem than in the other ecosystem.  And I'm rejecting it.  And I'm saying no.  When the iPod came out, it worked with MP3s.  And it really took off when you could connect it to Windows.  And the iPhone had a web browser, even though it didn't have apps at first.  And those things made it really useful, no matter what you were doing.  And in this case, even if you like Apple Music, and I do, you probably have other types of  things you want to listen to.  And this is so limited right now that it doesn't work for me.  And the difference is that in some cases, if they had come out with this a couple years  ago and you didn't have ecosystems that were good and you didn't have a high quality audio  speaker like the Sonos One that was about the same, it was less expensive or two packets  the same price, you could maybe say, okay, well, fine.  This gives me a slightly better experience.  But the reality is that these other systems are more advanced.  Their assistants are better.  They do more things and they work with more music services.  So the only reason you buy this is because you either really love everything Apple or  you've been convinced that the audio quality is so much better that that's worth it for  you.  And I would say that for most audio files, this isn't going to be the sort of thing that  make an audio file is going to want to line in, Jack.  They're going to want to be able to play.  Exactly.

Start time: 3485.48
End time: 3505.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  So even when they go to about the audio is better.  I can't hard line in.  There's a huge difference.  You can't even Bluetooth to the thing.  I need Google.  I've convinced that Google is just winning the game as far as, you know, you think they're  going to ultimately win sound.  They want my heart and I'm a jerk.

I don't think it's better.  But for some reason, people think it's Consumer Reports, David Pogue, Jason Howell all thought  it sounded as good as if not better.  So and it's got the assistant.

It's great.  And I did. It was super easy.  It was like, do you talk to it or?  Well, at that point, you just use the Sonos app.  You just because it doesn't have Alexa built into it.  So the Alexa and soon Google Assistant are only built into the one.  I mean, I guess you could put an echo into it, but that would  that would, you know, mess up the line.

Transcript:  But in fairness, I don't know any of these home speakers  that are really going to be designed to be repairable in that sense.  And I think that's just part of the course.  If you buy a network speaker, for the most part,  you're going to have to take it to a specialty repair place.  And they probably are going to just give you a warranty swap out.  I don't really know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I haven't tried the Google Max.  My problem with the Google Assistant is that I have so many Google accounts.  I use like a different one for my, you know, main Google login  that is not associated with my email or my calendar or anything else that I haven't.  At least last time I tried the Google Home, it wasn't able to really work  with my workflow. I might try it again.  But no, I'm pretty much all in on the Sonos.  But I did like the sound of the HomePod is just for the money and for what it does  right now. Yeah, there's no way I can justify it now again.  Like if in six months they are able to open it up and you can use it with more things,  then that changes the the conversation a little bit.  But I still feel like for the price that it is and its limitations,  I personally can't justify it, especially without the line in it.  And I know that Sonos doesn't have it either, but it does have the ability  to at least link with systems that do.  And my issue with the sound quality, people are like, oh, the sound quality is so great.  And I'm like, OK, but you're playing for the vast majority of stuff.  You're playing, you know, lossy encoded music from an Internet connection.  So why does this how does this fantastic sound quality?  Why does it matter if you're literally pumping actually airplay is not it's forty four one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. You can you can technically do Flac or Alex through Airplay,  but that takes a lot more effort.  And so most people aren't going to be playing that stuff.  So, again, even though, yes, it's CD quality, what's the whole point  of having this this high end audio system is to play something that's maybe better than that.  And instead, you've got lossy, a lossy encoded file running through it.

And nobody wants to buy an amplifier anymore because, you know, you got to throw that work.  So times are changing. Things are changing.  But I just think that this Apple thing is a waste of time.  Let me tell you a secret thing.  Uncle Leo is going to make you really sad about my Google home.  So I finally broke down.  I Google home that the house, because I went to the battle between Alexa.  You went all in on the on the Google.  So I went all good. But you know what I did?  I got them all set up to we most.  So they only turn on when I click on the we mo, because I don't want nobody listening.  You don't want anybody listening.  You know, they're in those pearls of wisdom.  I got to go through extra step to automate my house, to turn the lights on and off.  But guess what? In case I like kill a frog or something, nobody's going to know about it.

It's kind of, I don't know, problematic to think that  on the one hand, it would be nice to for for your automated home  to maybe adjust things when it knows you're home and not home  and do things accordingly.  But on the other hand, there is kind of at a macro level, a big brother  kind of concern that I would have, which is to say,  am I comfortable with all this information being handled by third parties  and how competently are they going to protect that information?  That to me is the bigger thing.  And and that's why as much as I as I am freaked out by Google  in a certain sense, I sometimes am more comfortable with them  just because at least they're confident.  I don't know. But but but and sometimes I'm more concerned  with the companies that are capturing all my information  and I don't have any confidence in their competency and how they handle it  or how they're going to resell it or how they're going to protect  that information from others.  And that's when I look at TV manufacturers, especially, and I'm like,  I don't have any trust that they're not going to be selling this  with highly personalized and attached information.

Start time: 5301.02
End time: 5329.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And well, the difference is, I think, is that Facebook had by that point  already achieved such a mass of use of, you know, such mind share  that even though people would always say, oh, I'm going to delete my account.  Like, I remember I one time this was years and years ago,  I wrote a story for a Mashable that says, like, no, you're not going to delete  your Facebook account.  And because there is this delete Facebook day and all these people told me  how wrong I was. And then, you know, the next news report time,  it was like Facebook had added even more users than ever before.

Start time: 5329.28

Start time: 5331.70
End time: 5363.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, but people aren't going to do it.  I think the difference here is that, you know, Snap,  the reason they did this big redesign is because they're trying to improve  engagement, because engagement hasn't continued to rise the way they want it to.  And they're also trying to increase advertising.  And they're trying to get, you know, a different demographic interested.  And the problem is, is that they have a competitor, which Facebook never had,  that is copying them, you know, part and parcel and isn't messing things up.  So there is a real risk, I think, that Instagram is going to do a Snapchat

Start time: 5363.22

Pro tip on Snapchat for all the Snapchats.  I know there's not that many of you, but when somebody sends you a  proud message and you don't want them to know, you just slide your finger  to the sidewalk, peak almost 80 percent through, snap that bit back.  They don't even know you opened it.  Yeah, I mean, you know, if you're out there sneaking and you don't know

But I mean, from a user perspective, it's a it's a lot better  if you don't like I mean, because if you look at your standard Facebook page now,  if you go into your profile and actually analyze how much of that is advertising  stories, whatever else bullshit they want to put in there and actually look,  what is coming from people you care about and who you are in contact with?  It's a tiny proportion.

And if they start to see that going down,  then I think they would reverse course and change again.  But until that happens, you know, you could have 10 million people  sign a petition. No one cares.  But I will say I agree with Owen, I mean, because I'm not a teen,  but I love the teens.  And, you know, they're all about Instagram using the Snapchat filters.

Transcript:  Well, no, but you see, if I get a message from Facebook  and I don't have the Facebook app on my account, I just go into it via its web page.  I can't read that on the web page because Facebook is intentionally...  They've separated that so that you install it.  You've got to have Messenger on there.  And it grinds my gears something wrong.

Start time: 5726.60

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I agree with you because it's too absent.  But that said, it's interesting.  There are a few people that I have conversations with exclusively on Messenger.  The rest of them is either iMessage or Signal  or whatever. I don't really use WhatsApp, but I know that's really popular.  But yeah, I mean, between WhatsApp and Messenger,  I mean, they kind of own the majority of the messaging space, too.  So it doesn't matter so much if the teens are leaving Facebook proper.  I'm sure they're not happy about that.  But it would be more problematic if they were leaving Snapchat  or not Snapchat, if they were leaving Instagram.  But since they're not leaving Instagram,  you know, they can still advertise and they can still get that information.  And then I think the long term goal, whether this works or not,  would be to then somehow say, OK, well, now you have a reason  to use Facebook proper once you age out of something.

They focused on cookies, social plugins.  The share button is a like button is a big one.  Invisible pixels and how Facebook uses them to collect information  on people's browsing behavior.  The German court last week  ruled that Facebook hadn't done enough to alert people  to the pre-ticked privacy settings on its mobile app, the defaults.  So Facebook's starting to get some pushback.

And the fines are going to be massive.  So get it sorted out.  We're running out of time on this.  And Facebook says, you know, we've got we've got this sorted.  It'll be fine.

Now, it's who do you trust your VPN?  Not Facebook. Yeah.  Do you go to someone like Facebook, which will monetize the hell out of it?  Yeah. Or do you go to a small VPN who you trust and who has a decent record?  You know, it's not hard.  It's not a hard sell.

Transcript:  You know what? You know, see, this is where I don't trust anything.  I just found out last week when I made another Gmail account  that I can only have so many phone numbers for them to verify.  I have a burner phone that every single tech desk, all this phone does.  It's a backup phone.  My phone breaks. I take the sim out.  But everything is texted that my two all goes to that phone, that phone only.  And you can't imagine the spam text I get.  I've got stuff from strip clubs to mom and pop shops.  And I don't know who's sending them.  But you can't trust nobody with your phone number.  Uncle Leo. Well, that's random.

Transcript:  I don't know that it's not.  I mean, last month, I was down at the Enigma conference  and they got a guy from Google there and he was saying less than 10%  of Gmail users have two factor turned on.  Yeah, that's sad.  If we're talking and that's just a simple two factor.  The instead of people where they get an SMS message.  Well, that's because they don't make it easy to turn on.

Start time: 6100.82
End time: 6152.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I think that if you if Google cared about turning on two factor,  and this goes for all the companies, if they cared about turning on two factor,  they would they would prompt you to do it frequently.  They would make it easier to do.  And that would be part of the process.  Instead, what they do every so often when you log in from a different  location or different IP, it'll say, hey, is this is this backup email  and backup phone number for you? Correct.  But it doesn't say, hey, while you're here, why don't you turn on two factor?  So I think part of it is is obviously I think a huge part of it.  The reason less than 10% is because Google doesn't prioritize people  turning it on.  They that that's not something that they've wanted to design for.  If they wanted people to use two factor, they could very easily, you know, change  up and send it goes for Apple's thing, goes for Facebook.  Same goes for any of these companies.  They could, you know, make it part of the the login process  to highly encourage people to use two factor. But they don't.

Start time: 6152.88
End time: 6168.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, sure. But I mean, we're talking we were talking about sort of Facebook VPNs.  If we're if we're saying that people have trouble with Gmail's two factor,  think how much trouble they're going to have setting up their own VPN.  And for Facebook to turn around and say, oh, this is right.  And they're just saying this app.  Don't look behind the curtain about what we're doing.  That's just precisely.

Start time: 6169.12
End time: 6191.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And if you look at the language that they use around that VPN, they're not  promising you privacy so much as they are saying, oh, you know,  this is a secure way to do something.  But they're not claiming we won't capture everything that you're doing  and then sell ads on it.  You know, it's but people hear VPN and they think, oh, well,  that's a safe way to do something.  They're not actually considering the motives that Facebook might have.

Barcelona is a lovely city.  The pickpockets are insane, but it is a lovely city.  But it is very pretty.  Mobile World Congress is just too big.  And it's become like CES.

Transcript:  Well, well, but I mean, I think in theory, I mean, you're looking at  if you're trying to build something like it, like a like a MacBook, right?  Or if you're trying to build like a low level laptop at this point,  the Intel stuff, as as Ian's pointing out, really hasn't they haven't been able  to kind of catch up in the same way that Qualcomm is.  And so if you could have the advantage of having great battery life,  the support for a modem so you could actually have always on connectivity.  And now your processors, because they're they're so much smaller,  that the nanometer level are even more power efficient and better performance.  Like, why would you be why would you not consider  if you could get the software to run the right way and not have huge performances?  Why would you not consider making that your platform for a laptop?

Yeah, that's more to justify the need for these new processors.  You know, for most of most of us, unless you're watching video  or playing a really high end game on your mobile phone,  you don't need the ultra spiffy spa, pretty fast processor.  Absolutely.

I hear trying to go into the matrix, but they come out here every year  and tell you that you're going to be able to do something you could never do before.  What's a monster?  What is doing?

I watched the show three o'clock and more as soon as it came out.  But I'm like, it was 55 minutes of somewhat laughter.  And then it was over and I had no more of it.  And I had 50 million dollars.

That's the key.

Start time: 7445.32
End time: 7459.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think there's some onus when you get new subscribers, you can't lose them.  So it is they are now on a treadmill.  They have to continue to produce content that keeps those new subscribers and generates more.  And that's going to be very challenging.

Transcript:  I think it is. I mean, the thing with I mean, if you know this from HBO has known this for years.  And obviously, you know, they are one of the most profitable, if not the most profitable part of  Time Warner is that it's cyclical in terms of when people would subscribe and then drop the service.  And that was one of the reasons why they they launched HBO Go and HBO Now is they basically  said, you know, you can have all of our catalog content on demand as well.  But people used to, you know, like in the Sopranos heyday and Sex and the City heyday,  you know, they'd subscribe during those months when the shows were on and then unsubscribe.

Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. So everybody listen, if you got kids go to school or even got a coworker,  tell your kids that I know we live in a world of no bullying and no making fun of people and  no talking about people, but check with your kids to make sure that everything in school is okay.  And start early so they feel comfortable telling you stuff. Because if all these kids knew that  there was something wrong with this kid, the problem is they're told not to rat on people  or tell on people or talk about somebody being weird. You should talk to your kids to find  information that's going on in their day. And if something's making them feel uncomfortable,  that you find out and know. Somebody was bullying a girl in my daughter's class since I talked to  her. It wasn't bullying her, but I talked to her, told the teacher. The kid never went home and  told her parents she was being bullied. She just was dealing with it. The teacher went in,  dealt with the problem, talked to the whole class, didn't point anybody out.  But the point is you gotta talk to your kids and be in kids' lives because you don't want to end  up on the news talking about, I knew that such and such was going to do this and nobody said  anything. So start early with your kids, especially if you're out on the internet and on the Snapchat  and Instagrams. Find out what they're doing, what's important to them in their day because  their day is important. I know you're working. I know you're tired. I know you just got a new  iPhone, but check with your kids and ask them what's going on because that stuff matters.
