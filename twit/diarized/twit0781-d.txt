And actually these days you could be on CNN you could be on yeah any network in the world  if you have oh I have a flash cam set in my house with Skype. You're in you're on. That's Paul  Thurotte. I recognize those stentorian tones of uh Thurotte.com. Authoritatively agreeing with  whatever it is you just said. Yes indeed Leo you're right. It's good to see you and off off the  Wednesday show. That's right. Actually Paul and I have spent a lot of time together because Thursday  morning we covered. My wife's starting to ask about that actually. That weird ex we actually we  started by that but let me first introduce Harry McCracken the technologizer from Fast Company. It's  good to see you Harry. Good to be here Leo and everybody. Harry just did a great piece we'll ask  about on the advanced technology center at Google the ATAP. It was really interesting all the things  they're working on. And then I didn't I missed this in Fast Company on June 30th you celebrated  the 50th anniversary of the picture phone. The first zoom call. Oh yeah. Yeah actually the first

Start time: 277.46
End time: 294.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it was the AT&T picture phone right. It was like the first one where it was actually a service that  people paid for to use for work. The first kind of actual video call was in 1964 at the World's Fair  in Disneyland. The World's Fair. I saw it. In 1970 in Pittsburgh you could get the equipment and use it at your office.

Start time: 294.48
End time: 310.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah the New York World's Fair in 1964. I remember going as a kid I was what seven or eight years old  and I remember seeing a picture phone thinking someday daddy we'll all be  and it only it took the germ to do it. It just took 56 years. 56 years and COVID-19. And one pandemic.

Start time: 314.06
End time: 333.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah one pandemic later we're all doing this. In 1964 there were three places in the country where you could do it  New York, Chicago and I think maybe Washington DC and it was it cost a lot of money in 1964 dollars  to make a three-minute call so basically did not catch up on and also didn't catch on in 1970

Start time: 334.26
End time: 351.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they only get sold a few hundred. Yeah wonder why. I thought actually until very recently it would  never catch on because people just didn't want to prepare themselves to appear on a camera  right but we're used to it now right Ashley you've got your own little set on here in your house.

Start time: 351.66
End time: 370.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're ready to go. Yeah yeah and I was like and you know I work on a video team so everybody wants  to see each other everybody wants to talk and stuff so and especially now when we're not actually  getting out and seeing a lot of people it's like it's a really nice way to sort of just connect  with other human beings so yeah yeah I mean the amortize it out now that that video calling is a

Start time: 370.72
End time: 399.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  lot cheaper. Well and to be fair I remember in 1970 any long distance call was expensive.  If you made a long remember that Paul if you had a long distance call you'd say  I'm calling long distance we've got to make this quick. I'll call you on Sunday. Yeah right.  Let's yeah. Mom I'll call you on Sunday for two minutes because that's all I can afford.  Now we call around the world for nothing. I mean it's I mean it is literally nothing right.

Start time: 401.48
End time: 417.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Kind of hard to believe. Yeah yeah. I made a $75 phone call the other day. Where did you go?  Where could you what did you call the moon? I called India and the person I was calling  asked for to be an actual phone call rather than Skype or whatever and I believe it cost me 75 bucks

Start time: 418.14
End time: 432.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for like half an hour. Why would you do that? Because I can expense it. Oh okay so fast company  paid for it. It seems odd that they wanted a phone call. Was this like deep throat you were talking

Start time: 432.24
End time: 448.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  to? Not particularly. The nice thing about phone calls is they're if you're on an iPad like I am  if you use your phone it's easier to record a voice call right than stuff like Skype or Zoom  or whatever so I don't object to it personally. Also it's pretty reliable which is important if

Transcript:  you're recording an interview for a story. Okay I get it. That makes sense. So Paul and I watched  did you I'm sure Ashley because you cover gaming you watched the Xbox event on Thursday morning.

Start time: 461.14
End time: 465.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We even had a live stream about it. I thought you might have. It was very fun. We did too.

Start time: 466.92
End time: 472.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was just Paul and me so it wasn't fun but yes we tolerated each other. We spent all that time

Start time: 472.66
End time: 476.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  together of course you're having a good time. Mostly we were saying things like is that Tetris?

Start time: 476.54
End time: 480.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That looks like Tetris. Are they saying they've got a Tetris game? Is that possible? You have

Start time: 481.26
End time: 487.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  one hour to show games and you're gonna show Tetris? Tetris? Yep. And then there was there was an

Start time: 487.80
End time: 498.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  actual Tetris game. There was an actual Tetris game and then the other thing that Paul I was very  impressed they were they had Tinkerbell right and Paul's going oh my gosh. Well it was going to be the

Start time: 499.04
End time: 506.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  last game and they're floating around with Tinkerbell. I said you gotta be kidding me.  You gotta be kidding me. The only thing that could save this if she gets eaten by a frog. And she did.

Start time: 507.10
End time: 517.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He called it. That's amazing. That's amazing. That's clippable. You put that on the internet.  Put it on TikTok. Get that up on TikTok. Impressive. There's your TikTok stardom right

Start time: 517.44
End time: 536.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  there in a box. Listen to her. She knows. She's with the socials. So the big thing I thought and  at the time I remarked it but I didn't really think about it is how almost I think they said  for every game every single game was on Xbox Game Pass. Is that right Paul? I think it was.

Start time: 537.06
End time: 566.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right. Yep. That's a big deal. Yeah and this is the difference in the ways that these  companies are going to market for the next gen. I mean Sony is selling you a console and Microsoft  will sell you a console but what really Microsoft wants is a subscription service and you can choose  your device through xCloud or through Game Pass. They didn't ever say xCloud but they only referred  to gaming the cloud once. I thought that was interesting but xCloud is a code name so that

Start time: 566.32
End time: 628.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  suggests that that name is not permanent. Yeah. Yeah. I mean if you do the math it makes a lot  of sense right? So you can either pay. So Sony is hoping that you'll pay let's say four to five  hundred dollars for their next gen console and then sixty dollars for a handful of AAA games.  Seventy in some cases. Yeah. Yeah or 70 in some cases and then and then you'll you'll buy into  PlayStation Plus right? And so Microsoft is like well cool but what if. Yeah. What if if you can't  afford a Series X or it's something not interesting to you maybe you have a PC. A lot of those games  are cross-platform right? So they're being very smart about it as a service and saying  well if you don't want to upgrade like that's okay we got you. You can play all of these great  games on Game Pass. It'll only cost you x amount of dollars a month and over time if you consider that  over the life cycle of a console you know you're looking at a thousand dollar spend maybe more

Start time: 629.50
End time: 633.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but it's like no one's thinking like that. Don't talk like that. No one's sending a thousand dollars.

Start time: 634.20
End time: 643.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But if you're just enjoying games here. Yeah you're just enjoying games. It's if you spend  fifteen dollars a month for five years you know that's that's a lot of money and like it's way

Start time: 643.94
End time: 669.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  more than just. Sorry as you were talking you reminded me of or you put the idea in my head  that in many ways what Microsoft is doing is the same thing they've done on Windows with PCs which  is just preserving backward compatibility. You know Apple or Sony is moving ahead very aggressively  like Apple does getting rid of old technology and Microsoft is over here saying hold on a second.  You can use your old stuff too. Yeah you can go for it when you want and when you do it'll be better.

Start time: 670.86
End time: 675.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We just want you in the ecosystem. We just want you in the ecosystem and if you want to subscribe.

Start time: 675.52
End time: 686.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's great. And also it sort of makes sense as part of Sacha Nadella's vision of Microsoft in  terms of it being so service oriented about multiple platforms and you can use the platform

Start time: 688.18
End time: 725.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  of your choice in a lot of cases. Yeah yeah you can play this Xbox game on whatever you want.  You want to play it on PC. We got you. You want to play it on Xbox one. We got you. We want to play  it on Series X. Great. Like here it is. It's on Game Pass and also I got to say like kudos to  Microsoft for making Game Pass extremely compelling with all of these day and date titles. I mean Halo  Infinite is a game that Microsoft could very easily say no that's not going to be on Game Pass  for a little while. Like we're going to wait. But no they just came out swinging like yeah you're  going to be able to play this on Game Pass. Like no problem. We got you. The trick here is going to

Start time: 726.46
End time: 745.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  be the third parties because you know the selection of games that are on xCloud in particular that  those are the games whatever they call it those are the games that will play anywhere you know  on a mobile device or whatever. That's going to be up to the developers and I'm curious to see  obviously Microsoft's you know games their studio games will be in there but I wonder

Start time: 746.04
End time: 749.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  about the third parties. Can you get a CD Projekt Red to put a cyberpunk on that

Start time: 750.26
End time: 761.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  service? Well could I get Call of Duty in there right? And I think we know the answer to that  one is no. But why is it no? I think Call of Duty does pretty well financially in the current

Start time: 761.62
End time: 765.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  play. So there's no incentive. There's no technical reason though right? They could. Yeah I mean their

Start time: 765.48
End time: 775.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  feeling is like if you want to play it on a oh sorry but yeah if you want to play it on PC and  Xbox or whatever a PC and PlayStation please do but then you'll have to pay for it twice.

Start time: 775.98
End time: 815.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is a measure of the difference in business models between Sony and Microsoft. Sony is a  hardware company. Microsoft is increasingly not even a Windows company. It's a cloud company.  A service company. Yeah. So it makes perfect sense for Microsoft to say  you know the truth is we don't care where you play it.  But and I think the reason they I mean obviously they can't impose this on third parties  but they did demonstrate some AAA title. I mean that Halo Infinite is AAA high quality  4k 60 frames per second and if they can stream that from the cloud then there's no reason any

Start time: 815.54
End time: 853.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  game couldn't be streamed from the cloud right? Right yeah. I think that's the future of video  games right? Where it's you know we're now seeing an infrastructure emerge that you know hopefully  for most people enables them. I mean I know that there are a lot of communities still that are  underserved in the way of high speed internet so that becomes a problem right? And one of the  things that actually kept the Xbox One from having that feature on it that did those online checks  was the military. Submarines. The military was very upset because you know a lot of times you  don't have access to the internet. They took a lot of heat. You want to be able to just play your video games.

Start time: 853.88
End time: 858.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For saying you can't do it in a submarine. They took a little... Someone literally said what do you say to

Start time: 858.38
End time: 863.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  someone who's on a submarine and they said well maybe you should stick with the Xbox 360. Yeah.

Start time: 865.06
End time: 869.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the guy who said that got fired didn't he? That's right he's gone. He's gone. Yeah he doesn't work there

Start time: 869.76
End time: 902.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  anymore. It's not a good strategy and the thing is so the infrastructure is not there yet I think  to make the full leap but it is not a wild idea especially now that we're seeing consoles go  without optical drives. You know the next step of that is now we have this really really inexpensive  box that doesn't even store anything. It just plays our games off our servers for a subscription fee  you know in the future and you just you buy a controller and you connect it to that thing and  that's you know there you go. That's kind of interesting because

Start time: 905.56
End time: 912.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it makes the Sony PlayStation 5 is for people on submarines and for anybody else there's Xbox.

Start time: 912.56
End time: 918.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's literally the marketing tagline. It is. This is for people in submarines. But in a way that's where

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Paul and Mary Jo and I on Windows Weekly have had a constant conversation about  the future of computing being in the cloud. Boy there was a great piece in Bloomberg Business  week this week about the big Norsk aluminum companies ransomware attack and it was just  devastating. Actually it's well worth reading if you haven't read it. Norsk Hydro lost 60 million  dollars. They had cyber insurance but it only paid about three million of the 60 million in costs.  They were prepared in every way a company could be prepared for ransomware but they're so distributed  and they have so many processes on computers that it just devastated them for weeks. They were down.  They couldn't make products. They couldn't ship products. They couldn't service customers. They  couldn't even easily pay their own employees. Their payroll system was down. They had to pay  their employees in Brazil by copying the previous payroll and manually eliminating anybody who had  been fired since then and then sending the same checkout a second time. And it all started. This  was the thing that was devastating. The way these attackers got in, it was FIN6 is the name that's  given to this hacking community because they're financial only. They're not like mafiosos. They're  just trying to make money. They intercepted an email from an Italian client of Norsk Hydro  to the company. They didn't modify the email. There was an attachment. They took the benign  attachment, turned it into the malware and forwarded it on. So for the person receiving it,  it was exactly the email they expected from an existing customer with an attachment they expected.  They opened it and that's it. The infection happened in December. The attackers had complete  access to the network as far as anybody could tell until they triggered the ransomware in March.  Four months, they're wandering around in the network, probably exfiltrating whatever they could,  finding whatever they can, figuring out what the attack points are and then launching the attack  four months later. In fact, I'm surprised it was only $60 million. We've seen companies lose a  billion dollars in ransomware attacks. So it seems like they got off a little bit light, but it's a  stunning story. But it does make you think, let me just finish the thought because I want to bring  it back to what we were talking about, was it does make you think that on-prem computer systems  may not be going forward this most secure thing to do? I work for a very small company. So

Start time: 1092.90
End time: 1127.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  fast companies, seen it obviously a giant big publishing companies. I work for a company that  employs six or eight people. We were also hit with a ransomware attack. I don't think I ever  mentioned this. We had a backup. So we kind of just reset everything and we went back.  But I later found out to my amusement that the amount of money they asked for with us was $478.  I think they adjusted based on the size of the company.  So they figured that was all we could afford.

Start time: 1127.36
End time: 1219.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the ransomware request for this one was unknown. It said, contact us, let's negotiate.  But North Skyro never did. They said, we are not going to pay because we don't want to look like  a soft mark. I'm sure they had backups, but the problem was it was so distributed, 35,000 employees  in Europe, in the US, in Brazil. So much of their stuff was on-premises computers running  processes. They talk about the New York aluminum factory that was heavily computerized to know what  to make, what molds to use. They had to go to a paper system and faxes. So they have 50,000  different aluminum dyes for making different parts. And it uses software to keep track of what's  being made, to tell employees which dye to pick off the shelf. They had no idea what to make because  it was all on a computer somewhere. So that's going to be one of many impetuses moving.  Admittedly, fast internet is not global, but I bet you every single North Skyro facility  has a fast connection. Why wouldn't they move this stuff into the cloud? The biggest trouble  they had getting back online wasn't that they didn't have backups, but that they had to go  through every single machine and make sure there was nothing malicious on it. Because the guys were  there for four months. They could have hit little time bombs everywhere. Yeah, exactly.

Transcript:  I'm currently checking my Garmin watch every 10 minutes to see if it works again.  I had no idea. Not as of a little bit before we started this. I had no idea the degree to which  my watch was heavily dependent on Garmin services to just get stuff onto my phone. I kind of thought  there was much more of a direct connection between watch and phone rather than watch to a Garmin

Start time: 1255.32
End time: 1269.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. I'm torn. I hope that Garmin is able to get back and running without paying anybody anything.  Apparently, there's some question whether it's even legal for them to pay. I'd like my watch to  work, but I'm also a little bit patient because it's such a terrible precedent to pay these people.

Start time: 1270.28
End time: 1274.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the last I read Garmin had not decided whether to pay or not. They were considering it.

Start time: 1275.00
End time: 1277.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I hope they have really good backups, although apparently even if you have backups, they can

Start time: 1277.84
End time: 1322.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  instantly get infected. Yes, they have to be cold backups, right? If it's a hot backup.  By the way, you could thank the services of the National Security Agency, the NSA,  for making it possible to so quickly worm through networks with the fine Eternal Blue malware that  accidentally leaked out a few years ago and is widely used by ransomware attacks to spread over  networks. I don't know if these attacks used Eternal Blue or not. Garmin services have been  down for three days. That's incredible. The other thing maybe more concerning is four days. Yeah,  the other thing more concerning maybe is a lot of aviation uses it. That's terrifying. Well,

Transcript:  FlyGarmin and as a result of FlyGarmin website, mobile app are down. Call centers are down,  unable to receive calls, emails or chats. In the case of Norsk Hydro, they were well prepared. In  fact, it could have been worse if in the middle of the night they had somebody saw something with  it been going on and they had a response that they had a playbook that they planned and they  implemented it immediately and it still was devastating. Not enough. So I don't know how  you plan for that. So that is one argument for getting, I don't know, would it be safer in the

Start time: 1379.68
End time: 1440.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  cloud? It's so hard because it's the same argument that people have of why they keep physical media,  right? So it's like, oh, I like to collect blu-rays because I have friends who are like this,  who are very much like they want physical media because they are like, I can't trust that a company  is going to be in business. And then what happens to all of the things that I purchase there? They're  just digital. They're nothing. It's a bunch of bits and they're just like, and I won't have that  anymore. And so it's a very similar type of argument where there's something to be said  for a physical backup, a physical copy. And it is one of the biggest flaws, I guess, or one of the  biggest risks in going entirely digital. Got to be prepared. And even then, like you said, you could  be prepared. You could have a book, you could have everything ready to go and it still might not be

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  enough. It seems like there ought to be something we could do. I talked to a CEO on the radio show,  it was the last call on the radio show an hour ago, who said, we got attacked. Fortunately,  we had a mirrored knock. We had two network centers. One was a mirror of the other. And just  by good fortune, this was the plan. We were able to switch over. So we were only out for a couple  of hours. We were able to get fully up and running. He says, is that enough? I said, well, you're just  lucky that there wasn't a connection at that moment between those two mirrors, because you  could have mirrored the attack and then you'd be out of luck. I don't know what you do. I really  don't know what you do. Be a good topic for maybe our next LastPass seminar. What do you do? What  do you do? There's lots to talk about. We'll talk more. Is there anything more to say about the Xbox  thing? When are they going to announce Xcloud? Do you know, Paul? When is that going to be

Start time: 1502.56
End time: 1520.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  officially published? Xcloud becomes part of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. I want to say it's in, I  thought they said end of August. I feel like I heard end of August as well. Soon. Yeah, okay.  Soon. That's soon. Yeah, that's pretty soon. Somebody has to blink first, right? We're going

Start time: 1520.42
End time: 1574.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to get pricing, I assume next month. It has to be in August, because then you're giving people about  90 days to decide whether or not they want to preorder a relatively large purchase.  Yeah, I feel like it has to be next month. But they're playing chicken with each other because  I think Xbox is a little bit, they don't want a repeat of the $3.99 moment at E3. That was  really not good. Fill us in. What was that? So Xbox had announced, okay, here's our console.  Here's how much it costs, all this stuff. And then at the end of this PlayStation  E3 conference, it comes out and he's like $3.99. That was it. It was just like $3.99.  This is the original, the PS4, you mean? Yeah, the PS4. And people lost their freaking minds.  It was just such a mic drop moment to come out and say, oh yeah, PS4's coming.

Start time: 1574.32
End time: 1577.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Microsoft was bundling Kinect. Yeah, so it was too expensive. It was $4.99.

Start time: 1577.34
End time: 1582.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they were bundling Kinect, so it was expensive. It was $4.99. And Sony just comes out and is like,

Start time: 1582.92
End time: 1586.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so that's why you play chicken. You wait and you hope that somebody will announce a price so you

Start time: 1586.24
End time: 1624.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  can undercut it. Yeah. Or at least match it. Right. It's like, oh yeah, don't get caught with your  pants down. That's what they're waiting for. I think both of them are doing that. Sony bought  Gaikai. Do they still have cloud gaming? They have PlayStation now. It's not as robust as Game Pass.  Not as robust. I think they will find potentially an incentive to expand on it quite a bit, maybe in  this next console generation. I mean, they should. If they're looking at Microsoft, I mean, that is  something they should be very interested in. But they're relying right now on a lot of exclusives.

Start time: 1624.62
End time: 1628.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot of exclusives. And can you play PlayStation now on anything, or do you have to have a PlayStation to play it?

Start time: 1629.28
End time: 1638.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think some of the games you can play not on PlayStation. There are some that are exclusive to certain consoles.

Start time: 1639.22
End time: 1643.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On a PS4 or PC, but not on your Android phone. Yeah, I thought it was PC and PS4.

Start time: 1647.77
End time: 1650.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then there's Google Stadia, which you can pretty much play anywhere, including on a TV set.

Start time: 1651.08
End time: 1671.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It always felt like Stadia was sort of a proof of concept. I don't know. I'm still waiting on that.  Google is not... Their track record is not that great with trying new stuff. They try so much.  And then so few things actually end up lasting for a really long time.  There's free there, but most people pay a monthly fee. But you get some limited games.

Start time: 1674.96
End time: 1688.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's weird because you buy the game at full price, but you don't own it. It's on their server.  That has to be a sticking point for some people. It would be for me.

Start time: 1689.20
End time: 1715.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And when you stop subscribing, you no longer have access to that game.  Yeah, you bought it. You paid full price for it. It's like for a subscription, that's different.  Obviously, you stop your subscription, you lose access. People understand that.  But yeah, to pay $60 for something like Destiny 2 or Assassin's Creed or whatever it is,  and then just not have access to it once you decide that service isn't for you anymore is...  Yeah, a lot of people aren't interested in that.

Start time: 1716.26
End time: 1727.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Will Xcloud be Stadia-like in the sense that you could play it on any device  except that it's a subscription price that includes a bunch of games?  The game... Right? It's Game Pass Plus.

Start time: 1728.66
End time: 1739.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's basically an extension of the Xbox ecosystem to other device types using streaming.  But it's going to be a subset of what you get from Xbox Game Pass and from what you get just from Xbox.

Start time: 1742.40
End time: 1745.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So not every game on Xbox Game Pass will be available on Xcloud, but some subset will.

Start time: 1746.00
End time: 1754.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right now, I think it's about 100 games. I might be confusing it with Xbox Game Pass.  It's a fairly limited selection, but it's in preview right now.

Start time: 1755.20
End time: 1762.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Paul, do you think they're going to charge an extra surcharge to have access to Xcloud,  or do you think it will be just included but limited in scope?

Start time: 1763.76
End time: 1784.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's just going to be included because Xbox Game Pass is actually pretty expensive.  Per month, it's $14.99. And there aren't really great ways to get a good deal on that.  You probably saw they got rid of the one-year Xbox Live Gold subscription.  You can't get a 12-month pass on it anymore.  I'd have to look it up, but Xbox Game Pass.

Start time: 1785.06
End time: 1786.96

Start time: 1787.14

It took me like four hours for one page.  And this is the future.  So technology is changing the world.  Our show today brought to you by Extra Hop.  Oh, these guys are cool.  They originally started to do performance monitoring, but they can do so much more in  this new IT reality where remote access is on a massive scale.  We're all working at home.  Cloud is happening.  Multi cloud is happening.  A constant increase in the devices in your home, the Internet of Things devices and add  on top of that the crazy rise in cyber crime.  And now imagine yourself as an organization trying to keep track of all of that from the  cloud to the data center to the customer.  That's where Extra Hop is such a big help.  It gives you something you need to protect and scale your business.  Unified visibility and a context for the things you're seeing.  Plus, if it does it right, you're going to have intelligence response workflows so that  teams can collaborate easily and respond quickly to any situation.  That is Extra Hop.  It helps you detect threats and performance issues 95% faster and respond 60% more efficiently.  This is exactly the kind of tool you need in this ransomware high vulnerability world.  Extra Hop helps keep your business secure and available with SaaS based cloud native  network detection and response.  They've got sensors everywhere.  I'll give you some examples.  Wizards of the Coast, you know them, of course, Magic the Gathering.  They secure and support their AWS cloud using Extra Hop.  The last thing you want is, oh yeah, they left a bucket open online and we got all the  data out of it.  No, that's the last thing you want.  Chief architect and information security officer at Wizards of the Coast, Dan McDaniel, said  there is no other company that aligns to supporting the DevOps model.  We use the speed, the lack of friction, than Extra Hop.  Alta Beauty uses Extra Hop to secure their Google cloud and to keep networking and security  teams closely aligned so engineers can focus on innovation.  Senior IT engineer John Crease says before Extra Hop, we had limited visibility to what  was going on in our cloud, but now we can quickly identify vulnerabilities and exploits  and understand how our applications are performing in the cloud.  We know now, just that story about Norris Kydo, that every minute counts when you detect  a threat and how you respond and how quickly you respond determines exactly how much it's  going to cost you in the long run, how quickly and well you will respond.  You need a plan, you need the sensors, and you need actionable alerts, and that's what  you get with Extra Hop.  Take control of your cloud security right now.  Go to ExtraHop.com slash twit and if you want the best eye candy, they have a really fun  full product demo online.  You can actually watch it at work.  ExtraHop.com slash twit.  You will say, oh, I got to have this.  I need this kind of information.  There's also some great information there on securing and supporting remote access.  That's all available free right now.

Although, even though they didn't announce it publicly, Burke took two scoops really  for you.  Two scoops of delicious Android ice cream for you, Jason Howell.  Because Burke said internally Q was quince tart.  They just never told anybody.  And while the dessert name stopped being used for public releases, they still used them  internally.  And once again, Android 11 is referred to internally at Google as RVC or red velvet  cake.  But Burke says we're not going to use that one publicly either.  But at least we know.  I want to think red velvet cake every time.

And they spent a lot of time talking about stuff like security tags you could swallow  and that kind of stuff.  And over the last few years, they just have not promoted themselves much.  They got merged into Google's hardware group.  And Soli, the radar technology, and the Pixel 4 is kind of the one major thing that's come  out lately.

Transcript:  And their mission these days is to try to give devices intelligence without trying to  put all the smarts into the device itself.  So a lot of the intelligence can live in the cloud.  And the stuff I saw involved stuff like a smart remote control that you can kind of  point at different devices in your house.  You can drag and drop a YouTube video to your speaker if you want to listen to it.  They're working on a smart pen that's a little bit like Livescribe, if you remember that.  Except you don't need to use special paper.  You can digitize your stuff just with ordinary paper.  And you can have it translate stuff on the fly and so forth.

Transcript:  This harkens back to the glory days of Bell Labs, AT&T's R&D facility, Xerox's Palo Alto  Research Center, SRI, these great blue sky research labs.  Do companies, is this something companies still do?  We just don't know about it.  Or is it less likely that you're going to see this kind of blue sky R&D in modern America?

Start time: 3106.02
End time: 3149.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, Google is still like rife with R&D labs of all sorts, like the XLab and all kinds  of stuff.  I think the interesting thing about ATAP is it's now very closely affiliated with Google's  hardware operations.  And it's not entirely blue sky.  They want to be ambitious, but they do want to create stuff that might logically show up  in hardware Apple might, sorry, Google might create.  And so it's at least very promising.  Nothing they've done so far has knocked it out of the park or changed the world.  Soli is really intriguing, but the Pixel 4 has been apparently a disappointment sales wise.  Some people really like Soli, other people said that it was...

Start time: 3150.00
End time: 3163.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was the technology that let you wave in front of the phone and go to the next track.  And I have it, I've never once used it.  I always call it Soli.  They say it's Soli, is that how they like to pronounce it?

Start time: 3163.42
End time: 3177.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think I'm mispronouncing it probably.  I think it is Soli.  It also does things like if you, in order to conserve battery life, you can tell if  you're reaching towards your phone and it will turn on the face unlock before you've  actually lifted the phone up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's out in a number of things.  There's a backpack and Levi's jean jackets.  All high priced.  And a smart soul for soccer players.  And that's not been a mass market success.  But when I talked to Dan Kaufman, the head of the lab, he says that basically there's  value in getting stuff out even in small quantities because if you have actual people buying stuff  and using that, you will learn things you will not in like a beta test.

Start time: 3227.10
End time: 3237.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That makes sense.  Yeah.  In any beta test, once you get it out to the public, inevitably somebody thinks of something  that just you never considered.

Start time: 3239.74
End time: 3284.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The example they gave is something called the Levi's commuter jacket with Jacquard built  in and a woman bought it and she pointed out that when it gives navigation directions,  it was giving these very detailed step by step directions.  If it's a commuter jacket, people tend to know how to get to work and home and therefore  they don't need those detailed directions and because the intelligence was in the cloud,  they were able to adjust that.  Oh, that's cool.  So they didn't have to...  I do think you have to expect that these people who buy these fairly expensive things with  Jacquard built in have to have a certain amount of patience and understand that it's still  somewhat emerging technology though.

Start time: 3284.98

Transcript:  This is the challenge for Silicon Valley.  So a lot of those early R&D labs, Xerox is the most famous, Xerox PARC, invented technologies  we use today like crazy but Xerox never made a penny off of any of it.  It just kind of filtered out into the world and was used by other people but they invented  the mouse, the GUI, the menu, windows, laser printer.  In fact, there's a book, How Xerox PARC Invented the World and it made no money.  I can't remember the exact name of it but it's kind of sad.  And then on the other hand...  Fumbling the future.  Fumbling the future, that's right.  And then on the other hand, you could do stuff that looks like ATAP is doing which is you're  working very closely trying to make products but the problem with Silicon Valley is everything  they create seems to be driven by Silicon Valley unless by humans.  So it is nice if they can adapt over time but Silicon Valley's strategy just seems to  be create whatever you can and just throw it and see if any of it sticks because we  don't know what people want.  Is that a reasonable point of view or should they be talking to people more?  I think the thing I think most about is glasses.  That seems to be what everybody is converged on is well that's going to be the next big  thing.  Then somebody asked me yesterday on the radio show, what happened to voice assistants?

There were videos that used his name and likeness to convince viewers to send cryptocurrency  during a fake Bitcoin giveaway, perhaps doubling.  Isn't this the same as the Twitter?  It's exactly the same.  They even used Elon Musk and Bill Gates.  The event was on YouTube for months, promised to give viewers back double what they sent  when viewers, of course, gave them cryptocurrency.  They didn't get anything back.

Transcript:  Why is a public figure likeness not considered the exact same thing?  Right?  If somebody files an infringement claim and says they're using my likeness, why wouldn't  that be taken down immediately just the same as they're using my music or they're using  my...

Start time: 3711.38
End time: 3730.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The difference is that the fingerprinting they do for music is automated and completely  instantaneous.  They can match it.  It's just matching.  Why can't they do that for faces?  They should.  For public figures.  Maybe they should.  Yeah.  It's just, you know, this is more of a manual process.  So instead of taking seconds, it takes months.  Because humans...

Start time: 3730.74
End time: 3770.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It seems like a thing that you would...  It seems like a thing YouTube should have been working on for ages.  Right?  So like if he has, oh, well, hey, if we're going to do this for music and we're going  to do this for, you know, whatever, video games, if you're going to make these digital  thumb prints or prints that you can match up and then say, yeah, this is an infringement,  like why would you not do that?  Especially with deepfakes coming up.  Oh, it's going to be really bad.  Why would you not do that immediately?  Why would you not be working on that with like MIT or, you know, something along those  lines to say, okay, like we're going to protect against deepfakes by doing this thing on YouTube  where, you know, if someone uploads an image of a person and they put in a copyright strike,  like we're going to take it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think this lawsuit has...  Again, it depends on the kind of complaint you're making because for some reason, if  a lawyer representing an artist contacts YouTube, those things are taken down immediately.  And they're often...  And the thing they're complaining about is almost always fair use.  It's not someone has uploaded a song.  It's literally a musician talking about how they made the song or someone reviewing a  movie or whatever it might be.  It's incredible.

And then we're developing some new stuff, which is exciting.  I'm part of a kind of a move fast, break things creative dev team.  We just had a series that I helped co-create ago live called Hacking the Apocalypse, where  the very excellent Claire Riley, which is one of my colleagues at CNET, this is pre,  before the germs came.  She went out and traveled and learned about all kinds of things, like how to survive different  apocalyptic scenarios.  And so she went and visited nuclear bunkers and she got into a little pod that's designed  to protect people from tsunamis.  She did all sorts of stuff.  She is absolutely amazing.  Kudos to her and Andy Altman and John Kim, who are the three main players who produced,  wrote, edited, re-edited.  They really went in there and made this thing sing.  And it's really exciting.  So we're all really proud of it.  So if you haven't seen it, you can check it out on CNET or YouTube.  I believe we're airing it on Pluto TV right now.  Oh, nice.  Pretty awesome.

I would just appreciate that.  And also just giving them the credit that they do because they really worked so hard  on this.  My co-producer and I, Logan in LA, came up with this idea in March of last year.  So it's been a long time in production.  And then of course, when the pandemic hit, we had to kind of...  There were some adjustments that that team had to make.  So they worked really hard and it really shows in the end product and we're really proud  of it.

Transcript:  I will admit, I will say this.  I will admit to being...  So Logan is kind of runs our YouTube channel, our LA producer.  I'm also a producer in LA, but I'm mostly on air talent and creative development and  stuff.  So we come from film and TV backgrounds.  We had college for it.  I interned at Jimmy Kimmel.  So when I came to CNET, there was a lot of news people in video.  As opposed to now where you see a lot of teams, video teams, both on editorial and elsewhere,  are very much from the same backgrounds that Logan and I come from.  So we are certainly guilty sometimes of being a little bit of TV and film school snobs and  being like, well, this is not how you do production in film school.  So that's totally us.  And apologies to any of my coworkers who are annoyed by that on a regular basis.

I just finished watching Aaron Franklin of the Franklin barbecue in Austin, considered  widely considered the best Central Texas barbecue in the world.

Thousands of lessons as they share their stories, share their expertise with you.  And you know, it's not what I don't watch in a YouTube video.  This is, this is really fun.

There is there are downloadable materials.  They're always adding new people teaching you amazing things from how to execute a perfect  technique to a master's insight about their craft.  There's something for everyone.  My new favorite, the one I've booked Mark to start watching.  I can't wait.  It's a whole lesson in politics from Carl Rove and David Axelrod.  Obama's campaign guy strategist.  Carl Rove was W's campaign strategist.  They're doing it together, which I think is adorable.  And they everything from how to find a candidate, how to prep the candidate, how to do opposition  research.  It is really, I can't wait to watch this.  And I'm not, you know, get into politics or anything, but I just the idea of watching  these two of the best, most successful campaign strategists of all time.  Talk about what they know.  The sections include starting a campaign, assessing your candidate, researching your  opponent, understanding the electorate, polling and focus groups.  I'm always been how to use direct mail, how to create a slogan and a logo.  There's 24 segments on this, identifying influencers, the end of the race.  There's a great segment at the end, the state of politics.  I just I think this is this is what you want with masterclass.  This is the best learning, beautifully shot, fascinating material.

Transcript:  So I also think that you have to remember the algorithm is key.  In fact, Ben Thompson, a strategic at a very...  At a great insight, he was comparing TikTok to Quibi.  So Quibi is a Hollywood's attempt to do short videos on mobile devices.  And I think it's probably premature to say it failed, but it's...  It's as close to failing as you get.  They spent...  I think you got it.  Yeah.  They raised $1.75 billion.  Three months ago, they...  Big splash.  They had big names, celebrities doing high production value, seven minute shows.  They had that special super secret sauce technology where you could rotate the phone  and get vertical or horizontal and it would be a different perspective.  They have mysteries.  They have reality.  They have Chrissy Teigen as a judge and John Legend shows up.

Transcript:  Okay.  I agree.  I mean, but not enough to make you subscribe.  So hundreds of thousands of people downloaded the app.  Millions, I think, downloaded the app.  According to Sensor Tower, at the beginning of this month, when the three month free trial  went up, of those millions, only 72,000 actually paid for it.

You remember that thing at CES?  We're going to turn it vertical.  You could flip that TV.  That was silly.  That's like a Quibi TV right there.  They should have named it the Quibi TV.

Transcript:  So Ben had some really...  I thought the insight was really good.  He said, this is the Hollywood model, which is you spend a lot of money.  You get the best talent possible.  You do the best production you can.  You get big name celebrities.  You put out the best stuff you can.  And the Hollywood model is most of them will flop, but enough of them will be big that  they'll pay for all the rest.  And he said, compare that to the Silicon Valley model, which TikTok is an example of,  where what you do, and YouTube did this too, is you just say to everybody, upload your video,  as many of you as possible.  And Facebook, to some degree, does the same thing.  Just put everything on there, and then algorithmically, we'll watch which ones get watched, and we'll  start to surface those, and algorithmically, we'll get better and better.  And so of the millions of videos uploaded every day, a handful will become very successful.  That's a very...  That's a good model.  TikTok works so much better than the Quibi model.  And it's why TikTok is so much more...  And by the way, it's free.

Transcript:  Although I'm sure they're making money.  So TikTok has become the poster boy for xenophobia, for sinophobia, for the Trump trade war.  Mike Pompeo, the Secretary of State, said, we're looking seriously at banning TikTok  in the United States.  I don't...  That would be a challenging thing to do, although there is the Council on Foreign Investment  in the United States, CFIUS.  There might be ways that they could say, because TikTok is a Chinese company, they could possibly...  This is untested in the courts.  Go to Google and Apple, say, you need to yank TikTok from your stores.  And by the way, turn it off on every phone that's already got it.  That's conceivable.  I don't know if they'll do that, or if this is just more saber rattling from Trump.  But the folks at TikTok are taking it very seriously.  I mean, you have to.  Yeah, here's a story in Bloomberg from a couple of days ago, Katie Roof and Jiaping Wang.  Combative TikTok founder races to save app before Trump ban.  And there are a number of strategies.  One would be to sell it to American investors.  Another would be to spin off a company that would be the US TikTok.  The problem with that is one of the reasons TikTok succeeds is this, we can get millions  of videos from all over the world.  The US, according to Bloomberg, is a relatively modest part of ByteDance's overall business.  The TikTok app has been downloaded 165 million times in the US compared to 2 billion times  globally, including the Chinese equivalent.  Now India has banned TikTok, so that might take a big chunk out of those numbers.  They also are looking at splitting ByteDance, the Chinese parent company, into a ByteDance  China and then ByteDance everywhere else, set up a global headquarters in the United  States or the UK.  But I guess, I don't know.  The issue is there's a lot of concern that Chinese government might be influencing ByteDance,  that they might be using the app for data collection.  What are you laughing?  You don't think this?

Transcript:  This is the thing I'm very curious about.  I get it.  But also, we're all stuck in our houses, so there goes your location data that you'd want.  I just feel like I'm all about, you know me, Leo.  I talk about privacy all the time.  But it's like, what, I'm like, what is the motivation here?

Start time: 5072.68
End time: 5095.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, TikTok has in the past done things that apparently the Chinese government might have  asked them.  They banned videos about Hong Kong protests.  They have in the past down, it's unclear whether the algorithm is doing this automatically  or by human intervention.  But if you're overweight in the past, they have kept your videos from getting to the  top of the food chain.

Start time: 5096.56

Transcript:  I think this is, I don't know, you know, Peter Navarro.  So Pompeo talked about banning them.  Peter Navarro has talked about, who's I think our US trade negotiator, talked about fining  them.  TikTok, this is a big deal.  TikTok is the most valuable startup in the world at this point.  Seventy five billion dollar valuation.  Actually that was during its last official fundraising.  In subsequent private fundraising, maybe valued as much as 140 billion dollars.  This is a very valuable company.

Start time: 5153.46

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're also talking about maybe like hiring 10,000 people in the US.  They already have a CEO from here who they hired away from Disney.  They're talking about giving lots of money to creators in the US.  I'm not entirely sure how any of that would counteract any legitimate concerns.  But they know that the concerns are legitimate or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you say we're creating jobs in the US, that sharpens the blow, right?  10,000 new jobs.  We're a job creator.  People kind of know what buttons to push for the Trump administration.  Apple dedicated a whole webpage to creating, what did they say, like two and a half million  jobs?  Some ridiculous number.  The reason is they included everybody who had ever written an app for iOS as a job.  But they know that carries a lot of weight in Washington.

Start time: 5206.28

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They are the first, that I can think of, Chinese software experience that's become really important  in the US.  Things like WeChat have dabbled with this country and never gotten very far because  what WeChat offers is hugely popular in China and is kind of almost the opposite of what  people want here.  TikTok is something that has a lot of appeal no matter where it goes.  It's obviously one of the first real competitors that Facebook has.  Now that TikTok is not available in India, Facebook has Reels, which is sort of a TikTok  clone, which is available in India and taking advantage of that.

Start time: 5252.50

Transcript:  I think the thing I think about when I look at TikTok is the really endless creativity  in people.  I don't compete with that.  In this kind of cool short Chinese nature.  Yeah, you know, it doesn't, I mean, at least what I'm looking at now, I'm not logged in,  so I don't, this is just the generic stream on their website is, in fact, you don't even  see any Chinese people.  But it's very creative and people are very talented and doing really interesting things.  And see, this is why I don't have it on my phone.  I just, I can't.  Now what you're not getting, because I'm not playing the music because I don't want us  to get taken down by some third rate lawyer for some cheesy 70s band.

Our show today brought to you by LastPass.  Your IT department has a tough job right now.  More devices, applications, people working from home.  New threats, new regulations, strong security getting more complicated than ever.  Thank goodness.  LastPass provides your IT department with strong security that's easy to use and manage.  LastPass lets you secure every entry point from shadow IT to apps to mobile and cloud  services.  Their access solutions give you visibility and control over every access point to your  organization.  You can unify access and authentication.  You can access a variety of applications and devices, but that can lead to a lack of visibility.  You can't really see what your users are doing from application to application or device  to device unless you use LastPass.  LastPass identity offers a simple and integrated view across all access and authentication  tests.  IT will know who's accessing what, when, and where.  That's really important, especially with employees working from home.  The beauty part of LastPass is you get increased security without impacting productivity.  It doesn't slow down employees.  It doesn't hurt productivity.  It actually makes their job easier.  So they're more likely to want to use it.  Single sign-on is an example.  It's so much better than passwords.  Makes it easy to sign on.  Employees love it, and yet it's more secure.  It's kind of LastPass does the thing that's the hardest in security.  It makes it more secure and easier.  And of course, it's the best password manager out there.  Passwords are entryways into businesses.  You can't be using sticky notes and spreadsheets to keep track of them.  You need LastPass's secure vault decrypted and encrypted only at the device level.  The password, the master password is never sent to LastPass.  Only your employee knows it.  They don't store it.  It works on every device you've got, iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, Linux, every browser  known to man.  Your data is always secured with the strongest 256-bit AES encryption.  The same used by banks and the military.  It's as secure as you can get.  Protect your business and your IT department with the tools you need to keep your business  safe with LastPass.

Transcript:  I'm nervous about Intel.  This is a company that just actually posted stellar earnings.  Their business is not quite equally split between PCs and data centers.  They literally fabricate their own chips, which has always been kind of a competitive  advantage.

Transcript:  That's the story, which is Bob Swan, during the post-earnings conference call, which I  caught this late, said, someone asked, would you consider outsourcing TSMC or whatever?  He said, yeah, that's a contingency plan for sure.

Start time: 6110.10

Transcript:  Why is it important?  You better explain this.  Why is that number important?

Start time: 6139.60
End time: 6167.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The nanometer number?  It really speaks to the efficiency of the chips.  And this is the problem.  So as computing has gone mobile for end users and data centers have gone to the cloud, what  we're looking for is that power per watt.  It's the power efficiency number.  Intel has always been, they're the megahertz guys.  They're really good at pumping up the power of individual chips.  They're not good at bringing them down to smaller die sizes and making them more efficient.

Start time: 6167.28

Start time: 6180.75
End time: 6225.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Moore's Law is a moving target.  It's certainly changed over the years.  Yes, the problem is Intel is about to be subsumed by, we'll just call it ARM because I don't  know what else to call this.  But those types of chips are more efficient and they are obviously ideal for a data center,  which is roughly half of Intel's business.  And personal computing of course has gone mobile.  And off the top of my head, there are probably 10 times as many mobile devices.  Is that right?  That's probably an exaggeration.  Eight times as many mobile devices sold each year as PCs, something like that.  I don't think Intel is going to give up the PC anytime soon, but they're going to be the  last company standing there.  And that's not the business you want to bet your future on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well Leo, I have to disagree with you.  No, I've long felt the future is open, for one thing.  And that's kind of maybe a software approach.  But yeah, you can see what's happening out in the broader world with regards to personal  computing.  I mean, you can't ignore it.  I mean, it's happening.

Start time: 6271.47
End time: 6299.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's like, apparently the yields are not good for their process.  He says they identified a defect mode in its seven nanometer process that caused yield  degradation issues.  Basically, they are just struggling at this point.  Now, admittedly, Apple abandoning Intel chips, it's a small fraction of their business, doesn't  it affect them on the bottom line?

Start time: 6300.00
End time: 6330.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think it is indicative.  Apple as a company that, well, look, they're concerned about control here.  But that Apple is able to make this transition now is astonishing.  And they see the future.  I mean, they're wrapped up in that future.  They are very much a post PC company.  Their devices business is much bigger than their Mac business.  So moving the Mac to Apple Silicon or an ARM type chipset is a big news story.

Start time: 6330.72

Transcript:  Well, Sam was talking about Intel a little bit.  We were talking about chips on the radio show.  He's the car guy.  And he did point out that while Nvidia and other companies have done very well in automotive,  Intel at least has an automotive play, perhaps.  OK.  Do they?  Do they?

Start time: 6368.30
End time: 6380.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.  Even Nvidia, by the way, makes almost as much money from data centers as they do from  graphics and PC.  That's right.  Their business, like Intel's, has gone in an interesting direction.

Start time: 6382.32
End time: 6394.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's why the big story is the rumor, and it's only rumor, that Nvidia is thinking  of acquiring ARM.  Softbank is either putting ARM up for sale or something.  They need cash after their flop with WeWork.

Start time: 6394.40
End time: 6418.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't understand how Nvidia could afford it.  This is a company that I think they generate about $3 billion in revenues a quarter.  There are probably only a few companies that could afford to buy ARM that would want it.  Apple's not going to do it.  They could, obviously.  Microsoft's not going to do it.  Intel could make a case for Intel buying them.  Actually that's not a bad idea.

Transcript:  You quote an analyst, Chris Rowland.  Yeah, that's a great quote.  Who says, with the latest push out of process technology, we believe Intel has zero to no  chance, that's by the way the same, zero to no chance of catching or surpassing TSMC,  at least for that next half decade if ever.

Start time: 6447.21
End time: 6464.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and this is the volume.  I don't have an exact number on Intel.  It's in the hundreds of millions, but that's the difference between a business that ships  primarily to what we'll call low volume markets, data center, slash PC versus high volume markets  in mobile.  Billions.  Wow.

Transcript:  It's just a sad story for American manufacturing given that Intel was a great American manufacturing  story for 50 years.  It's very bittersweet for me, regardless of whether the devices have come out better or  worse or whatever.  It would be nice to see Intel flourishing.  The era has been ending, at least ever since the smartphone became a big thing.  Intel tried to make smartphone processors and failed.

Start time: 6532.32

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, Intel did this famous thing back in the late 70s or early 80s.  At one point, they were doing a lot of memory chips and it was really successful for them.  But they decided the future was not memory chips and they bet everything on microprocessors  and shut down the memory stuff even when it was doing well.  And I kind of wonder, is there like a big bet Intel could make today that would be the  equivalent for that?  And part of it might be kind of acknowledging that the future is not being quite so vertically  integrated.

Start time: 6562.34
End time: 6569.51

Transcript:  This looks bad.  This was a...  Okay, Harry, you probably have your finger maybe, Ashley, on the pulse of future technologies.  I saw this story in the Washington Post and I thought, what the heck?  It's a picture of the mayor of Chicago, Lori Lightfoot, and the governor of Illinois,  JB Pritzker, at an announcement.  U.S. officials and scientists unveiled a plan on Thursday to pursue what they call one of  the most important technological frontiers of the 21st century, building a quantum internet.  They had a professor from Chicago, University of Chicago's Pritzker School of Molecular  Engineering, and senior scientist at Argonne National Laboratory, called the Internet Project  a pillar of the nation's quantum research program.  It's a birth of a new technology.  Oh, and it will be, by the way, hacker-proof, they say.  This all sounds really good until I got to the sentence.  Maybe you can explain this to me.  Maybe I'm just ignorant.  Quantum computers are still in an early stage of development, not yet as powerful as classical  computers, but connecting them via an internet could help accelerate their use for solving  complex problems.  The networks promise to be more secure, some even say unhackable, because of, hand waving  here, the nature of photons and other quantum bits known as qubits.  And my favorite part was when they said that devices on this quantum internet will be able  to talk to each other using something called quantum entanglement without being connected  in any way.  What?  Is that magic?  I think that's magic.  They're not connected.

End time: 6747.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It seems impossible.  Oh, and by the way, the reason it's not hackable, this is another good one, is the Heisenberg  uncertainty principle.  If you snoop on the traffic going on in the quantum network, it changes.  So you can't hack it because you can't look at it.

Start time: 6748.88
End time: 6781.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That seems like a really raw idea right now.  Yeah.  Especially given the state of quantum computing in general.  Then again, the internet got going in 1969, and it was a very raw idea back then.  And it sounds like the notion for the quantum internet is it would start as something for  military applications and academia.  I mean, I think over the next few decades, it's a totally logical idea.  That article you mentioned, I think also says that nobody is really sure who's going to  be for this right now.

End time: 6811.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not entirely clear why you couldn't just sort of connect quantum computers over the  internet more or less as we know it.  I think that would be more secure just given the ability of quantum computers to do encryption  at a level that classical computers can't do.

Start time: 6812.32
End time: 6849.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is, you know, maybe it's the Washington Post and it's difficult reporting, and I'd  love to know more.  And I was hoping somebody would explain it to me.  For instance, they say that they've built a 52-mile quantum network.  And that's going to extend to 80 miles.  And then in New York, there's an 80-mile quantum network.  But at the very next paragraph, they say a key piece of hardware called a quantum repeater  still needs to be developed, invented to amplify the signal over long distances.  So it's my guess they've got quantum computers over a standard network, not a quantum network  because they don't have a repeater yet.

Transcript:  Right.  I think, I mean, Harry has it right where this is stuff that's decades away, I would  imagine.  I think my biggest concern is, I mean, I agree with the, you know, if you really want to  make things a little more hacker-proof, like sponsor encryption bills.  Sponsor encryption bills.  We have existing technology that can help keep hackers out of things.  Sponsor encryption bills, you know, be pro encryption.  But on that same note, like I also, I think the thing that I also have concerns about  or that I would have concerns about whenever this happens is when we originally developed  the internet, it didn't exist before.  And now we're talking about two different kinds of internet.  And it seems like one will be maybe a little harder to access for people of lower income,  people of lower means, people in more rural areas.  And the thing is, is now you're creating, now you're creating two different classes  of information available to people.  And I have a problem with that.

But I was tweeting about it this morning.  I just, I get very frustrated when I read about technology or computer science programming  or any startup that does not consider the worst intentions of the worst people when  they build products.  They think, oh, it's going to be great.  Like pie in the sky.  Like, oh, this is going to be so amazing.  It's going to be hacker proof.  It's going to bring people together.  It's going to be hacker proof.  It's here.  All the great things it's going to do.  And, and they don't consider how that can be weaponized to exclude groups of people,  to give disinformation to groups.  It's all about the Tic-Tac.  Will there be Tic-Tac on this center?  Are we going to weaponize Tic-Tac?  Is there going to be Tic-Tac?  Tic-Tac.  That's the thing that really frustrates me is it's like, yeah, you're talking about  creating two different internets and you think that's not going to affect a group of people  whoever it may be that will not have access to it?  Like it absolutely will.  And these companies just, you know, we have this issue in computer science where we just,  that is not constantly hammered into a curriculum either in a learning institution or outside  of a learning institution in private companies.  There is ethical ramification to the product that you build.  And you have to really think about these things.  And you have to, you know, not to say always think like an evil person, but it's like there are  people out there who want to use products, whether it's tech or analog products, to do bad  things.  And you have to consider those use cases when you are building this stuff.

Space Force, not the Netflix TV show.  The actual Space Force logo is here.  It does not look as much like the Star Trek logo as it did.  They probably took some some feedback, but they do have a motto.  Semper Supra, which doesn't mean we're always driving Toyotas.  It means always...  Semper the Supra.  It harks back, of course, to the Marine Corps slogan, Semper Paratus, always prepared.  Or is that the Boy Scout motto?  I can never remember.  Semper Supra means always above because they're always above.  They're always up there.  Space Force.  Your personal zenith.  Yep.  Just thought I'd pass it along.  TechCrunch says that the original Space Force logo revealed in January,  which looks like the Starfleet's logo, is actually the seal for the Space Force branch of the military.  They say this new logo is the simpler one for the organization as a whole.  They say you could tell them apart because this one looks more like the Pontiac logo.

Transcript:  I had this. So when I was filming, we did an app walkthrough of the Peacock app for CNET's YouTube channel.  And when I was filming it, I was doing it on my PC using my Elgato Capture.  And, you know, everything was fine until I actually wanted to play any content.  Or I went to the channels tab, which is like live channels, which are not necessarily like your traditional channels.  They were like, oh, it's a channel for the Tonight Show or the Today Show or whatever, where it's just constantly playing episodes.  But I went to that.  And yeah, I think it's HDCP, right?  It's like preventing a bunch of, you know, we don't want you to capture this stuff.  So I really struggle watching that stuff on my desktop, which is good.  There's some issues there, which is not great.

Transcript:  I really can't. I can't imagine why they thought it was a good idea to launch without support for especially those two devices, especially like Roku and Apple Fire TV,  which tons of people have and prefer over Apple TV, for example.  And so it is it is a little short sighted, I guess.  I like I'm sure maybe I'm sure it probably has something to do with the fact that there's like, you know, lawyers involved in negotiating and deals.  I'm sure there's something going on there that I'm just not privy to.

Transcript:  I would imagine that one point six million downloads would be, I don't know, maybe triple that had they launched on two of the other biggest platforms.  It seems like it seems like a big misstep for launch.  But, you know, people who are into people who are streaming are not reading these articles.  Right. This is like very inside baseball. They don't care about how Peacock's doing.  They'll just go download it whenever they are, whenever they remember it exists or is in their face.  And then they go, oh, yeah, I'm just going to use this.  Like, I don't think this number will affect anybody's willingness to download it in the future.

Start time: 7987.60
End time: 8002.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mostly, at least if I'm I use myself as an example, it just comes down to is there a show I want to watch?  OK, I want to watch it. What do I need to watch it?  Oh, I need Peacock and then I'll download it and install it and maybe even pay for it if I don't want to watch the ads.

Start time: 8003.06
End time: 8079.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I do think it is very smart that they launched with a free option.  Yeah, that's good.  That's brilliant on their part because it gets everybody into that ecosystem.  Right. And then you have and then they launch originals.  They have some originals, but obviously with the pandemic, they weren't able to finish a lot of production on some of the later produced shows.  So they'll have more originals next year.  And as time goes on, you're going to see them once those licensing agreements end with Netflix or whoever they might have them with.  They are absolutely going to start keeping exclusives on their properties in in app.  So it's over time.  They're just going to be more and more reasons to be a subscriber to Peacock, whether that's on the free level or to pay for a little more content and a little more content and ads.  Or you go to the top tier, which is ten bucks a month, and it's it's no ads, but they actually have an asterisk there where it says actually there will be some stuff because of agreements we have with other production companies that there has to be ads on them for the time being.  So you may see a couple of ads here or there, but generally speaking, it will be a no ad experience at this point for the consumer.

End time: 8113.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this is what we asked for. Right.  Like I it's a be careful what you wish for. Is this what we asked for?  Is it really? Yeah, because if you think about it back in, let's say back in the 90s, early 2000s, when everybody was paying ridiculous amounts of money for cable bundles, it became well, why can't I just buy this channel?  Why can't I just buy this channel? Why can't I just pay for this?

Start time: 8113.92
End time: 8120.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, to be fair, what we really wanted is why can't I just buy this show? We want a complete desegregation.  And you can do that. That's the thing. You can do that.

Start time: 8121.52
End time: 8142.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You pay your thirty five dollars and buy your show for a season.  But most people would rather have this subscription where you have access to more stuff.  And this is what people thought they wanted.  And now we're seeing kind of a return to a bundle, these like sort of skinny bundle systems like you have your phylos where it's like, well, if you don't want this is actually worse than cable TV, though.

Start time: 8143.18
End time: 8180.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Because at least a cable TV had too much to watch, but it was all in one interface.  Now there's too much to watch, but they're all in different apps.  You have to figure out which app. You can't switch between shows on different apps.  You have to manually switch out, load the other, wait till it comes up, choose a profile, go in.  You know, it's it's so fragmented and it's very confusing.  It's like Ashley said, you know, you don't you don't know what the deals are with people.  You know, if I want to watch Seinfeld, where is Seinfeld this week?  Is it was it on that flexible while?  Now it's isn't it on HBO or something?  It's I why do I need to know stuff like that?

Transcript:  I think I really like the categories it offers.  I think some people are really turned off by them because they're extremely specific and niche, kind of like those really weird Netflix categories.  But I am very curious.  I think for me over time, that trending tab, which is a very interesting and eclectic mix of here's a three minute news clip of the day.  Here's a show you might like.  Here's this. Here's this.  I like that a lot.  And I think that that's a really interesting concept that we haven't really seen on a streaming platform that's as big as Peacock.  And I think if you can offer that and really curate it well and as we talked about earlier, use the algorithm, use an algorithm to understand who your viewer is and really serve them.  That is a very compelling thing for me.  And I mean, I have it.  I have an account.  So they got me to buy in at least on a free account.  So for now, I'll probably keep it free.  I don't think I'm going to pay for the upgraded stuff.  The upgraded accounts.  But you know, who knows?  Maybe next year they'll have some award worthy show that everyone's talking about.  It's a buzz worthy thing.  And you don't want to have your FOMO and you got to subscribe and everybody needs to get in on it.  So yeah, we'll see.  I think it's very interesting.  But yes, I do want to do the rankings every year.  And also I would like to formally and publicly apologize once again to the WWE Network, which I think is a very interesting show.  I was waiting for an email from the WWE Network, which I think is the only streaming service I accidentally omitted from that list.  Who knew they had a network?  I literally agreed.  They emailed me.  I was waiting for an email from them.  As soon as it went live, like first two comments, like what about WWE Network?  And I'm like, oh my God, I had nightmares about this two nights before it published.  Is it all wrestling all the time?  It's all it's wrestling content.  So it's not necessarily massive.  It's not wrestling related, like reality TV, stuff like that.  Yeah, I felt really terrible about it.
