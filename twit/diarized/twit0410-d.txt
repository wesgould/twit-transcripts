Start time: 164.44
End time: 173.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And from The Verge, and this is Dieter's first time Dieter Bohn. It's great to have you, mobile editor at The Verge.  Yeah, good to be here.  And a friend of Rene's. I guess you guys work together for a while.  Yeah, absolutely.

Start time: 174.16
End time: 177.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a nice way of saying I was his old boss.  Yes, his old boss.  Not old, former.  Former.

Start time: 178.16
End time: 214.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Former.  You look a lot like Ed Snowden, actually. I don't, you don't know anything about the NSA, do you?  No, not much.  Okay, just checking.  That's not just me. The chat room says the same thing.  Also, an old friend, a guy I used to work with at Tech TV at the Screen Savers.  He was one of the funniest writers ever, a producer at the Screen Savers.  He's now editor at Polygon, which is Vox's new game website.  Russ Pitts, great to have you.  Hey, Leon. Good to have you.  Good to see you have your special gold sword.  So we just want to make sure we're all armed with Minecraft-like 8-bit instruments.

Start time: 215.84
End time: 218.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just in case it gets rough, I wanted to have this close at hand.

Start time: 219.16
End time: 225.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How's things going at Polygon?  Very, very well, actually.  You launched, what, a couple of months? When did it launch officially?

Start time: 226.32
End time: 233.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Officially launched, I want to say October of last year. So it's been about seven months.  This was our first E3 as a Polygon, and it all just went very, very well.

Start time: 234.16
End time: 276.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Very fun. Vox, of course, used to do, did, still does SB Nation, and then launched The Verge,  both of which are amazing websites, then decided to get into gaming at Polygon,  is like The Verge, really kind of the definitive gaming website.  So I was really thrilled when Tom Merritt told me that you had taken a job at Polygon.  That's great news.  Thank you. Thank you so much, Leon.  Welcome. First time on Twitter for Dieter and Russ, and we'll talk about E3 in just a bit,  but we also have an old friend who's going to talk about something a little bit crazy.  Well, dare I say loony. Trey, Trey Radcliffe is here from StuckInCustoms.com,  our favorite photographer. You're back from China. You got into China.

Start time: 277.86
End time: 282.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I got into China. I got back out of China. Great success there. So the visa was taken care of.

Start time: 282.99
End time: 290.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, the last time you were here, you didn't, it was up in the air.  You were supposed to leave the next day, and so you got to go, and you went with the NEX 7.  How did you like that?

Start time: 291.68
End time: 301.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I loved it. Yeah, so I did an experiment. I set my normal big Nikon D800 to the side,  and I replaced it with my Sony for about 10 days.

Start time: 301.70
End time: 306.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Not paid by Sony. He bought it at retail. It's not some special advertising deal.

Start time: 306.54
End time: 321.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No. I have no relationship with Sony, but I'm not one of these old school guys that's just tied to carrying around  big iron and mirrors just because it's the biggest and the best.  I think that these small mirrorless cameras, this is the future of photography.

Start time: 322.76
End time: 343.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, and I'll tell you why I asked, because when it came time to,  Henry graduated from high school last week. When it came time to get him a graduation present,  I got him an NEX 7. Yeah. I thought I want to get him a nice camera.  I want a light camera to take to college. And based on, so I didn't make a mistake,  because you hadn't gotten back yet. Tell me now, is it too late?

Start time: 344.82
End time: 358.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, it's great. You know, there's only a few conditions when you need a big DSLR,  where that is still better. Maybe like high speed action type stuff,  or where you don't want to encounter the buffering, but really, NEX 7 will take care of 99% of your needs.

Start time: 359.26
End time: 370.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. Good. So welcome back to Twit. He's in New Zealand. He's in Christchurch right now.  Tell us the story. You got a strange email from Google last week.

Start time: 371.82
End time: 418.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so they sent me a note, and they said, we can't tell you what's going on, just sign.  I was like, well, and I knew it was Google X, so it's got to be cool.  And they've only announced two Google X projects, you know, the self-driving cars and the glasses.  So this must have been cool. And it was this Project Loon.  And it was this audacious, ambitious idea to surround the world with internet balloons.  So they wanted me to come along and take some photos and just kind of see what was going on.  It happened to be here in my backyard. That's totally coincidental.  So I jumped in a car with my family and drove a few hours north from Queenstown up here to the Christchurch area  and joined the team and started taking photos. It was a blast.

Start time: 419.36
End time: 453.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So you actually got to document this. And I know there's already one video on StuckInCustoms.com.  We're not looking at that right now. This is a Google video.  But you shot one video and you have another one coming in a couple of days that is in a lot of technical detail  discussing, you know, talking about what's going on here.  But as soon as that video gets approved, it'll be at StuckInCustoms.com.  But they were smart to ask you because here you are documenting. This is the secret Google warehouse.  So are these, first of all, they're in the stratosphere.

Start time: 454.94
End time: 487.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so they're twice as high as commercial airlines. And there's basically nothing up there.  There's no more weather. So they get solar power cleanly.  And the big breakthrough about these balloons is that they can move up and down at various levels through the stratosphere.  And as they move up and down, they can catch different air currents.  So they can sort of keep this grid or matrix like mesh sort of Cartesian plane.

Start time: 488.96
End time: 493.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're not they're not going around the world. They're not attached by a 10 mile string to the earth.

Start time: 495.84
End time: 521.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, they've got a they've got a valve on the bottom. It's actually a two chamber balloon.  And the top chamber is filled with helium. OK, bottom one is filled with regular air.  And by pumping air in and out of the bottom chamber, they can move them up and down, changing the density of the of the helium a little bit.  But that's that's kind of the same. But they they change the weight of the balloon by pumping more air into the lower chamber.

Start time: 521.72
End time: 527.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I get it. Yeah. So that's something you can keep doing kind of for at least until the balloon wears out.

Start time: 528.96
End time: 553.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. So that's the big goal is to not fill up the balloon too much so that it pops or that it gets these holes in it.  You know, they're they're really trying to figure out a way to keep the balloons up there for a long time.  But they have had balloons get up there and stay, you know, for months and years.  I mean, this is ballooning is sort of an old science. It's a tough it's a tough science.  So they're trying to get their balloons to stay up as long as possible.

Start time: 553.70
End time: 567.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Can you show this on my screen? This is the balloon going up.  So you get a sense of it. They're doing this on New Zealand over New Zealand as an experiment.  How many balloons do they launch over New Zealand? Dozens and dozens.

Start time: 567.40
End time: 582.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know the exact number. They've got this company called Raven Aerostar that they partnered with.  And Raven Aerostar, they're the guys that build all these huge weather balloons for NASA.  They do all kinds of crazy stuff. So these guys are they're super hardcore.

Start time: 582.50
End time: 586.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They know what they know what they're doing. And how do they get the Internet access to the balloon?

Start time: 587.72
End time: 609.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, so they have these big ground stations that are in cities or, you know, in places where they definitely have a good solid wired Internet connection into the into the backbone.  And so your signal goes up from your house, you know, you have or your car or your little village or whatever it is.  You have this little antenna that aims up at the sky.

Start time: 609.26
End time: 615.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Here's an image, by the way, of the antenna on Trays of video. It's kind of cute. It looks like a little balloon, a little red balloon.

Start time: 616.64
End time: 626.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, you can see a little if you look over there to the right, you can see a little white dot.  That's one of the balloon balloons that is flying over here.  Yeah, it's quite tiny up in the sky.

Start time: 626.30
End time: 630.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So these are visible on a clear day. You can't kind of see the balloon.

Start time: 631.96
End time: 637.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That one is kind of still on its way up to the atmosphere. So they are really tough to see with the naked eye. They're pretty tiny.

Start time: 637.20
End time: 638.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, they're 10 miles away.

Start time: 639.48
End time: 649.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The signal goes up. It goes to one of the balloons and then it gets relayed around to other balloons until it finds a ground station, goes down, gets the data, then brings it back.  You know, right.

Start time: 650.48
End time: 661.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And in fact, there's as the balloons move over, there's a handoff just like a cell network.  And so it's an interesting technology. What kind of speed do people get?

Start time: 662.82
End time: 738.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I went to a couple of testers homes and we we looked at it.  It seemed perfectly broad bandish. I didn't jump on speedtest.net to see how fast it really was.  But I remember the first time. So I was in there with this kind of funny story.  I shouldn't tell it. But so I went into the first testers house and I was there with Stephen Levy from Wired magazine, who wrote a beautiful piece over there on Wired.  By the way, one of my best photos that I took is going to show up in Wired magazine.  They got an exclusive on it. So the world hasn't seen that yet.  Be sure to check out Stephen's article when it comes out in print.  So anyway, what happened is we went to this testers home and they're getting Internet.  They're on trademe.co.nz, which is sort of the local eBay.  And then, of course, everyone in there, we want to connect and connect our cell phones or whatever and start playing with the Internet.  And so Stephen Levy is over there. He's connecting to it or whatever.  Then I went over and saw that, oh, people are connecting to it. I want to connect, too.  So I go over and I asked the Google guys, I said, what's the password I want to get on?  And they said, just a minute. Mr. Levy is on the Internet.  I was like, all right, I'll wait. I'll wait till he has a good experience.  I don't know what they thought I was going to do. You know, BitTorrent, the Game of Thrones.

Start time: 738.52
End time: 755.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but one of the time only plays. Yeah.  How funny. Yeah. So, yeah, they're claiming 3G speed.  This is not to wire, you know, America. This is not to get cities online.  This is for areas where there is no Internet access.

Start time: 756.36
End time: 760.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they say that there's actually quite a few Americans that don't even have good Internet access.

Start time: 761.26
End time: 771.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I got a call from a guy in Montana, you know, just the other day.  He says there's no there's no Internet access available to me.  But these people, but if you're in the first world, you'll probably use satellite and expensive satellite Internet.

Start time: 772.74
End time: 827.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, this I think this will be quite disruptive the same way that fiber has been disrupted.  So when fiber drops into a city, it drives competition crazy. Right.  Suddenly people have to provide, you know, unlimited Internet or drop their prices.  It is not just the access that I think is exciting here.  Here in New Zealand, actually, I think this is a pretty good test bed because I noticed this after I came from the U.S.  Where I'm used to having unlimited Internet.  But people here, they don't really have unlimited Internet in their homes.  And I think this is actually very common in Europe and all over the world.  We're quite spoiled in the U.S. And so I know that like at home in Queenstown, I happen to have unlimited Internet.  I've got to have it. So I pay extra.  But all of my son's friends who are 12 and 13, they come over and they can't believe that my son can watch limited YouTube videos.  I mean, it's inconceivable to them. Right.  And can you imagine being a kid growing up not being allowed to watch, you know, maybe 10 or 20 YouTube videos a month?

Start time: 828.44
End time: 839.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, it's a big deal for us as TWiP because it means that people in New Zealand really are going to be very careful about how much of us they watch.  You know, if you want to be an Internet broadcaster, bandwidth caps are a bad thing.

Start time: 841.36
End time: 848.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it sucks to make a decision like, well, do I have enough bandwidth to download Leo's show this month?  You know, it's a horrible decision you have to make.

Start time: 849.42
End time: 859.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So does Google have they said they plan to offer this for free worldwide?  What do they what do they probably don't know what they plan to do with it or do they?

Start time: 859.16
End time: 866.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they don't really have a business model for it yet.  I'm sure I don't know what the business model is for fiber.  You know, I don't think they provide that for free.

Start time: 867.80
End time: 877.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They've always said that is their goal as a company is get people use the Internet more.  If people use the Internet more, they'll make money.  Because they're an Internet advertising company.

Start time: 878.24
End time: 888.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they just want to get more people on the net.  And I don't think they want to be a giant ISP and make money from like monthly charges.  They just want to get people Internet and then they do AdWords and this sort of thing.

Start time: 890.65
End time: 938.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It seems like they have a business model.  I mean, I don't know if it's enough to pay for the infrastructure.  Who knows how much these balloons cost.  But the model is pretty straightforward.  The more people that use the Internet, the more the world is connected.  Both it's good for the world, but it's also good for Google.  And this is why no nation is going to do this because it's floating all around the world.  The UN isn't going to do this.  I think it's going to be a company like the Google or the NSA.  They might do it.  That's a joke. Maybe not such a big joke.  So this is cool.  So people, if you live in New Zealand, you can if you go to Google.com slash Loon,  as they call it appropriately, the Loon project, you could sign up as a tester.  What do you think?  I mean, this is pretty cool, Trey.

Start time: 940.31
End time: 985.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's great.  It seems on the face of it, goofy.  Well, you know, this Rich Deval is kind of one of the guys behind this.  It's just a huge team, of course.  But he and Mike Cassidy, they know it's an audacious plan and they're serious.  They don't want to waste their time.  They want to do something that's going to work and change the world and affect a billion plus people.  You know, these are all makers.  They're all kind of Burning Man kind of guys.  They love building stuff.  And they're having a ball.  They're doing some serious science and they're really iterating in a Google way.  So I think they've got the right approach and the right attitude.  I mean, everyone's super excited about it, especially New Zealand.  Sometimes we feel like the end of the world.  So it's exciting to get stuff to launch here.

Start time: 986.16
End time: 1024.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I thought that was why you moved there.  You want to be at the end of the world.  So the idea, and we'll see what happens, but the idea is there's five billion people on the planet who are not connected to the Internet right now.  The vast majority.  The idea is to connect as many of them as possible with hundreds, perhaps thousands of balloons floating at 60,000 feet above sea level,  getting their Internet access from base stations in big cities and passing along.  And because it's so high, you could be in a valley.  I mean, you could be really in a very remote area surrounded by mountains and still be able to get Internet access.

Start time: 1025.03
End time: 1041.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. No, selfishly.  I just want to put one of these little friendly red things on my truck because I'm driving around to these remote areas in New Zealand to take photos where there's no cell phone coverage.  So I have zero Internet.  The idea that I could just have the Internet floating above me all the time.  It's intoxicating.  It's awesome.

Start time: 1042.48
End time: 1045.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I see you're wearing your glass.  You wear it all the time?

Start time: 1046.16
End time: 1055.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not in the shower.  Good.  That's the line that I draw.  Yes.  No, I do wear it.  Actually, I find myself pulling out my cell phone very rarely.  Wow.  It's really...

Start time: 1056.74
End time: 1062.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No more of that emasculating, girly looking at your phone stuff.  You're going to wear those macho blue glasses.

Start time: 1062.24
End time: 1064.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I can pull them off.

Start time: 1065.44
End time: 1085.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hey, Trey, always good to talk to you.  Thank you for sharing that with us.  Watch Trey's site, StuckInCustoms.com, because in the next day or so,  there'll be a more technical description from behind the scenes.  I guess lots of blackboard, whiteboard chalk talks and so forth  about how this whole thing is supposed to work.  Yep, we'll get it up there.

Start time: 1086.30
End time: 1086.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thanks, Trey.

Start time: 1087.18

Start time: 1089.16
End time: 1285.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Great to talk to you again.  Take care.  Trey Ratcliffe, StuckInCustoms.com.  We're going to take a break when we come back.  E3 on the docket.  Of course, WWDC.  I have a little package from Apple here we might open.  And whatever else is in the news.  I guess we can talk about the NSA.  There seems to be more revelations, even more revelations about the NSA spying,  which seemed to confirm Steve Gibson's hypothesis.  On Wednesday, he says he figured it out.  He figured out what prison it was all about.  And I have to say, I've seen no evidence to counter what he says is going on,  and it's a little chilling.  We'll talk about that in a little bit.  Right now, our show brought to you by our friends at audible.com.  Yet another reason to have unlimited Internet,  so you can download great audiobooks everywhere.  Father's Day.  I forgot to say Happy Father's Day to Trey.  Happy Father's Day.  There's an audible section to send Dad on a listening adventure.  This would be a great Father's Day gift.  To sign Dad up for a bookstore with over 100,000 audiobooks.  Does Dad spend time in the car commuting, at the gym working out, washing dishes?  There's all sorts of reasons why I listen to audible.  Lots of times I want to listen or I want to read a book,  but I can't hold a book, so I listen.  And I love it.  When I go to bed at night now, I listen to audible.  Whenever I'm in the car, whenever I'm doing anything,  I've got audible going throughout the house.  I love it.  The audible apps that run on your smartphone, your iPhone, your Android device,  your Windows Phone, Windows 8.  My Sonos has audible.  Let me listen to all sorts of titles.  I'm a big audible fan.  We're going to give you a free audible account right now.  If you go to audible.com slash twit2, you can sign up for the platinum account.  That's two books a month or two credits a month.  It's basically two books.  And your first month is free.  You can get your first two books.  Cancel anytime in the first 30 days.  Pay nothing. Those books are yours to keep.  How about this?  I think it'd be time to re-listen to 1984.  They've got a new edition of 1984.  That's book number one.  What about that?  You can choose.  I just listened to The Great Gatsby because I saw the movie and I thought,  is this like the book?  It was.  A great rendition by Jake Gyllenhaal.  Is it Gyllenhaal or is it Jif?  How do you pronounce it?  All sorts of great stuff.  Julian Assange has a new book called Cipher Punks,  Freedom and the Future of the Internet.  Here's the problem.  Choosing two great books.  You've got to pick two.  Your first two are free though.  Audible.com.  How about this?  All the rave, the rise and fall of Sean Fanning's Napster.  That's got to be interesting to listen to.

Transcript:  It's our first E3 as a full-fledged site.  We were there last year.  We were publishing our content on the verge,  ramping up to launching our full site late last year.  But this year was our first E3 as a dedicated site,  as our own big editorial team.  It was pretty exciting.  It was probably the most exciting E3, I think.  I've been covering games for about seven years, maybe eight years.  A lot of the editors have been covering games for a little bit longer than that.  Most exciting E3 I think any of us have seen.  This is a really big, transformative time in games right now.

Transcript:  Well, primarily because of the new Xbox One and the PS4.  Both Microsoft and Sony had press conferences  where they talked more about the games than about the TV viewing.  And still that controversy kind of even more flamed about used games on Xbox One.  Sony put out that funny viral video in which the tutorial on how to share games with the PlayStation 4,  which basically involved, here, have a game.  So we also got the prices, $4.99 for the Xbox One, not a surprise.  Paul Therade said that's how much it was going to cost for a couple of months.  $3.99, $100 less for the PlayStation 4.  That's also not a surprise since it's a comparable device.  You take off Kinect, which is about $100. That makes sense.  Is that $100 difference going to make a difference to buyers come Christmas?  Or is the used game issue a big issue?  Or is it just a tempest in a teapot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think it's a tempest in a teapot.  I think the jury is really still out on what will make a difference this holiday season.  There's still a long way to go, and that's what Microsoft is telling us.  It's a long road to launch.  And the fact is they're still being cagey on exactly what the details will be for their used game policy.  They made some inflammatory suggestions.  I think a lot of their hard policies will be subject to change.  But to be honest, Sony's announcements weren't...  You know, they were received very well at E3.  There was a standing ovation on the floor of their press conference when they announced this,  which is practically unheard of. That just doesn't happen.  But I don't... You know, what they announced was essentially,  yeah, you can buy a game. You can buy a hard copy of a game.  You can give it to somebody else. We won't charge you for that.  We're not going to restrict that.  The console is not going to have to check in with the mothership every 24 hours via the Internet,  like the Xbox One has been announced to have to do.  But then they snuck in a little something about having to pay for PlayStation Plus to play multiplayer games online,  which was something they hadn't talked about previously, and they hadn't done previously.  And then they also announced that game publishers will be able to set their own policies  about how and when or if you will be charged for playing online or playing a used game or trading a game.  So really, their policy isn't entirely too much different from what Microsoft has...

Start time: 1470.38
End time: 1479.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, Microsoft's saying that the publishers get to choose what their used game policy is on their games,  even on the Xbox One. And that's what Sony's saying. They're just saying it from different directions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they can also decide that you may be able to buy a game, buy a hard copy of a game in a retail store,  in which case Sony has announced they won't charge you to play that game.  But EA could then say they will charge you for an online pass to play that hard copy online,  or once you download it onto the hard drive of the PS4, which some have suggested all games will need to be downloaded to the hard drive.  And once you do that, it's no longer a physical copy and then the rules can change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think so. I think there will always be a market for games that people want to grab.  There will always be a market for things that you can play without an internet connection.  But as far as the consoles are sort of the bleeding edge for the core gamers who aren't playing on the PC.  And that bleeding edge will always use the latest and greatest technology.  I think one of the reasons we haven't seen too much...  The C3 was very exciting because we got a lot of news about a lot of games that are coming out.  And they all seem very advanced and very exciting.  Games like Destiny and Titanfall are doing really exciting things,  merging multiplayer gaming with single-player gaming and creating interesting experiences.  We haven't been getting the details for those games until recently because they were tied directly to what the consoles were doing.  The technology built into the consoles, which has just been announced.  So I think it's kind of a double-edged sword.  People say they don't want to be always online, but then they use their always online connected devices to complain about that.  They say they don't want to...  They want to be able to take their console to grandma's cabin when they go on vacation.  But who really does that?  So a lot of the experiences that are coming out in terms of the games that people play,  which at the end of the day, both Microsoft and PlayStation have made a lot of noise  about being full living room integrated devices with downloadable movies, integration with Netflix and various other services.  But at the end of the day, games sell consoles.  And the games that are going to drive people to buy these consoles are the games that can provide the most interesting, innovative experiences.  And that is leading towards the internet.  So, you know, I think there's going to be an initial outcry.  I think once the policies sort themselves out in the next few months, they're going to look very similar.  I think at the end of the day, people will buy these consoles, whether they're online or not.  And that outrage will go away quickly.

Transcript:  You know, you get the sense looking at Microsoft that everyone who had any any idea how to talk to the public somehow went away.  They've really done a very poor job of enunciating their policies in a way that make them seem palatable.  In fact, there was a report, I think it was in the Military Times earlier this weekend saying that the Microsoft has single handedly alienated.  This is a quote. Microsoft has single handedly alienated the entire U.S. military because they're not online,  because you will require an online connection to play the Xbox one because the Kinect, which has a camera and a microphone, must always also be online.  So theoretically, this thing could be listening in on classified.

And these guys, you know, and I've heard people say that, you know, military bases, even some forward operating bases do have Internet connections.  And that's fine and fantastic. But you can't rely on that, obviously, in a compact zone.  You know, so these guys get a lot of joy and relaxation from playing their devices.  And when you put restrictions on those that make it difficult for them or even impossible or illegal for them to use it, then then you're asking for trouble.

Transcript:  I hadn't even thought of that.  I think one of the things people pundits were saying is, well, you know, as much as you hear the hardcore console gamers talk, they're not who drives the sales here.  Is that true?

Start time: 1739.50
End time: 1794.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not true now. It certainly hasn't been true for the last eight years.  The current console generation, those consoles were sold first and foremost to gaming.  It's gaming. I think you'll see more and more people who aren't part of the core crowd buying these devices.  You know, I think that the Xbox One has a lot of really cool integrated features for people who enjoy watching sports on television, who play fantasy football.  That looks cool. Yeah, it looks really great.  So I think they're trying to open those consoles up. And Microsoft has said since since day one with the original Xbox, they wanted it to be a Trojan horse.  They wanted it to be a living room device more than a game device.  And slowly they have been building it into something that could be reasonably called that.  I think the Xbox One really is.  It's an all in one solution for practically everything you would want to do from your couch.  And that's fine. But man, they need to first sell this to the core gamers because that's who that's who their evangelists and PS4 has no living room use.

Start time: 1795.78

Transcript:  I mean, it is a gaming box and nothing more.  Or it's funny because I bought the PS3 a lot of it because it had Blu Ray on it.  It was. That's right. Yeah, I got it.  I got gaming for free. It was a Blu Ray player.

Start time: 1807.36
End time: 1837.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was one of the cheapest Blu Ray. Yeah, very good one, too.  Yeah, the PS4 actually will have a lot of the same offerings that the Xbox One will have.  You'll be able to watch your movies.  You know, the PlayStation for the PlayStation 3's viewing capabilities and movie downloads has been roughly equivalent to the Xbox 360.  And I think you can expect the PlayStation 4 will also have a similarly robust living room solution.  You have to buy the camera extra if you want it to spy on you in your private moments.  I don't think a lot of people will do that, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't see how they would. I don't expect that to happen.  You'll still need the Xbox subscription. Yeah, the Xbox Gold.  That sucks.  But you'll need the PlayStation Plus just to play multiplayer games.  And up till now, we haven't heard anything from Microsoft that they will charge just to play multiplayer games,  although I imagine they will consider PlayStation's announcement to be permission to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, man.  You know, you just from the point of view of who's getting their message out and who's generating the most public goodwill,  you have to say Sony is the winner right now.  I mean, that standing on the show over the press conference, that was the game for them, at least today, E3.  It's still a long road to launch.  And like I said, I think most of the policies window being fairly similar at the end of the day.  But right now, Sony's got the goodwill on their side.

And that's, you know, a lot of people think that that's that's an admission they didn't really have a lot to talk about,  although they did announce some exciting games that got a lot of people excited about the Wii U for the first time since it was announced.  So I don't know about Nintendo.  You know, people people want to count them out because I think they they are definitely seeding a certain part of the game to Microsoft and Sony.  I don't think they see themselves as directly competitive competing with those two companies.  But, you know, it's still but they're still competing in terms of there being only so many hours in a day.  And, you know, in the same way that Indies compete with the larger game companies, you know, they're all looking for the same eyeballs  and the same amount of time and the same attention from people.  So I guess their goal is to is to try and do that a different way that they're tapping their leaning on their core franchise is very hard.  And I guess their hope is that people will want to play Mario enough that that they will buy that Wii U and buy that new Mario game.

Transcript:  I mean, at least, you know, I talked to a lot of indie game developers at E3 and people like to say there's really nobody doing platform gaming,  which is that style of Mario game.  Nobody doing platform gaming right now, except for the Indies and Nintendo.  And people obviously like that style of game and they like those characters.  You would just, you know, I think I think a lot of us who are hardcore games fans, we just wanted to see more from Nintendo.  It's been such a beloved company.  You know, a lot of people grew up with with the NES and those characters.  You just want to see them competing a little bit more strongly.  So a device like the Wii U, it's it's kind of confusing.  It's like Fisher Price, my first tablet.  You know, it's limited in a lot of ways.  It doesn't feel cutting edge and the availability of the games is very limited.

It's it's it's the little game console that could you know, there have been some some Ouya competitors announced.  Lots of people trying to put forth a cheap console solution tapping into the Android market.  It's an interesting thing.  I think it's definitely it definitely makes a statement about where these innovations in gaming can come from.  You have a lot of Indies, indie development driving that console.  And obviously, it's relatively inexpensive.  You can use it's not very hard to get your game in that marketplace.  And, you know, if you buy that console, you can you can play lots and lots and lots of games very easily and cheaply.  You know, the though it's it's honestly I don't think it's very well done.  I don't think it's a very solid solution.  I think it has a long way to go before it's going to be a competitor to to the Xbox.

So they wanted to play that down a little bit.  But they also had to kind of juggle the fact that people play games and have certain expectations,  whether they're realistic or not.  So you do have the option to deploy the dog in certain ways.  But for the most part, it's more of a snooping tool.

You like it?  I do like it. Yeah, I do like it a lot.  I think they are. I think the trick, though, I mean, you know, they do what they do.  They do it very well.  I think the trick with that game is going to be how well it delivers on some of the next gen promises they've made in terms of the connectivity  and some of the merging of the single player with the multiplayer gameplay and how well all that works.  Because, you know, there's no shortage of shooters.  There's no shortage of games.  This game is going to sink or swim based on some of those promises.  But I like it a lot. I think it looks really good. It's very exciting.  One of the coolest aspects of it is the ability to sort of seamlessly matchmaking.  You can go from playing a single player game to having friends drop in and help you out and have a co-op experience.  And that happens more or less seamlessly.  And that can drop in and out at any time.  And then you'll enter these public areas where all of a sudden you're playing an instance where anyone playing the same game in roughly the same area of the world can join in.  And you can all team up against enemies or to accomplish various other things.  They're being a little cagey about the details.  I think they wanted to get out this idea that the game morphs from single player to co-op to multiplayer.  And all of the technology, all the matchmaking is happening behind the scenes.  So there's no loading screen. There's no lobby. It just happens. Right.

They wanted you to be able to build your own character and make the choices of how he looked and how he played.  And I also get the sense that there was a feeling that the Master Chief character had kind of overwhelmed that franchise.  I think they want to allow the writers and the creators to have more freedom to do different things.  That's fair.

And then they pulled it back and they made it more Kinect again.  And then they pulled it back again.  So I think it was actually I misspoke.  It was originally not supposed to be a Kinect. And then it was Kinect.  It went back and forth.  What it looks like now is a weird kind of hybrid between a Kinect game and something else.  I think a lot of people are calling it a Kinect on Xbox One technology demo.  I think it looks very, very pretty.  I mean, the Crytek, they're the team behind Far Cry and Crysis, which has been known to make computers cry.  So I think it's going to be very, very pretty whether or not it's interesting, whether or not it's fun to play.  These are still open questions.

What we're hearing now is that they're going to start integrating more or less simple things that enhance the experience.  Imagine in a Splinter Cell game, for example, and this is not something that I know that they're doing,  but imagine, for example, if you could touch your temple and activate your night vision, right?  Or shake your head or do gestures like they do, like the soldiers do, like hand gestures to each other and like stop or ICNF.  Yeah.  Little things like that that they can layer on to the core experience of playing a game with a controller that I think would make a big difference.  It's bloody. Holy cow.  Oh, yeah.  Lots of neck stabbing.  Neck stabbing is still a big thing in games.  Very popular.  It was a big deal last year, very popular this year.  In the Call of Duty Ghost demo, there's a part where you're scaling the outside of a building like Batman.  You're scaling down the outside of a building and there's a dude on a window washing platform about nine floors down.  You can press a button and leap down and stab him in the neck and it's just exciting.  Great.  All the neck stabbing you could ever want.

Transcript:  You know, one of the coolest things I saw was Ninja Gaiden Z.  Ninja Gaiden is a...  With zombies?  No, you know, there may or may not be zombies, but the funny thing about it is that's a really hard game.  People enjoy it because it's hard and a ninja theme.  This one takes it in a little bit different direction.  They basically hired one of the creators of the Spec Ops game, Spec Ops The Line, which is a critically acclaimed game,  about the horrors of war, but they hired this guy and they basically said, have fun with it.  Take the franchise in whatever direction you want.  And he did.  And it's kind of silly and over the top and definitely not a traditional entry in that franchise.  I think if you're looking for something a little light and fun and exciting and deep, that'll be a good one for a lot of folks.

Transcript:  Well, we're getting into a place now where you're acquiring two and three hundred person teams  and ten to a hundred million dollars to create these games.  And you're seeing them still being sort of beat or matched by small, you know, ten to fifty person teams and making indie games.  I think a lot of the really exciting, ambitious stuff is happening in India right now.  And these AAA teams, they're really scratching their heads.  They're really trying to figure out what their extra hundreds of people and extra millions of dollars is actually getting them.  In a lot of cases, it's nothing.  So I think we're at a point in the industry where we really needed to see three with the new technology  and to be able to say that you have these large, expensive teams working with this new, exciting technology to do outstanding things.  But at the end of the day, it's a very scary time to make an expensive game.

Very in-depth coverage with a lot of a lot of gameplay video from E3.  If you want to know what happened, what the big games were, this is the place to go.  The console wars and so forth.  And I'm sure as the console wars develop, we'll talk to you again.  Maybe this Christmas time you can help me decide.  Actually, I pre-ordered the Xbox one.  I'm getting all of them.

Transcript:  I have this theory that, and I should have brought this up earlier, but that mobile is still eating away at the console.  Oh, it totally is.  Like WWDC, Apple is now the last platform where you can come in, stick your phone on a table,  grab a Bluetooth controller, AirPlay or HDMI to your TV, and just start playing games.

If you're Microsoft, you're smart because Kinect is something unique and different that can maybe bring that out.  And they had that, and I meant to ask Russ about this, they didn't show the Illumirom technology, but I love that demo.  I was expecting more of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Be honest, that's why I got the Xbox One, because I'm more interested in the TV integration, the smart glass, second screen stuff.  I like the NFL with the stats on the side.  I think for me, the games, I'm going to play a few times.  So it makes more sense to have a console that can do more.  Which I'll get all of them.  And in that case, Microsoft has won the perception racket, because as Russ pointed out, they're really pretty much identical in terms of that.  Yeah, absolutely.

Thanks to Trey Ratcliffe and to Russ Pitts for joining us.  Sticking around, Dieter Bohm from The Verge, our good friend Renee Richie from imore.com.  Lots more to talk about.  But first, let's take a break and talk about one of our sponsors with a unique product.  It's free.  Free free.  Like, it's just free.  And really the trick on this, and I think one of the reasons they're making it free,  is because it is hard to talk about what it does.  If you've ever, if you're in a big business where you know about big business intelligence,  you probably have this idea that, you know, in big business, they have big data,  they have huge data sets that they can parse, they can go through, they can predict the future.  It's really changed the way business is done in the U.S.  Wouldn't it be cool to have that kind of business intelligence for you, for your podcast,  for your small business, for your store?  Well, Sumall is bringing that exact idea down to earth free right now.  S-U-M-A-L-L dot com.  We've been using it at Twitter, and it really is incredibly useful for us.  We can tie in all the services we use.  So Google+, Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Instagram, they just added Amazon.  Actually, that's been there a while. MailChimp, AdSense, SendGrid, Basecamp, Bitly,  WordPress, Constant Contact, they've got Amazon, PayPal.  They're getting through the API, they're getting information from all of these services,  and then giving you a beautiful dashboard that shows you things like,  well, we're interested, for instance, when we plug our T-shirt on the show,  does it increase T-shirt sales?  When we do it on Twitter, what's the relationship between that, the show, and T-shirt?  All of this stuff is a really impressive example of big data  that you can put to work for yourself right now.  So with Sumall, you go to one place, you can see what's happening across your business.  You know, whatever business you're in, I think you're going to be very interested in this.  And it is free. They've added an export and spreadsheet view.  You could put projections into email.  In fact, they're adding features all the time, a dozen new features.  Sumall just passed a half trillion social impressions tract.  They're sucking all of that data in.  They've grown 30% in the last few weeks.  I think people are starting to learn about Sumall.  I hope you're learning about Sumall, and I hope you'll give it a try right now.  Go to Sumall.com, click Try Sumall, create an account, and I got to say it is free free.  It's not freemium. You will see some pricing.  I think there's still some pricing on the website.  That's just maybe some idea of what it might cost someday.  But for right now, you don't even give them a credit card.  It's just, I don't even know how they're paying for this ad.  It's free, and it's great.  I just think that actually it's a good friend, Anthony Kasellana, who was, I'm sorry, not Anthony Kasellana, Dane, who was at the start of Squarespace.  I think he just believes in this, and he just figures, we'll figure it out.  We'll make it happen.  Are you a YouTube channel, Chad? You should be using this.  Get your YouTube metrics together with your social media campaigns to see what works.  Wouldn't you like to know when it's best to tweet about a new video, to correlate Google+, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram to your YouTube video views?  You can do all of that.

Start time: 3110.72
End time: 3123.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you can, yeah, the best part about it is that all of those services are plugged in.  I don't use just one service. I might have analytics on something, but not everything.  And so it's really nice that everything can be plugged into Sumall.

They do not resell your data. Your data is secure. The data is private.  It is a great service. And all I can say is try it.  Sumall.  Wish Dane all the best because I think he's really doing great.  No, there will be no nudity on this show.  That's my promise to you.  I was looking forward to it.  I would say fully closed at all times.  Bit of a bid and switch.  I make no promises.  I got a bag.  I got a couple of things from Apple.  Look at this.  So WWDC was on Monday.  Renee, you were there.  Did you go?  I was not there.  I was in the city.  You looked across the bay and you saw all the people flocking to Moscone.  There is the hall.  What do you think that is?  If I didn't show you a logo.  Yeah.  Or it could be a freezer thing.  It's got an Apple at the top and an Apple at the bottom.  And on the back, this is the new Airport Extreme with 802 to 11 AC.  Why did I buy this? No one knows.  Because I could.  You can't wait for AD.  Yeah, because that's going to be the future.  In about three months it's obsolete.  They say it's because of the antennas.  But you know what's interesting in here?  iFixit did a teardown.  I should show the teardown because there's a big gap in the middle where you put your hard drive.  So this would be the same unit as the time capsule unit, but they put a hard drive in it.  What I wasn't clear about didn't look like there was a SATA connector.  Is there a way I can connect the hard drive in there?  Or do I have to buy it from Apple?  You might have to buy it from Medi-Fixit.

Start time: 3242.30
End time: 3247.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, no SATA connector, but how are you with the soldering iron?  How do you feel with the soldering?  And then I was really pleased because that came today.  And then I was really pleased to see this also.  We sent somebody over to the Apple store and we're very excited about what we got here.  This is something a lot of us professional users have been waiting for.  The new Mac Pro is here.  And look at that.  You see the cooling?  It goes right through the top and comes down right through the bottom.  Actually, I had to make this up.  This is not.  It's a bunch of gaffer's tape.  But I had to make it up because what I think you don't get right away with the pictures of the Mac Pro is its dimensions.  This is roughly true to dimensions.  That's the scale.  It's almost the scale.  It's about this much off.  It's about half an inch off.  So that is pretty amazing.

You're going to have soldered in SSD drives running on the PCI-3 bus, right?  Absolutely.  You're going to have sticks of RAM.  The only upgradable piece would be to take out the old RAM and put in very expensive, higher density RAM.  And two video cards also soldered onto the motherboard.  It is not upgradable.  It is changeable.  It is what it is.  That's why I call it the world's most expensive home theater PC.

What a pro wanted was a new cheese grater with his new Xeon chip in it and a Thunderbolt port.  So that's what the pro wanted.  They don't look at this.  It's under their desk.

Transcript:  And this is also a way to attempt technology that's going to filter down to the rest of their products, which is not something unprecedented.  I mean, the MacBook Air, the first one was horribly flawed, but eventually it led to the one Dieter's using that's fantastic.  And those technologies permeated the MacBook Pro and all their other technology.

Transcript:  All right. So they announced the new MacBook Airs as well.  Two of them, an 11 inch and a 13 inch using the new Haswell.  That's pretty much the difference. It's using the fourth generation Intel processor, which gives them...  Pardon me? Second microphone.  And the array mics that the Retina made famous, which I've never really noticed.  OK. I thought interesting that they claim battery life on the 11 inch of nine hours and 12 hours on the 13.

Transcript:  I'm getting the 13. I'm super excited about the battery life.  This thing maybe gets me two hours. It's two years old.  I think that the Retina MacBook now, I think the performance still isn't where it ought to be.  So why would I want that here?  I want just make it last forever.  Once you get Retina hashed out, then you can bring it down to here.  But 12 hour battery life, if I can realistically...  They say 12. If I can realistically get eight, I'll be on cloud nine.  I'll be on cloud nine.

End time: 3821.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Which Apple pioneered with PowerNap.  And I'm curious what's new in the new coalescing features.  But this does...  And this is what Haswell supposedly supports in hardware as well.  It's a big issue on all mobile devices, and I guess on a portable laptop too,  which is that I know on these Android phones they're waking up all the time,  even when the screen's off, and that just kills your battery life.  First thing I do on an Android phone now is disable Facebook,  because Facebook will call home every five minutes.

Transcript:  And that's what they announced for iOS too,  is that they're going to intelligently do all the multitasking.  And it was very interesting, because they could have pissed off a lot of developers  saying, we're taking over multitasking, don't you worry about it.  But they said, developers love server-side smarts.  So we're going to wait, we're going to see.  If you have a good signal, we'll do stuff.  If something is waking the GPS and other people want it,  and they're doing the same thing with OS X as they're doing with iOS,  and that is just putting everything into the smallest profile they possibly can.

But he did...I forgot what his good line was.  He did get a couple of good lines off.  Well, one is he said we're not going to delay OS X because we've run out of big cats.

Status board.  Status board.  Yeah.  Little pricey. It's like 20 bucks.  But the idea is you can put modules in for any kind of information.

So, if you're Lightroom and you've got a major upgrade, you either just give it away,  which is why by the way, Adobe, I bought Lightroom in the app store so they're going to close  that off for me, or you have to charge them full prices if it's a whole new app.

I can't imagine they didn't think of this use case, but it seems so obvious that it's  not just going to happen overnight and people need to get paid upgrades.  Yeah, absolutely.  Tell me, Rene, I'm at a loss.  It's commoditized software.

I feel like this is absolutely clear.  Apple's going down the same road they went with Jobs Left the first time.  They're falling apart.  It's things like that.  Steve would have figured it all out and had a plan and a path.  It's like they're throwing crap against the wall at this point.  I just feel like they have completely lost their mojo.

It seems to me all Apple did was focus on a really ugly color palette, but you could debate that.  That's a matter of taste.  And not really do much at all to improve OS.

Start time: 4465.22
End time: 4496.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What they did...  I think the unfortunate color palette has taken all the attention away from the stuff that they did do.  And what they kind of did is...  The interface is actually completely different.  They got game developers to come in and build a physics engine, a particle engine.  Really?  They turned the entire operating system into an object that you can now manipulate in 3D space.  That's cool.  It's mapped around cylinders.  Why didn't they talk about that?  And the fact that I think that this was such an early beta...  This was probably the earliest iOS beta we ever got, and it's not complete.  They didn't have time to get an iPad version done.

And I'm much more confident in them fixing the palettes and rendering the icons and finishing the apps  than I would be if the 3D engine and particle effects and the new interactions were broken.

And it birthed the gaming industry on iOS.  Just by happenstance.  And this new one, they rolled a bunch of the stuff they built for the interface into new gaming code.  You can get a lot of the gaming stuff for free now.  And I like that they're continuing to gamify iOS.  There's apps in there that I don't think they've shown off yet that are literally like playing games.  The entire thing is enjoyable and delightful in a visceral way that iOS wasn't before.  And they could fail.  Absolutely could fail at realizing it by the time they launch.  But they still have three or four months to clean it up and make it coherent enough that it works.

Transcript:  No, well, my feeling is, again, like last year, Maps took up so much time and space that they didn't have time to do a lot of other stuff.  They did do tons of API stuff, like collection views last year.  This year, this whole interface, I mean, they started this eight months ago when Scott Forrestal left, and they've been sprinting to near exhaustion to get this done.  And they didn't finish on time.  And this is not a beta.  People think beta like Google or beta like, oh, it's a sneak preview of what they're going to release in the fall.  This is a very hot beta.  It's going to change and change.

Transcript:  Do you genuinely believe that they're going to go in and radically change the look and feel of the icons in this color palette?  Because if so, this is how it's going to look.  Yeah, if they're going to change it, then we all need to hunt down some crows and bring them over to Apple so that they can eat them.  Because they've got this on their website, big giant.  I agree with you.

Start time: 4743.16
End time: 4772.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I agree with you.  And again, the thing I heard back at Macworld was that it was going to make a lot of fans of rich texture design cry.  And it absolutely did that.  But that is something that's fixable.  This Apple seems like the previous Apple seems like once Steve Jobs made a decision, this icon has to be bluer.  That's the icon it was, even if they were much better icons.  This Apple can change.  And I think that they put this out and they're listening.  And if you look at the photos icon, it's a done icon.  If you look at some of the other icons, they look like wireframes to me still.

Start time: 4773.53
End time: 4797.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'll tell you why they can't.  Because they have just told every app developer in the world, fix your app, make it this palette, make it look like this.  And they're working really hard because current apps look crappy in this new iOS.  And so if I'm an app guy, I'm immediately changing my design.  And if then Apple in three months says, oh, never mind, that's going to be really a mess.

Start time: 4798.42
End time: 4824.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A lot of developers initial action was screw you.  I'm not changing my design at all.  I'm not doing this.  But the reaction, one of the key principles of this design, like one is clarity.  And I don't think they've achieved that.  The other is deference.  And there's they actually want to get out of the way of your content, but they want to get out of the way of your apps.  They said, like, if you want to make a green felt app, please do.  We'll get out of your way and it'll be the best looking green felt app you've ever seen.  So they are they don't they don't necessarily want anyone to look at the way that they look.  There is no felt. That's one good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  A very nice air-cooled hat.  Paul was very funny on that.  We will talk about what Steve Gibson, I think, did deduce, and I think accurately, about the NSA spying program.  In fact, there are some more revelations today that confirm what he said on Security Now earlier this week.  That's coming up in a little bit.  First, a word from Stamps.com.  If you are in a business, you know that a lot of time is wasted.  A lot of money is wasted dealing with the post office time, driving there, parking, getting in there.  And if you're buying a postage meter...  You know, I didn't know this.  Postage meter ink can be as much as 100 times more expensive than inkjet ink, which is already too expensive.  Stamps.com eliminates the postage meter, lets you print your own U.S. postage from your computer, your printer.  Use a laser printer. It's cheaper.  And it prints right on the envelopes, if you want, with not just the stamp, the indicia for the stamp, but your company logo, the return address.  It could pull addresses out of your computer's address book, your QuickBooks.  If you sell on Amazon, eBay, Etsy, PayPal, pull it right from there.  It does so much more than just licking and putting a stamp on an envelope or a package.  It will help you choose the right class of mail as well.  Stamps.com is postage on demand 24-7, whenever your business needs it.  If you do a lot of mailing in business, this is so much better.  You'll save up to 80% over a postage meter.  You never have to go to the post office again.  Actually, the post office comes to you. They love Stamps.com.  They'll pick up any package. You schedule a free pickup.  You can do things you can do with Stamps.com you can't do at the post office.  Stamps.com is always open.  Import addresses from your address book.  You can use cost codes in Stamps.com to attract postage spending by a specific customer or a specific department.  Automatic address verification because you're online, right?  It even offers discounts you don't get at the post office.  Discounts on package insurance too in just one click.  No more handwriting forms.  It'll print out your certified mail, your return receipt, your international customs form automatically.  I might just go on and on.  Plus, that great USB scale.  I got mine here.  This is worth carrying around. That is a sweet little piece of brushed aluminum.  That thing, you plug that into the computer and Stamps.com knows exactly how much postage.  Here's the deal. Go to Stamps.com.  Stamps.com right now.  You'll see an $80 special offer on the front page with $25 in free postage.  Forget it.  Click the microphone.  Enter our offer code TWIT.  That $80 bonus turns into a $110 bonus.  $55 in free postage at Stamps.com.  I want you to take advantage of this right now.  Visit Stamps.com.  Click the microphone.  Enter the offer code TWIT.  You'll get free postage.  You'll get the postage, the scale.  You just pay shipping and handling on that.  It's around five bucks.  You'll get a supply kit and a month's free.  Stamps.com.  Now, if you're just mailing your Christmas card list, you don't need Stamps.com.  But if your business is doing mailing of any kind, be a postage pro.  Use Stamps.com.  We thank them for their support of TWIT.  I'm glad that you agree with me, Dieter, that the iOS is ugly.  Because at first I looked at it and I thought maybe it's me.

Start time: 5339.77

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 5344.60
End time: 5356.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they tweaked iOS 5 and iOS 4.  They did tweaks like lock screen notifications and things changed.  And the textures behind things changed as the betas came out.  But again, this is not the old previous Apple, which is what's giving me more hope.

Start time: 5357.16
End time: 5397.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There are some wins here.  As I said on our coverage of WWDC, Apple did three things here.  It played catch-up in a lot of respects, notifications, and the control center.  That's Android catch-up.  It copied in some cases.  The notification center looks a lot like Android.  Everything's remixed.  And there is innovation here as well.  So they did all three and probably in roughly equal measure.  Photos is great.  Nobody could do this but Apple.  The new photo gallery has thumbnails, little tiny ones, of your whole year.  Like iPhoto, they're now organizing by the metadata.  So it could be date, time.  Android's galleries, in fact, the HTC One's gallery does that quite nicely.  And everything is so spatially aware.

End time: 5423.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The question is, is this design, and we could get into really nerdy stuff about font weights and what not.  Is the design like in an uncanny valley where it's almost great, but then it falls into this weird space.  And if they just tweak around the edges and fix a color palette, it's going to be amazing.  Or is it just kind of going to be in no matter how much tweaking around the edges they do.  I want to point something out.

Transcript:  I want to say no.

Start time: 5434.24
End time: 5458.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it is not an uncanny valley.  If you look at the the screenshots, let's just focus on gradients of blue.  You have three different types.  The weather goes from dark blue to light blue, but then the app store goes from light blue to dark blue.  The videos go from a teal to a darker blue.  Right.  Well, that's what I'm saying is if they fix that inconsistency.  Look at photos in Game Center.  It's like Game Center.  Like everything is flat except for Game Center, which is shiny.

Start time: 5458.32
End time: 5462.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 5463.18
End time: 5483.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So this is a photo from Dribble of someone who redesigned it.  I like the Dribble image.  Where it has more white space.  Gradients are consistent.  Also, look at the app store icon or the iTunes store icon.  You have the weirdest looking musical note you've ever seen.  But in the in the redesign one, it's an actual music note, which you would expect to see on an icon.

Start time: 5483.20
End time: 5491.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 5513.16
End time: 5520.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's also I mean, it's not good.  I mean, sometimes they have yellow on white and sometimes there's no contrast.  I mean, there's a lot of basic tenants of visual design that they did not follow for this.

Start time: 5521.24
End time: 5575.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But I do have to point out that one of the reasons you change design is to make the old design look old and to sell new phones.  If you don't have and I think we're rapidly entering that era where there's not a lot new to do.  You have to make some differentiation when when Detroit got in that situation with cars, they put fins on them.  Doesn't do anything, but it makes the old car, the old finless car look old fashioned.  Absolutely. So this could just be fins.  I just want the fins to look a little nicer.  They aren't the nicest.  But neither, you know, some of those fins, their wire mesh fins at this point.  Yeah, well, maybe and maybe that's it.  You know, I'll grant I'll give you that.  I hope you're right.  I do think radio is great.  They only gave it a few minutes.  But Apple apparently did make the deals with the records companies as we had presumed they would.  It's part of iTunes desktop Mac desktop Windows and iOS.  You've got curated playlists.  You've got automatically generated Pandora style.

Now it's US only right now, but that's not that's not Apple's fault.  That's the record.  It's really painful.  Yeah, this is another tumble log.  Johnny Ives redesigns things.  He takes all these all these normal designs.  We're familiar with like the Mercedes logo there.  That's good. Plants versus zombies coming soon.  Leo. Yeah, plants versus zombies, too.  Looks good. Time travel.  Looks fun. Yeah.  All right. That's enough of that.  You're making me sick.  It's like the Easter Bunny threw up all over it with I'm trying to find good things.  AirDrop. Yeah.  Don't have to connect it anymore.  I can just drag and drop files from me to you.  Don't have to bump. No more bumping.  The weather app is beautiful.

Transcript:  Yeah. Well, they arguably still have to do some catch up on.  They didn't go that far.  They didn't do that much at all.  No. They had new voices. So you have a few new voices, a new interface.  It ties in now to a few more services.  But we discussed this on MacWheat. They're still bound to their Nuance deal.

I guess now the sessions, if you're a developer, you have the same restrictions.  Absolutely.  You can't talk about it.  We don't really kind of know, but it's good to know that the developers were excited by what they saw.  We don't know what it was.

Transcript:  All right.  Well, we'll watch with interest.  And, you know, I'll buy all their crap anyway.  I don't care.  I want to believe.  I want to believe!  All right, we're going to talk about the NSA.  I think Steve Gibson on Wednesday, he had...  And if you haven't seen it, he had an excellent security now.  When he started, he said, Leo, I think I figured out what's going on.  And I don't know.  I said...  I was very skeptical because I thought, well, nobody can talk about it because you're enjoined by the Patriot Act that if you will get a national security letter, you can't say anything.  So I think we don't know.  He said, well, listen.  And at the end of it, I thought he makes a good case.  So we'll talk about that in just a little bit.  And now that there is more and more going on, there's more stories coming out.  Declan McCullough had a very scary story today in the CNET.  We'll talk about that in just a second.  Before we do, though, let's get one more ad in here so that I can buy all that Apple crap.  This is Go To My PC from Citrix.  Go To My PC is, I got to say, I use it all the time.  Citrix is really starting to put together an array of apps for business that are just with Go To Meeting, Go To My PC, Podio, Share File.  I keep saying to them, guys, you got to make a suite.  This is all great stuff.  Go To My PC means you can leave the office.  Now you may say, well, what do you mean?  All right.  Before you leave, put Go To My PC on Mac or PC.  And now wherever you are at home, at the pool with the kids, you can access your office computer and even from an iPhone, an Android phone, an iPad.  You could accessing Windows 8 on an iPad is just kind of mind blowing.  It's fast. It works well.  It is the ultimate remote access.  Totally secure. It uses SSL.  So your transactions are completely encrypted.  In fact, I know a lot of people use Go To My PC so that they can use their iPad at an open access spot, say at an Internet cafe and feel like they're secure, which they are, because the traffic is completely encrypted going right back to the office.  It's very easy to use.  You can run any program.  You can access any network resource.  You can send and receive email.  Even if you don't have an app on your phone, you could run that app via Go To My PC on your computer at work.  It's very easy to try.  In fact, I've got a good deal for you.  30 days free.  No, just go to GoToMyPC.com.  The apps are always free.  Click the Try It Free.  Do this on your office computer.  Click the Try It Free button, enter the promo code TWIT and then install it on your office computer.  You won't need the IT guy to come over.  You don't need to punch a hole in a firewall.  It uses NatTraversal.  So it works perfectly well in every environment.  It is a great solution.  Go To My PC.  Citrix invented remote access.  They actually licensed it back to Microsoft.  They are the kings of this.  And for many years now, Go To My PC has been the simplest, easiest and best way to access your computer, Windows or Mac.  GoToMyPC.com.  Use the offer code TWIT for 30 days free.  So Steve's...  This is interesting.  We're seeing more and more about the NSA, about prison.  We talked a lot about it last week.  According to Declan McCullough, the NSA disclosed in a secret Capitol Hill briefing  that they have many, many people at the NSA who can listen in to any phone call without a warrant.  The analyst at the NSA just says, yeah, I want to hear that.  If the NSA wants to, writes Declan, if the NSA wants to listen to the phone, an analyst's decision is sufficient without any other legal authorization required.  This is revealed by a congressman who serves on the House Judiciary Committee.  It's worse than we thought, frankly.  The evidence is strong that they are collecting all electronic transmissions inside and out of the US.  The NSA is not supposed to listen in to calls that are just US to US.  Apparently they do and they can.  Emails, instant messages, text messages.  Phone calls.  Everything you do on the Internet.  Steve was trying to reconcile the notion that these companies like Google and Facebook just blanket denial.  No, they don't have access to our servers.  With what people like Edward Snowden and now others are saying, yeah, we can see everything.  We can watch people type.  Steve supposes, and I think he's probably right, given...  In order to understand this, you have to understand a little bit about how the Internet works.  I think that's probably why members of Congress haven't really sus to this yet.  They're starting to.  All companies, Google, Facebook, and just like you, have to connect to the Internet.  They may have multiple points of connection.  They may have multiple Internet service providers, but they have Internet service providers.  These big Internet service providers are most likely the ones who are being wiretapped right at the connection to Google.  Google doesn't know or has no way of monitoring this.  It's after Google, but really before the public Internet.  It's exactly what the NSA was doing at AT&T.  They were wiretapping AT&T so that WorldNet users, ISP users for WorldNet, all the traffic into and out of their computers was monitored by the NSA.  It's also clear with the NSA building a giant facility in Utah capable of storing five zettabytes of data that they are in fact storing all this stuff.  What's become clear is they're not necessarily sifting through it or listening at any given time, but they're storing it.  Should a time come that they wanted to find out what is that Rene Ritchie doing when he visits the United States, they can go through it.  Steve's argument was absolutely compelling to me.  He even says, look, that's why they named it PRISM.  What does a PRISM do? It splits light.  They're splitting the fiber optic cables.

Transcript:  You don't even have to assume that they're doing it really close to these big companies.  Even if it's the most innocent, innocuous situation where they're just doing it on the pipes going out of the country.  May East and May West or whatever.  Even in that case, they're still catching so much stuff that's just internal to the U.S.

Start time: 6480.18
End time: 6572.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I asked Steve, why would they do it so close to Google?  He said, well, because then they can do a subpoena.  Let's say they see some traffic that's suspicious.  They could say, well, on February 13th, between the hours of this and this, we saw this traffic from this IP address.  Who was that?  Now Google now has to respond to this national security letter, and they now have identified it exactly.  So there's a reason to say, oh, well, we know where this came from exactly.  I suppose you could do that at any point on the backbone.  Here's why I find it disturbing.  We've seen time and time again the U.S.  government using any pretext.  Once they've got somebody they want to arrest, let's say they find something on Renee.  Now they can go back and say, well, let's find more stuff.  And the laws are so loosely written, I'll give you a good example.  This is how they went after Aaron Schwartz.  It is a federal crime to violate a website's term of service.  That's a felony.  I'm sure you do it all the time.  If you've ever made up a name on Facebook, you violated their terms of service.  All those kids 13 years old and under who are Facebook members, guess what?  You've committed a federal crime.  Now all they have to do, they want to get you, Dieter.  Let's say, let's go back and see what that Dieter has been up to.  And now they can, there's so many, you know, stupid crimes they could get you.  They add that to the list.  Right.  And I just don't think we can trust the government to do this responsibly.  Dianne Feinstein, apparently the chairman of the committee knows about this.  Our senator here from California.  She's not been very forthcoming on this.

Start time: 6572.30
End time: 6588.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, we've got problems multiplied on top of problems.  So whatever the actual surveillance is, is a problem.  But then the fact that keeping what that surveillance is a secret multiplies it.  So there's no conversation.  Right.  So we not only do not know what they're doing, but the fact that we don't know is making it worse.

Start time: 6589.38
End time: 6617.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Dianne Feinstein, who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee, acknowledged the agency's analysts have the ability to access the content of a call.  I mean, it's clear now.  Without warrant that the NSA and other federal agencies can listen to any call.  And all it requires is some low-level analysts to say, and by the way, there are thousands of them, I'd like to hear this one.  You don't think they're listening in to all sorts of traffic just for fun.

Transcript:  The sheer volumes of data.  Well, that's what doesn't protect us because now, and that's the I guess that's kind of to me the point is they saw it all.  Yeah.  And then they just wait until they want to get somebody.  I think what you're going to see, and Declan backpedaled a little bit, although I don't think materially, is you're going to see a lot of threats coming out of the federal government.  You know, if you get a national security letter, you can't talk about it.  Facebook, remember, asked for the right to say how many of the government requests were NSLs.  And Google's been doing this for a while, has mushed in with all the other data.  The feds are going to fight this.

Start time: 6672.52

This doesn't help anybody because we can't figure out how many are actually FISA.  We already do everything else.  So we're not taking part.  And then Twitter sided with Google.

But I just think this is so important.  I would go to the EFF page, EFF.org, where they call for action and they give you ways to act.  Stop mass surveillance.  Tell Congress you should.  We said this last week.  It's even more urgent now.  You should tell your member of Congress.  This is not OK.  They will help you.  Just enter your zip code.  It'll tell you who to write to.  Postal service is good.  Mail it or call them.  You want to.  They need to identify that you're actually a constituent before they'll take it seriously.
