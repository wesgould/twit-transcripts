Transcript:  It's a secret and so that's good news. We can you know, I take we could breathe again  And then there's some sad news  after  80 36 years as host of Jeopardy  Alex Trebek passed away today at the age of 80 as you know, he had cancer announced it on the show continued to do the show  I understand there are new jeopardy is going through Christmas  And then I don't know what they'll do they'll have to do reruns I guess I  I think from now on we're gonna answer all questions all all answers will come in the form of questions on this show  in honor of Alex Trebek  We miss him I was talking to our photography guide who lives in Germany  Chris Marquardt, he said oh, yeah, I heard about Alex Trebek. I said, did you watch Jeopardy?  No, we don't get in Germany, but everybody knows Alex Trebek all over the world. He said  Yeah, it's an institution. He said at the chaos computer club when they're  Arranging the chairs to make more room getting everybody to you know, defrag the the room  Everybody does the jeopardy theme?  So I guess yeah, it's kind of universal that's in Berlin that's kind of universal so Dan you're gonna be busy  We're all gonna be a little bit busy on Tuesday Apple is having its one more thing event. Oh boy  Apples going on longer than the 2020 presidential election. This is an endless supply of Apple news  it's expected especially because the  AR invite had an Apple going up like a laptop lid that they will be announcing laptops

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Almost certainly based on Apple silicon, right? Yeah, I mean that that seems to be the big thing  That's left for them to talk about this fall  They've already revamped the iPhones the iPads the home pod pretty much everything  So the Mac is about the only thing left in their lineup and the Apple silicon rumors have been  Running pretty fast and furious for a while now and you know, it there's a certain logic to it  obviously they switched to Intel 15 years ago and  They  You know have been increasingly moving more and more of their critical infrastructure under their own roof  So since they're building all these great processors for iOS devices  It seems only logical that they'd want to bring them over to the Mac as well  I mean it seems like the potential for huge gains is really significant  So I'm excited to see this I've been waiting for this for a long time  And I think we're gonna be pretty blown away by what they have to offer is in a way

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This seems like a new era the end of an era with Apple Intel  but Intel itself has been struggling not just on the Apple platform even Microsoft's looking at arm and  certainly data centers are looking to arm and  You know Nvidia  For their processors you have to wonder if this is the beginning of the end for Intel. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Think they could dig stuff out  I would never bet against them because they are so big and they have such a deep bench  But they definitely that their miss in terms of mobile was a really big deal, right?  they never really competed in mobile platforms and  They were sort of bound to the desktops and laptops and I think that it has done a lot of damage to them  And they've tried to dig themselves out of that hole and they have not had a lot of success with it  so  as the sort of  Influence of the desktop and laptop computer starts to wane a bit and people are more and more using tablets and smartphones to do  everything in their lives  Intel and to a lesser extent AMD have both, you know suffered I think as a result of that

Start time: 468.02
End time: 513.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Intel most definitely it certainly has it's a big company and  Probably has a lot of patents and intellectual property, but they're also saddled with  10-billion dollar  Chip fabs that are becoming less and less valuable by the minute  I have to wonder that's Ben Thompson's contention  He said this two years ago that Intel's big mistake was both designing the chips and making them  that's exactly what arm does not do and that  They got locked into their platform because they built so many fabs  So many giant fabs and then it turned out their platform couldn't deliver first with  Itanium  The new IA 64 platform which they abandoned and then finally they couldn't get down to the 10 nanometer process

Start time: 513.94
End time: 594.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Meanwhile Apple's chips are five nanometers. Yeah. Yeah, I mean hard to argue there and especially because  Apple has really pushed the envelope in terms of what they're doing with their silicon on the iOS side that  You know, I think that  They were always frustrated in Cupertino for dealing with the fact that they had to be locked into Intel schedule  right and like Intel would come out with new chips on their very specific roadmap and  Apple always felt a little bit like it was straining at the bit there and  trying to push their their computers faster or forward and  The problem was that they just couldn't you know  They had to wait for Intel and being bound to any other company for Apple, especially for something that's that important  It just I think it drives them crazy inside and like I think that's a long-standing philosophy  Coming from those days when they were really teetering on the edge of you know  Bankruptcy and being you know, essentially dissolved as a company was the fact that they had to be  Beholden to some other company in order to produce their devices  So I think they've kind of if you look at their trend line over the last 20 years  It's all about bringing more and more stuff in-house and doing more and more stuff, you know  designing building everything from the ground up as much as possible under their own control because frankly  They're control freaks

Start time: 596.46
End time: 658.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  None of you are old enough to remember but I remember very well the same exact problem  The same tensions between Intel and Microsoft remember in interviewing Andy Grove 20 some years ago  The CEO at the time of Intel who was just bitching and moaning about Bill Gates and Microsoft saying, you know  Here we are. We're making these 32-bit chips and these stupid windows is still 16-bit there  There is something to be I mean there's there's  Pluses and minuses but there is something said for making both the hardware and the software  That's what Steve Jobs always said actually it goes back to Alan Kay who said, you know  You really want to make a great computer you need to make both you have to have you have to own both sides of the equation  Unfortunately or fortunately for Intel anyway  Microsoft couldn't break up with Intel Microsoft wasn't in a position to say okay all you PC makers stop using Intel  They didn't make the hard. They just made the operating system  So there was this natural tension that never did get resolved  And now you know, it's maybe too late for Intel

Start time: 659.71
End time: 692.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  well  Good you bring it up now because almost seems like a Microsoft and Intel combo would be really interesting down the line, but  To what you guys are saying. Do you guys remember?  Yeah, where were you when the Intel switch was announced for Apple because I was working in IT and I just looked at that  Oh my god  Everything I just have built and supported is no is not gonna work anymore  So I'm really worried for IT people right now because this is it's not even just you know x86 x86  It is it's a completely different switch. It's to arm. Yeah, everything's that

Start time: 693.42
End time: 768.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Literally the beginning of my tech journalism career was in  2006 so it was literally at the moment that transition happened  I was getting I was just starting out writing for the Mac user blog at Macworld and  Yeah, I know I think it's a big deal  But I think what Apple has proved is that over the time they have done more transitions than anybody in  Computing right they have not only gone from you know, they used to run a Motorola chips in the classic days  They went to power PC then we had the software transition going from the classic Mac OS to Mac OS 10 and now they're transitioning  You know, they would transition the Intel now  To their own silicon chips like if anybody has got this down to sort of a science, it's definitely Apple  And so yeah, there's gonna be impacts for sure  I think the biggest question that everybody's waiting to hear is whether or not Apple's gonna decide to do something about virtualization  So running Windows on your Mac, for example, right?  That was a huge sell of of switching to the Intel processors was like you can boot into Windows  You can run virtualization and virtualize Windows. How is that gonna work on an Apple silicon processor?  I mean like what kind of emulation is gonna have to happen there if any is it gonna be feasible at all?  Are they gonna be able to run, you know, maybe the ARM variant of Windows  There's some licensing issues at play there as I understand it  So a lot of questions there for people who depend on that as like critical workflow

Start time: 770.14
End time: 776.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, also makes me worried about games because Mac has never been a great platform for games and now it's good good luck

Start time: 776.74
End time: 786.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good luck, but now but built of something. Yeah, iOS apps run natively now and iOS is a great platform for games  So it's kind of a weird situation for them. Yeah, I know I agree

Start time: 788.00
End time: 800.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's constantly frustrating as a longtime Mac user  I wish that I could be able to play any games on this device  But no, I must stick to my switch or a PC if I want to use Steam

Transcript:  Apple's so hostile to triple-a gaming that they basically kicked the most profitable game of our generation off fortnight  They you know  It really act like whatever yeah, but they have Apple Arcade a five buck a month subscription all you can eat a hundred games  They're all kind of casual games, but maybe Apple says some of them are pretty good

Start time: 822.18
End time: 841.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like I'll say this about Apple Arcade and I wrote this up in gadget  Like it is it is sort of an antidote to where mobile gaming is now right because Apple Arcade  They had to do it for that reason. Yeah. Yes. Yeah, there's no an app purchases  It's all like it's pretty much all you can eat, but some are really complex deep narrative games  So it's not just like the casual stuff. There's a lot of cool stuff in there

Start time: 843.22
End time: 851.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple's history with gaming is so weird. I think fundamentally I would argue they've never gotten gaming  You have a way that they for a while they were gonna make a gaming platform

Transcript:  Given current events. Yes, very soothing. Yeah, I have a shameful admission to make I  Was all excited about buying the Xbox Series X or a PlayStation 5  Then I noticed the switch was available again  Because you couldn't get it for a while during quarantine  So I bought a switch and I thought oh because I wanted to play Hades, but they thought I should try Animal Crossing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's and there's and there's scammers there's turnips scammers. Oh, yeah  What a world it's a crazy thing in having played Pokemon go when it came out  I saw how nuts people went and there were all those sites just like you said Dan where they figured everything out  you know, oh you need this to do this and this and and  Animal Crossing it's the same, you know, I was talking to Laurie Gilch said oh you need this app and this app and here's the site  And you know, you can track the stock prices and figure out when to send you sell your turnips  I feel very fortunate. I sold them on Wednesday by Friday the market had crashed so I got  a

Transcript:  Return of the Oprah din next  My answer up until it came to switch for a game that I'd wanted to plan Mac but couldn't it is  technically an insurance adventure with minimal  So too, but it's much more interesting than that sounds

Start time: 1056.12
End time: 1063.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Looks and feels like a classic Mac game from like the 80s basically and  I ended up playing on my Xbox for the same reason as Paris. I can't play it on my Mac. So

Start time: 1070.38

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're an insurance adjuster  This ship  Came to shore with nobody on it  You represent the insurance company for the ship who's supposed to figure out whether or not they can make a claim and you're given this  Pocket watch you'll see right there. Yeah, that lets you go back to the time of death  Oh my god for every body you see so then you go and you have to kind of jump  From death to death and figure out what happened on this ship  Oh, and it's a mystery game and so essentially  You have to try and figure out like who all these people are how they died and you have to get the  like names and causes of death, right in  Groups of three to advance and then you learn more about the story. It's fantastic

Start time: 1121.04
End time: 1130.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the good thing about this game is it has an end right you get to the yes  Yes, and I guess Animal Crossing has an end unless you decide you want to continue the turnip thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it is a good thing to watch when you're waiting for election returns to come in  I want to take I want so I'm excited about the Apple thing  There really isn't much to say till we see on Tuesday. Although  although  There were some leaked geek bench  results  Yeah, and this happens from time to time right where  You know, and I don't know maybe you guys have a better idea where either it's somebody who has the new Apple Macbook  Accidentally because when you do a geek bench benchmark  If you're not careful, it can upload it to the public site where everybody can see the numbers  It could be that somebody did that by accident could be Apple leaked it on purpose  It could be completely faked. Yeah, but it's impressive as hell. It's for an a 14 X  We would expect in fact the a 14 which is the current chip in the iPad air and the new iPhones would have a special  desktop variant it clocks at 1.8 gigahertz  Can turbo boost to 3.1 gigahertz which would mean it's the first time ever any Apple silicon gets over three eight cores  That's about what you'd expect too. They've got six cores in the iPhone 12  This one had eight gigs of RAM, although you know, I'm sorry the GPU had eight gigs of RAM  So this sounds like this sounds like a pretty yeah heavy machine and it outscored the i9  Intel Apple MacBook Pro  Both in single core and multi-core performance  What do you I mean Dan maybe you have some experience with this could this be fake it could be fake

Start time: 1283.35
End time: 1336.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's it's impossible  No, but it could very well be real  Like you said it kind of pegs in where we would expect it to be the a 14 X would be expected because that would  Probably be the same chip that would end up in any new iPad Pro as well  Usually the X variant is what you see in the iPads after they debut the sort of standard variant in the iPhones  So a lot of people speculating that you know what we see in an iPad Pro might also show up in a laptop and as you  Said he kind of outpaces basically every Mac laptop on the market right now  Which is not a bad place to be and we don't even know, you know, what configuration what variant is that right?  Like if they're talking about both a MacBook Air and a MacBook Pro is this the pro version is it the air version?  You know what is going to be the functional difference between these things? So I  I  Yeah, there's a there's a lot of possibility here  But it you know certainly exciting to look at something and be like well  If even the base level is gonna be faster than everything on the market right now. What is the high end look like, right?

Start time: 1336.82
End time: 1359.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, definitely on your bingo cards. You should have the phrase all day battery life  Right because that's what you get with these kinds of chips is much better  power much better power curve and  and perhaps  Maybe 30% improvement in performance, that's the kind of number Apple likes they don't like doing benchmarks  They don't like giving you benchmark numbers, but they like saying things like 30% better

Start time: 1361.12
End time: 1382.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Perform. I think the last thing they had said like when they were talking benches was like their chips are twice as fast as the most popular  Windows laptop, right? I think that's what it was for when they were talking about the new iPad  So, you know and then we don't know like the thing about Apple's even once we get the actual spectrum of them  We won't have the actual they never say number  We have to break it down get them somebody you know

Start time: 1382.98
End time: 1402.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The one thing I do remember because I bought I have bought several now of the i9 MacBook Pros  Was when it first came out the the youtuber who benchmarked it in the freezer?  Because the thermals are so terrible  Right thing that you could as soon as it got fast it could it could only be very bursty  You know quick because as soon as it got fast it would heat up so much they had to say

Start time: 1402.96
End time: 1433.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no, no slow down slow down. So I keep in mind that none of the existing, you know a series devices  Have active cooling in them right, you know phones iPads Apple TV. There's no active cooling systems in those things  There's no fan. So if you can put an active cooling system in on top of it  I mean think about what additional performance that lets you sort of eat out of it if it's like well now that we can actually  Cool this chip down and it's not threatening to burn the entire laptop to the ground  We can eat so much more profound performance out of it. That's just gonna be very person who constantly has

Start time: 1434.08
End time: 1443.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Probably a hundred or more Google Chrome tabs open at once  I truly wish that there was any cool it because my laptop constantly sounds like it's about to take off into outer space

Start time: 1445.68
End time: 1477.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, when your laptop spins up the fans spin up because you're installing software then, you know  It's time to get a better laptop and a lot of the modern a lot of modern Windows 10 laptops  The fans are on at high volume a lot of the time and I think that's an Intel flaw  That's why I'm very I think this is gonna be very interesting and I can guarantee you everybody's looking  On the PC side looking at this with interest not that they'll be able to get Apple silicon  But at least maybe this can stimulate arm chip development for Windows

Start time: 1478.34
End time: 1504.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if we see a fanless laptop set out of this by the way just because of the history of these processors  So we've seen like a couple  I think the last time I saw it was like Dell's XPS 13 2 & 1 from like two years ago  Was at least very very quiet and like it had a weird cooling system  So I guess we'll see it was super underpowered because if it's fanless on Intel you're running Y series probably

Start time: 1504.22
End time: 1537.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  And who knows maybe Biden will be tick-tock, you know  The first tick-tock president there's always I think Kamala could be honestly. Oh, yeah  I  so in a more serious vein there is there is a lot of  Investigation going into big tech. There's the Department of Justice's  lawsuit against Google there's the houses the antitrust subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee's  450 page document  there's a lot of  You know interest in what we can do about big tech how much of that?  Transitions from the Trump administration to a Biden administration. What do you think Paris? I think quite a lot of it

Start time: 2049.98
End time: 2077.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I think  We're definitely it seems like the Department of Justice's investigation into Google is probably going to  Continue into the Biden administration. If not be furthered  It seems it like it's more likely that like Democrats Democratic State Attorneys General would  Join that lawsuit. Maybe even like add allegations  About Google. Yes, right as of now it was it was really a political it looked like a political

Start time: 2080.08
End time: 2150.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Prosecution of Google it was Republican governor or Republican AG's rather joining it not Democrat  and it really was  The as formed it was something William Barr pushed through in fact  We're hearing reporting that a lot of the staff attorneys at the Department of Justice said it's too soon. It's too soon  We don't have a case built yet and Barr said no. No, we got to do it before Election Day  So I mean it's somewhat political but you think I mean it's been very clear Biden has in his many statements during the  Election said, you know, we need to pursue this Elizabeth Warren another Democratic candidate  Who perhaps will have a role to play as she's certainly gonna have a role played in the Senate was was  Was was actively campaigning for the breakup of big tech  So you think that in fact Biden even said I I think we should really we should look at  Section 230 of the DMCA. We should get rid of that  I've been told Jeff Jarvis says he knows of  Advisors who've spoken to him about that and said, please know please maybe that's not what you want to pursue  So maybe his position will change

End time: 2218.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that I mean we're certainly going to see a change in tone. It uh depends on  it depends on honestly whether or not the uh, what happens with the Senate because I know that um Democrats were interested in  possibly tackling antitrust, um, right, uh laws and doing reforms so that maybe they could um stop  Facebook and google and other companies from um,  acquiring smaller startups and whatnot and perhaps uh pursuing  um antitrust charges or building a defense based on um things like that, but I think it  I mean certainly I had hoped that some of the  Inflammatory policy making or uh executive orders we've seen kind of around 230 and the rhetoric around that might uh  Cool down a bit in a new administration  Hopefully once somebody explains to whoever her president is what section 230 actually is and what it means and what it does not

Um, well just quickly like I  At the very least we won't just have hearings where they invite all the leaders and just yell at them like children  Which to me was the single most embarrassing like a lot of embarrassing things embarrassing things happened over the past four years  But that was just  It was so pathetic. It was so childish where there are a lot of big problems to solve  I think elizabeth warren has some great ideas like yeah  Deconstructing the monopolies is really what we should be talking about  So I hope she pursues that because we've seen time and again like facebook even with this election  Has been slow to fix a lot of the problems from 2016. So yeah, there's a lot more they can do

Transcript:  Yeah, I was just thinking I mean along the lines of what davin you're saying  I think the it's clear the concerns that democrats have with big tech are very different from the concerns that republicans have  With big tech so with the doj investigation going forward. It sure seems like it might be  Refocused if anything, I I kind of agree with paris. I don't think it's going to go anywhere  But perhaps if it gets more time to sort of mature and then they're spinning up a different, you know  Different doj apparatus it's possible that we'll see stuff  That's more focused on the issues that democrats are concerned about and which I think are probably the issues  You should be concerned about like david was just saying not why does why does google not like me?

Transcript:  I imagine there was a little celebration  In ten cent  head company headquarters tiktok and wechat might survive  The trump administration and judge actually, uh, it was  You know tiktok was supposed to be shut down in four days judge beetlestone said no  You don't have any reason to do that. So that's been stopped by the courts at least temporarily  I can't imagine a a biden administration would continue to pursue that that seems so politically motivated  on the other hand our relationship with china, I mean, I mean  That's a big part of tech too. You know apple's  Uh phone sales in china dropped precipitously last quarter  And it's thought that that's had something to do with the anti-china sentiment the tariffs  That the trump administration leveled against china chinese phone buyers  Suddenly got patriotic and bought a lot of huawei phones making them the number one phone manufacturer in the world  That might change.

Transcript:  Well, I mean apple is also  They've been in kind of a bind there for a while because not only is china a huge market for them  But china is the source of the vast majority of their manufacturing and labor  And so apple has been slowly, you know as we saw starting in early this year when the coronavirus really started in china  You know been trying to diversify and move their assets around so they can manufacture in other places  Including india and vietnam and elsewhere of course for the pandemic it ends up turns out that that's everywhere  So that didn't really help them  but I mean certainly the relationship with china is part of that where  Trying to not have all their eggs in one basket and be in a situation where they're not solely dependent on if the chinese u.s  Relationship goes south. It's not like we can't not only sell into that market  But we can't get our phones produced and sold to other markets either  So I I agree that it's a huge area of interest for apple is how well the u.s  China relationship sort of stands up and whether the biden presidency will improve that

I don't think it'll be it  You know, it's hard to say but I doesn't feel like it'll be a tense relationship  This is the difficulty you might you might say if you're conservative or they're censoring our speech  You might say if you're a democrat, oh, they're they're too they're too big  uh  But there's also this issue that they seem to be powering the american economy, especially now  During quarantine you you want to be a little careful  You don't want to chop them up and destroy what may be the only big economic powerhouse  During quarantine there is  Well, that's uh, I mean there too though.

Transcript:  Go check out my videos because it's some of the longest videos and longest reviews i've ever done  But i'm not going to pick a side because that's the thing and I actually scored them exactly the same because  These are these are gaming computers that are running basically the same hardware. They both have amds and two processors  They both have rdna two graphics, you know, so they're very very similar  It's just like a couple little design tweaks here and there where I think they're different  I really lean to the xbox series x just because i'm more of an xbox gamer. I like game pass, which is their subscription  Yeah, you pay  15 bucks a month for that in xbox live and you get a ton of games in all the first party games  It seems like a no-brainer purchase for any xbox gamer and it's great like it's fast. It does work  Hey, well, it has all the ray tracing hardware we need there aren't many games right now  That fully take advantage of this hardware and I think that's the uh, the big downside for xbox  Whereas ps5 has like, you know, it's sony  Sony's always good with the big first party games that people want to play so they've got miles morales  As spider-man they have demon souls coming up. So those are things you'd want to buy a new system for  They're both giant boxes. These are pcs under your tv. This is this is a hysterical humble brag

End time: 4897.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but the razor gaming pc is not covered by like cheap plastic  So I feel like that's the thing it's they're both they have very cheap  Plastic side panels you could pull it off sticking a new nvme ssd down the line to like give it faster storage  The best thing about these consoles, they're both running. Um nvme  Ssd's no more right old ugly slow laptop hard drives. No more of those so they're fast  They load games super quickly. They're both doing interesting things when it comes to speeding up load time  So microsoft has quick resume which lets you jump between games pretty easily  Sony's load speeds in general just seem super fast. So spider-man  Loads like from title to gameplay 15 seconds or so and there's no loading in the game itself  Like there's you'll be in manhattan. You'll go into a building. You'll zip right out back into manhattan  Nothing, so it's almost magic. Yeah, it's great

It's very narrow slices  So if you're if you're playing, you know, if you want spider-man  You're going to get you got to get a ps5. I mean, there's just if you  The exclusives are going to drive a lot of sales  I'm driven as you were by the in fact  I was going to do the 35 series x deal because it's a good deal  You pay less for the hardware you actually get a break on the hardware and then you have to you're subscribing to their  but for me  I different gamers are different, but I am not going to buy a title  Paul therot buys call of duty. He'll buy call of duty cold war and just play that non-stop for four years or something  Yeah, that's it for me.

Yeah. Yeah, but they rear it like they don't leave that quickly  So if you spend if you want to play a game for a month or two like you can just play it on game pass  And all the first party games are just there.

Start time: 5067.78
End time: 5132.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I actually so it worked out really well because I had lg's latest cx oleds in like in my basement to test  So I was like, okay perfect for these systems. Yep, that is hdmi 2.1. So it can do 4k up to 120 hertz  And that's the big broad just living the charmed life. Oh my god. It's so jealous. It's super good. It's pretty good  But I also have spent the last week just writing like a crazy person. So I like reviewed the heck out of these things  um miles morales ray tracing I feel like ray tracing this thing we're all gonna have to like learn to  Live with because it looks great, but it's running the game at 30 fps, you know, like spider-man did on  You know on the ps4 there is a 60 fps mode  But there is no ray tracing because ray tracing is so hardware intensive  And honestly  I'd rather play the 60 fps mode because it's spider-man you're zipping through this this city  So that's the big thing gamers will have to learn this year is that 30 fps gaming  You'll get some great you'll get 4k rendering you'll get ray tracing in there  But if you want the faster frame rate, which I think just looks better to most people  You'll probably have to sacrifice a lot. I had no idea

Start time: 5133.04
End time: 5139.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 5140.78
End time: 5155.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kind of pretty much. Yeah, pretty much and honestly, I feel like we're gonna see some games kind of balance how they do this  So I feel like spider-man if they gave us a 1080p  Mode with ray tracing that was 60 fps. I think the hardware could handle that and I don't mind it being 1080p

There's a game astro's playroom  Which comes with the system  You can really feel the haptics where if you're walking on sand versus walking on metal or wood or something  You could feel it in the controller  So I think sony's done a smart job here and it's their first controller that doesn't look like the original playstation controller, too  So yeah, shout out to them for that finally

Not off the table  Uh, it's great to have paris martineau with us from the information from engadget devinder hardewar  Dan moran six colors what this is a nice  A nice way to decompress after a very stressful week  I'm glad you're uh, i'm glad you're you're all here our show today brought to you by wasabi hot cloud  Storage if you are one of those companies we are where you're generating a lot of data  And in a fairly consistent way, you know, we know there's going to be another terabyte every week of of twitch shows  You're probably thinking and why am I i'm just buying more hard drives every week. What am I doing here?  Look at wasabi. Look at hot cloud storage wasabi is so economical. It actually costs less than just the maintenance  Fees on that on-prem storage and I would argue it's more secure more reliable than any on  Prem solution. This is cloud done. Right 80% cheaper than amazon s3  About as much as five or six times faster. It uses amazon's api  But it doesn't charge for that  It it doesn't charge for egress. That's always the thing that bugs me in a lot of cloud storage is  Oh, look, it's cheap to store it there. But if you want it back, you're going to pay not with wasabi  No charge for egress and I think it's significantly more  secure  11 nines of durability 11 nines. I don't know if you can get better than that  That means on average you'd lose one file maybe every  years  I don't know what's going to be what the planet earth's going to look like in 649,000 years, but all your files will still be there  All your data is hosted in premier tier four data center facilities not only highly secure, but they're fully redundant  That's a good thing because wasabi has active integrity checking every object stored  On wasabi is checked for integrity every 90 days and because they're in redundant data centers  If one bit goes missing you can get it back you can get it back  Try that with your on-prem storage wasabi follows industry's best security models and design practices  They have access control mechanisms like bucket policies and acls. You're the best thing. I love this. Your data is immutable  so  ransomware hackers  fumble-fingered employees  Your drunk self at three in the morning cannot change your data  So it's safe. In fact, they encrypt automatically whether you request it or not at rest  Wasabi is HIPAA compliant FINRA compliant CJIS compliant.

Transcript:  Oh, you want to play star wars? No problem. We'll get you one. No problem  In california, we passed prop 22  And there's been a lot of hand-wringing from  labor  Advocates, but I think there's also I mean this is a tough one. I voted yes on prop 22  This is the one that said uber and lyft drivers can be employed as independent contractors  They don't have to be as california employment law has said and ab5 in particular. They don't have to be employees  And i'll tell you why I voted yes because I know so many people in our business  freelance tech journalists who  If they lived in california lost gigs lost work  Because they were covered by these crazy laws. They can only write so many articles  Before the company would have to hire them and and you know, as you you guys all know you work in the business  Most most of the people write for tech publications are freelancers. You're you guys are staffers. Well, dan, I don't know what what  I'm a freelancer. You're a freelancer. Yeah  Nevertheless, I saw robert reich former clinton labor secretary and others  Uh bemoaning this like this is going to be the end of the labor movement in the united states. Did I do the wrong thing?

Start time: 5847.18
End time: 5885.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's tricky to to sort of distinguish because there's certainly circumstances where these people feel like  It feels like they should have the option for things like benefits and I know prop 22 did allow some  some benefits to sort of trickle down and and there is a like a freedom aspect of being able to have either the choice of  being an employee but like kind of  It still does feel to a certain extent that when it comes to like the the ride-sharing companies and those kinds of gig economies  It's sort of new gig economy stuff that there is a lot of  Advantage being taken of labor markets, but it's it's it's not cut and dried  I think is the big problem is like they wanted to kind of apply a one solution fits all approach to it and it turns out  It's more complicated than that unsurprisingly

Start time: 5886.98
End time: 5926.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll tell you that lift and uber spent a lot of money on ads  They even got the  chairman of the mothers against drunk driving  To come out in support of it because she said well, you know  If people can't take ubers and lifts they're going to get on the road and kill our children  It's like well, well, I can't vote for that I got a better vote for that  um  I just I have I have mixed feelings because I I do believe in the labor movement. Uh, I don't want people to be taken advantage of  is it  foolish of me to say but lift and uber drivers are choosing that and uh,  Obviously if they choose it they like it

Start time: 5929.64
End time: 5964.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or am I just yeah, I think it's it's it's challenging because I can imagine a lot of people  Who do want the security of a full-time job from these things?  But certainly the flexibility is proving to be one of the things that a lot of the people who are doing these kinds of work  Want they want the ability to set their own hours?  They want their ability to work when they feel like it and not have to go in for a nine to five job  Which is totally understandable. But  Really, I mean honestly, I feel like so much of this  Potentially could be solved if you had something like socialized health care, for example  Where you do you wasn't tied to your employment status?

Start time: 5964.72
End time: 6031.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So like maybe this isn't this is a symptom not the the root cause uber and lift would not exist if they had to pay  A fair wage if they were responsible for benefits, uh, you know the way it works you own the car  You pay the insurance you pay the gas they give you a pittance  I understand they're making a profit even at this point, but they still lose a huge amount of money. I mean, I  They said and I think it's fairly credible if this does not pass. We're leaving california  So, I don't know  You know california had just passed a law saying or a judge rather had just ruled that they do have to pay  There they can't be contract employees. They do have to pay full wages, but I think this law overturns that  Furthermore, and this is something that's kind of nasty about it. It is a lock-in it says this can only this law can only be overturned  By the state legislature with seven eighths of the legislator  Wow, that's crazy talk about a supermajority that's you might as well say it's got to be unanimous. Yeah, what you know  Paris you live in brooklyn. I'm sure you take ubers or used to anyway take ubers and lifts, right?

Start time: 6032.50
End time: 6082.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah, I mean it's I think a really complicated issue because  I mean as you said these companies wouldn't exist if they  Did not from the get-go kind of um  Source their labor from this strange gray area in current labor laws where?  They have employees that are working essentially full-time hours, but for not the same sort of  Minimal wage or just wages generally that you'd expect with full-time work and that traps a lot of people in a precarious situation  And I know that a lot of labor groups  That support these workers are made up of contract drivers  Contract drivers  Fought against prop 22  Solely because they wanted a kind of different option, right?

Start time: 6083.60
End time: 6090.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some of them contended that you know  If these companies were forced to they could figure out a way to make the job flexible and still pay benefits

Transcript:  I mean you I'd certainly hope that for all of the innovation  For all the things we law these companies with oh wow, they're able to make this incredible app  Like they should also maybe be able to make it  Uh create a business that  Works in current labor laws, but I guess there's always the option of changing the labor laws to fit the business  Which is what happened in this case

Transcript:  You know, I feel I I don't know what that yeah, you know on the one hand  I like to take uber and lift. I don't want to go out of business  Uh, well, I don't these days but my daughter does I would prefer to have her take lift and drive a car  Uh, it's very expensive. She can't afford it. Uh, you know, she takes mass transit whenever possible, but she has a late shift  She's gonna have to take a lift home  You know  taxis are not  Widespread in California and I don't think being a taxi driver is a walk in the park either  for that matter

Start time: 6152.38
End time: 6180.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's been really tough for taxi drivers in new york. Like that's one of the it's an ongoing thing because  Because of uh, what was it the the actual value of the medallions, uh, just dramatically plummeted  Or something so yeah, that that's been a major problem all around. Hey, these are big tough problems  Ab5 I just know from having a lot of freelancer friends in California and people who write for California based sites  You know that really that made their lives incredibly difficult. That thing was just kind of a disaster

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was really what swayed me and people like mike elgin  Uh, you know our own aunt pruett  Who used to live in north carolina was able to write for tech republic as soon as he moved to california tech republic said  Uh because of ab5 the bill  That that put this in effect. Uh, they said we can't you're out of work  We can't use you because of these restrictions on how we can use you  I understand it'd be really great if tech republic could hire and as a full-time employee  It'd be really great if mike elgin could get benefits and a job and all that  But that's just not how at least in my business in our business the tech business  That's just not how it works almost everybody who who's on our shows is a contract employee  So I just I and they want to be they're happy

Start time: 6232.70
End time: 6246.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I like that. I mean I I worked full-time at macworld for seven years and I enjoyed that  but I really love the flexibility of having my own schedule and doing my own work when I want to do it and  Yeah, it's it's a plus for sure, but it does come with its challenges

You guys brought up health care, but that's really like this would all be so much easier  If we didn't have to worry about this if we were like so many other, you know first world countries, so  That's uh, that's the big thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was saying health care wasn't supposed to be tied to employment forever  This was a band-aid put on after um, I believe it was world war two and yet somehow we've stuck with it this entire time  as our dominant system and it  Certainly has a lot of compounding impacts. I mean  Especially as somebody who working in media staff jobs  I've preferred being on staff, but i've also been laid off twice in the last couple of years and it is  awful just in the sense that yeah, suddenly you got no benefits. It's hard to suddenly you have to be like oh I  Could if I get injured be in debt for the rest of my life or I have to pay a thousand dollars a month  For cobra, which I can't afford because now I am unemployed, right?

Start time: 6306.68
End time: 6406.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it isn't right. We've got to fix that. I think we all agree but  This is this is a this is a larger challenge and you know, I think you could also and i'm sure there'll be advertisements to make this case  Why should taxpayers subsidize uber and lift by paying their employees benefits their health care benefits and that's a good point, too  We we got to we got to solve this I agree  We also just passed  Uh a privacy law prop 24 in california. This was an add-on to our already very strict  California privacy act  This made it even stricter. Although there are interesting loopholes  a number of people pointed out notice  Facebook did not lobby against prop 24 and maybe one of the reasons is facebook  can is big enough to  adhere to this the  Requirements of prop 24, but it pulls up the ladder against smaller companies who can't  That might be one reason  Um, this was another tough one poor california voters. We have to we have to do the work of the legislature  Uh, I voted for this one as well because I feel like more privacy protections are probably a good thing  Uh, it's still not nearly as strict as gdpr, but it did bring in some of the gdpr  Rules  and now the I understand that none of you are california voters or  Technically affected by this but if there is a privacy law in one of the states  It's very likely that every other state will benefit from that because companies are going to have different policies for every state, right

Start time: 6407.52
End time: 6460.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I feel like companies often do as somebody who  Spends in an ordinate amount of my time reading  Terms of service or privacy policies. I'm that person who actually does try and read it now before I agree to anything because  Legally, they have to be kind of clear and easy to read that often does impact us thanks to gdpr. But generally I mean  The protections only apply to california and for the rest of the country like I can't request  To see any of the data that companies are collecting on me. Meanwhile colleagues that I have are that are in california can and  I assumed kind of a similar dichotomy applies to data collection. I assume that these companies that have made so much money  Finding every loophole in my privacy that they can are not going to give it up just because uh,  One state out of 50, uh has passed some laws, right?

Transcript:  That the the prop 65 warning is another great example of california voters  Being and it's apparently very easy to get a proposition on the ballot. I think 100 000 signatures and you're good  and uh  Yeah, that's a great example. You can't go anywhere without seeing a prop 65 warning in california, which effectively eliminates the warning  Because it's there every it's everywhere. You can't i'm sure there are cancers. I mean the chemicals known to cause cancer here in this building  And there's a prop 65 warning out front  So what do you you know, what is it immediately dilutes it all same thing with a cookie warning that we now see on every gd website  Thanks to gdpr

Transcript:  One of the most controversial parts of the california privacy law  It allowed companies to charge consumers who opt out of having their data sold  Now on the face of it, that sounds like a good idea. You have a choice. You want to keep using facebook?  Okay, five bucks a year five bucks a month, whatever  That seems like a fair that seems like a fair trade  But there were those who say oh now privacy is a luxury item and only people with money can afford to have privacy

Start time: 6566.98
End time: 6594.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's already a luxury item  That's true. That's now the transaction. I guess is becoming more apparent in some cases, although I doubt that  I don't know. It seems not beneficial to a company to kind of  Make it that apparent, especially when california is the only state where the supplies but already  People who are um at an economic disadvantage are the ones who are being exploited the most when it comes to data and privacy  That's just a fact.

Transcript:  It's  It was such an interesting campaign here because leo you just mentioned the um getting  mothers against drug driving involved and here the big sort of scare tactic that the opposition was using was  The ability for you know, just anybody could get your data about where your cars were  So they were using like domestic abuse kind of as an example of like oh now your you know, abusive  X can find you anywhere and it's like well, that's  Not exactly what this is about. I mean there are certainly data security concerns  You want to make sure that if this system is does exist it is  Well secure, but that's that's true of any system that uses any personal data, right?  Like any location-based system, which is a ton of stuff that we use right now  But overall, I think you know it passed by a wide margin because we know we passed the first right to repair a law back in  and you know this basically was like well more and more stuff has been moving to online resources which the  Manufacturers can control by essentially saying you can only log in if we decide that we want you to log in if you're it  So opening that up to third parties, I think is a is potentially a big win both for you know independent mechanics who were the sort of  the big  Constituency we're talking about here  but also just  Anybody who wants to make devices that work with some of these cars that are so technological that you can't you know?  Kind of get access to these systems anymore

Start time: 6726.04
End time: 6749.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  and I think that there's a big question still outstanding as to what exactly this looks like right because if you have to have  All automakers complying with this and it has to be sort of broadly accessible  How are you going to implement that?  Are you going to have them all use one set one sort of system or protocol?  Are they're going to be everybody have their own little siloed systems?  How are you going to roll this out and make it secure and who who gets access etc?  So yeah, there's a lot of implementation details to figure out

What you mean, you know, oh, yeah, we know everything  We know we know at all, but they don't share that with you. Of course sure  That was a little eye-opener. Oh, yeah. No, we're looking at the logs. It worked as expected. It says so right here  That's not a bug. It's a feature. Okay  Okay, I guess I was dreaming  Uh kyle weens the founder of ifixit one of our sponsors great guy says this will be the most advanced right to repair law in the world  Opening wireless automotive diagnostics and unleashing unleashing a world of possible apps.
