And it  turns out that Breaking Bad's in  New Mexico, it was going to be  in the valley, like the San  Fernando Valley. It's in New  Mexico for one reason only, tax  breaks. Right.

Transcript:  Everybody knows about Bitcoin,  the cryptocurrency invented by a  person or persons unknown using  the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.  He's disappeared, but Bitcoin  lives on. And obviously the  people pay a lot of attention to  it. You can buy in San Francisco,  you can buy cupcakes with  Bitcoin and drugs with Bitcoin.  But Bitcoin is not the only  cryptocurrency. There are quite  a few. Litecoin is another well  known, well respected one. But  there is a, and I don't even  know if I should call it a joke  cryptocurrency that's become  very popular called Dogecoin. It  is a play off of an internet  meme. There's the cat, right?  The eye can has cheeseburger cat  and Doge is like the dog  response. Is that right, Patrick?  The dog response to the cat?  Well, not exactly. It's not

Start time: 316.82
End time: 373.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  really the response. It's just a  funny looking dog with some  similarly weird grammar and  spelling. But it's, yeah, it's  very funny. It's very quirky and  it lives mostly on things like  4chan and Reddit.  Of course it does.  Well, obviously. And that's  where this Dogecoin thing is  taking off. It started off as a  joke apparently. And I think  the reason why it's, well,  obviously the reason why it's  popular is the only difference  between Dogecoin and other  cryptocurrencies like Litecoin  and things like that is that.  It's the meme. It's bathed in  that stupid, silly humor. And I  think we were talking about  before the show, it's now the  seventh most popular  cryptocurrency, which isn't,  you know, it doesn't mean it's  actually the seventh most  popular cryptocurrency. It doesn't  mean it's actually going

Start time: 373.82
End time: 408.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  anywhere. It's based on  Litecoin. It's using the same  technology as Litecoin. And  according to somebody in the  chat room, it's now trading at  it roughly 10,000 Dogecoins to  the dollar. However, I've just  learned that many of the people  here at our office are mining  Dogecoin, like the encoding  servers we use to take these  shows and encode them in all the  different formats. It's not  working all the time. So when  it's not working, it's making  Dogecoin. Am I saying it right,  by the way? I think it's Doge.  If you go to Know Your Meme,  that's what Wikipedia, that's

Start time: 409.37
End time: 410.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  how they list it also.

Start time: 410.82
End time: 428.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Know Your Meme says it's part  of a series on interior monologue  captioning. That's the meme  type, interior monologue  captioning, as in I Can't Has  Cheeseburger. First posted five  months ago on Know Your Meme.  So it's about...  It's a little bit, yeah, it's

Start time: 428.86
End time: 447.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a bit old. The meme itself is  a little bit older than that,  but it became very popular over  the summer, I think. And it uses  things like the kind of things  that the Doge, the dog, says are  much something or while  something or many something.  In the software, the wallet that

Start time: 447.82
End time: 454.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you're using has... It's in  Comic Sans, Doge's favorite  font, and it uses DogeSpeak.

Start time: 456.10
End time: 521.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it says for the menu, I mean,  the label for the menu where you  see your wallet, it says much  receive. The history, the  tracking of your exchanges, it  says many history. Your addresses  are very address and mining is  called dig with a little paw  from Doge. But you know, there  is a kind of a tech angle here,  a serious rather tech angle,  which is the cryptocurrencies  are super popular right now, and  they're one of the very, very  hot things. And it must be both  infuriating and frustrating to  all the people who are betting on  these kinds of things and  investing so much money in them  right now to see that something  like this can rise to the seventh  place. Again, seventh place  doesn't mean a lot because none  of those are worth a lot except  for maybe two or three. But just  because Reddit and 4chan and  whoever else has taken a like  into it.  But it also underscores the,

Start time: 521.98
End time: 526.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you're about to say this, so I  won't say it, the absurdity of  currency in general.

Start time: 526.82
End time: 533.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess. That's not exactly  what I was about to say, but it's  true as well.  So we all pretend that the US

Start time: 535.88
End time: 556.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  dollar, for instance, has some  intrinsic value. It's a piece of  paper, has no intrinsic value,  and then people say, well, it  would have were tied to gold  except that gold is not going to  be tied to gold except that gold  has very little intrinsic value.  The value of gold based on its  industrial value is much less  than the thousands of dollars an  ounce.  Well, I mean, there's some really  good evidence.  It's all made up.

Start time: 556.82
End time: 564.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, there's really good  evidence that if we were still...  It's the value of the trust you  put in the government's economy,  isn't it? So it does have value.

Start time: 565.02
End time: 584.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If we were still tied, if the  dollar was still tied to gold,  there would have been some really  interesting analysis that had  been done of how much gold has  fluctuated much more than the  dollar has even just over the  past decade.  It would be very volatile right  now, in other words.

Start time: 584.82
End time: 587.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would be very, very volatile.  Yes.  It was good that they untied it.

Start time: 587.82
End time: 598.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  The dollar has been much, much  more stable.  Now, I guess you could argue that  if they were still tied, maybe  that would have stabilized gold.  I don't know, but it's the tail  wagging the dog, right?

Start time: 599.02
End time: 600.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or in this case, the doge.

Start time: 601.51
End time: 602.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go.

Start time: 603.70
End time: 655.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think that's what's  interesting because...  So Bitcoin, in a way, kind of  underscores that what we call  fiat currency, currency that is  based on trust, on full faith and  credit of the United States  government.  So Bitcoin is also a fiat  currency in the sense that it's  imagined that it's worth  something.  But then Dogecoin, to me,  underscores the absurdity of all  this, but it also points out  something that I think is a  little bit seamier, which is that  at least to some people, and I'll  point out to myself, Bitcoin  looks like a very clever pyramid  scheme.  It is guessed that the earliest  Bitcoin creators, including  Nakamoto, Nakamoto is probably a  Bitcoin billionaire right now,  were he to convert his bitcoins  into dollars, and that the  people who start these currencies  are in fact potentially profiting  greatly from all of this  attention and speculation.

Start time: 656.05
End time: 676.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  What I...  Sorry, what I don't understand,  Leo, and I know you've talked  about this number of different  shows, so maybe there's consensus  on it.  I don't understand why it's  spiking.  So you look at what Bitcoin has  done just in the past couple of  quarters.  It's ridiculous.  You know, I mean...  It's gone back down a little bit,  but still outrageous.  It has gone back down.  Yeah.

Start time: 677.94
End time: 683.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But...  Well, that shows me there's a lot  of speculation in it, right?  Yes, yes.  Right.

Start time: 684.60
End time: 742.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.  Well, it's understandable that  there is...  We call it speculation.  There's also potential.  Speculation is people seeing  potential in that currency, and  there is a huge potential there.  I mean, it could...  If it stabilizes at some point,  it could become, well, what the  promise of it is, which is a  currency that is not controlled.  It's kind of what the web and the  Internet did for communication  and for, rather, media.  This could do for currency.  And there is...  I don't think it's only baseless  speculation.  I think there is a possibility  somewhere out there that this  could become stable in the future.  Now, of course, it's only a  possibility, but it's  understandable that people are  betting on that possibility,  because if it was certain, then  obviously everyone would be doing  it, and it wouldn't have the  value it does.  The Winklevise...

Start time: 744.10
End time: 767.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Winklevoss twins who have  heavily invested in Bitcoin,  proving that they, in fact, should  never have had any money from  Mark Zuckerberg at all.  But they say that Bitcoin will  reach $40,000 a coin next year.  Currently, it's about $600.  It's been as high, I think, as  $1,200 on Mt.  Gox, which is just one of the...  Oh, it looks like it got over  $1,500 on Mt.  Gox a few days ago.  It's just so bizarre.

Start time: 767.82
End time: 776.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's almost like people are  treating it instead of like a  currency, and it's almost like  it's being treated like some kind  of investment mechanism.  Yes.  It's a pyramid scheme.

Start time: 777.82
End time: 788.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a scam.  I don't know what it is, but I  think the Dogecoin is great  because it is simultaneously  making fun of it and making a  little money for its inventors.  Now, Father...  But if you want to, if you

Start time: 789.89
End time: 809.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  really want to go and figure out  what it is, isn't it the  equivalent of a collateralized  security?  There's this thing off there  that has some value, but really  it's being traded as if it were  shares in something.  The same way that mortgages,  the way that mortgages were  packaged into certificates.  And look how well that worked

Start time: 809.84
End time: 810.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  out for us.

Start time: 810.82
End time: 826.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and that was exactly where  I was going with that.  Unfortunately, the way that  Bitcoin works, I don't think it  can get big enough to avoid  being manipulated by large  numbers of people.

Start time: 827.57
End time: 838.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's interesting.  Now, Overstock.com announced  this week, in fact, I think  today, that they are going to  accept Bitcoin for buying  stuff at Overstock.com.  So you can get real stuff with  Bitcoin.

Start time: 839.79
End time: 843.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you can pay your  WordPress.com account in  Bitcoin, can't you?

Start time: 843.84
End time: 852.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there's lots of...  One of our sponsors, ProXPN,  which is an open VPN, takes  Bitcoin.  As I said, there's a cupcake  shop in San Francisco that takes  Bitcoin.

Start time: 852.92
End time: 857.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what does that buy you?  500 cupcakes for one Bitcoin?  Well, there's the irony of it.

Start time: 858.39
End time: 897.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember, early on, somebody  bought a pizza.  He used thousands of Bitcoins.  It's like a multimillion dollar  pizza now, had he known, but at  the time, it wasn't worth much.  And to me, I think that anybody  who takes Bitcoin now, and I  include myself because you can  donate to us, we take Bitcoin,  it's purely like, well, what's  the risk of this?  Show out, sell a few cupcakes.  You're not going to sell a lot  of cupcakes on Bitcoin, or  Overstock's probably not going  to sell a lot of stuff.  But hey, collect those Bitcoins  because at some point, there  seems some likelihood they may  be worth a few bucks.  But they may be worth hundreds  of times more in a year or two,  right?  The only thing is, when do you  get out?  Or zero.  Or zero.

Start time: 898.82
End time: 899.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or zero, yeah.

Start time: 899.82
End time: 902.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 907.82

Transcript:  F-L-O-O-Z.  It was promoted by Whoopi  Goldberg in 1999, a series of  television advertisements.  It was created by iVillage  founder Robert Levitan in an  attempt to establish a currency  unique to Internet merchants.  It comes...  The problem is it sounds like  floozy.  It's not a good name.  They were notified by the FBI in  2001 that a Russian organized  crime syndicate was using flus  and stolen credit card numbers  as part of a money laundering  scheme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  It really is interesting, though,  virtual currency, that it is  going mainstream, that it is  going to much larger attention.  It's got the attention of the  government.  When we first did Tech Republic  for the first five years, we had  what we called tech points,  which was essentially a form of  virtual currency.  You got them like every...  The base currency was...  You got for reading an article.  You got a lot more for  participating in the forums.  You got some for basically  rating articles if you thumb  them up or something.  It was really interesting  because part of the promise at  the beginning was, well,  eventually you'll be able to get  swag with them or you could turn  them in to do...  We were really wrestling over  what should we let people do  with them?  Should we let them...  Could they not see ads for a  year or something if they have  enough points?  We really wrestled with it.  After about five years, we never  really decided...  We never figured out the right  way to handle it.  At some point, I can't even  remember why, we just...  We just had to figure out how to  get them.  We converted them to flues and  it disappeared.  We converted them to flues and

Start time: 1036.90
End time: 1040.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 1040.86
End time: 1051.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was one of those things that  we thought...  Everybody's kind of forgotten  about them by now because they  really hadn't been a prominent  site.  So why are you bringing it up  again?  Yeah, I know.  Don't...

Start time: 1054.86
End time: 1058.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the tech points.  But I guess the interesting  thing is that we're not going

Start time: 1058.82
End time: 1098.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to be able to get them.  We're not going to be able to  get them.  The interesting thing is, I  don't think the world was really  ready for virtual currency was  part of it.  We weren't the only ones.  Lots of sites were doing this  kind of thing.  But now it does seem at least,  despite all of the crazy  inflationary activity going on  with Bitcoin and everything,  there's an appetite obviously  for digital currency.  And it's hard to think that it  will be Bitcoin with everything  that's going on with Bitcoin.  But this is going to happen.  And this is probably going to  happen a lot sooner than we  anticipated.  It's suddenly one of the big  stories of 2013.  We can't stop talking about it,

Start time: 1098.82
End time: 1182.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but I don't know what...  It's hard for me to adjust to...  I mean, to assess what it means.  I don't know if it's important,  if it's not important, if it's a  scam, if it's the next big thing.  It's very...  And Dogecoin, I love it because  they made a joke out of it.  And yet we're mining Dogecoin.  In fact, Father Robert Ballester,  one of our hosts, he hosts  Knowhow on this week in  Enterprise Tech, is going...  He says Dogecoin is actually  kind of interesting.  It's based on Litecoin's proof of  work, reverse hash designed, not  to kind of resist what's  happening with Bitcoin.  You know, with Bitcoin now, the  way Bitcoin was set up is that as  more and more processors are  doing the work, it becomes harder  and harder to solve.  The problems get harder so that  it evens out.  So it makes it hard to mine.  And apparently this is exactly  what Dogecoin and Litecoin are  avoiding.  It's probably the most difficult  way to do it.  It's more resistant to the idea  of throwing a lot of power on it  because it needs a lot of memory,  which he says, Robert is a priest  so you can listen to him, makes  it more for the common man.  So in two weeks we're going to do  an issue of Knowhow in which  Robert will assemble a reasonably  inexpensive, I think he means  mining rig based on an AMD GPU  that should be good for about  $12,000 a day.  So watch in two weeks.  You too could be Doge mining.

Transcript:  Now see, to me, I'm much more  interested in gems because I'm  playing Clash of Clans.  It used to be donuts.  I should not laugh at people  because Linden dollars, donuts,  whatever, I spent some serious  money on it.  And then the Simpsons tapped out.  The New York Times yesterday had  a story about George Yao, who  was the, they call him master  of his virtual domain.  He was the king of Clash of  Clans players.  This is a game that is now netting  the Finnish company Supercell as  much as $2.4 million a day.  $2.4 million a day, people are  using gems to play this game.  Now it's actually a good game.  There's some strategy involved.  It's a fun game to play.  SoftBank just took a 51% stake  in Supercell for $1.5 billion.  There's money in them that are  fake currencies.  I've only spent $20 in Clash of  Clans, and that's it.  I'm not going to spend anymore.  I've learned my lesson.  It's a Skinner box, somebody  said.  Paula Deen says, hi Paula.  Hey, love you.  Love your show.  Paula Deen says it's a Skinner  box.  It's true.  Well, these well-designed video  games today are not fun.  They're compulsive, right?  You have to play.

Yeah.  $40 a month or whatever.  By the way, does Blizzard still  charge for World of Warcraft?  Of course.  Okay.  I thought there might be a trend  away from that.

They're guiding me.  You know, we have eliminated  the meaning of CES.  So please assign it, ascribe it  no meaning.  But speaking of the, the, the,

Start time: 1834.70
End time: 1865.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the CES, you know, the pain of  CES, the best photo ever.  I cannot find it is there's a,  there's a photo of Natalie Del  Conti on the last day of CES or  it's like the, you know, maybe  the last day that they're when  they were doing awards or  whatever.  And, and she, she did her show  and then she just fell asleep  right in the middle of the scene  at stage.  I mean, it, it, you could just  see she's just completely  knocked out.  And I was like, that's the  symbol of CES forever.  It is exhausting.  It's huge.  It's essentially uncoverable.  What we're going to do this

Start time: 1865.70
End time: 1918.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  year, we, we, for years we had  a skyrocketing, a skyrocketing  and we, for years we had a  sky booth and, and it was fun.  And I really actually loved it.  It was also hugely expensive.  And so we decided we could do a  better job of covering it by  sending, we're going to send  Robert Ballas or Dick D Bartolo  will be there.  Scott will, you know, I think we  got four reporters there and  what they'll do is feed us stuff  back.  And when I decided and tell me  if this sounds crazy, I realized  that really there's only the top  layer of CES matters, the top  20 products or 30 products.  After that, there is a very long  tail of iPod accessories and  stuff that you don't really care  about.  Maybe inside there, there's one  or two jewels, which I would like  to find and I would put them in  the top 30.  I don't mean the top biggest  names.  I mean the top 30 products of  interest.  And after that, you can just go  home.  So what's that?  That's what I've assigned them.  I've said, look, find the, find  the top 30 products, report back  on that thing.  We'll be done.

Start time: 1918.84
End time: 1949.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd say it's even, even less  than that, that are really,  really interesting.  And the thing is, the thing is  with, with CES, you know,  with, with CES, there aren't any  big major announcements anymore  because everyone wants to do it  outside of CES because they can  and have their own press  conference at a time where it's  less crowded.  So of course you're going to have  a lot of things and some of them  are going to be interesting, but  you're not going to get the big  announcements that you would have  gotten, you know, even five, six,  seven years ago.

Start time: 1950.35

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I go pretty much for the trends  and for the meetings.  So the trends you start to get  when you, when you sort of, and  the trends are sometimes related  to the meetings, but also it's  kind of, you just see what  everybody's kind of peddling,  even though a lot of it's never  going to come to market.  That's the other problem with it.  Yeah.  A lot of the products never come  to market.

Start time: 1980.01
End time: 1985.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like, maybe this is stuff we  might sell you in six months if  you show some real interest.  Yeah. It's like the Droid.

Start time: 1985.80
End time: 2015.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the name of that product?  The Droid.  There's this one, the Motorola  did the product.  They showed it at CES.  It was one of the Droid's  and they never released it.  The Droid Bionic.  Well, they released that.  They released it like eight  months later, completely different  phone.  Nothing like it.  No, not the same features at all.  Completely different, you know,  device ultimately.  You know, device altogether.  We responded to feedback.

Start time: 2015.84
End time: 2018.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 2020.19
End time: 2029.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 2029.70
End time: 2034.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 2035.74
End time: 2090.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we're really seeing an  inflection point in the  tech marketplace now.  The idea that you have  a single device that is sort of  the locus of your information  and computing is just gone.  And so there's a lot.  That's a really good point.  The new things that are coming out  are either vaporware or  are good intentions that won't make  it because of money or technology  or whatever.  But in total, I think we're  really going to see the very  beginnings of some really big  changes at this year's CES.  That's the only reason I'm going.  If it were just another year,  whether it's how big a TV can you  make and how cheap of a tablet  can you make, I'd be somewhere  else.  So now you got me scared.

Start time: 2090.70
End time: 2091.92

Start time: 2093.13

Transcript:  It's true.  Actually, the decentralization  thing is really, really true  because the cloud is pretty much  your cloud services are the center  of the universe.  Plus, everything is getting smart,  right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everything's getting smart.

Start time: 2103.70
End time: 2150.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The other trend that I'm really  watching is contextual computing.  You look at what's happening with  Google now, how much more useful  that has gotten.  It was useful early on.  It's even more useful now.  And the services that look at you  and then they know more about you  in many cases than you know about  yourself, your services, your  services do and in scary ways in  many cases, too.  Extrude computing is really one  of those trends that's gaining a  lot of momentum.  It's probably one of the biggest  things to watch in 2014.  It's empowered by the cloud and it  feeds into all of the  decentralization that Ed's talking  about where your devices, you  don't need this sort of one device  that's the hub of everything  anymore.  Those days are gone.

Transcript:  I remember asking Paul Attalini,  who was at the time still chairman  of Intel, CEO of Intel.  And this was years ago, but it was  already becoming clear that the PC  was going to take a back seat to  something in the post PC era.  And he said, no, no, no, we'll  always have a PC as a central hub.  This is Intel's hope.  And it hasn't really worked out so  well for Intel.  But on the other hand, I would  point out that these trends don't  happen over a year.  They happen over a decade.  And so we saw tablets at CES  before that Comdex for 10 years  before they happened.  And so we've been seeing we saw  convergence.  How long was convergence the  watchword before it even got  close?  So I think you're right.  I think wearables is a watchword.  I think distributed computing,  internet everywhere, the internet  of things.  This is all these are all watchwords.  But they don't happen over a year.  They happen over decades.

Start time: 2209.70
End time: 2228.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, true.  Well, some of it's a, you know,  at least CES, it's it's kind of a  test to see where where people add  on these things, even to smaller,  simple level. I look at like  wireless charging.  Right. There's kind of some bunch  of competing standards, but it's  actually gotten remarkably better  this year.

Start time: 2228.74
End time: 2240.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just put a lot of I agree.  I just put a wire.  First of all, last year, all the  wireless chargers were junkie.  You had to position them carefully  and the Google made one for the  that it slid off of it all.

So but I have if you'd  bring me bring me my slope because I  just got something that actually works.  And then here's the funny thing.  So this is a Galaxy Note 3, which does  not have wireless charging.  But for eight bucks, I was able  to get a little thin  wafer sized thing  that supports Qi charging.  I put it on the contacts  here in the Galaxy Note 3.  Can you get it over the shoulder?  Anthony, are you working on that?  I see you feverishly pressing buttons.  The camera's off.  Oh, man.  Well, anyway, I put it in the  it actually so thin it just goes right on  top of the battery.  The case still goes on.  And now I can do what there it is.  Thank you.  So there so so this is  this was eight bucks on Amazon.  It's that thin.  NFC still works.  I thought this was kind of amazing.  And I'm not a big fan of wireless  because all the chargers I've used  are like that Google charger  until I found this.  This is called the tilt.  It's from  love that I actually have one at the office.

But on the bottom of that thing,  it's got the light that tells you if it's  right, you know, lined up or not.  And positioning is so tricky.  Positioning is so tricky on this.  It almost always lines up.  I've actually very rarely.  I put other phones on it just to see  what's going to happen.  It works with an XS6.

I shouldn't really mention something  like this without telling you.  It's tylt.com.  They make a lot of other silly stuff,  but the Vue wireless charger, which comes  in a variety of colors, I actually bought  two of them.  It's not cheap.  I think it's what?  60 bucks, but it actually works and it's  got a sensible angle.  It just kind of has a good idea.  All right.  Moving on.  Our ads today, our sponsor today is  personalcapital.com.  This is an interesting story.  I interviewed the founder of personal  capital a year ago on triangulation.  He was formerly CEO of PayPal, CEO of  Intuit, a guy who knew a lot about money.  We had some really interesting  conversations.  Actually, that's when I signed up for  personal capital a year ago.  Personal capital is free.  It gives you a financial dashboard, all  your accounts in a single place, and it  helps you invest.  It's really, the idea is it's not a  checkbook manager.  This is a wealth manager.  The irony of all of this is that as you  progress in your financial life, the more  progress you make, the more difficult it  is to invest well, to use your money  wisely.  Personal capital helps you keep track of  the checking account, the savings account,  the retirement account, credit cards,  investments, mortgages, loans, all those  things that really can put you in a  financial fog, the fog of finance.  You can't make great decisions when you  only see the puzzle a piece at a time.  This gives you complete intel with  graphs, charts, and reports.  It's like a financial GPS at your  fingertips, and it's free when you go to  personalcapital.com slash twit.  It'll just take a few minutes to sign up,  and it will pay big dividends.  They will help you make the most of your  assets.  And you might say I'm too young to  invest.  This is the best time to invest.  I wish I had been putting money into my  401k.  This is the best time to invest whenever.  Personalcapital.com slash twit.  I don't think they'll put you in Doge  coins, but you never know.  Maybe put a small amount in Doge coins,  just in case.  Personalcapital.com slash twit.  We thank you for your support.  You're watching twit this week in tech  last episode of 2013.  Biggest story of the year, Ed Bott.  I know that you got the most clicks on  the Oracle crapware story, but I'm  going to go ahead and get to it.  The biggest story has to be the NSA.  The NSA story was also on my list of  the top five stories of the year.

Transcript:  I thought what was interesting is, I  mean, there's no question that the  Snowden revelations are important and  big.  What I thought is the story that I  wrote way back in early July, I think,  or late June when this first started  happening, it sort of bookmarked the  year.  It was a story that was really  interesting.  It was a story that was really  interesting.  It sort of bookmarked the year for me.  I wrote a story about how terrible  that first story on the  NSA leaks was.  It was the one about Prism, and it was  the one that said that the NSA had  direct access to all of these things.  And the Washington Post actually said  that all of these tech companies, Google,  Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo, were knowingly  participating with the NSA in this.  And we now know, of course, that they  were as much victims as everyone  else.

And so it's sort of fitting that  the year ended with 60 Minutes doing  one of the sloppiest, most  horrible pieces of journalism.  Jason and I both work for  sites that are owned by CBS Interactive.  Full disclosure,  60 Minutes is part of the parent  corporation that pays me most of  my income during the year.  But that was just a terrible story.  There's been a lot of sloppy journalism  around the whole NSA story  this year, unfortunately.

Start time: 2713.11
End time: 2740.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's the story.  I think the story is Snowden  himself and  going out on a limb and  doing what he did.  Interestingly enough, it's come out that  he was able to do all of this.  There's a bit of an IT story in  this as well. He's able to do all  of this because it's sort of bad configuration  inside the NSA.  There was a SharePoint server  and he was able to use that  to get all these documents that he shouldn't have had access to.  I didn't know this. Wait a minute.

Start time: 2741.70
End time: 2754.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is interesting. So  Microsoft SharePoint, which is designed  really as a way to share documents among  coworkers, was  the security misconfigured? Is that  why he was able to get in? That's my understanding.  This is a story that just came out

End time: 2802.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yeah, but that's  the other part of this story  this year. Really, to me,  the far more important part of this is  that we have outsourced so  much of the United  States government, military  establishment, and  spying in general  to contractors.

Start time: 2805.24
End time: 2811.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Can I just, I'm just  curious what the, because the whole thing was obviously  carefully crafted by the NSA  to paint a certain picture.  Why do they mention the high  schoolers? Because the young people today  should be working for the NSA. I don't  understand that one. Maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  future. Yeah, yeah.  Can I just get back to the sloppy  journalism part for one quick  second? Just to remind  the fact that when  the story first broke,  we didn't know everything we know now. And  Ed, when you're saying that  people said,  I guess it's GreenWalt,  said that  Microsoft and Google and everyone was  participating willingly,  maybe not willingly, but  were giving away our information. That's what  we believed at the time. And it took a lot  of analysis and thinking and  brain racking to figure  out what PRISM actually was.  And I guess  it was  on security  now. Steve Gibson.

Start time: 2898.10
End time: 2931.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so that's  my takeaway was, which was that this  PRISM slide was the piece  of evidence. What happened was  non-technical journalists looked at  it and said, oh, Microsoft and Google  and Yahoo are cooperating.  It did take Steve Gibson, who sat  back and said, no, that's not necessarily what's  happening. I think that they're  doing something we now know is the case  called upstreaming, which was that they  were intercepting, they did not,  although it was unclear, because it did sound like from  the slide that there was  an NSA presence within the servers  of these companies. And it

Start time: 2931.80
End time: 2947.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  did take a lot of people thinking  about this for, you know, it was a few days, maybe  even a couple of weeks  before we finally  figured out what it probably was.  So I think it's a little  bit unfair to say that the  journalism was sloppy at the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Patrick, I think you need to read what I wrote there,  because I think you're misinterpreting  it based on, you know, a 140  character summary.  Sorry.  But the story, there's two things  about the story. Number one,  the Washington Post  and The Guardian were in  competition to break the story, and  so they both wound up running  it before  they had done  what a journalist is supposed to do, which is to  figure out stuff like that. Two,  they said things as  though they were fact,  when they didn't have  the documentation to support them as  fact, or even frankly as  speculation. And three,  one thing that The Washington Post did  was they printed one story  that was picked up by literally  thousands of other journalistic  outlets and  sent all over the world. And then they  rewrote the story  so that by the next day, the thing  that they had online did not  even resemble the thing that they published  originally that everyone picked up.  Those I think are pretty  cardinal sins of journalism.

Start time: 3023.78
End time: 3073.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  journalism. I know this is a tech  show, not a journalism show, but you know, a lot of  it is the downward pressure on journalism.  I mean, journalists  organizations are thinner than ever.  We have fewer fact checkers. We have fewer copy  editors. We have fewer  what we used to call review editors  that are doing this kind of thing.  The news cycle is much  shorter. The news cycle used to be about three days.  Now it's about three hours.  So it's tough.  I'm not defending journalists because Ed's exactly  right. Journalists drop the ball.  I mean, I agree on  a lot of the stuff at the beginning.  And we don't know what we know now.  Hindsight is 2020.  But clearly people didn't  corroborate facts.  They made leaps that they shouldn't have.  And you know, this  story has kind of been botched all year long.  I mean, really again and again

Start time: 3073.76
End time: 3091.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and again. You know, I'm proud of the fact  that thanks to Steve Gibson,  our coverage of this has been the most accurate  and has proven to be the most accurate  from almost from day  one. And it's one of the things that  we're starting to, I've decided to really beef up our  news coverage because I feel that  somebody's got to do a better job of tech news coverage.

Start time: 3091.82
End time: 3117.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree. It's true. We have actually  purposefully, on Tech Republic,  we've purposefully not covered  it many times because we couldn't verify  a lot of stuff. There was so much crap being  said both ways. You know, you try to  verify it and you know, you  get stonewalled. You know, we actually  haven't published much about it for  that reason.  And you know, that's not  really the answer either, honestly. And we're trying  to figure out what, you know, what the

Start time: 3128.73
End time: 3172.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm OK. I'm the only one  who's not an actual journalist here. So  I'm sorry if I'm being  you know, I think you're being a little bit harsh  on at the very beginning  of the story. Could they even  and maybe I don't know, but  could they even have verified all of this?  Were there  ways to actually, I mean, this is  very, very serious  and complicated  and secret and dangerous  stuff, quite frankly. I mean,  Snowden had the story not  been leaked would probably have  ended up in a ditch.  I'm not  saying you're wrong. Obviously, I have  no business saying this, but I'm just  I just think the way you're  presenting this is a little bit  harsh.

Start time: 3174.29
End time: 3291.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, again, I think maybe you should read  what I wrote because I don't think it's harsh.  I think it's accurate.  But I think there's a debate  that needs to happen in this country.  I mean, I was  furious about the Patriot  Act when it was introduced  in 2001  and 2002 and rushed into  law. And  I wrote stuff about  this in 2004 and  2005. To me,  a lot of what is  has come out about the NSA  is simply saying is simply  the details that they  were doing exactly what they  thought what we thought they were  doing. What I'd like to see us  have now is  a really robust national  debate, especially with  the legislators who have been falling down  on the job of overseeing this  kind of surveillance. And the only  way that you can have that debate  is by putting accurate  information in front of  the people. Now,  Glenn Greenwald and Bart  Gelman and Laura Poitras and  all the people who've been involved in this  have been publishing  lots of facts and things that  the American people deserve to see. And I  have no problem with that. The  problem that I have is on  the frequent occasions when  they have jumped to conclusions that  weren't justified by the things that they  were printing. And as a result,  people who  only read a fraction of the  news reports anyway  come into the debate  with a set of  beliefs that aren't  supported by the facts.  And that to me,  to me is an overreach. And a lot  of the overreach comes because  the people who are writing this are also trying  to be advocates.  And when you're  an advocate, sometimes you start  editorializing beyond  where the facts take you.

Start time: 3292.97

If I had to guess,  I think that it's going to be a  very typical Microsoft solution where  Mulally will become the CEO  and Satya will be the CTO  in a role that Microsoft hasn't had a CTO  since Ray Ozzie left.  And so this will allow them to have  the technical leadership without  Satya having to  take all the bullets that would come  with also being CEO.  That's my guess. Is Microsoft manageable

Early next year, I think  makes me think that there's probably some kind  of... There's something going on in the back  room that maybe they didn't expect. I mean, they released  all this sort of Balmer stuff  in December. They were teeing  this up for it to happen.

You do that for a couple  days and then a couple days later, you announce  the new CEO. That's  typically the way you would do it.  And most of the  vibe throughout  the year was like this was going to happen by the end  of the year. Is this a good time... If you're making

You're also going to have product news  that people are revving up to  go at the beginning of the year as well.  You can argue it both ways.  I do think the future of Microsoft,  and I've said this and written this many times,  I think the future of Microsoft is primarily  a cloud company.  If you look at...  There's a lot of things that...  Obviously, key mistakes that Ballmer made.  Missing the mobile  revolution is the big one. Microsoft had a huge  lead in tablets and smartphones that  he completely  spent. It's not all his fault. He's not the one  running product for those things.  But you have to take responsibility  for it. But what he did get right,  and doesn't get as much credit for,  and should, is the fact that he  was investing in enterprise  and in cloud in a big way,  and really turned them into a  powerhouse in both of those areas.  Things that don't get talked about much, but  Microsoft still has a lot of trust  in enterprise, despite  things like this SharePoint kerfuffle  with the Snowden thing.  It's not really Microsoft's fault  if they misconfigured it.  And in the cloud,  Azure has the potential to be  one of the winners.  Azure works well with Linux.  It works well with other platforms.  It scales  in really big ways.  Those two things,  my sense is  five or ten years from now,  Microsoft may not be a household  brand in the same way. It may not  in the same way it is.  That's kind of up in the air. But I think it's  still going to be a powerhouse in the computing  world the same way kind of Oracle and  IBM and other companies are.  They've got a ton of momentum  for that behind the scenes

So I don't see  how they can come back from it.  There have been  rumors about them  making cheap  entry-level phones  with Foxconn.  I don't see how that will help  them all that much.  Microsoft, I mean Windows Phone  is now the third  in market share  in third place.  I don't see BlackBerry coming back from it.  They could.

Can't say I've done it today but we're on a  good path. He says 2014 will be  an investment year. He hopes to be  cash flow neutral. In other words, not  emerging money by 2015  and actually profitable in 2016.  Not sure how you do that.  It ain't with phones.

That this Foxconn deal is really  a back door to a Chinese  ownership. That Foxconn  will be building, selling, even  stocking the phones.  Presumably sending some  money back to Canada.

They used to make  a lot of devices for everybody else.  You do that long enough and you get enough experience  making devices and you go,  we can make our own devices.  Let's just do this. Right?  You have to expect that Foxconn  at some point is going to try to say,  you know what, let's make our own brand.  But whether it's Foxconn or they may  buy a brand or they  may just put it under a  different brand. Whatever.  At some point they're going to do  their own brand.

Transcript:  Come spring.  So I think, I think Patrick's  right that  the Blackberry 10 was  their big bet and it  flopped. When you read, I read through  the reports this week and I think  70 or 80 percent of  the devices they sold this year were  Blackberry 7.  Wow. Wow. Yeah.  There's some, you know, so they really  didn't, their new operating  system failed, but the  strength that they have is in  enterprise device management  and patents.  They have a lot of patents  for enterprise management.  So ultimately, they may  wind up doing something like  Nokia did, which is to say  we'll sell our  hardware division to  somebody like Foxconn  and we'll become a smaller  company focused on network services.  Right. They, you know, and  they could, with all their expertise  and their ability to protect  some of that expertise with patents, they  could actually survive  in that field. But as Jason  points out correctly,  that would be with far fewer people than they

Hope you're enjoying our end of  year episode next week,  best of, and then the week  following a brand new year for this week  in tech. I appreciate your being here  all through the years. This is our  eighth year beginning our ninth  year next year doing this. Wow.  So we're almost as, we've been doing this almost as long as Ed Bott's  been blogging.  About the same time.  Yeah.  And I still don't wear pants, so there.  Here's your tin foil hat.  Thank you. I want the tin.  And we do it thanks to  our great sponsors who make this possible.  Always free because  we are ad supported.  I kind of, you know, made that choice early  on with Twitter for a while. We thought maybe we would  be a paid service or  we'd take donations, but I think, you know what?  Mike Elkins convinced me of this.  The idea of making this  free so it's ultimately democratic.  So everybody gets to watch as many eyeballs  as possible. And then hand picking  great advertisers.  Just a handful of them to bring them  to you. That seems to work out pretty well.  One of those advertisers has been with us  for a long time. Four years, five years now.  Squarespace.com.  The best hosting.  Plus the best  software on top of that.  To give you a website that is  just fantastic. Never goes  down. Always beautiful.  Mobile responsive now with their  new designs. And they have so many  great templates. In fact, if you go to Squarespace.com  and click get started, you get to pick  a template. For two weeks you can use  Squarespace at no cost. You don't even have to give them  a credit card. Play with the  different templates. The beauty of this is the  way Squarespace is designed.  Your content is  completely independent. This is how it should be of the  template. So you pick a lovely template  like the front row. Import your  content. And if you say, hey, do you want to try a different one?  You just press a button and everything's  reflowed to fit into the new template.  Every Squarespace site looks different  because it's so easy to completely  customize it using click  and drag and point and click.  If you know JavaScript,  they've got a great developers platform  but you don't have to use it. All of the  templates, every one of them,  is mobile responsive.  That means the site looks great  no matter what size screen.  From iPhone to 32 inch  4K display, your site will resize  and reflow to always look at  its best. That's nice too because if you're using  Squarespace commerce, it means  you've got both mobile and desktop  commerce all inclusive.  You gotta try it.  Two weeks free, visit Squarespace.com.

Transcript:  Although I wish I could get a red one.  I'm sure you can paint it red. I could just paint it.  So the Mac Pro went on,  sneakily went on sale this week.  We weren't sure when, at  midnight I think. If you didn't  order it in the first few minutes,  you're out of luck. You won't be able  to get it until February. Apparently it was available  for December 31st, at least for a little  while. But you had to be up at midnight  and so forth.  I was going to order one, but I  don't want to wait until February.  So what I'm going to do, my new plan is to go  down to the Apple Store on December 31st  and hope they get one or two  that I can buy  on the spot. Some journalists  did get those, get them for review. I know  Jason Stel was tweeting. He said  his is very quiet.  But when you put your face next to the top, you get a nice  bath of warm air coming out of the thing.  Molly Wood  got one.  I'm not sure who else. I don't know if she's going to drop it out of an  airplane. She's famous for her torture tests.  No Mac Pro for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a very good question.  It's a couple  of possibilities. It may be that there are very  few of them. It may be that there's been so much demand.  Remember they haven't updated the Mac Pro for three years.  They might have sold  10,000. We don't know in the first few hours.  I don't know.  It does seem more likely that it is  a challenging manufacture process.  Remember they announced this  in June  and said sometime  before the end of the year,  I have a feeling it's hard to make.  The extruded aluminum is not, I'm told.  Apparently that's a well-known technology.  So I don't know.  That's a good question. Any thoughts anybody?  Why the short supply on the  Mac Pro?

Start time: 4506.59
End time: 4531.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think it's a question  of super high demand.  I don't think that there's  I think there's a very passionate  cohort of designers  who want that.  But I don't think that it's one of those things  where lots and lots and lots of people are buying it.  I think it's just a  it's going to be a niche product.  And they don't really, Apple doesn't really  lose anything by not being able to fulfill  the orders for that right away. That's true.

End time: 4574.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I was just saying  I don't think they made that many.  They're  expecting this to be  a high-end market. I think they would prefer  not to make the product honestly.  Because they  they're really looking for markets of scale.  But it would be a bad  PR move not to do it.  I think they figured they do it.  They can keep some  PR by doing it. They can  innovate a little bit on manufacturing.  And that's probably a smart thing.  I sort of wonder how passionate  they really are about it. The fact that they let  the old one lag for as long as they did  I think shows that they were really on the fence  about whether they wanted to play in this market  anymore or not.

And once they announced  this, I decided we're going to move to Windows  because we need  to be able to buy late model  relatively affordable machines.  The Final Cut Pro  10 is unusable for us for a variety  of technical reasons.  They abandoned our market, so we're going  to buy Windows and Premiere. It kills me. I'm a Mac  fan, but that's what we're going to use because  it only makes sense. And I think that  there is a market for that, and I think they've abandoned it.  It may not be an important market.

Today, you can do pretty much  everything except for high-end video  editing and computer graphics calculations.  That's true. On a laptop.

And the reality is  now that we have a world where we have  trucks and we have luxury cars  and we have  minivans  and we have smart cars  and skateboards and bicycles  and motorcycles and everything.  And lots of people have  multiple examples of those things.  So the idea that you had to choose  between one of those was the great  distraction that he did.  He's brilliant. He was brilliant.  It was the thing he did better than anything  else. He just sliced it.

Transcript:  The Ford truck is the best  selling vehicle in the world  for 35 years in a row.  So the fact that  he used the truck, that's why I sort of  did the double take when he did that one. Like, I understand  the analogy and to an extent it works.  But it's sort of funny is that  35 years in a row  that's the best selling vehicle  in the world.  But it's also used for work  in the same way. It actually is a pretty  decent analogy to the way  people work because when you want to get  real work done, people still use  they still by and large, especially  knowledge workers, sit down  and use a computer.  The thing is, is where, why  that market has been battered  is that people were using  computers, including laptops,  for so many other things too. They were  buying for this period before  really the iPhone  and Android kind of hit.  People were buying a lot of second  computers because they were being  connected more. And they were, so that  market, you could say it kind of was  almost artificially inflated as people  were buying these second PCs,  netbooks, things like this.  What happened is once those second devices  came, that market just dropped out.  Nobody was buying, you know, netbooks.  Nobody, you know, very rarely were buying  second laptops anymore to keep, you  know, cheap one up, you  know, on the upstairs  in the bedroom or whatever, buy one  and give to your kid. By and large,  they started buying these small  devices. So, you know,  a lot of it looks really bad for the PC  right now, but essentially it's, what I  would think of is more of the normalization of that  market to where the people who really need  those devices, you know, that's what they're  getting. They're still using those for work.  They also last a lot longer than your typical,  you know, mobile device.  And so it's still a solid  market. It's just a lot smaller than it was  before it kind of got artificially inflated by all  this kind of second PC, netbook stuff.

You'll be able to preorder Christmas  Day 2013, and they'll be available  January 17th. It's both  the 5S and the 5C.  And it's interesting that Tim Cook in his statement,  one of the first words out of his mouth,  is enormous respect  for China Mobile.  We have enormous respect for China Mobile.  This is, I mean, another big  market opening up to  Apple, and  it's a market that has been dominated  by, I think, by Android up to now.  Although the iPhone was always in great  demand, just in short supply.  So, you know, maybe they're making the right move.  They're not, it's certainly Mac, selling Mac  Pros isn't going to make much difference to the bottom line,  I don't think.

This is really, when you talk about  the PC,  PC Plus, post PC, whatever  you want to talk about, a lot of it has to do  with the growth being  in emerging markets  where people simply can't  afford expensive  devices. And so the challenge,  so the interesting thing about  looking at the iPhone 5S and 5C  into China is that will appeal.  There's a very, there's a large enough group  of people who have the money to buy  that in China.  But the  really successful products there  are going to be the really  low cost ones. And that's the truth in  Brazil and India as well.  Apple doesn't have anything in that category.

This is the Apple ad misunderstood, which I've  now seen on a couple of NFL games.  They're spending a lot of money because this is a 90  second commercial. They actually have to  buy three ad spots to air  the whole thing. I think there is a cut down that they're  showing as well. But it kind  of speaks to anybody who's ever had teenagers.  This kid is apparently  ignoring everything that's going on.  Grandpa even had to throw a sock  at him at one point just to get him out of his  stupor.  And then, lo and behold,  and I know tears are going to come to your eyes  when you see this. Grandma certainly burst into tears.  The little kid,  the teenager, he's not been ignoring  us. He's been secretly,  just like the NSA, taping our  every action. And has made  a lovely movie out of it.  Oh my, oh my, isn't that beautiful. So all  those things that you saw looked  like he was ignoring. He was really just recording  it sideways.  Somebody made it.

Transcript:  Oh, OK.  So there's actually a couple of things  about this ad that are kind  of brilliant or I think will  be viewed as, and I think could  be influential  in the way people make ads.  One of the things that they did,  I think, was  they didn't have these  very,  it's a very grungy, very  interesting take  on an ad. One, it's too long.  And I mean this in the sense of they're breaking  the rules, right? They didn't get very  sort of polished, good-looking  people.  It goes on way too long.  It sort of sets us up to  look at this  and sort of judge this person of  like, here's this, why are they putting  this little jerk on here that all he's doing  is ignoring his family.  And they're totally setting you up, right?  Right.  But they're setting you up to  that part at the end where then  they change your perspective. Oh,  what he was actually doing was something  creative, using our  tools kind of thing.  But it breaks a lot  of the rules  of advertising.  And ultimately,  it kind of succeeds in the  fact of getting across that feeling  whether  you believe in it or not. Like you said,  a lot of kids are, when they're doing  this, they are actually texting or doing something  not so creative. That's the first  thing that comes into my mind is how this

Start time: 5229.74
End time: 5296.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is phony. This is a phony baloney  ad that this isn't really what's going on. That's  what comes to my mind. Of course, then I think  the ad that made me cry most last year this  time was the Clydesdale ad,  the Budweiser ad with the little horse and the  guy raises the horse and then the Budweiser  guys take him and then the horse  breaks away and he kisses him.  That made me cry. So I'm an idiot.  Who's better? Google or Apple  at making tear-jerking ads?  It's not an ad. It's the  What Did the World Search for in 2013?  The Zeitgeist video  from Google. But I got to say,  this is the same exact spirit.  Same even  sappy music.  This is New  Beginnings.  They're touching every possible  constituency here. Gay Marriage, The Pope,  Royalty Lovers,  Sci-Fi Fans,  Democrats,  Republicans, child throwers.  Everybody is appealed to.  Actually, I think  it's a pretty good ad.

Transcript:  You've been sextoing again.  Do they drink Frenette in  France or is it just a hipster drink  here in the San Francisco Bay Area?  Do they drink what? I don't know. You see,  I knew. Fernet, Bronco.  It doesn't ring  a bell. Yeah, I thought so.  Ladies and gentlemen also, oh, we've lost  Jason Heiner. He's been coming and going the whole  show. And I've been deftly  avoiding showing that.  But I blew it for you, Anthony.  Sorry. Jason  Heiner from Tech Republic. Our show today brought to you  by Stamps.com. The last thing you want to do  right now is  go to the post office. Crowded,  long, lots of people, parking lots  full, because everybody's mailing stuff. I don't  blame them. But if your business is mailing  stuff, you don't want to go in there  with all the amateurs in there. That's why  you should be using Stamps.com.  Makes your holiday mailings easy.  If you mail flyers,  invoices, packages, if you sell  on Etsy or eBay, that kind of thing,  you ought to know about Stamps.com. You print  your own stamps and shipping labels. You don't  need special ink. You don't need a special printer. You just  need Stamps.com and your printer, your computer.  They've got shipping solutions  for everybody. And a  lot less expensive. A fraction of the  cost of a postage meter. I want  you to go to Stamps.com. By the way,  the mail carrier will come get your mail  no matter what size the package. You  do not have to go to the post office. Nothing  you can do at the post office that you can't do on  Stamps.com. Except maybe, I don't know,  flirt with a clerk or something. But  everything else you can do at  your desk. Stamps.com offers  discounts you can't get at the post office.  Priority Mail, Priority Mail Express.  They'll fill out all the forms automatically.  The computer will print out  the international mailing forms  and all of that. Taking that data from  your customer's  website on Etsy, eBay,  PayPal, Amazon, your  QuickBooks, that kind of thing. The whole point is  it's going to save you a lot of time. It's going to save you a lot of money.  And I've got a good deal for you. If you go to  Stamps.com right now, don't take that special  Santa Claus offer on the front page  there. No, click the radio microphone  and enter our offer code  TWIT. Just to let them know you heard about this  on Twitter. And they're going to turn that  $80 value to a $110  bonus value. You get $55 in free  postage to use over the first few months of your  Stamps account. A free digital scale, $5  supply kit, and of course  a four week trial at Stamps.com.  Go there right now. Click the microphone.  Stamps.com. Use the offer code  TWIT.  One of the things that supposedly we'll hear  about is new plans for  T-Mobile. Un-carrier 4.0  at CES. I've been a little  underwhelmed. I love T-Mobile.  But it's not exactly like they've  eliminated any of the  carrier stuff that they do.  So I'm curious. They apparently  have done away with contracts.  They've kind of done away with device subsidies.  They have that jump  early upgrade program. What else is  coming from T-Mobile?  They say something. You're not  going to believe.  Okay, well, I guess we won't be  talking about it.  What could it be? They sent out invitations.  No idea. Are you going to  go to the party at the  January 8th? No.

I said, I'm going there just to see the Internet  of Stuff with a nod to George  Carlin.  But I think there's so many  interesting niches of  technology. Sensors  and microprocessors  and  connected  smart things and health-related  stuff with the Affordable Care Act coming.  There's going to be a lot of innovation in there, too.  Now you're making me  want to go. I feel bad I'm not going.

Am I crazy? I should stick around.  Just hang out. So the  rumors include things like giving  paying early termination fees  for people to leave their  carrier. That would be interesting.  I do have to say I love it that they're  offering, even though it's edge only,  they're offering unlimited  international roaming. That's a nice thing  for people who travel. I don't  want T-Mobile to succeed. The other rumor is  that Sprint's bidding to buy them.  Which would be sad.

Six Californias  he's actually going to. And you know given the way  the ballot measures work in California  it's almost certain  that he will be able to get this on the  ballot.

And the answer is not very.  So  so yeah, but they are already there is already  legislation being passed and movements  you know in UN and other places  about you know putting putting together  these treaties on not  allowing drones  to make decisions to kill  human beings and why that is.
