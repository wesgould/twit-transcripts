Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When I started, years ago in the 80s, when I was a kid, I worked at Infoworld and Michael  Swain did that. And he had his whole office covered with these badges.  The legendary Michael Swain. And I felt it would be  derivative for me to do that. So I never did. I just throw them out.  We've all done it now. And thank God, because you know,  I like to archive. It's a real problem with me.

Transcript:  It's getting to be a dim memory, isn't it now? Look at this.  Comdex. This is from Comdex in 1984. This is the first PC magazine.  It was published in 1984. And this is the third Comdex.  I thought it was supposed to be in 83 or 82. Well, maybe it's 82. It doesn't have a date.  As usual, when you do the first edition of any magazine, you don't date it  because you don't know how much longer you're going to have to...  You might have to sell it for months. That might be the only edition.

Start time: 254.74
End time: 258.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It came out within a year of the PC itself, so I think it was 82, something like that.

Transcript:  Okay. Yeah. That makes sense. Program generator does graphics and music. Look at that.

Start time: 264.96
End time: 266.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's exciting. There's some really good stuff in that book.

Start time: 267.90
End time: 277.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  February, March, 1982. Okay, there we go.  So they talk about this is the third Comdex. They talk about how it's becoming bigger and bigger.  Forty-five hundred booths and thousands of people attending.

Start time: 278.02
End time: 280.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It got bigger and bigger and bigger, and then it blew up.

Start time: 280.18
End time: 303.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It just disappeared. That's what happens.  We brought out the old magazines because this was a big week for Macintosh on January 22, 1984.  Thirty years ago. They had a big party.  Yeah, they did on last night. So January 22nd was the Super Bowl ad.  The Super Bowl was early in those days. It was still in January.  They keep moving. Eventually it'll be one whole year of football.

Start time: 305.36
End time: 341.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, players.  And then January 24th, the official announcement was at Flint Center for a shareholders meeting.  And then recently, and I actually credit Harry McCracken for this.  If you go to techland.time.com, Harry McCracken's blog, you could see a video that has never been  seen in public since 1984 of Steve Jobs demonstrating the Mac for the first time in public.  This was at the Boston Computer Society. Let's see, it was January 30th.  So it was a few days later.  He loves Clorox.  Of course, there's an ad. It's got to be an ad.

Start time: 344.00

Transcript:  And a great suit to be seen.

Start time: 345.82
End time: 353.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He did look good. You saw it, obviously, Clayton.  It was pretty cool to see this.  The double-breasted suit.

Start time: 353.74
End time: 359.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that was Tim talking. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was Tim and some chariots of fire action too. I'm sorry. Spoilers. I'm sorry. Spoiler alert.

Start time: 360.06
End time: 374.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, because we've all seen that moment where at the shareholders meeting,  he takes the Macintosh out of the bag.  They play the chariots of fire.  And then the Macintosh says, hello, I'm Macintosh.  And that was an exciting moment.  This is the kind of the replay of it.

Start time: 374.30
End time: 377.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What we're going to do is simply wait until those standards emerge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's Steve talking to the Boston Computer Society.  Here's the Mac team all on a panel.  Let me see if I can find the unveil.  Yeah, here it is.  This is some of the images from the Macintosh.  Do you have the chariots of fire sound?  Do we lose sound all of a sudden?  Hey, where's your Mac, by the way?  That's the 1984 ad.

Start time: 404.66
End time: 410.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that me?  Really for the second time ever, we'd like to let Macintosh speak for itself.

Start time: 415.34
End time: 425.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hello, I'm Macintosh.  It sure is great to get out of that bag.  I've come a long way.

Transcript:  But IBMs couldn't do this.  The graphic display, bitmap images on the screen, all of this stuff was unique at the time.  You know, it wasn't too long.  Somebody in the chat was saying, you know, my Amiga was 10 times better only a year later.  But this was the first time we'd seen anything like this.  It's pretty exciting.  And the Boston Computer Society Geeks, very excited.  If you want to watch the whole thing, it's an hour and a half.  And one of the fun things is they kept the camera going after the event.  And people like Woz and others were answering questions from the audience.  And that was kind of fun to see Woz talking and Bill Atkinson and Andy Herzfeld and others  talking to the audience.  These are people using Macintoshes for the first time.  Clayton, for some reason, I feel like your first computer might have been a Mac.

Start time: 482.70
End time: 555.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, my first computer, I remember sitting on my dad's lap.  We had a really early IBM.  I actually wrote a piece for Engadget a couple of years ago, growing up geek.  And I talked about sitting on my dad's lap while he would write basic code.  He was the first person in the neighborhood to have this old thing.  And he was writing code.  And he ran grocery stores all along the East Coast in the United States.  And so he would build all these databases to manage the meat inventory for all of these  different grocery stores up and down the East Coast.  And it was just sitting there watching him do this was remarkable.  And to see then when we were robbed one time, we took our grandmother home to her apartment  a few blocks away.  And just in like the 15 minutes we were away from the home, someone broke into our house  in Cherry Hill, New Jersey and smashed the windows.  And we pull up to the driveway and the lights are on upstairs in the upstairs of the house.  And my dad said, I didn't leave the lights on.  Oh, so he rushes in.  And instead of going like to anywhere in the house, he didn't like worry about his safety.  He didn't look for like my mom's jewelry.  He ran right to see if the computer was still there.  And sure enough, it was so damn heavy.  No one could lift the damn thing.

Start time: 555.26
End time: 561.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nor did they know what it was or know what they could do with it.  Right.  Do you remember, Tim, what your first computer was?

Start time: 562.50
End time: 577.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a Commodore 64 back in the 80s.  I did a lot of gaming on there and learned some basic programming back in the day as well.  So did a little bit of early coding back then.  And I got a 286 after that a little later on.  But Commodore 64 was my first computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple.com took to the takeover.  Happy birthday, Mac.  It's funny because on the 25th anniversary of the Macintosh,  Apple did nothing and they asked Steve Jobs why not.  He said, I don't look backwards.  But now that Steve is gone, Apple does a lot of looking backwards.  Right.  This is a long video.  I'm not going to show the whole thing, but showing early artists who used Macintosh to create.  Hans Zimmer is in this.  There's a surgeon.  And it's kind of it's kind of cool.  And then after the video, if I can skip to the end,  they do a little timeline on the web page.

Start time: 620.89
End time: 623.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here was my idea.  The IBM 5150.  That's what it was.

Start time: 624.80
End time: 629.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that was a mini computer.  Right.  That wasn't a PC or was it?  It was the PC.

Start time: 629.86
End time: 646.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was the first PC maybe.  It was 200 pounds.  Oh, that thing.  Was that the box that ran BASIC and APL?  Yeah.  It didn't have a special keyboard.  It was a very advanced machine.  And it did weigh a ton.

Start time: 647.64
End time: 654.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The first IBM was a 5150.  But that's not that was not 200 pounds.  So I know there was I think a different number.

Start time: 654.36
End time: 656.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it was 50 something.  Yeah.

Start time: 657.52
End time: 661.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not going to ask you what your first computer, John, because you used.  I used a rock.

Start time: 661.30
End time: 664.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You used them in school, right?  I had two rocks and a stick.

Start time: 665.68
End time: 671.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you did you were you were at Berkeley in the 60s?  I was at Berkeley when we used rocks and sticks and lines.

Start time: 672.78
End time: 701.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you do computers then?  Actually, I was using a little Fortran action.  I was doing I was one of those jokers that would put obscenities on the on the punch cards and then  go register them.  And so you go look down the line and all these people are registered and there's what?  Whoa, what's this?  Some horrible obscenity.  Someone said poop on our computer.  And so I went to the lab and typed a bunch of those out and stuck them all over the place.  So I started early.

Start time: 701.78
End time: 715.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have come along.  Here's, by the way, the Byte magazine, the first of the IBM PC, the famous cover with  the thickness of that.  This is when computer magazines were real.  There was money to be made.  Money.  Look at all the ads.

Start time: 717.32
End time: 742.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they all shot themselves in the foot.  What cracks me up, I always thought was a great irony.  These computer magazines, if they had just encouraged diversity instead of getting all  on board with Microsoft and one thing, you know, one one word processor, Microsoft's office,  by the way, Microsoft never advertised much, which is the irony.  This whole thing.  They essentially put all these little guys out of business and put themselves out of  business at the same time as not buying full page ads.

Start time: 742.26
End time: 763.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was hilarious.  In the magazines.  But, you know, I was thinking about this the other day.  I mean, we really can credit Microsoft with the personal computer revolution of the 80s  and 90s because they created a stable, predictable platform for developers to write software.  Developers, developers, developers.  Without that, I don't know if you have the PC revolution.  There was a reason to have a mono.

Start time: 763.38
End time: 766.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, see, this was the logic that resulted in the demise of the whole scene.

Start time: 767.30
End time: 776.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So maybe it's maybe that's the natural consequence, but it did certainly.  I don't know.  It feels like that that we wouldn't have had the kind of mass.

Start time: 776.46
End time: 810.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I always wonder if we could do a if there's some way just to pull Microsoft out of the equation  from the beginning, where would we be now?  We could be further along.  Really?  Well, I mean, it's possible.  Look at the way.  Look what happened when Apple came in and all of a sudden changed the phone and then the pad,  which Microsoft been trying to sell all these years.  Next thing you know, this thing's the iPad is like a hot product.  Everyone's jumping on board.  Meanwhile, Microsoft had tried to promote this back in the day of wind pad and before that.  And then that more recent one, the effort never always failed.  I think a lot of their stuff is pretty junky.

Start time: 811.72
End time: 821.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, we wouldn't have it.  I was having this discussion the other day with someone about whether or not we'd even  have the success of Apple in the way that we do now if it wasn't for Vista  and the debacle that was Vista.

Start time: 822.39
End time: 825.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, come on, Apple.  It was a success before Vista.  That's a good one.

Start time: 826.24
End time: 834.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean, think about it.  I mean, that was that was a real turning point.  I guess you're right.  I mean, that was a real turning point.  Think about the think about this, the switching.  Well, wait a minute.  You were there for millennial.

Start time: 834.64
End time: 909.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, with Millennium Edition, Millennium Edition came back to Apple in 98.  Did the color IMAX.  That was when Windows 98 was the dominant and new version of Windows.  And I think you could say Apple's return started then.  Remember, it was partly due to Microsoft putting one hundred one hundred fifty million dollars  into Apple into Apple.  Yeah.  When Apple was about to go bankrupt.  More irony.  Yeah. That keynote with Bill Gates, a giant Bill Gates.  And then people booing him.  I am about to give you money.  I know I feel strongly that without Microsoft providing a consistent platform,  you don't have the growth of the 80s and 90s.  And then, of course, what happened is you're right.  Microsoft fumbled it for whatever reason.  Maybe it's just the natural business cycle.  And now we're looking for that platform.  We don't have it anymore.  We people are rejecting.  I believe people are rejecting Windows 8.1.  I don't think the iPad is a platform.  It's certainly been successful for app developers,  but it's not universal enough to be a dominant platform.  Okay.  I think the next platform is the cloud.  But the problem is there's, you know, maybe it's Google's cloud.  I don't know.  What do you think, Tim?  Do you think that that's the case that you need a common platform for success in the industry?

Start time: 910.28
End time: 956.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you definitely do.  And you also need competition.  And that's the big thing.  I mean, if you delete Microsoft from the picture back in the history of personal computing,  then that's a major player out of the equation.  That doesn't force Apple to be as good as they had to be to compete.  That's a good point.  Yeah.  And so, you know, Apple could have gotten fat and lazy and who knows what would have happened.  But yeah, going forward, definitely, you know, platforms are shifting.  And certainly iOS and Android are developing and becoming big.  But the sort of standardization and interoperability that you're referencing,  Leo, you know, the standards that Microsoft put forth and the standards of development  and the sort of things that developers could target for exchanging data.  Those sorts of things are kind of nascent at this point still,  especially when you talk about cloud computing.  There's so many great services out there, but none of them talk to each other.  And there's no way for any of them to talk to each other.  Really.  There's no standards in place at all.  And we're a long way from that.  HTML5 isn't that the promised standard?

Start time: 959.34
End time: 963.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, isn't that what we need?  But nobody's right in the name of HTML5.

Start time: 963.84

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The past five years, that's been a promise.

Start time: 965.54
End time: 975.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do we need anything?  Maybe the days of the platform, who cares?  I use a Kindle, I read books on it, I use this for something else.  I use my desktop.  So what?

Start time: 975.58
End time: 981.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You get the lock-in.  Well, yeah, and you get ecosystem lock-in.  Right.  No.

Start time: 983.10
End time: 1012.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not locked into the Kindle.  These things shift.  I mean, look at the Nook, right?  I mean, what's the...  Would you encourage anyone to go out and buy a Nook right now?  No, of course not.  I wouldn't, but that's beside the point.  How long did that last?  But you think we're here, this is brick and mortar store that I can walk in,  huge Barnes and Noble, it's crushing all these little bookstores in the towns, right?  This massive store, you can go in and get coffees there.  They're brilliant, right?  Because you'll sit there all day and drink coffee and just keep buying books.  They come out with their own e-reader platform and the Nook.  This is a gold mine.  It's crap.

Start time: 1021.28
End time: 1025.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I was saying that...  I mean, how long...  You say who cares about lock-in.  No, I never said that.

Start time: 1025.98
End time: 1039.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I said I don't see the lock-in.  I see somebody else coming along with a Kindle clone of some sort that might be better.  Maybe not.  I don't care.  I like the Kindle.  It's not an expensive product and it moves a lot of books, I'm sure.  But you got a dot...

Start time: 1039.06
End time: 1060.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is it?  Dot Moby file.  So you buy all your books on Amazon.  Well, let's say you don't.  Well, let's say you do.  For the sake of our Jedi.  But okay.  That's the point of the lock-in, right?  Kindle is the most popular e-book distribution platform, is it not?  So what happens...  It's dot M-O-B-I.

Start time: 1061.66
End time: 1079.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's M-O-B-I, actually.  Yeah.  And yeah, okay.  So I had downloaded a book the other day and it was in the e-pub.  And I just ran it.  There's a website online.  I just typed it in.  Boom, it came out as a Moby file and I put it on the Kindle.  I read it.  I don't see that...  I don't feel locked in.  I mean, there's all kinds of ways of getting around it.

Start time: 1079.72
End time: 1100.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But if you buy a first-party book, if you actually pay money for a book that you download  from Amazon, it's going to be encrypted in such a way that you can't do that and put  it on some other readers.  So it's not so much the hardware that's going to go away, but it could be the platform that  goes away.  And if that platform goes away, then that content that you purchased goes away with  that platform as well.  And there's no way to do transfers of licenses or anything like that across these...

Start time: 1101.12
End time: 1119.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to sell the books two or three times, but that's not unusual.  The whole world's been headed toward this licensed lockdown DRM crap anyway.  That's not a good thing, is it?  I know.  I don't like that, but I don't think it has anything to do...  So you think it should be one giant megalithic company.  There's no fragmentation.

Start time: 1119.40
End time: 1177.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everybody should be some ogre.  There's definitely disadvantages to that.  I'm not saying...  Look, Microsoft, in fact, faced the antitrust lawsuit from the Department of Justice in  the late 90s because of this, but we gained a benefit from it.  And I'm not saying it's...  What was the benefit specifically?  The benefit was if you're a developer, you could write a program and have a known potential  user base of hundreds of millions.  The platform was not a shifting sand, although later the Microsoft APIs did shift probably  a little more than they ought to have.  But it was a consistent platform that you could write for, and you knew you had a market.  And I think that we saw an incredible blossoming of software in the 80s and 90s because of  that.  And I think that it's a little more fragmented.  Now, if you're an iOS game developer, you're writing for that ecosystem, and it's not going  to be on Android.  It's not going to be on desktop.  It's not going to be on HTML5.  And so a lot of creativity and I think potentially very important software gets missed.

Transcript:  I think the reason for the huge boom that you talk about was because of the graphical  user interface showing up.  And it created all these people with all these idiots who couldn't type DIR into a command  line because it was too complicated.  It grew the market base.  I agree.

Transcript:  This is good.  So basically, they say Facebook is about to lose about 80% of its users.  Good.  Because they said essentially it acts like an infectious disease.  It's not the first time we've used that model.  Viral video.  It spreads like a virus.  I love this.  This is a great study.

Transcript:  It feels right.  When you're reading it, it feels accurate.  It feels like, you know what?  You can't really explain why your friends are not using this thing anymore and why.  But no one actually vocalizes it like they did with MySpace.  It's just people just stopped using it.

Start time: 1285.06
End time: 1331.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We should make that clear because people say no one's there.  No, there's plenty of people there.  Just not the family, not your high school buddies,  not the people you want to connect with.  They're all on Facebook.  But they don't like it any more than you do.  These researchers presume or offer as a model this disease model.  I like it.  What happens with diseases is they peak and then they die very rapidly.  You get a fever.  The reason is because people, well, immunization happens.  People get over the disease.  Antibodies.  They're saying the traditional model of disease spread,  they're going to update it to assume that recovery from a disease,  like Facebook in the social context,  means you have to have contact with a non-diseased member,  a non-user of Facebook, someone who has recovered.

Start time: 1331.54
End time: 1335.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would be, I've never recovered.  So by contacting you-  I apparently have built-in antibodies.

Start time: 1337.02
End time: 1352.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have modeled this.  There's math.  And you could see the math.  Yeah, they got math.  That means it's true.  They've got search query data curve fitting-  Science is in.  Results in discussion.  And so they say that in the next two years,  Facebook's going to lose 80% of its audience.  Now this happened to MySpace.

Start time: 1353.68
End time: 1356.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would bet serious money that that's not going to happen.

Start time: 1357.70
End time: 1374.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think I buy this for a couple of reasons.  The first thing is they liken this to the pattern that MySpace saw.  And of course, MySpace did have a devastating loss of active users.  But one of the reasons that they did that was because Facebook came along and stuck them all away.  There's nothing that's coming and showing up that's really showing that same potential.  But what about Snapchat?

Start time: 1376.02
End time: 1381.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is it?  Snapchat?  What is the thing all the kids are using now?  Snapchat, John.  Is that it?  All the kids are using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't you think there will be that at some point?

Start time: 1392.42
End time: 1434.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  I mean, I can't-  If there is, then it's going to have to be something completely different than what we see today.  I don't see anything that's on the market right now replacing Facebook.  I mean, certainly like Clayton mentioned, Google+.  I use Google+. a lot and I like it a lot.  But it certainly doesn't fit the same template that Facebook uses.  Snapchat, I'm telling you.  Keeping in touch with friends and that kind of thing.  But the other thing is, there are lots of things that have come along that have had these big  booms of popularity and that didn't die out.  I mean, think of internet usage.  You could apply the same models to internet usage and certainly people haven't wandered  away from the internet after using it for a couple of years.  So I don't see what makes Facebook fit within this model that they're defining  and other things that remain popular don't fit in.  I don't see where the differentiation is.

Start time: 1434.30
End time: 1458.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the thing is, I mean, the phrase people use is the network effect.  You stay there because everybody else is there.  And so there's a natural lock-in because it's where all my friends are.  I'm telling you, the kids are out.  They're done.  But that's what I think that in time, that's what's going to happen.  Maybe it's not Snapchat.  Maybe it's Instagram.  Maybe it's not Instagram.  Maybe it's fine.  Or maybe it's none of the above.  What is it that we need and get from Facebook?  Nothing.

Start time: 1459.34
End time: 1476.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm talking to the wrong guy.  I see Facebook providing a core service and I don't see anything else really filling that void.  Like bringing all those features together, keeping in touch with your family and your friends and  everything else.  I mean, to me, it's more like email.  And certainly people are shooting from email.  But people are saying that email is going to go away.

Start time: 1476.58
End time: 1505.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't even think that people are even using it for that.  I mean, I guess they're using chat services on Facebook perhaps.  But really, I think the thing that's taking off, I hear more and more people, the young kids,  I hear them all around the offices are constantly talking about Instagram now in a way that I never  heard of talking about it before.  But Facebook owns it.  So hey, kudos to Facebook for buying Instagram.  I agree with that.  Because that's all you need.  It's a photo, a little comment here.  You can now share directly with people individually, almost like Snapchat.  So maybe the decline of Facebook.

Because if you don't eat carbs, you're not going to get gluten, right?  Well, no.  The thing is, you'll find gluten in coffee.  You'll find it in crappy coffee.  Yes, you will.

So my close friend who was Celiac, it took him years to figure out what it was, finally  was diagnosed and he would just be in double pain, constant pain.  It was a horrible thing.  Horrible ailment.  He finally figured out and he got off of it.  He finally got off of gluten, but then he would still have some coffee in the morning  in the green room and couldn't figure out why.

It's been number one on Amazon, New York Times bestseller called Grain Brain.  All research, all science is now pointing to the fact that Alzheimer's, dementia,  is inflammation of the brain can be directly tied to gluten and wheat allergies as an inflammation.  His research is pretty overwhelming.  I've interviewed him a couple of times on the show.  He has been on the Dr. Oz show.  It's been remarkable and there's been a number of books on this as well.  Dr. Richard Lustig's book on sugar and Gary Taub's book on why we get fat.  I love Gary Taub's stuff.  Gibson's been big on this, but he hasn't focused on gluten.

Now I live a stone's throw, literally a stone's throw from East Rutherford, New Jersey,  where the game will be played.  And the whole city right now is preparing me in Times Square.  They're building all the scaffolding for the building a ski slope in Times Square for the big event.  They're really concerned.  They're trying to get all these hoity-toity rich people to start using public transportation  for the game.  Today we had a guy on the show from SeedGeek.com.  And they're saying that the cheapest seats were like 2500.  Yeah, they're like an aggregator, like the kayak of tickets.  Really expensive because I looked.  $2500 for the cheapest seats.  But he says in like a few days they already dropped $1000.  And he says that you see this, it's not because the teams, he said,  it's not as a result of the teams or anything,  that you always see this right before an event.  That literally wait to the day before an event,  you'll get the best possible price on your tickets the day before an event.  They got to dump, unload.

But think about the infrastructure that is delayed on a regular basis.  The taking the train to the city on a regular basis  is late one or two times a week.  Without fail.  The subway is late on a regular basis.  The elevator you're waiting to get on to go up to your meeting is late.  How often are you texting someone to tell them that you're running behind for a meeting  because of some sort of infrastructure being behind?  So Gmail goes down and there's worldwide panic.

Transcript:  I think Yahoo could have spun this by simply saying that they were trying to provide a news  update to their users.  By apologizing, it made it look like they were trying to poke fun at Google.  If they simply said, hey, we're just providing an update.  We thought people would want to know because everybody, I mean,  CNET certainly tweeted about Gmail being down and Gadget did as well.  And a gadget owned by AOL has their own mail service, but nobody thought that  Gadget was poking fun at Gmail.  I don't think so.  I think that would have been a better response for them rather than apologizing.  Never admit it.  In other words, spin it.

Absolutely it is.  Yeah, that's definitely the way they're going.  And I think that's something that, you know, something that a big property like Yahoo  definitely needs, you know, that they need something that's going to be providing tech  news with a general consumer angle toward it.  You know, I think that's a little bit too hardcore.  And if that's really successful, then they can, you know, kind of branch out and go a  little bit more, a little bit more hardcore, a little bit more techie, a little bit more  nerdy with the news angle and the news spin.

Transcript:  Well, that's the thing.  That's a big company that's doing this.  So here's Matt Cutts' argument for SEO and backlinking.  For years, the strategy had been if you wanted to build up your blog status within Google Search  rank and Page rank that you would, of course, write guest blog posts on other people.  You would try to get high profile blogs to allow you to come in and do a guest post that say you  want to write about life hacking and you contact Tim Ferriss to write something.  Or maybe you reach out to Pat Flynn and you try to write something on his smart passive income  blog or something like that.  You try to make these connections.  Well, now Matt Cutts is saying, hey, now that these companies are coming in and offering to  pay for these things to happen, we're cutting it off.  And this year, mark my words, is the year that that backlinking strategy and guest blogging is done.  Is that different from native advertising?  Yeah, that's different.

Because of mobile viewership, which of course is lower CPMs and fewer opportunities for placing ads.

Once the New York Times and CNN got on board with this stuff,  the advertisers looked at the results they get from this and it's much...  They say something like three to ten times better response rates.  They are now insisting on these ads.  Yes, because they're tricking readers.

Transcript:  There was a huge uproar when The Atlantic ran an editorial from...  Miss Cavage of Scientology.  And that's basically exactly what was going on here.  You could think of that as being basically a guest blog about Scientology.  And that was, of course, very poorly labeled as being an ad.  And it was very ugly and had a huge negative impact on that.  You know, that story publication has gone back for so long.  That's something people respect.  And they definitely crossed that line there.  And there are so many other companies now that are like,  oh, well, if The Atlantic's doing it, then I guess it's okay that we can do it as well.  And to me, it's definitely sad to see.  I think you're right.

Transcript:  It's sad that then you see the rise of paid journalism like what Jessica Lesson is doing.  So I don't know.  I think the market affords these types of things.  And people kind of can pay with their dollars.  They can decide if they want this kind of a thing.  They're going to pay for Jessica Lesson's type of journalism with her team.  Or you're going to settle for the kind of stuff that you're seeing,  what Tim was just referring to on The Atlantic.  And I think that's exactly what Matt Cutts is getting to as it relates to even just bloggers,  not even just like large scale Mashable and BuzzFeed,  which is, you know, we want to make the internet maybe a better place for content.  So that these blogs, maybe you've come to love and respect,  are actually putting out quality content that are great pieces.  You know, like I said, if Pat Flynn writes a really great piece on content strategy,  that's great.  And that brings real value to the internet.  But if someone's paying for that and then sticking in the content somewhere as a guest blog post  just to get backlinks to their website, then we all suffer from it.

Start time: 4015.70
End time: 4090.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the reason these things work, whether it's acknowledged or not,  is because they're essentially fooling people.  That people read it thinking it's editorial, give it greater weight than they would if they knew it was an ad.  That's actually exactly what the problem is.  It's about tricking people.  And I think when any brand starts doing that, they really cheapen the brand.  Now, I agree with you, Clayton.  The market will end up, I hope this will end up shaking out.  And you do see some really interesting moves towards paywalls with Jessica Lessend.  It's $400 to get the information a year.  I paid for it.  I'm not sure.  I love Jessica's stuff at the Wall Street Journal.  I think it's an interesting move for her.  And I'll watch with interest to see how she does.  But I'm not sure if the content is so compelling that it's worth $400 a month.  But maybe that's because I'm not an investor.  You look at Recode, which is Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg's recasting of All Things D under their own brand.  You look at what did Greenwald is doing.  The guy who broke the Snowden stuff, Pierre Omidar is giving him, I don't know how many millions of dollars.  $250, supposedly.  The same amount Jeff Bezos paid for the Washington Post.  $250 million to create, I don't know if it's a paywall.  Is it ad supported?  We don't know yet.

So it's $20 a year.  It's a tip jar.  It's not payment.  It's a subscription.  34,000 subscriptions generating more than $875,000 in revenue.  He'd set a goal for $900,000.

And I was excited about it.  I think my wife and I both subscribed to it.  But then when I started seeing that most of the articles were just repurposed,  associated, a lot of them were repurposed, associated press articles.  I can get that in eight other apps that I have.  I want to see original content.  I'm sorry.  They tried some interesting things there.  They hired some, during the Mississippi flooding,  they were actually the only company that they had it.  They hired a drone.  And they actually had aerial pictures of the flooding when no other news organization did.  So the Daily was trying some things.  It just was, I think, a flawed platform.

Transcript:  Right.  It's a question of who's paying, too. If you look at Jessica Less's content,  there's a good chance that a lot of her subscribers are actually being paid by their  employers. They're able to expense that expense $400 a year.  Whereas the daily was a personal expense for a lot of people.  So if you cross in that threshold where this is a professional expense,  something they can write off their taxes or something they can get their employer to pay,  then obviously that boundary, that threshold of what's acceptable goes up a lot higher.

Transcript:  We'll talk about the great firewall of China heading all of its traffic to,  we're a little town in Montana, I think. That was another  strange thing. But first, a word from FreshBooks. If you are a small business, you know that probably  the worst time of the year, or the month, I should say, is the end of the month when you've got to do  your invoicing. I always hated that. You know it's you if you're using Microsoft Word or Excel to  do your invoices. Do you have a shoe box of receipts that keep track of your expenses?  Right about now, you're digging them out, right? Tax time's coming. How about in 2014, turn to  turn over a new leaf and save time, get paid faster, keep track of all your stuff with FreshBooks.  The easy way to send invoices, manage expenses, track your time. It's a cloud accounting solution  that is so simple. I actually started using this in 2004 when I was invoicing a bunch of different  people for work I was doing, including Rogers in Canada. I had different currencies. I had Canadian  dollars. Amber MacArthur said, try FreshBooks with this new thing. I loved it. I loved it.  Easily create invoices online, capture and track expenses on the go, get real-time business reports  with a few simple clicks. You'll get paid faster. There's even, if you and your client agree, you  can have the invoicing and the payments automatically done by FreshBooks. There's even a pay me now  button in the email FreshBooks sends out. I mean, it's just really, really great. Put your business  in the palm of your hand free for 30 days at getfreshbooks.com. Here's a little way FreshBooks  is thanking Twit listeners who join up. Make sure when you see the how did you hear about as you  write this week in tech, can they write Twitly sir or just this week in tech? Write this week in tech  just for safe, because I want you to be in the drawing every day they're giving away a birthday  cake to somebody who signs up and says this week in tech for a new account. Getfreshbooks.com. We've  had the birthday cake. It's really good. It's not just like some grocery store cake. It's a really  good cake. Getfreshbooks.com. So apparently there was a misconfiguration. We think it was in the  great firewall of China that put as many as two thirds of the country out of action for several  hours. Oh, now I have to sign up for the Financial Times to read the rest of this story. Gosh, darn  you, paywalls. Let me see if- That stinks. Let me see if- If the system works.

Wow. Who owns the building? Perhaps the biggest failure in internet history.  So this company, this is basically a front. For what? The CIA? NSA? No, no, no.

So apparently, Sofidia, which is something a  little shady, a company that is based on paper in this Wyoming building, perhaps is, well,  it's controlled, they believe, by jailed former Ukrainian prime minister. And it's a company  charged with helping online poker operators evade gambling bans. Anyway, it's a very, this is from  the, this is actually a better article anyway, from the Bits blog in the New York Times. Apparently,  what happened was the people who run the Great Wall of China, one of the things that they do  is they block sites. They block Twitter, they block Facebook. Right. They also block proxy  services that people use to get around the Great Firewall of China. Right, and VPNs.  Technologists surmised that traffic, the Chinese internet sensors were trying to block traffic  to Sofidia, but mistakenly redirected all traffic from China to them. Nice. They flipped a bit.

Trash talk. But you  don't usually do it on camera to the networks. You do it. This is all the sports talk radio and  sports talk TV and ESPN talked about all week. OK, so that's the other theory is that Sherman knew  he's a very smart guy. Went to Stanford, very smart, very well spoken. He knew exactly what  he was doing. He got in a Twitter battle with Crabtree, right? What profit was it for him?  Because he's famous. He's been famous. Well, he's even more famous.

He's still freaking out, charged up. So if I if that just happened to  me, I don't know that I would have, you know, been able to calm down very calmly and just said,  well, Aaron, thank you very much for the question.

Because what he's managed to do, especially after that,  the choke signal and all that stuff, he drew so much attention to himself that you have to  know that the referees in their pre game meetings are going to say, we better keep an eye on this  guy. And they're going to keep an eye on this guy. And he's a major holder. He likes to hold  the receivers. He likes to he does a lot of pass interference. He gets away with a lot.  He is going to get called for at least two or three penalties that otherwise may not have been  held. I have to wonder what his teammates think, you know, apparently they don't care. They think  that's just richer. This way. That's the way it is. But that's just, you know, so I think that  Peyton and his boys are going to win that game. I'm moving to South Korea.

It's a very passionate country full of  passion for mostly Starcraft, but also for downloads and a hate for pre-installed apps,  which is great. I think that's something we can all aspire to.

Those things could also be covered by this ruling too, which could mean some pretty extensive  changes to these mobile operating systems to be able to rip those things out, much like  Microsoft had to rip out IE from, I think it was Windows 95 back in the day.

And of course, Apple wants to be president in South  Korea. So how exactly they're going to draw the line between, you know, quote unquote bloatware and  application or iOS functionality that remains to be seen. But certainly those things are our apps.

So they bought I-Pack and Palm. So a lot of patents related to mobile devices,  which is interesting because Qualcomm just released the talk, of course, which is,  they make components, but it's not too often that Qualcomm makes an actual device. Now they  bought a bunch of patents that all relate to devices, which makes me wonder if Qualcomm isn't  going to be making more devices in the future. That's a good one.

You chose Squarespace because it's easy to build a website. It's affordable to build a website.  You start with 20 beautiful templates. If you're doing...  If you want a site that looks great, if you're a photographer, an artist,  it's great for a portfolio because you want your site to be gorgeous.  You want your site to express your aesthetic. But at the same time,  you don't want to become a web developer. You don't want to learn JavaScript and CSS.  Well, you don't have to. Squarespace gives you the tools you need to make your site gorgeous easily.  Of course, it never goes down. That's a nice feature. You get hosting and software.  They've got their new Squarespace metric app. I don't know if you've tried this yet, Clayton.  It's iPhone and iPad ready. It lets you see the site stats in real time.  Page views...  Yeah, I've been using it recently.  It's so cool. Site unique visitors, social media follows.  They've got a great blog app too. They've really got... These guys are good.  The code is gorgeous.

And that's really what you want.  You don't want to have a different site because you're on an iPhone.  You want it to look great on all size screens.  You can try it for you. No credit card needed. Just go to squarespace.com  and you'll see the Get Started button. Browse around a little bit before you do.  They do have wonderful help. They have forums. They have webinars.  They can do workshops to make you better at it. All of that's free.  Their support comes from the Squarespace offices in New York.  So it's really good. These are the engineers who actually do work on it.  When you decide to sign up for Squarespace, make sure you use the offer code TWIT.  And the number one, TWIT1, and you'll get 10% off.  And they'll know that you saw it on This Week in Tech.  That's TWIT1 to sign up for Squarespace. It's free and you don't even need a credit card to try it.  But if you decide to buy, get 10% off and get that annual plan.  As little as eight bucks a month, you get a free domain name.  They've got e-commerce.

She was addicted for a while.  Yeah. They've trademarked the word candy.  Come on.  Come on. They got the trademark and they immediately started issuing take down requests  for any app that had the word candy in it. But apparently...  You're asking for trouble.  It's not even just apps. It defends against clone titles, which I think is legitimate.  There's a lot of clone titles, but I think they got it even more broadly than just apps.  So who knows? You may see...  This won't last.  Really? It seems like a generic word.  Apple actually emitted the take down requests on the king's behalf.  I guess that's part of the mechanism if you have a trademark.

Did you see the guy? We had a long debate on this on this week in Google about the guy  who wore glass into a movie, an AMC movie theater. Now, in his defense, he has  prescription glasses with Google Glass attached. In Columbus, Ohio, he's sitting there halfway  through the movie. A guy flashes a badge at him, says, come with me. Oh, grabs the glass  and says, come with me immediately. Turns out it's the Department of Homeland Security.  Yeah, that's weird.  Well, I don't think so because I think ICE, which is part of DHS, is the defense copyright  and trademark and stuff like that. They're the copyright police now because stealing a movie

But the theater owner have every right to throw him out,  just as they would if you were holding up a camcorder or even his phone and recording.  That's illegal. And so you took the side of the government on this idea because, frankly,  if you're going to be a glass hole, you should expect this kind of treatment.

I also made sure that I took it off if I ever went  into the men's room just to be, you know, to be cautious and be aware of those sorts of situations.  I didn't want to be, you know, I didn't want to create a scene. I didn't want to create any issues.  The only time that I wore glass that I was a little bit unsure about was through airport security,  but actually wanted to see what the reaction would be through airport security. And actually  everybody was fine in that case. And I checked my rights before going in there. And I knew that I  could do that legally. But certainly going into a movie theater, I think is asking for trouble,
