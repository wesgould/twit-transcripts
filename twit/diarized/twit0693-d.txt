The show where we cover the week's tech  news with the best tech journalists I can round up on short notice. And no,  just kidding. With the best tech journalists in the business like this guy  right here, Larry Maggott has been doing it longer than anybody. CBS News Radio,  connect safely.org and an old friend, a good dear friend, not old friend. Hello  Larry, good to see you. Oh, too. Great hair you notice. Back from his tour  of Europe, you were, you visited the House of Lords. I did. I visited,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I visited the House, had lunch at the House of Lords. I have a friend who's,  who's in the House of Lords. It's a lifetime position. So as long as she's  alive, I'll have a friend at the House of Lords. And then we went over to  Brussels to do some meeting with the European Commission down to Luxembourg,  also for European Commission. Then off to Paris for the Internet Governance  Forum and also GovTech. It was tech week in Paris along with, you know,  so right, literally hours after Trump left, I went to a meeting that Justin  Trudeau spoke out. He, he has got, of all the people I've, I didn't interview  him, but of all the people I have been around in the tech world and policy,  he probably knows more than Al Gore. And Al Gore at the time was pretty good.  And then after that, Macron, Emmanuel Macron spoke at the Internet Governance  Forum and basically said, there are two kinds of Internet. So there's the  California Internet where government is basically has nothing to do with it.  It's laissez-faire and there's the China Internet where the government controls  it. And Macron wants the Internet to be somewhere between the California  Internet and the China Internet.  That's an interesting thought.  With government control or government involvement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. Tim Cook came out, I think tonight on Axios is going to say,  you know, he acknowledges that regulation is coming. So I think that Macron  is probably right.

Start time: 222.98
End time: 259.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And Cook agrees.  Cook is, I think, one of the first people to say we have two Internets.  Well, very interesting. Welcome.  And I will introduce the rest of the panel before we get into the heavy conversation.  But that's an interesting topic. Georgia Dow is also here for mymore.com.  It's always a thrill. Hello, Georgia.  She's senior editor over there at Georgia Dow.  She's also, and we need her more than ever, a psychotherapist  who creates great videos about reducing anxiety, sleeping better, raising your kids  at anxiety-videos.com. Hello, Georgia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hello. We have two new videos actually.  So we have, well, we have like we're starting the master series,  which is more for like businesses and getting ahead and just leading a better life.  So we have one on emotional intelligence and that's about, what do your emotions mean?  What do other people's emotions mean?  What is this social engineering?  Why do people want certain things?  And then we have another one for conflict and that one's on conflict resolution.  So how can you get into a conflict with someone and actually make it a win-win  or even make your relationship better because you had a disagreement with someone.  So it's just kind of how does not get stuck in being defensive or reactive  and how you can deal with it.

Transcript:  And you do these with Sandra Reich.  Yeah, I do.  Who's also a therapist and you're both at the Montreal Center for Anxiety and Depression.  So that's anxiety-videos.com.  You make households.  Yeah, really.  You need to be around here.  I'm going to be a billionaire.  Hey, that's Brianna Wu, candidate for Congress in the Massachusetts 8th District.  It still says that as your lower third.  Are we going to leave that up?  I think we should.  So Brianna was primaried out by her Democratic opponent,  who did in fact win his seat back in Congress.  He was the incumbent, but you say you're not giving up.  Nope.

End time: 389.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I never give up Georgia.  That's right.  No, we got over 17,000 votes.  That is amazing for a first-time candidate.  We had a very small team and I always, I said from the beginning  when I started running that I was probably going to have to run twice.  You have a very, very small chance of winning your first time.  And my goal was always, you know, be an engineer, get all my mistakes  out of the way, figure out how to do this.  And, you know, we're already gearing up for 2020.  It's amazing how much more I know at this point.  I know how to file FEC reports.  I know how leaders in every single town.  I know how to give a speech.  I know how to raise money.  I know like leaders in every single part of my district.  So, you know, I'm in a 2020 to absolutely win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to say how brave that is because of course Brianna was also  very well-known victim of a gamer git.  I know you don't particularly want to talk about that.  But for you to stay in the public eye when probably every bone in your  body said let's just hide shows how much guts you have.  And so are you, so you're going to, you already filed for 2020?

Start time: 416.56
End time: 466.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We already did.  We're already listed with the FEC.  And one of the things, Leah, I was talking to you about this before the  show, one of the mistakes I made is I hired people like I did in my game studio.  We hired a lot of people straight out of college and gave them jobs.  And we all figured out how to make software together.  And that works well in engineering because you're developing  something new every single time.  But with politics, this is one of those fields that there's  innovation, but some of the basics.  You just can't disrupt your way around.  You know, you've got to shake hands.  You've got to meet people.  So this time around, right.  Well, I mean, you've got to get off the computer out into the real world.  So one of the lessons I've learned is you've got to hire people with experience.  And that's exactly what we've done this time around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, and I was talking before the show about this, but I have  experience with friends who've run for office and you're exactly right.  The first time you're unknown, an unknown quantity.  The second time you're known and it often name recognition is a sadly  a huge part of why people win.  I was talking to somebody about the Petaluma mayoral race.  And she said she was going to vote for one of the candidates.  I said, why?  She said, because well, she has the most lawn signs.  And honestly, I don't think that's an outlier.  It really name recognition is a lot of it.  So I'm good.  I'm glad to hear you're not giving up.  You're going to continue to run.  Now we have Brianna Wu 2018.com is the website.  That's gone.

Start time: 506.02
End time: 523.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's still up.  We finally got Brianna Wu for Congress.  So we are actually building that right now.  Last time around, we went with a, again, we went with the  disruptor nation builder.  We're going to work with the tried and true NGP van this time.  So someone on my team is migrating that currently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will say this, and this isn't all seriousness Leo and hold me to the standard.  I have talked to really high quality documentary journalists.  And one of the things I've committed to is, you know, if I am fortunate enough  to win in 2020, I want to bring people in and kind of show the American people.  The sausage.  What happens if you call up the house minority and majority leader and  try to get bills passed, what's really going on in Washington.  And I want to open things up, especially on the technology subcommittee.

Start time: 625.44
End time: 691.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The smoke's bad.  It is.  So on health levels are over 200.  It's just under 200 right now, but it has been over 200 for the last couple of days.  So we're inside with our molecule air purifier running full bore and we have a couple at home.  We had turned them all the way up and just try to stay inside and it's tough.  I wasn't paying too much attention to it.  I thought, oh, I'm strong.  I'm robust.  And on Thursday we had, we were putting up the Christmas lights and I just got, I had just got an electric bike.  So I went on a bike ride.  None of this with a mask.  I woke up Friday morning.  I thought I'd smoked a carton of cigarettes.  I was coughing and I was, it was terrible.  And I realized, no, I am not immune.  And when it gets to, when the levels get that high, everybody, everybody's health is impacted.  So that's a big deal.  That's minor compared to the people who people lost their homes, lost their lives, people lost their lives.  And we don't know how many, but a thousand people are missing.  Yeah.  God, that is a terrifying number.

Start time: 692.52
End time: 705.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, I mean, I think about, I was in Mississippi for Katrina and you know, about a 1800 people died for that.  So you think about at just this point, it's already 1000.  That's, it's really scary, you know.

Start time: 705.52
End time: 705.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 709.37
End time: 821.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's just our little corner of the world.  There's sadness all over.  So we're going to focus on the good.  Like Facebook.  Facebook.  Now I, you know, this article in the New York Times, delay, deny and deflect how Facebook's leaders fought through crisis.  Came out just, I think it was on Wednesday.  And it is one of those stories by, you know, one, two, three, four, five, New York Times reporters.  They say 50 sources, you know, very well sourced.  It's one of those stories where it's inside the boardroom, inside the offices.  So I always have a little nervous when I read that kind of story, you know, any story that has the lead.  Cheryl Sandberg was seething inside Facebook's Menlo Park, California headquarters, top executives gathered in the glass walled conference room at Sander, Mark Zuckerberg, etc.  etc.  I'm always a little skeptical about articles like that.  And indeed Facebook has said that many points in this article, it got wrong.  But I get the sense that the general thrust of it is not wrong, which is that Facebook went on a public relations offensive.  After the 2016 election and even to the point where they hired a fairly sketchy company, which they have, by the way, since let go that attempted to blame George Soros.  Unbelievable.  It was called it's definers public affairs.  Facebook says now, oh yeah, we did use them, but we didn't know what they did or would do and we have fired them since.  But this is very much the Facebook playbook, which is, you know, slash and burn and apologize later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Start time: 823.58
End time: 886.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I don't know how much I credit.  I'll be honest with you.  I abandoned Facebook months ago.  And you stayed away, Leo.  Yeah.  Well, yes and no.  Okay.  So this is one of the challenges of being a tech journalist is it is the story.  I didn't kill my account.  I deactivated it and I had to reactivate it to buy.  I'm sorry to say I'm embarrassed to say a Facebook portal.  Yeah, you bought one.  Yeah, I got two of them.  They're coming.  Facebook charged my card.  At first I looked and I said, oh good.  They I something went wrong.  They didn't but no, they charged my card.  So I will have to have a Facebook presence and I just gave him some hundreds of dollars.  Yeah, and they're not cheap.  But we got a but I feel like we I don't know.  At first I thought we should review it.  So I bought it because that's our job.  Then I thought nobody's going to buy this right.  Then I saw that Android center of view, which said it's my favorite way to voice chat.  So I don't know somebody in the chat room says I should move.  I should move before they deliver them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I have some thoughts on this.  You one of the things that really struck me in this piece is, you know, I don't know  Sheryl Sandberg personally, but she's certainly friendly with a lot of people that I know.  Like if you're a woman in tech, you're you've got connections to Sheryl Sandberg one way  or another.  And I I was so disappointed with her role in this.  And one of my main takeaways is, you know, Sheryl Sandberg is someone really associated  with Democratic politics associated with my party.  But here she is going out and hiring a really sketchy right wing firm to attack critics  of Facebook with what I think most of us would agree are anti-Semitic attacks.  And I really think it I think it speaks to a problem I've seen in the valley where  some people there's almost a perception that like if you're on Team Democrat, like  you're fine and that's the end of the story.  And I think like with with Sheryl Sandberg, this is really why you have to give more  scrutiny than that.  Does does that make sense to you just because you're a Democrat and you write a book about  women in tech?  It doesn't mean you're fighting for the right things.  And I really think this article shows that.

Start time: 978.78
End time: 1017.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the part of the problem we have in this country is treating politics like team sports.  Yeah, that you're on.  That's my team, right or wrong.  And I have to tell you right now, even though the Democrats control the House, if if they  make it all about stopping Donald Trump instead of making good policy, there's a lot to do  in this country actually that they will be just as bad as the other guys.  And it isn't my team, right or wrong.  There's a lot of work to be done and the work needs to be done.  And I honestly think the electorate feels the same way.  It would be a huge mistake at this point.  So back to Cheryl.  I know Cheryl.

Start time: 1018.27
End time: 1074.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do know her quite well.  And she and I court, you know, I haven't talked to her about this particular New York Times  article, but we correspond back and forth.  And I'm on Facebook Safety Advisory Board.  So in a way, I'm a little bit close to the company.  And what I can say, and there's some things I can't say, but what I can't say is that  they're conflicted.  There are within the company different forces and around a lot of issues.  And there's just a great deal of conflict as to what is right and what isn't.  I was actually in Europe when this article came out, so I didn't focus on it.  But on other issues, they often actually try to do the right thing, but wind up screwing  it up.  And again, I can't say that's true here, but it wouldn't surprise me if somebody didn't  properly vet this PR agency.  I mean, I'm not saying I'm not getting Zuckerberg and Sandberg off the hook, but it wouldn't  surprise me if they just didn't know what was going on.  We've seen a number of articles about Facebook employees having lost.

Start time: 1075.64
End time: 1101.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me give you the headline from the Business Insider.  Facebook employees react to the latest scandal.  Why does our company, now I've got an ad on top of it.  I guess Business Insider has just put up a fence, a paywall.  Sorry, Business Insider.  I guess I won't be reading that headline.  Why does our company seem to lack a moral compass is what it said.  Go ahead, Georgia.

Start time: 1101.86
End time: 1148.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that there's just a huge need for some radical responsibility.  When she said that she didn't know what was happening in the company.  Being unaware does not mean you're not responsible.  So if I was unaware that my child threw a ball in the neighbor's window and broke it,  it doesn't mean that I'm not responsible for the damage of which that does.  So then if I continue to be unaware, if my child keeps on breaking windows for say,  let's say three years, then they'd call me negligent or like willfully unaware and call social services.  And then when people find out that I was actually getting paid because I own a window repair shop and getting millions of dollars.  This is a very apt analogy.  Maybe there's more purposeful behavior in the fact that I closed my eyes and didn't really know what my kids were up to.

Start time: 1153.40
End time: 1177.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that they both, if you run a company, you are responsible for what your company does.  And you saying that I don't know means either you should not be heading the company,  but either way you should still pay the price and make sure that you take care of it as quickly as possible.  But you can't wait for three years and then say, you know what?  I really did try to take, you know, take a lot of responsibility to make sure that that happened.  And they didn't really even fix the problem.  You know, we still have.

Start time: 1178.20
End time: 1180.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  I think you and the problems continue.  You're right.  The problems continue it.  And even the whole Cambridge Analytica stuff that they should have known that in fact, when they announced originally that they were putting it in,  you know, have an app economy.  I happen to be at that press conference and I asked Zuckerberg, what are you going to do when some of these apps start violating your policies?  And he had no answer for that.  And it was obvious.  You know, it didn't.  There was no reason why he had to wait for that crisis.  He could have figured that out years before it happened.

Start time: 1207.36
End time: 1241.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  This is this is what this is what really gives me a lot of pause here.  Yeah, I agree with you.  At first, I was like, how could they not know that?  But my friend Eileen Carey, she's actually done this kind of work professionally before.  She's a really good friend.  And she told me and this is on Twitter.  Anyone can see her thread that this kind of keeping the CEO and the person hired you out of the loop.  That is very much by design.  That is how you do it.  So your fingerprints are quote unquote clean.  So to me, I don't think that really.

Start time: 1242.14

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They gave back the money.  Right.  They didn't say, you know what?  This is wrong.  So now we're going to give back the money and try to, you know, use that money that we got from ill-gotten gains to be able to do something good with it.  They're like, you know what?  We're going to keep the money.  That's all good.  And we're going to say, I'm sorry.  And unfortunately, it's true.  We have very short attention spans.  We kind of we will grab our pitchforks and and run out there until the pitchfork gets too heavy or there's something else that we need to pitchfork.  And so I think that that's what they were hoping for is that people would end up forgetting and then going back to Facebook.  And if you look at Facebook's numbers, yeah, it's been dwindling, but it isn't the amount of people that have, you know, left Facebook that really it should be if they understood what was happening.  And that makes me feel kind of bitter and angry.

Transcript:  Let me read you since you didn't follow this Larry so closely when you're in Europe, but let me read to you from the Thursday article in the New York Times about this firm, Definer's Public Affairs.  They are a, apparently, an opposition research firm.  They were hired in the days before Sandberg was to testify to Congress back in September.  And they were hired pretty apparently to target the 15 members of the Senate Intelligence Committee that were going to question her.  In one document circulated a reporters Definer's tallied what software the 15 members of the Intelligence Committee used to track visitors to their Senate websites.  This was given to the press as a way to undermine these senators.  Another document detailed how much each senator spent on Facebook ads, how much they'd received in campaign donations for Facebook or other big tech companies.  This there's no way Sandberg did not know who they were hiring and what they were going to do.  This is what they do.  This is what Definer's does.  And for Facebook and Sandberg now to apologize and say, oh that we didn't know and we fired them strikes me as disingenuous.

There's very much I think a backlash from young people.  Oh, yeah.  Older people I think are I don't think many people love Facebook, but I think older people are more reluctant to delete it because that's how they stay in touch with distant friends and family.

And the other thing I did is I kind of put more stuff on my blog.  Because I wanted so that way if people really want to know they go to my site and they can see stuff.

So I'm actually almost done with Twitter and like that's my last social media.

What I did do is I had an account where I was just posting links and I kept that alive and I deleted anything that wasn't news any fall.  I didn't follow anybody.  That's not just a news organization.  And if I I do feel like I need to have if some if something big happens, I need to be able to go and see what they're saying about on Twitter.

Transcript:  But Leah, that's where I think in first of all, like for a personal decision anyone decides to leave Twitter and Facebook more power to you.  It's a great decision.  Like Georgia said, these sites are not great for you.  But you know, maybe you'll Leo, you're such a bastion in the tech industry.  You can probably leave Twitter and it's not going to affect you as much as someone's getting started today in the tech industry.  You've got to be on these sites to network.  You've got to be on Facebook meeting people.  You've got to be on Twitter meeting people.  And I think it's really hard to not do that.  As a candidate, you probably do too, right?  I do. I have to run ads on Facebook.  I hate it.  In my campaign sat down and had a really hard talk with me for 2020 after having that come to Jesus meeting about what went well and what went wrong.  We have to spend more time on Facebook because 80 percent of people in our district have accounts there.  And I put in a hate.  No, I was just going to say I hate that I'm part of the problem because I'm feeding this monster.  I'm doing it to specifically regulate Facebook, which is what I'm going to do.  But, you know, I also want to say what really troubled me is this story troubled me.  But what troubled me a lot more, Leo, was Mike Isaac's story that came out today talking about Mark Zuckerberg's response to the company after this news broke.  And it's a short article.  I invite anyone to read it.  And the points of it are really frustrating.  It is basically Zuckerberg going on telling his employees that Facebook is the real victim here.  It is emphasizing that they are going to fire anyone that talks to the press.  It says that Facebook thinks they should just lay their heads down low and wait until things to blow over and people to go chase another car.  They don't really acknowledge doing harm to our democracy.  And their only real concern about this story is that some of their employees care.  It's affecting their morale.  And Georgia, I'd love to know what you think.  But to me, this feels like this feels like this is a company that is not incentivized to change their behavior.  And I think it's not realistic to expect anything to change.

Start time: 1831.18
End time: 1875.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that you're absolutely right.  I don't think that it is there in their best interest to change.  I don't think that they want to.  I think that they're hoping that it will blow over.  The last time that they for the Cambridge Analytica, they ended up spending a lot of money to donate to different politicians in hopes that they get away with not having to be regulated and people looking over what they're doing.  And we need that.  We need people to look over these companies to make sure that they're still taking care of the people because in the end, like I understand, Facebook's a company.  They want to make money.  And Zuckerberg is not known for being the most empathic and thoughtful with the way that he deals with his responses and the people that are there to say the least of that.  And so without regulation, and that's what they don't want.  That's what they need.

Start time: 1876.60
End time: 1888.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, you're right about Zuckerberg, but I know people in Facebook and maybe that's what he's talking about.  I know folks at Facebook much lower down the food chain who really do think about these issues and are really bothered by these issues.

Maybe Brianna has to others have to because it's the only place they can meet family and friends the only way they can run for Congress.

Transcript:  And Larry, I agree with you.  There are definitely a lot of people.  I know people that work at Facebook that are caring thoughtful people.  But that's what he's doing.  He's taking the people that have voice that they're upset and instead of fixing the problem, he's saying well, you better not get caught saying anything.  I better not find out because they'll be held to pay for it.  And so it's just putting pressure on people that are just trying to make a living and do it in a way that they can feel good about it.

Transcript:  And George, I want to add something on to that.  You know, it's one thing if Apple's firing someone for talking about iPhone and leaking an iPhone as far as I see it, that is Apple's prerogative.  But Facebook is shipping the information that we need to run our democracy.  This is hand in hand with government.  It's hand in hand with news.  And there needs to be public accountability.  So I really feel like it's a different use case for Facebook to just be threatening anyone that talks to the New York Times when the New York Times is reporting things that they're doing that are so harmful for our democracy.  Leo, I completely agree with what you said.  This is gut check time.  This is time for everyone that looks at Facebook to look in the mirror and to ask themselves who they are.  What are you supporting?  What are you building?  What are you empowering?  Is this good for the world?  And in Silicon Valley, you can go get a job in five seconds.  This is not going to stop until people that work there, like, choose to stop working there.

This one, though, I want somebody to explain this point five Android.  Tim Cook has consistently criticized our business model and Mark has been equally clear.  He disagrees.  So there's been no need to employ anyone else to do this for us.  And we've long encouraged our employees and executives to use Android because it is the most popular operating system.  I think Donald Trump would say.  I don't understand what that what are the point of they making there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are they saying don't use Apple because we don't like Tim Cook and he's our chief critic.  And by the way, since Tim Cook is we don't need to hire anybody with a conscience at our company.  What the hell is this statement?  It's just bizarre.

Transcript:  But I will say on the sex trafficking side, they have done a good job.  I mean, that's the area where I wait a minute.  You better explain that.  Okay, slow down, buddy.  The area that I work with Facebook and their safety advisory board is around child safety.  Yes.  And in that area, I think they have worked really hard.  Now, I'm not saying they're perfect, but they have done a lot to employ what's called photo DNA and other technologies to try to cut back on child sex trafficking.

Start time: 2110.94
End time: 2151.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not at all thinking that Facebook has an easy job because everybody, a billion and a half, maybe two billion now people use Facebook.  That's almost impossible to edit and control.  You're a platform.  You know, I do not envy them.  I think in a way, the difficulties they face are in the nature of their success.  And I'd say the same thing about Twitter.  I also think these are intractable problems.  You're never going to get all terrorists, all sex trafficking, all anything off Facebook.  It's too big of a challenge.  Same thing with Twitter.  So I don't know what the answer is.

Start time: 2152.06
End time: 2179.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they hate speech is a real challenge because they're kind of up against.  They're also up against free speech issues and trying to figure out, try to keep the ADL happy on one side and the ACLU happy on the other.  And trying to balance that one is difficult.  So, you know, again, I'm not deeply ingrained in this current controversy.  I'm not here to defend Facebook at all.  But I will say in the little area that I work, which is the child safety area, I think they have made some progress.  So that's about as far as I can go.

Start time: 2179.10
End time: 2223.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's an area you know firsthand about.  And I admire for them.  It'd be my guess that, I mean, basically they have the Aegean stables here and there's no Hercules to clean these out.  You have literally an insurmountable problem that is based on what you're doing and the success of what you're doing.  And it would be my guess that Facebook knows this.  They know that's not fixable.  So what they've chosen is, look, we're going to do the best we can.  We're going to defend what we're doing as best we can.  And we're going to keep on doing what we're doing because that's the business.  And by the way, that attitude would explain everything.

Start time: 2223.86
End time: 2264.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, the only thing that bothers me about that, Leo, is that it's kind of like that too large to fail argument.  Oh, yeah.  Which I do understand.  But what you're saying is that, well, you know what?  We have too many people to be able to control it.  And then it just makes me want to say, well, then have a smaller pool of people that are on Facebook.  Not going to happen.  If you have a party, it won't unless legislation comes down to say that, you know what?  You're going to have to pay money towards anyone that's, you know, whatever inciting violence or harassment or whatever it might be.  But, you know, you have a party and it's too big to control that, you know, the violence that happens at your party.  Have a smaller party and if not, pay the price for the people that then have to clean up the mess.

Start time: 2265.02
End time: 2354.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I think you're dead on.  And, you know, I thought Tim Cook, he said this so perfectly the other day.  In fact, the speech I give on this, I pretty much, you know, we look at his points there because it was so well said.  You know, I am personally not a pro-regulation kind of person when it comes to technology because I don't think Washington can keep up with the technology industry.  But the fact is here, you know, Facebook really plays such a huge role in our democracy.  There was Russian interference with our election.  There's consistent misinformation.  We've had teenagers go and commit suicide after bullying that they've gotten on this platform.  You know, they are putting media organizations out of business.  They've lied about the number of video views that things have gotten like causing industries to pit to pit to pivot to video.  And then, you know, like journalists lose their jobs over the decisions Facebook makes.  This is a company that impacts all of us in huge ways.  And the truth is this is our country and we can regulate the things that operate here like Facebook.  And if we don't get this under control, I really I know this is a strong statement, but I genuinely believe Facebook as is currently run is the biggest threat to democracy in America.

Start time: 2355.70
End time: 2409.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would say there's three paths here.  There's the Facebook could.  Attempt to prevent all of this and that I think is impossible because it's a judgment call.  Face could be forced to do that and still impossible.  Facebook could dissolve, disband, change its business model, like Georgia says, maybe be a small little boutiquey kind of social network.  That's not going to happen.  So given that none of those are in any way viable, Facebook is choosing the only option it has, which is just as fast as you can appease government because we can't even if they regulate us, we can't do it.  Pretend we're trying to control all this stuff, say all the right things whenever possible.  But meanwhile, our business has to continue.  So no business is going to put a nail in its own coffin.

Transcript:  A few months ago, Facebook made a change in the algorithm so that what you see on your feed today is going to be more the friends that you interact with in less immediate organizations.  Well, actually, I think it worked in a negative way.  I'm actually finding Facebook more boring because every time I log in, I see the same people, the same sometimes the same post that I saw yesterday.  By the way, they knew it would be more boring.

Start time: 2432.40
End time: 2439.72

Start time: 2440.46
End time: 2465.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's my point is that to some extent, by making it, quote, safer, they've actually made it less interesting.  And I don't know what the happy medium is or the solution is.  But the fact is that people want to yell at each other.  People you know, it's not Facebook didn't create trolls.  Facebook didn't create.  No, they just weaponized us.  They enabled people to weaponize them.  And believe me, there are plenty of people who are.  And I'm not responsible.

Start time: 2465.68
End time: 2493.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If my thesis is correct, Larry, Facebook did what it did under pressure from government and users.  They're going to do it until people look away and they're going to go right back to the way that works.  The best for them gets the most engagement because that's their business model.  And this is my point is Facebook is going to deflect, deny, agree to whatever it can to keep people from regulating it, from leaving.  But ultimately, they know what works and they're going to keep doing what works.

There are more and more people are on Instagram, on WhatsApp.  And so the service, what they call the blue service, Facebook, that could actually dwindle at some point and not necessarily the company.

We just want them to do things in a way they're less destructive to the rest of us.

End time: 2794.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't.  But I do think we can make it.  I think there are two factors here.  The fact that they bought Instagram really deeply concerns me.  It's the exact same playbook that Microsoft used in the 90s.  And, you know, Leo, you and I are both old enough.  We've seen tech giants come and go.  We saw IBM buy Red Hat, you know, last week.  You know, IBM was what they wrote about in 2001.  Like that was the villain.  1984, right?  Right.  Coca-Cola by the water companies and juice companies.  What worries me about Facebook?  I'm sure Facebook is going to eventually fall because the exact instant there's a competitor  I can go by to move off of it.  And I think other people will too.  But what concerns me is the anti-competitive behavior at the start of the show.  Leo, you were talking about how younger people tend to not be on Facebook.  You're right, because they're on Instagram.  That's a much higher percentage of younger people.  Facebook.  There was another very promising social media startup that my friend Taylor over at the  Atlantic wrote about that basically loops video.  Facebook literally just copied it and put it right out.  So I don't worry about people moving from Facebook.  What I do worry about is Facebook continuing their anti-competitive tactics in the social  media space that will be impossible to escape from basically leaders with this kind of  fundamentally morally broken compass.

Transcript:  It is such an interesting conversation and I just don't know what the answer is.  And I should really, if you're going to be fair, there's all sorts of amazing success  stories that come straight out of social media, including Facebook and Twitter.  And there's a lot of things very positive, very good, as well as very bad because it's  like life.  And so you can't be all tarred with the same brush.  However, I do feel it's a little bit of a problem.  We got to figure this out.  Right.  We all agree on that.  Let's take a break.  Brianna Wu is with us.  You know what?  We went to your website and it's they've taken it down.  They did over at Nation Builder.

Give this to yourself.  Master class.  I don't know how they did it.  Got the biggest names in the world to teach classes on their disciplines.  Imagine learning tennis from Serena Williams.  Basketball from Steph Curry.  Chess from Gary Kasparov.  Poker from Daniel Negrano.  Helen Mirren teaching acting.  My friend Steve Martin teaches you how to be funny.  I mean, this is amazing.  Frank Gehry on architecture.  Annie Leibovitz on photography.  Diane von Furstenberg on fashion.  And incidentally, this isn't like, oh, he does a 15-minute.  These are classes that are full, rich, beautifully shot.  Actually, I'm going to go into my account because I can show you some of the classes  that I'm paying attention to.  What do you, oh, how about this one?  Samuel L. Jackson.  I love this one.  Teaching acting.  One of the things he does in this and so let's close this out, but just so you  could see this is not just, this is an, look how many lessons it is.  This is 21 lessons.  There's a class workbook.  He does a Q&A.  He has office hours.  This is not, this is a real class.  One of the things he does, which is fantastic, breaking down a script.  They take a script from Pulp Fiction.  They take that scene in the restaurant from Pulp Fiction.  Let me turn the audio off.  And he takes acting students and he literally goes through it with them  and talks about motivate, this is, you can't pay for this.  This is, this is like mind bogglingly good.  It's so well shot.  It's so well done.  That you're going to put it on the big screen and just enjoy it like a  documentary if it's, you know, I mean cooking from the best chefs in the  world, this is so amazing.  There's, I can't sell you hard enough on this.  I was going to give it to my son for Christmas and he said, I already got  it for myself, which is kind of a bummer.  He's, he's an aspiring chef and it has really great cooking stuff.  Gordon Ramsey has a class.  Alice Waters, Wolfgang Puck.  So I mean you're learning cooking from the best chefs in the world.  Martin Scorsese teaching film directing.  David Mamet teaching playwriting.  I mean, oh my God, you want to learn how to lay down beats?  Deadmau5 has a class.  I'm making music.  I can't, I just, I just, I love this and I just want you to go.  Now we've got, of course, as always, I'm going to go ahead and  I think this is a very good deal for you.  If you go to masterclass.com slash twit, unlock access to every  masterclass for a year.  That is one of the things I think is really important.  When I first went there, you know, I bought one and I thought, oh, wait a  minute, I want, oh, I want that.  You're going to want them all.  So unlock them all 35 world-class masters and it's a very low annual price.  I think you're going to like it.  And what a great gift.  Masterclass.com slash twit, unlimited access to masterclass.

And I'll tell you the other reason, which is completely self-serving.  If you subscribe to this and you hate it, they don't send email to  masterclass.  They yell at me.  Right?  Cause my friend Leo told me about it.  What, you know, if your friend told you, oh, you gotta, you know, you  gotta buy a molecule air purifier.  So you don't breathe fire and it was terrible.  You wouldn't yell at molecule.  You'd come to your friend Leo and say, what are you talking about this thing?  Fortunately, we only accept good advertisers.  Occasionally.

It's so expensive.  Let's take a break.  We got to pay.  We got to pay for the Anki robot for Georgia here.  Our show today brought to you by rocket mortgage.  If you're about to buy a house or you need a mortgage to  buy a robot.  No, they don't do more cut mortgage robot.  More.  It might ask you it may start but not right now quick and  loans number one lender in the country number one in a  couple of ways number one in customer satisfaction.  That's according to JD Power for the last eight years in a  row and now thanks to that they are now as of last December  number one in volume.  I think it makes sense.  If you serve customers, if you focus on the customer  experience people are going to love you and they're going to  come back.  They're going to tell their friends.  That's exactly what happens with rocket mortgage.  Let me let me tell you about actually this is quick and loans  product for nerds for geeks people like us rocket mortgage  because it's an entirely online mortgage approval process.  So already, you know, I'm in favor of it.  I don't want to go to the bank get dressed up fill out in a  big long application and then the bank sends you home and  says do homework.  You got to find paperwork and bank statements from last year  and pay stubs from your previous employer.  That's crazy.  Instead rocket mortgage you fire it up go to rocket mortgage  dot-com slash twit to you can even do it on your phone rocket  mortgage dot-com slash twit to and you begin the power buying  process step one.  With literally just a few questions no long application.  They will check your credit and they will say here's the loans  for which you qualify you choose the term the rate the down  payment.  They have very good rates a variety of them.  You pick the one you want and now you've got pre-qualified  approval.  That was less than 10 minutes good enough.  So they if you're at an open house, you could do it right  there and show the realtor say we want to make an offer.  But then the next step quick step to quick and loans will  verify your income assets and credit usually without any  intervention on your part because they have relationships  with all the banks and everything they get all the  information they need and in less than 24 hours.  They give you verified approval.  You get a letter even you could print out show the seller  that makes you basically a cash buyer.  The seller looks at that goes other good for it.  They got the loan already that puts you right at the front  of the line.  You're way ahead of all those other people were saying I'd  like to buy your house, but it's contingent on me getting  a loan.  No, you got verified approval step 3 once you're verified  you qualify for something new and this is because rates are  starting to tick up rocket mortgage quick and loans again  thinking about the customer experience.  It makes you nervous if the rates are going up.  You're kind of in a hurry because if you wait if it's not  the perfect house you want to look at some more the rates  could go up and it could cost you thousands of dollars more  even if the price hasn't changed just because the rate  went up.  So once you're verified you qualify for rate shield approval.  This is awesome.  They lock your rate for up to 90 days while you shop three  months.  So you have plenty of time to look your rate cannot go up  rates in the real world could go up your rate is locked.  Here's they need to have to do this, but I like this if rates  go down your rate will go down.  So can only it's only one direction.  It's either down or flat.  It can never go up.  I love that.  Now you have three months to find the right house instead of  rushing.  This is exactly why quick and loans is the largest and best  mortgage lender in the country rocket mortgage.  You could start right now rocket mortgage.com slash twit  number two rocket mortgage.com slash twit and the number two.  That's all one word rocket mortgage.com slash twit to  rate shield approval is only valid on certain 30-year  purchase transactions additional conditions or exclusions  may apply.  This is based on quick and loans data in comparison to public  data records equal housing lender actually that's important  licensed in all 50 states and MLS consumer access.org number  You don't have to remember all that just remember rocket  mortgage.com slash twit to if you're if you think you're  going to go out house hunting or you want to refi go there  right now set up the account.  You'll be ready rocket mortgage.com slash twit and the  number two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's much better.  But like VR is not relaxing.  It's exhausting like you're playing you're moving.  It's not if you're having a long day at work.  I don't want to play VR.  I want to sit and have something mindless that I can just  play VR.  It's I'm I'm tired and it causes more anxiety.  So if you're already dealing with a high anxiety day VR  does not fit into your day.  Then it's not one of those kind of soothing reactions to  that and I think that a lot of people will expect it to  be the same thing as a sit-down video game where you  can kind of enjoy killing orcs or doing something else  that you're having fun to and I don't find that like  walking around ducking running hacking and slashing all  through like 45 minutes and then I'm I'm like done like  I can play maybe for an hour and a half and then I don't  want to play anymore and then I need to take a break  because I've burned through like I don't know what 5000  calories or something.

They certainly are the most valuable company in the world  not a trillion dollar company anymore, but still very very  valuable and the stock price of course has gone up 10 or  20 fold but from a technological point of view, I think you  could make the case that really their best days are in the  past that you know financially know but technologically.

Transcript:  Leo I've upgraded my iPhone every single year.  I bought the iPhone 3G.  That's where I did it for 4s 5 5s all the way through and I  got the phone this year and it was really surprising because  it wasn't sold on it.  I was like I'll wait till I see it at the Apple Store and I  stopped by and I saw it.  This is like just two days after it came out and they had a  ton of stock at my local Apple Store and I bought it and I  got the plus and I've never taken an Apple iPhone back to  stick with the old one before ever because I'm a huge Apple  fan, but it's just impossible to justify this year's iPhone  from the 10th.  Yeah, there's it's not it's not like the large one.  I feel doesn't bring anything better to the experience the  phone itself like the deep learning stuff.  I'm sure it will be great two or three years from now, but  it's just this is really been the first year.  I don't think they brought anything to the market with the

So if I were to buy an iPhone that's the one I get but actually  I love the Google Pixel 3.  It's my favorite.  Have you played with the night site yet?  Yeah, I just did yesterday as a matter of fact, and I was at  my son was doing a concert in San Francisco and I it was  a very dark room and the only problem is they made his hair  look red and he doesn't have red hair.  But other than that, I'm looking pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The things that they're doing that's a filter so nightsite  you take they take many many images.  This is so this is a very historically very hard picture  for me to take.  This is our Christmas lighting on our house and the problem  with this kind of lighting is it blows out, you know, either  the camera exposes for the lighting in which case everything's  pitch black or it exposes for the background in which case  the lighting is blowing out.  This is a perfectly balanced photo and I think Google did a  very good job of in software mind you remember now they're  taking I think 15 images some as slow as a quarter of a second.  So and this is handheld but if you do it on a tripod it senses  it's on a tripod.  It'll even extend those low-end ones somebody saying you  have a sniper tower.  Yeah, that's my sniper tower, right?  Temporarily home of a Christmas balls, but you know, but but  I think this is an example.  This is amazing that a camera phone could do this.  Yeah, that's great.  And so Google this is computational.  This is the funny thing is it didn't do this when we bought  the pixel 3.  This is something they pushed out.

Transcript:  That's you know, one of the things they're doing with their  AI is and this is really hard is they're trying to understand  what the picture is of and expose for that.  So for instance, if I had people in front of the house the  people would be dark-faced to get the lights right.  But if Google sees faces, it'll go.  Oh, you know what?  We should expose for the face and let the light be over  bright.  We're going to expose for the face.  So there's some really interesting things it's doing.

There are some who would say that's spooky.  Well, you know, it was really great in Europe when I was  traveling because I'd be at some landmark and I couldn't I  didn't know where I was and I would take a picture of it.

They were they are now in a situation where they were prone  to like be able to react to a hair fall, which is good for  survival, but then they come back to regular life.

We're inward focused.  Outside.  We're not outward focused.  Yeah, I'm very inward focused and it forces you to take a  really hard inventory at yourself.  What are my shortcomings?  What am I good at?  Where do I need to improve?  How do I connect with people that aren't like me because you  don't have that luxury of just saying, oh, those people are  dumb or whatever.  Like you have to connect with people.  That's the job and I find I am genuinely interested in people  that have problems that I don't like last weekend.  I spent my weekend at a retirement home going and meeting  senior citizens and kind of understanding what they need  and what they're not getting.  To me, that is, it's a deeply interesting process because it's  all about things I've just never thought about.  I've never thought to myself what happens after I can't drive  anymore and I need to go over to Walgreens to get basic stuff  for my house.  How do I get there?

There's so many people that are lonely outside in the world and  are just hoping to connect a lot of them that are exceptionally  shy or have social anxiety head towards technology because  it's a really easy way to do it.  Like running for government or even finding something that  you work for the community that's in your area is a really  nice way that you can connect with other people and learn  that people really aren't that scary.  The unfortunate part to technology is that you often feel  less safe with people in real-life situations than the  opposite to that and then you become more inclusive and more  inside of your world and it takes more of a toll which can  be really scary.  But you know for you having to interact with people every  single day and talking to people with very divergent views that  must have also made you feel much more open to differences  that you may not have been open to before.

They may be very happy, but I just you know, it is this week  in tech and I thought maybe we just hold on for a second.  We'll talk about tech.  How about that when we come back?  Okay, our show today brought to you by WordPress when I  abandoned all those social networks.  I did it thinking I'm going to blog more and I have and I  love it because I'm on wordpress.com.  I got my badge my 12 year badge a couple of months ago on  the WordPress app.  That's how long I've been at wordpress.com.  You want to see my WordPress blog blog go to leolaporte.com  I just I love it because it's mine when I upload photos or  videos or content.  I just posted that picture.  I was showing you to WordPress.  I own it.  I own it.  It's mine.  It's I can upload but I can also download images.  No one can say hey, we don't like what you're doing.  We're going to shut you down.  It's not Mark Zuckerberg's.  It's not Jack Dorsey's.  It's my site my home my content and every single person.  In this world, especially if you're young person, you've got  to have your own site.  You've got to have a place that you know, you can tweet you  can Facebook you can Instagram you could snapchat but you  have to have a place it links back to that you own you  control that when people and this is the thing to think  about what are people going to find when they Google your  name you want to have control of that because if you don't  someone else does someone else gets to put up the video of  you having a good time the other night with your pants on  your head.  You don't want that to be what shows up when you Google your  name.  You want your great WordPress site and this goes double for  a business every business so important control your reputation  online put up a site that shows your business that tells people  what your hours are your prices are a blog from the owner that  you know, if you're a plumber talk about plumbing tips if  you're a website designer talk about website designing tips  and you don't have to worry about the hosting the security  the software updates WordPress does all that for you.  There's no hassle you do the content.  They'll take care of the rest.  I love the WordPress app.  That's what we use to post as we are traveling around the  world.  I mean it's so easy to do I can also use a WordPress app to  check comments to block comments from spammers to approve.  I always have it.  So I approve comments and it makes it a great site.  My comments are great.  My the people who are part of my WordPress site.  I follow them.  They follow me.  It's just fantastic.  It's a real social network and such a great way to build  customers.  They have built-in search engine optimization social media  linking so your customers and readers can link to their  Facebook and Twitter your content plan started just $4  a month.  It's actually cost me less than when I used to host it myself  and boy it's a lot less headache and you can launch your  website with confidence because you can get help from the 24  hour seven day a week support team whenever you need it.  There's a real reason why 32% of all the websites in the world  run on WordPress.  It's the best third tonight.  You hear me right.  That's the number one third almost one third of all the  websites in the world are running on WordPress yours should  to wordpress.com slash twit by the way when you go there  you're going to save we're going to give you a little bit  of a 15% discount on your new plan purchase.  So definitely take that route wordpress.com slash twit  wordpress.com slash twit.  We thank them so much for their support.  See I put the if you didn't if I didn't have your email  address.  I put my postcards on my WordPress blog so you would get  my endless postcards.  So that's what I did right.  So that's a way to do it.  I love I just love WordPress.  Okay.  Okay tech.  How about this?  Amazon selects New York City.  Well not well Queens and Northern Virginia for its new  headquarters.  Actually, I loved I don't know if you guys saw Steve  Corella's Jeff Bezos on Saturday Night Live on Saturday  night last night, but he paid he said it's all kind of  trolling Donald Trump because it's in his birthplace Queens  and just outside of Arlington National Cemetery Nova.  I don't think that's the reason a little upset from  cities that bid for it saying hey, you know, we thought  you were going to be you know, this was going to be a  more open process and you said you chose the obvious  spots anything to say about I guess not.  Yeah, go ahead.

Transcript:  You know, this was very close to coming to Boston and you  know, at first I was really for this.  I have a really good friend of mine.  She went to College of Mississippi like I did and she  moved to Seattle and I'm sorry has been very good to  her.  You know, she works on the AWS team.  She's not particularly technical person, but she makes  enough money to own a house and have a family and they  can do it.  Healthcare.  Yeah, right.  So at first I was very much for this and then I started  looking more closely at what the impact has been to Seattle  and you know here in Boston, we have really really really  bad mass public transit and we also have an affordable  housing crisis because we're I think the third or fourth  third or fourth most expensive market in the entire country  and I was very glad to see that we we didn't come here.  It didn't come here.  I'm not like an anti-business kind of Democrat, but I do  think you need to factor in the total cost of the community.

Transcript:  I mean probably more easily than Boston certainly comes.  I think it makes more sense.  I think I'm glad we're having this conversation about it.  And I think people are very correct to ask why we can spend  1.5 billion dollars on Amazon and not fix public transportation  in New York.  I think that's a fair question.  You know, that said, I think, you know, Amazon has brought  good jobs to people I know and care about and I these things  aren't simple.  They're complicated.

That's it's not like it's all or nothing on any of that stuff.  Yeah, now in Toronto and I'd like to your opinion on this  Georgia Dow a key side, which is on the waterfront alphabet  has purchased 12 acres to create a smart city.  Actually the intercept calls it a smart city of surveillance.  It's a joint government effort.  The government agency is waterfront Toronto and Google's  sidewalk labs.  They're built.  They're going to build the city from the ground up.  Are you familiar with this in the controversy over at Georgia?

Start time: 6829.23
End time: 6933.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, talk about like Google got rid of the don't be evil  and they just went with be creepy.  So yeah, people are talking about it.  It's one of those things that they really like pushing the  like if you take a look on the site, you can see all of these  work really high marketed about how this is going to be amazing  and you know, this is going to have accessible public services  and you know, if you know, it's going to be all wonderful  and fabulous and you're not going to have any more problems  with, you know, self-driving cars and no traffic and everything  is going to happen.  But then you kind of take a look at all of the other systems  where it talks about having like an identity manager system  and ask people that want to work for the company about like  what do you think about elections in Canada and how are they  going to change with time and their their lack of transparency  in how they're going to be dealing with this is really very  scary.  Like it's it's like one of those they try to make it this  utopian thought of like green roof condos and like, you know,  like rainbows and unicorns where really it's like this  dystopian or Wellian thought of how now Google is going to  be tracking everything you do when you use your cards when  you go to the hospital and the weird thing for this is that  you know, when you use an application at least you have  those terms and services that no one reads that you have to  then give up all of your rights for but how do you do that  for a city?  You just suddenly go into there and now they're tracking  you because they own this part of the city.  But how clear is that like do you have to swipe a card or use  your fingerprints so that you can go in and and it's scary  to me.

Transcript:  Yeah, there's a there's a precedent for this Disney created  a place called Celebration right in Florida, which was a  Disney designed city.  They eventually kind of I think got out of it, but they're  you know, I on the one hand I understand this is a really  good example of how technocrats think about politics in the  world. They think and and and they're not wrong necessarily  that technology can solve a lot of problems and if we only  had full control the Larry Page said I wish we were on an  island so we didn't have this government interference thing.  Remember that when he said that in the key at Google I O they  feel like if if if you just look just let us handle this we  can make a utopia but with all these government regulations  just get on get in the way all these zoning restrictions  privacy restrictions and on the one hand I kind of understand  why Toronto might want to try it.  It's only a small part of the waterfront right?  It's part that's kind of not very attractive industrial.  You know, they're going to there's some interesting stuff  here. It's not all Toronto Toronto is very diverse and  X and lovely City because of its diversity.  It's got not one but two Chinatown's.  I mean, it's an amazing City.  So so what if 12 acres is devoted to this experiment?

Transcript:  I know it's the transparency though.  It's it was not done transparently people had to fight  so that they could actually find out what was happening in  the first sets of terms of service or whatever contract  that they had set up with Google and they weren't like every  time that the politicians and the people for the company were  asked about it.  They wouldn't say what would happen with the data who would  have access to it.  What type of data would be tracked to that and so they  didn't start from this place of being exceptionally transparent  and telling us what was going to happen and what wasn't going  to happen.  They only did that under duress and that always is that little

Transcript:  I do want to say is someone that sat on a lot of like local  government meetings and commissions lately.  I do think there is a role to play with technology working  better with local municipalities.  We were talking about automated vehicles earlier in the show.  You know something I didn't really think about until I  started running for office is people with mobility issues  and how much they're going to be relying on this that's going  to require things like zoning certain lanes to drop in,  you know, pick up passengers.  We need to start thinking about the protocol for how we  design roads.  Maybe we want to put sensors on the side of it to kind of  give a you know, an auxiliary warning beyond like camera  data and GPS data about where the edges of where you can  drive are there are issues that we need to start working with  cities on in one of my issues like I think the intercept  where the story comes from.  I think it's a good they do good journalism overall.  But like Leo as you're doing stories on Twitter something  I've always noticed is you take a second and you think about  the other side and you give it and I find the intercept to  be so reactionary that they really don't try to get another  it's like they've decided how they feel going in and they  do really good investigative journalism on it.  I think this idea could be done well with oversight and with  permission from the community, but I would agree with you.  It was handled very poorly here.

Transcript:  Well, let me give you the other side from an opinion piece  in the Globe and Mail by David Frazier who is a privacy  lawyer that was hired by sidewalk Labs to he says navigate  the intricacies of Canadian privacy law and he said he  points out he says that the questions about privacy didn't  begin with sidewalk Labs most Canadian cities and by the way,  this is true in England too, and I suspect true in the  US are full of sensors and we have no idea what's there  what they do what data they collect each municipality that  puts in those sensors is convinced they comply with the  law, but they're not transparent.  There's little accountability.  He says what we're doing at sidewalk is much more transparent  and accountable than the norm in Canada.  And so he reassures people just wait watch.  Of course, this is a legitimate concern.  That's why I as a privacy advocate was hired by Google and  we think we're going to do it right and you keep it you hold  us to a high standard.  So I think that that's another way to look at it.  He says a lot of the data that they're talking about is things  like weather data pollution data pollen count data traffic  counts energy consumption recyclables and things like that  not necessarily personal data.  So I think that I think it's reasonable to be concerned.  I think you're right.  The intercept is a little knee-jerk sometimes in these  issues.  And yeah, there's both sides of it.  I you know, I'm not going to move to Celebration Florida  because I don't want to live in Disney's world.  That's truly dystopian.  Yeah, but at the same time I think it's interesting to hear  at least attempts.  This is really the problem we have in general, which is that  I think Silicon Valley has a certain arrogance and technocrats  in general have a certain arrogance about a and I'm going  to say our intelligence and our ability to solve these problems.  And we look at politicians and then I did this on the committee  and it's such a slow arduous process.  Let's just cut through this.  I know what we should do.  Yeah, and I had that experience serving on that digital  committee in the city of Petaluma was a real pain in the  butt.

Transcript:  You know this conference I went to in the first conference  I went to in Paris where Justin Trudeau spoke was actually  called the GovTech Forum and it was all about European companies  and European governments getting together to try to figure out  how tech could make cities better and smarter things like  a smart bench, maybe at a bus stop that had solar and had  Wi-Fi and had, you know, information that was provided to  citizens that would be in public spaces.  So there are some very cool things.  I think the tech can do to make cities better, but I'm a little  nervous about the idea of a tech essentially owning the city  or owning even a big chunk of the city.

Julian Assange, my friend Julian, speaking of the  Intercept, right?  Julian Assange, the creator of WikiLeaks apparently has  been charged by the US government under seal.  No one knew about this, but in a filing in an unrelated case,  it came out and Washington Post got the story.  He's been charged under seal prosecutors inadvertently  revealed in a recently unsealed court filing.  He's charged with I guess cooperating with the Russian  government.  I have very mixed feelings about this.  Yeah, on the you know, we know that people like Roger Stone  and others went to Julian perhaps enlisted his help in  publishing emails from the DNC that had been hacked by the  Russians to undermine Clinton's campaign.  On the other hand, I think WikiLeaks is in other cases  done really good work.  Governments hate things like revealing the US drone program.  What do you I don't know what to think about this one.

They're very good.  They're grave concerns to have about WikiLeaks and who's  funding it and how they're getting information out there.  I think there is reasonable suspicion that WikiLeaks does  have some ties to the Kremlin.  I think that's a fear there's reasonable to have and I look  forward to the facts of this case coming to light.

Transcript:  Barry Pollock one of Assange's attorney said quote the only  thing more irresponsible than charging a person for publishing  truthful information would be to put it in a public filing  or to put in a public filing information that clearly was  not intended for the public and without any notice to Assange  he's kind of pissed.  Obviously I have no idea if he actually has been charged or  for what but the notion that federal criminal charges could  be brought based on the publication of truthful information  is an incredibly dangerous precedent to set.  I kind of agree with that.  This is the modern world is very difficult.  Yeah, it's because.  On the one hand WikiLeaks if they're publishing truthful  stuff.  It's truthful.  They're not lying on the other hand.  They're doing it at the with the support and behest of a foreign  government with an intent to undermine an election.  Well, that's not good.

So if you're a Democrat and the person that got arrested for  sexual harassment the Democrat is supposed to defend them.  But if you're a Republican you're supposed to condemn them  and it might make sense as Brianna says to just sit back  and look at the facts and judge people on what they did rather  than who they happen to believe, you know, whether their ideology  and your ideology happen to coincide but that doesn't seem  to be the case.  I mean it doesn't drive traffic.  It doesn't build ratings.

Transcript:  Well and the politicians are all over.  I mean, you know, condemning, you know, condemning what's his  name in Las Vegas.  It was Wynn who was a friend of Trump and then but not condemning  people who are friends and the idea that politicians would  parse things based on ideology rather than what kind of a crime  was committed.  Now when Julian Assange first came on the scene, I kind of  liked the guy.  I mean, I thought of him as a muckraker, the journalist, to  the guy who was uncovering bad stuff that the government was  doing. But then I started seeing other things I didn't like,  for example, exposing information about low-level operatives  and putting them in danger.  That isn't a necessary component of exposing corrupt government.  And so, you know, it's hard to kind of judge him because of  the complexity and the various things he's done.

In 2010, WikiLeaks released classified US military video  showing how drone strikes are used to kill not only bad guys  but other people, civilians, journalists.  That was doing good work.  Exactly.  This is when we first learned of WikiLeaks.  So I just don't know.  I just don't know.  It's very hard.  Maybe I'm going to agree with Brianna and say, let's wait until  we get some more facts.

That's hard work and I commend people who do it.  I know so many people who say, I got to get out of this jury duty.  I got to figure out an excuse.  Serve.  This is one of the most important things you can do in our country.  If only the people who couldn't figure out how to get out of jury  duty were on jury duty, you better hope you don't get arrested.

You know, something I've really thought about is when I go and vote, it's  always 60 year old, you know, 70 year old women running the polls.  I think Trump has really been a wake up call to people of my generation.  I just turned 42 this year that we've got to get up and serve and do our part.  I've never voted in my entire life where I saw women my age running the machines  and helping with the election.  And I really do think it's really been a big wake up call to my generation.  This is our country too.  And you know, no generation gets to sit it out.  Right.  And this is our turn to kind of step up and steer the ship and do what we can.

It is a local process.  And unfortunately, the side effect of that is some localities aren't too smart,  but Florida, I'm looking at you.  But in the long run, I think this is a beneficial thing.  First of all, because we have such a heterogeneous system, it's impossible to hack.  But also, I think that one of the things that...

So for like me in 2020, we know how many votes we got in Boston.  We know how many votes we got in Datum.  It really is micro targeted.  And you're right that you can't hack the entire system.  But the reality of winning elections is you're really hyper focusing on one,  two, three targets.  I don't think that's a bad thing.  I think that makes you responsive to those regions.

Transcript:  Now, I think there are things you can do to try to hack it much more  damaging than hacking a voting machine is gerrymandering or voter suppression.  There are things you can try to do.  But honestly, I think that one of the things that makes this country  strong is a strong focus on locality, on local politics.  And I really do think that that is very, very powerful.  It is also one of the reasons we have divisions in this country because  geographically there are very disparate points of view.  A lot of it depending on geography as much as it is on anything else.  And that makes it tough to have a single unified point of view.  I don't think that's a bad thing.

You know, when Trump complains about all the so-called illegal voting,  the people who push back are largely the county clerks and the state  attorneys general, many of whom are Republicans, many of whom love Trump.

And if there is a vote that two people think should like you, there's  like three parties often, but then they end up having like if there's  a vote that's like a medium, like you're like, I don't know if this  should be or shouldn't be included.  They all then vote to whether they keep the voter if they do not keep the vote.  Yeah, they're just again to try to keep it as honest as possible because  I think that you're right.  Divergent views are really important.  They make country strong.  We need differences in opinion.  You also want everyone's vote to count because they've spent the time to go there.  You don't want them to feel disenfranchised and frustrated and upset.  So you want both.

Transcript:  But Leo, if I can just push back on that for a second, how would you  handle something like in Georgia where they had voting machines and they're  left over in a warehouse and they're just not put out in certain precincts  with people of color?  I mean to me that kind of problem seems like it's really designed for some  sort of federal oversight because you know, we did we until the Supreme

Transcript:  Court overturned it.  We used to have a system, but that was a correctional system to correct for  inequities in the mostly in the southeast.  Yeah, they were talking about the Voting Rights Act.  I think the system honestly think the system works.  I know this is a little controversial.  I agree that there there are inequities local inequities.  Georgia's might be a good example of this and it's up to Georgians to fix it.  I honestly think it is up to Georgians to fix it and the best solution will  come from Georgia just as the best solution will come from Florida to their  issues.  That's how it should be done in my opinion.  That's I think that's I think that's where I kind of come down on the side  of states rights is a very loaded term because it's mostly used to defend  slavery.  But I think there is something to be said about that.  There's not going to be a perfect system.  There's not going to be a perfect system, but I think better for Georgia  to fix this and you know what if you're in the state of Georgia and what I  have to say I think they're making progress.  Oh definitely.  I think this election was of was a really interesting turning point and  if you're in Georgia if you're in Gwinnett County and you're got getting  counted if you're an African-American and Georgian has been disenfranchised  it's time to stand up.  That's why these things can be fixed.  Don't you don't look to Washington fix it.  Now we really are getting political.  I do have a bunch of little stories.

Yeah, it's it's truly tragic that this man died because of this  guy that was given far too many second chances.  He had a real history of doing this.  If I remember correctly, he had called in threats to local television  stations and somehow after spending time on jail was able to get  yet another chance to do this thing.  So I'm really happy this precedent has been set.  You know, I think a lot of people in gamer land.

I am now going in with guns to kill everybody.  Goodbye.  I heard the recording is very chilling.  Wow.  And but credit to the Petaluma police.  They came over they brought bomb dogs, but they did not come in  force.  They did not break down our door.  They they handle it exactly right protected us.  Everybody left the studio.  We let them proceed searching for bombs.  Of course, it was a hoax.  And by the way great expense to the law enforcement that has to  spend all that time.  They had to bring in dogs from another jurisdiction.  But thank you Petaluma police for handling it right and shame on  anybody who does this and you know what you're risking significant  jail time.

It's been it's in two stages FCC just approved the second group  of 7,000 Starlink internet satellites.  Musk says Starlink will take about six years.  So around 2025 every square inch on the planet Earth should  be wired for high-speed low-latency internet access.  And he's not the only one at the same day the FCC approved  three other companies Kepler, Telesat and Leosat.  That's my personal favorite to to put in some sort of satellite  internet.  This is going to happen very fast.  Now.  I know we don't have a great history of this.  You may remember a company called iridium.  Yes, I had one of their phones.  That kind of didn't so it's you know, you can build it but  you got to get people to use it and you got to have a business  model and so forth.  But I have to work.  Yeah, it has to work.

One of the things the FCC required is a plan for when the  satellites are either obsolete or starting to decay the orbit  starting to decay.  And I think in most cases the plans are something to do with  maybe somebody from Rocketdyne could help us.  Maybe they have a jet to fire that they got to launch themselves  into the atmosphere so they burn up or I guess you could launch  yourself into space, but that's not going to be a good solution.  It's good burn it burn up.  There are in the hearing about this they were talking about  there are currently I think NASA is tracking 500,000  individual pieces of space junk.

Fees been a few days down there and it was really it was really  fascinating to go down there and this is good and it was bad  at the same time.  One of the biggest things ever impacted me was the loss of  the Challenger when I was a child and you can go down there  and it's all private companies that own a lot of those NASA  landing sites down there now like you can see Jeff Bezos is  Blue Origin and you know SpaceX was launching while I was down  there and don't own them though, right?  They lease them.  Correct.  They lease them from the government.  They have their logos and everything.  It's like they do and you know, I think as we're figuring out  how we need to colonize space, I do think private industry  has a role to play.  So it's good and it's bad but yeah, this is why things like  we were talking earlier about just rooting for or against  somebody at some point.  I feel for good reasons.  We decided Elon was a villain, but I was really happy to see  this come through because I am I do think that they are doing  instrumental work and kind of getting us to the next chapter

That's great.  Let them make some profit.  There is a wonderful I'm going to plug this because one of  our regular contributors Amy Webb worked on this program.  It's called the first it's on Hulu and it's about a private  company launching a trip to Mars, but it takes government  support government funding as well as a private company and  what Amy did.

You know Larry you remember Godbout computers Godbout  electronics.  He was a big promoter of a standardized bus for CPM  computers called S 100.

They announced and we talked about it.  Everybody talked about it a contact lens that would have  circuitry in it that would measure glucose levels.  It would be kind of the Holy Grail.  It's a Holy Grail for a couple of reasons there.  I think our 14 million diabetics type one and two in the country.  I'm one of them.  I'm a type 2 diabetic who need to monitor our blood sugar  for health reasons in some cases for life and death reasons  and right now it involves a pinprick and a draw of blood  and it's painful.  It's annoying.  It's difficult.  It's accurate and there's been a Holy Grail for us to not  have to prick ourselves but also from the tech industry  because that's a lot of money you could make on 14 million  diabetics if you could just figure out a way not to have to prick  your finger.

Even with those there's about a 25% false positive rate.  I tend to 25% so these this this system the cardio system is  very similar with Apple Watch will do it has two sensors in  this in the case of the Cardia left hand right hand in the  case of the Apple Watch your wrist and then you'll take your  other hand and put it on the stem.  So it's very similar.  It will do an EKG.  You raise the exact problem though.  If it has a false positive and somebody goes in for treatment  and there's nothing wrong with them.

We would broadcast a stream and comment on it as journalists  one does right?  But for some reason Apple hired a lawyer who decided to be a  hard ass and in the middle of our YouTube stream.  They pulled us down knocked us off and we appealed immediately  as we always do but YouTube live is different from YouTube  downloadable videos.  The appeal takes a long time and then they give the the company  that's a that's complaining the complainant something like 16  days to reply Apple never replied.  We said no, no, this is fair use.  We're a news organization Apple neither agreed or disagreed.  They just didn't say anything.  So YouTube removed the strike and we're back up as of I think  Thursday, Wednesday, Thursday on YouTube.
