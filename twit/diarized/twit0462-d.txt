Transcript:  Go and also hear from the Houston Chronicle. Mr. Dwight Silverman always good to have you  Hey good to be here Leo and we are gonna talk about the week's tech news  In fact, let's start off with a story that Dwight broke this week  Houston  Varying numbers you said 50,000 Comcast users in Houston  I saw another that was even larger are now sharing their internet whether they like it or not  Comcast has been doing this all over the country since last year if we've had it here in the Bay Area if you're a Comcast customer  You notice gee, there's Wi-Fi everywhere. That's because  Residential Wi-Fi routers from Comcast are automatically being put into hotspot mode

Start time: 217.68
End time: 256.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What yeah, they launched what 50,000 50 years Houston  Yeah, but there but the goal by the end of the month is for them to have a hundred and fifty thousand of them  And basically what they've done  Comcast has this one router that they've been distributing here and in other cities for about two years  It's an heiress router and they have split off one of the channels and separated it out of the residential routers and set it up  with an SS ID that says  Xfinity Wi-Fi and anyone else who's a Comcast customer can come in and  Connect to it for free. They just log in with their Comcast login in San Francisco

Start time: 256.42
End time: 272.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can go almost anywhere in town and get on Wi-Fi if you're a Comcast customer by logging into Wi-Fi access  Points, but this seems to me a classic example of a company doing something good for them  That's bad for their customers. Why is it bad for the customers because it's using your bandwidth  Now

Start time: 273.90
End time: 287.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Security issue right? Well here the reason is it separates into two channels, you know in a DOCSIS three modem  You have multiple channels and the way they achieve the different speeds on it. I got it. I'm  Blustering here with this money

Start time: 294.44
End time: 300.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you straighten the boom don't have it tilted towards your mouth product don't have it down under my mouth

Start time: 300.36
End time: 320.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's good. You sound good. All right, so so the way it works is it is that in the DOCSIS three modem  There are multiple channels that could be bound to  To provide you service. It's how they get different tiers of speed and they've broken one off  And are and are dedicating it just for this so it doesn't count against your cap or your total bandwidth

Start time: 320.62
End time: 326.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So cap just don't cap on Comcast. Oh, yeah, there's 250 gigabyte cap on Comcast. Not anymore. They dropped that they did

Start time: 326.34
End time: 338.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They dropped that a while back  There are some cities where they're where they're experimenting with tiered services similar to the way cellular broadband works  But in Houston and in most of their markets, there is no longer a cap

Start time: 338.46
End time: 366.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the 250 gig actually they when they even when they launched it  They said we're gonna experiment with this. I guess the experiment was a failure  Because I've received notices saying you've exceeded the monthly cap. What are you doing all day?  town of massive files here  So now I'm on the Xfinity Wi-Fi site and it says over 500,000 hotspots find one near you  Did when you wrote this article, I think a lot of people were kind of surprised to take it back that Comcast is doing this  What was the reaction in Houston? Well in Houston there was and

Start time: 368.38
End time: 390.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's interesting is I looked at a lot of the coverage in some other cities and a lot of other papers are just going  Oh look, we have free hotspots and that was the extent of it. But here I  Think people were upset that Comcast essentially did it without asking permission  They sent in a stale mail letter saying that this was coming  But I suspect a lot of people didn't pay much attention to that and they didn't really pitch it as hey

Start time: 390.74
End time: 400.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're gonna use you your Wi-Fi access point  This is as convenience to you. Now if you look at the coverage map, it's mostly I'll bet you're mostly metros in the terms of service

Start time: 400.46
End time: 402.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's in there. Oh, yeah, and you can't turn it off

Start time: 402.72
End time: 407.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That'd be an opt-in kind of thing not an opt-out. It's an opt-out thing. Yeah, I believe in opt-in

Start time: 408.16
End time: 411.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it should probably be up and although then they wouldn't have that many hotspots

Start time: 412.40
End time: 423.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nobody would opt in  Well, let me interrupt you for a second because I didn't know about this and I want to know how do I use it  Do I go in I got some sort of a password? I guess my name

Start time: 423.56
End time: 447.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know what you have your Comcast login if you're an Xfinity customer, okay  So whenever you're going around town, you'll see this at San Francisco and you look for Wi-Fi hotspots  You'll see an Xfinity hotspot you click it and it'll pull up a normal sign-in thing  You sign in with your normal Comcast credentials now you're online  Then what you do this is great, you know, I mean it's great. Yeah, okay, it's great  So here's the deal comcastic

Start time: 448.82
End time: 470.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's it's residential. And so these modems these are 802 dot 11 in modems  They're in people's homes and they're not necessarily pitching it as a way to provide the city with open Wi-Fi anywhere you go  they're pitching it as you go over to your friend's house and  They don't and now you don't have to ask them for their password to get into their network now

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're all these are over. So, you know, it's people are saying I have a question another question  Okay, so I  And I advise everyone to do this. I gave up on the Comcast gear  I got rid of it because it's costing me every so much money a month  And so I bought my own Motorola DOCSIS 3  Modem which doesn't have Wi-Fi on it that I know of because I didn't buy one with Wi-Fi  What about but I do go through a Wi-Fi gateway. What's it? Can people get to know so I'm kind clean  Yeah

Start time: 515.32
End time: 526.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can't opt out by going to your Comcast account or going into modem settings  You can also just not use a Comcast modem or not use a Wi-Fi modem and you won't be affected or not  Have internet access. Yeah, or you can go

Start time: 527.48

Transcript:  What I'm trying to get at and the chairman saying oh Leo you're just old-fashioned this is good for everybody who loses  Were people in Houston pretty much saying hey, this is great

Start time: 541.20
End time: 588.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think people there were some people in Houston saying that other people I think were upset by the principle of not being asked first  And there was a lot of skepticism  regarding  The issue of security Comcast is saying this is a separate channel. It's not the same IP address  It's not the same SS ID that you have on your you know on your existing Wi-Fi router. And so  It's a completely separate channel  But the suspicion is that given how prevalent hacking is and how skilled some of these  You know some of these evildoers could be  It they think a lot of people think it's just a matter of time until it's it's hacked because it all is all in the same  Box and I suspect if there's a vulnerability at the modem at the router level that allows them to join these  These channels it'll get done

Start time: 590.53
End time: 599.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And also it just feels wrong that they're taking and yet you do benefit  I I don't know what to think of I like it it feels wrong. They didn't let us know  I think it should be opt-in but as as people say if it's an opt-in nobody's gonna do it

Start time: 601.62
End time: 606.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 637.82
End time: 657.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not as good frankly or as safe as what Comcast is doing no it does count against any bandwidth limits you have  If they're you now this is my question  It sounds like there is so much extra capacity that nobody's using that they can do this  And it's not slowing down your own internet is that what they're saying Dwight. That's what yes

Start time: 657.28
End time: 664.22

Transcript:  One of the things that Comcast has said in its in its public  In one of its filings with the FCC regarding the time Warner merger is that they talked about that the time Warner merger will  Allow them to do certain things like create their own  Cellular phone network and the cellular phone network that they described would rely heavily on

Start time: 710.02
End time: 740.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So essentially they build they're building the infrastructure for the future that will allow them to have a cell phone service  They have a deal with Verizon right now that allows Comcast to use the Verizon cellular network  That was in the when they bought some spectrum from Verizon they wound up getting this as part of the deal  So they would so an analyst I spoke with said what they could do is they essentially create a phone that hands off as you're  Moving from Wi-Fi to cellular back and forth and it allows them to very cheaply get into the cell phone business

Start time: 741.22
End time: 756.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why I don't know what to say. I mean it is you're using their cable modem. You rent it you pay five bucks a month for it  It just it feels wrong, but I can't really except for this potential security risk  I can't think of any real negatives to the end  I think that the idea this cell, you know

Start time: 756.48
End time: 773.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was years ago is in Sweden that they had showed some guy had this technology  And I think that's what these guys want to use where you could walk from  Cell to 3g to sell to 3g to sell to 3g seamlessly with you walking around talking on the phone  They do that now with Republic Wireless. That's how they're

Start time: 774.44
End time: 793.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Republic Wireless  That's how and that's what they want to do right they want to put you you get on the cell and then all the money is  Saved it offloads their cell sites. Yes, what you want. Yeah, that's what you want  You are providing selling devices that do that too. Yeah, that's how Republic Wireless works  It uses Wi-Fi unless there's no Wi-Fi and then it will reluctantly go to the cellular network

Start time: 794.40
End time: 817.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did I did a blog post in following up on this telling people how they can  The process to go through to get your own  Cable modem like John did I have my own cable modem and  And a separate router and a lot of people kind of didn't realize they could do this  But comcast for itself it does pay with take off here. They're charging eight dollars to rent  to hide

Start time: 819.06
End time: 852.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the least they could do is say if you turn this on or you allow it to be on  We won't charge you rent for your cable modem because you're giving us some infrastructure  I think that would be a good way to actually that would work  I would go for that and I'd be getting something for giving away. Although it was releasing it  It's their infrastructure to start with and there was Comcast. Yeah, but there it's on my premises  Yeah, it's their cell tower too  But I bet you they pay rent to the buildings that it's on that that Wi-Fi modems on my premises  They're using my premises to create a Wi-Fi mesh network  It seems like I should get something for that

Start time: 852.78
End time: 868.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What I'm hearing is that you don't like the fact that a corporation is making decisions for you and deciding what's best for the community  Without consulting you you need to be consulted  Corporations don't have to be fair. They have to and it's for the good of the community

Start time: 901.72
End time: 921.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Comcast said  Well, no, in fact  We can't guarantee that a merger with Time Warner will make anything cheaper or that even there the bills will increase less rapidly  This is Comcast executive vice president David Cohen. That was a screw. We are certainly not promising that customer bills are going to go down  Or even increase less

They stopped doing it. They stopped for who knows what reason  so they start doing this  Computerizing all the world's books like it was promised to all these technologists and now everybody's complaining about it including joley over here

It's if in order to perform full text search of the books, you got to scan them all in right? Yeah, uh  this  This service htl does not allow users to view any portion of the books they're searching  It does consequently does not add into circulation any new human readable copies of the books. It simply permits search  And then it would tell you what page number?  Are you okay with that?

Transcript:  But the good news is if you allow us is that what they're saying?  Yeah, if you allow us to spend 48 and a half billion dollars to buy direct tv  There will be quote there will be significant downward pressure on the prices  Of the new integrated bundles of at&t broadband and direct video and that will force the competitors cable companies to lower their prices  And we all win

Start time: 3725.66
End time: 3754.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So didn't it was it was it direct tv that at&t had in a deal with?  Before you verse they had to deal with it was either dish or direct tv and they were reselling that service  Yeah, they've been doing that for a long time with dish. I think right it was dish  So and they quit doing that when they did you verse, right?  But I know that at least here in houston  They're in they're very competitive with um with comcast in terms of what they offer and they're very competitive in terms of marketing it here

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Same in the bay area surprised to see that. Yeah, so this is a this is a filing with the sec  So I i'm thinking they can't really lie to the fcc about this why oh come on what the sec security exchange commission  You can't like that. Oh, the sec not the sec sec sec is wrong. These guys have enforcement capability  They can throw you in jail. Yeah, they got guns  um the rationale for this transaction  A fundamental shift in the way consumers obtain broadband and video services most consumers do it in a bundle  And we can't compete you verse notwithstanding. They can't over their fiber comcast and others  Well, you versus isn't always fiber a lot of times. It's dsl almost always it's dsl

Start time: 3797.82
End time: 3827.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is it is dsl and they're they're doing more fiber process  You're in the process of expanding it to try to be competitive with speed with the cable providers right now  I think the fastest you can go in most markets is about 24 megabits  They're expanding it in some some places at houston's one of them where you can go  Up to 50 but you know comcast goes to 105 here and there are 300 megabit services around the country  You can't compete at that with but I don't know that you versus sharing internet bandwidth

Start time: 3837.26
End time: 3863.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No tv doesn't impact your internet. You got plenty. No, that's what were you saying?  On you verse if you watch tv, it affects your internet. Okay on comcast. It does not  Because if it's on fiber, it doesn't either on fiber. There's plenty of bandwidth  So it doesn't forbid you use something like cable works is a little different because the data is coming in on a television  In effect a six megahertz channel, right?  So it doesn't impact that but uh, it it does on you verse because it's all data

Start time: 3864.28
End time: 3873.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then again most of the most of the movement though is to change that  Channel to a to an internet channel  So it's coming in, you know, right?

Start time: 3902.24
End time: 3922.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It seems to me that this is the beginning of a larger argument the dsl itself  Can't compete against fiber and cable  I mean dsl is very limited in the speed and it's very limited in distance from the central office  I mean if you're going to make that argument, you're almost making the argument  We can't compete against cable with dsl either right?

Start time: 3923.00
End time: 3957.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And satellite internet is not great even worse. So yeah, right. So this is strictly it's kind of i'm not quite sure how how  Internet plays into this in terms of dish because dish really doesn't offer anything that's competitive in terms of internet  And I think they can offer a bundle is the real  Right. That's one of the things that dish gives them  It gives them more buying power where they can go to content providers and say look  We've got this we've got x number of eyeballs now that we have both of these and they can strike con  Strike the same kind of deals that the big cable providers do what is the fastest dsl can go somebody's got 40 megs on

Start time: 3958.06
End time: 3972.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you can you know a dsl too and then you know, these these are they do bonded you can get faster  You can get 50 megabits, but it  You have to be pretty close to the central office  You have to have more modern tech net technology which a lot of these guys that cause money of more modern technology

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And of course it brings up the point. I used to argue with you years ago, which i'm still right about bit  They'd be paid by the bit because utilities generally speaking you pay by the kilowatt hour or by the  Cubic feet of water that's because you're generating
