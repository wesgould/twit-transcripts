Start time: 371.26
End time: 412.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  i'm kind of vacillating between whether they have an event or whether they just decide to do some  stuff via press release or just sort of drop a video which they've done as well last year when  they did that ipad pro announcement with the magic keyboard they just sort of like oh here's  a video and you know some members of the press got pre-briefed or embargoed information but because  of the pandemic they don't have to necessarily send out invites a week in advance unless they  really want to drum up an audience and for a lot of these things i think it's much more focused  at the press and sort of the the diehards and so i'm not sure whether or not they'll hold a big  event but i would be surprised if there wasn't some sort of product announcement coming in the  back half of april because there's so much stuff that has gotten rumored that just has never showed

End time: 458.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  exist i'm thinking or or do they is it a conspiracy theory is it all a clever ruse to make us believe  i know no i i don't believe that either but i i did have a moment uh and i was talking to my  colleague jason snell about this uh where it was just sort of a well do they i mean do they decide  maybe this isn't something they want to do like they were sort of playing with it and they were  thinking about it and maybe it's just not a market they want to be in i don't know it's it's very  strange to have something go on that long beforehand it was a year ago this month we saw the apple

Start time: 458.66
End time: 500.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  product support video that featured air tags by accident it was an accident although it kind of  implied that they had planned to launch this a year ago they also there's strong rumors there's  and they're due for an ipad pro that's been a year and of course we know that they're looking  at these new mini led displays that would be eventually go to the ipad go to the phones and  maybe even go to the laptop i don't know if i go to the phones but it go to the laptops  they've certainly ordered them we know they'd be buying them and then maybe maybe an apple tv  could it be the chip shortage that's holding this back is that because this is getting worse and

Start time: 500.22
End time: 567.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  worse this chip shortage i'm strongly starting to think that that is playing a big part in this  because if you look at sort of apple's history of doing events in the spring a lot of times  there's an event in march or early april too much later than that you start getting pretty  close to wwc and i think they like to space stuff out of it we know that's june 7th that starts this  year so yeah so i mean you know once you get into may you're like a month out and it gets a little  gets a little squishy in terms of how much stuff you want to release that much in advance  and then i think you know we look at the history of things like the ipad pro getting updated and  the ipads in general i think tend to get some sort of bump in the spring in march or so the last year  that's when we had the the magic keyboard announcement and the revamped 2020 ipad pros  and then the ipad air came out last fall and kind of beat the ipad pro in a bunch of different specs  and everyone's been kind of sitting there going like well what about the ipad pro like what is  happening with that isn't it going to get a new processor or something and so there's a lot of  things playing parts here the pandemic obviously but i think that chip shortage it's huge that's  real i think that's playing a big a big deal in this ford stopped making f-150s or their on and

Start time: 596.94
End time: 629.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  going to do there's a shortage um yeah i mean one of the things that insulates apple though is that  unlike a lot of the other big manufacturers for gm etc they don't run a lot of their assembly lines  in just in time format so most of the factories they assume that they're going to be able to get  the parts they pre-build a lot before they announce even exactly so apple always has a  huge lead time unless unless the pandemic struck right before yeah the the when they were getting

Start time: 630.10
End time: 698.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  into components tsmc says they're going to come to this shortage summit on monday they make the  apple chips and apple to kind of the dismay of other companies buys up pretty much all of the  production uh which has helped them up to now but but at some point you know the pipeline runs  runs low i don't think it's merely covet though i'm wondering if this also has to do with just  massive increase in use internet service providers are now being told that new routers  are 60 months off more than a year off because the router manufacturers uh like xilin can't get  the chips to put in the routers so this is this seems to me this is a kind of a multi-pronged  problem you're right dand about just in time a lot of manufacturers just wait until they need to  get the orders and they order the chips but if they're not there that's it but i think it's also  just uh covet and a huge ramp up in consumption more people are using computer hardware and

Start time: 909.30
End time: 935.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  going to take what do you do if you tsmc or intel do you ignore it and just say well we'll make it  or do you say well we should jump on this because who knows what it's going to be like at three  intel's building two new fabs in arizona which is probably smart because they're also betting on  geopolitical issues making it right a problem getting chips from china and chips made in the  u.s. that might be more appealing to a lot of american companies coming down the road

Transcript:  all right let's take a little break we've got a lot of things to talk about including denise howell  the one of the longest running court cases 11 years in the making google versus oracle the supreme  court put an end to it this week and i just can't wait to hear what you have to say about it  i i find this fascinating but we need you to explain it all all righty thank you our show  today brought to you by the way it's great to have denise here father robert dan moran it's  kind of like old home week that's going to be a fun twit our show today brought to you by  zip recruiter hiring is coming back if you're one of those companies that's actually staffing up  hey thank you that's wonderful and you want to know about zip recruiter because it is simply  put the easiest way to hire if you're hiring for spring you've got a position you know i mean  somewhere out there the perfect person right so how many times do we compromise though well i'm  sure the perfect person is out there but this is the best we could do and maybe you'll regret it  down the road it's so important because a company is just made up of people and the people you hire  can make or break your company so don't compromise the best person for the job is out there you just  need a way to find that person you're searching for a needle in a haystack there's no better way  to do it with zip recruiter first of all as soon as you post on zip recruiter your post goes to  100 plus job sites with one click of the mouse so you're reaching out you're casting the the  broadest net possible it goes to social networks it goes everywhere and it goes everywhere in the  country with and for every industry whether you're hiring a civil engineer in new york or an attorney  in colorado even if you're hiring a mascot in missouri yes that is a real posting zip recruiter  can put it out everywhere but then then it does something pretty remarkable because people come  to zip recruiter to apply for jobs they have on file hundreds of thousands of current resumes  they apply their matching technology to their existing resumes they match your job to people  looking for work when they get a good match they actively invite that person to apply they say we  found a job for you that's great for people applying at zip recruiter but it's great for you too  because it means you're going to get qualified applicants fast four out of five employers 80  percent who post on zip recruiter get a quality candidate within the first day now we've used  zip recruiter many times in our experience it's not been a day it's been hours i mean they start  rolling in fast it's an amazing solution and when i say rolling in it doesn't come to your phone  your inbox it goes into the zip recruiter interface which makes it very easy they recommend  people who fit well you could scan the resumes because they're all pre-formatted so it's easy  to read and then you can pick the right person fast try it right now for free only our listeners  get this link zip recruiter dot com slash twit zip recruiter dot com slash twit for any industry  anywhere it's the best zip recruiter dot com slash twit you can try it free right now we thank you so  much zip recruiter for supporting this week in tech we thank you this week in tech listeners for  supporting us by using that url so they know you saw it here zip recruiter dot com slash twit  google oracle 11 years in the making i have to say i did not see this one coming denise

Start time: 1443.84
End time: 1498.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  no i didn't see it coming either uh and and yes 11 years is a long time but i just want to put it  in perspective 11 years to go up and down the appellate system the way this one did  is really not that long a period of time in our u.s judicial system i looked this up for you leo  because you were talking about how long running the case was apparently there was a case in the  united states that holds the dubious distinction of being the longest courtroom battle it involved  an estate and it went on for 57 years that's that's like a lifetime the plaintiff it's maybe  several lifetimes myra clark gains was her name and of course there's dickens bleak house which  revolves around jarne dice versus jarne dice famously oh yeah yeah yeah find exactly how long

Start time: 1499.00
End time: 1527.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that famously it's still going 150 years later yes exactly well microsoft doj went on from 98  well that might have been not quite 20 years it went on for quite a while so i guess it isn't  unheard of what's really uh feels unusual is is the way this went because google would win then  google would lose and google would win then google would lose the the appellate court would throw it  back to the lower court to throw it back to the appellate court this thing was ping-ponged back

Start time: 1527.30
End time: 1564.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and forth yeah there were a lot of so there were a lot of issues here that required a jury to help  work them out when you have a fair use argument like the one that google ultimately prevailed on  there are a lot of facts that a jury has to determine but then it's ultimately up to the  court and the judicial system once they have all those factual determinations to decide if fair use  happened so there's that complicating factor we needed it couldn't just happen in the absence of  a jury so um some of these issues were jury issues that go back to the trial that started

Start time: 1565.94
End time: 1636.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  uh almost 11 years ago now actually the the trial started almost instantly after oracle bought sun  and sun had invented java which was a right once run anywhere programming language it's still  probably to this day with the most popular programming language in the world certainly  it's right up there um i remember interviewing jonathan schwarz who was the ceo of sun at the  time and he couldn't say this at the time but during the interview which was on triangulation  he said you know i knew something was up because when we started meeting with oracle about all the  assets and i started talking about java i could see the lawyers in the room lighting up oracle  immediately recognized what this meant in fact at one point uh the courts had told google you owe  oracle nine billion dollars for infringing on their java api so this this goes way back to to  the purchase of sun might even have been the motivating reason oracle purchased sun but

Transcript:  remember you have to go back even before that because that was the start of the legal case the  start of the saga actually happened i think in 2003 when google schmidt approached sun and said  we want to license java se we want to use it for android right they wanted to use it for android  but they had a stipulation they said look we want to open source this and sun didn't want to do that  because they felt that they were just going to fork it and then they would lose their licensing  fee so google decided to call off the deal and instead they made a clean room version of java  so the entire case hinges off was that actually a clean room no it doesn't and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  yeah it did in the early days but it was it didn't yeah eventually now correct me if i'm wrong  uh denise howell because you know law this is complicated but eventually that did not was not  the issue the issue was whether a clean room version of java was somehow protected whether the  apis that google duplicated they didn't use oracle code they didn't use sun's code they just  duplicated the apis because otherwise a program expecting java wouldn't be able to use right  whatever dalvik or whatever google ended up writing and then so at one point a jury i think  ruled that apis were copyrightable right that was the turning point yes it was and you're right

Transcript:  there's no question that copying happened here and the the opinion itself i i recommend  justice bryer's opinion it's 62 pages long as i have it open on did he seem to really understand  it okay so this is really interesting i think the very beginning of the opinion uh starts out with  and let me find the exact language here because you'll love it um one second i'll just i'll just

Transcript:  mention a couple of while you're looking that up turning points in this uh judge al sup who was uh  who was covering this case in the northern district of california the first jury trial oracle v google  very famously in 2012 learned java learned java so that he could see if it was because the issue  at this point was what was copied and and and oracle it came down to one routine the range  check routine that or that oracle felt google literally copied the judge learned java and wrote  his own range check routine just to see if if that was a copy or just the logical likely way to write  such a thing the judge said i couldn't have told you the first thing about java before this trial  but i have done and still do a lot of programming myself in other languages i've written blocks of  code like range check a hundred times or more i could do it you could do it it's so simple  he wrote it in java and uh the judge who learned java um there was a there was a line from his

End time: 1914.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  anymore right and actually i should correct myself because i just contradicted what i said earlier  juries find facts that go to the fair use determination it was judge also the wonderful  guy who threw himself so headlong into this so that he could understand it so thoroughly  uh that made that initial fair use determination and so he said it's okay that's fair use that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  question the the issue that you hit on earlier and it's still um it was still very much an issue when  it got to the supreme court the copyright ability of an api was something that the federal circuit  which was the court of appeal here found yes apis can be copyrightable the supreme court has has  punted on that they've decided that since the fair use argument is established it doesn't matter  whether apis are copyrightable or not they just assumed for purposes of writing their decision  that they were and decided we don't we don't have to decide that critical issue there's a lot  this is a changing area of the law there's this is it technology's changing all the time this may be  something that we want to re-examine at some point or another um they did reverse that part of the  federal circuit's decision and decided we're not going to say whether it's copyrightable or not  that was at this point is that wise to dodge that probably um well justice thomas didn't think so  he dissented uh but personally i think it probably was wise i think that there there's a lot to unpack  in the squishy nature as far as the law is concerned of an api it it very much straddles

Start time: 2008.06
End time: 2021.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  this boundary between copyright and patent and they said it might be copyrightable and might not  be but we're going to rule that it's fair use so it doesn't matter that's right so even if we say

Start time: 2021.50
End time: 2113.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that it's copyrightable which we're not saying even if it were copyrightable it's fair use and  that's all that matters but what i was going to say justice brier's opinion yes yes praises to  judge also for for his understanding of the critical issues at hand the court here you know  you can you can scratch your head about whether the actual justices of the supreme court have a  thorough going understanding of api calls or not but if you read the first part of this decision  there you know it gives you faith in our court system and particularly the vehicle of the supreme  court to really thoroughly understand issues whether the justices do or not the clerks do they get a  lot of friends of the court briefs and they can write an opinion you know i i really would love  to hear from some of our programmer listeners if they read through the first part of this opinion  which is prefaced by through an api a programmer can draw upon a vast library of pre-written code  to carry out complex tasks for lay persons including judges juries and many others some  elaboration of this description may prove useful and then it launches into pages of detail about  the facts of this case and and as i you know i'm not a programmer i'm a lawyer but i read through  this and it rings really accurately to me so i'd be interested in how our our geekier listeners  react to it as well i think the court you know in my humble opinion did a good job here of trying to

Start time: 2113.66
End time: 2152.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  grasp the actual actual issues at hand and the descent from justices alito and thomas really was  over this copyright thing they felt the court should have ruled on whether you could copyright  an api yes i think i think brier's opinion was this is as you said in flux we should we should  defer this as long as we can because this is a complicated thing and and things are changing  we can rule on this part of it and dispose of this matter without having making any assumption about  copyright should it really be the the a legislative thing should it be congress that dessert decides

Start time: 2152.96
End time: 2182.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  very much so i mean that's where this this confusion exists in the difference you know  the actual descriptions of what's patentable and what's copyrightable that come up to us  from the legislature right so if we're in a gray area here i think the court wisely decided you  know it's not for us to make that call and perhaps the legislature will want to do so recognizing  that we're in a gray area yeah i agree with you that brier's description of an api is actually

Start time: 2182.46
End time: 2197.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  pretty at pretty adept and i think he understood the issues involved with with making an api  unusable fair use is probably a good way to handle this until congress guys go ahead father up is this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  legal can kicking i mean since they haven't really decided that it's going to come up again at some  point someone's going to try to make a play for saying you can't use my api without paying me

Start time: 2209.00
End time: 2300.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well i think the fair use determination had set off right i mean if if somebody does what google  did here again they used a small part less than one percent i think of the overall  uh code that was at issue uh so they you know you go through the fair use factors did did you use  you know the least amount that you could and is it transformative and and really what this  opinion gets to is you know what are the goals of the copyright law act and what you know how are  they supposed to serve innovation going forward are we consistent with that goal with those goals  in this decision and the court lays out how they feel that you know it much like um there's copying  involved in the existence of a search engine but we all need search engines and they serve a very  practical and useful and innovative purpose for us even though none of those search engine precedents  were cited in this decision it's a similar kind of reasoning where you need to look at all the  factors and decide whether fair use is necessary here to make you know the cogs of the machine  turn and and i think that's although the court didn't put it that way and i'm putting it less  elegantly than the court put i feel like it's it's a there was a practical basis to this opinion

Start time: 2301.16
End time: 2332.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so what is so in at least in the in the usage that i understand of fair use  there are some tests for fair use ultimately it's up to a court to decide it's a defense not  it's not a proactive thing it's only a defense if somebody sues you but right but there are some  tests that are commonly used do those also apply to this what did the the justices talk about  how this why this is fair use yeah very much so and and what what did they say

Start time: 2334.42
End time: 2374.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  why is this very copying was a tiny bit compared to the actual work they looked at the nature of  the work is this is not like copying music or art or you know this is copying as a means to an end  very practical functional end and various other factors that went into the analysis yeah the  because fair use is a legal issue the court here got to look at you know it didn't have to  define it it defines yes didn't have to defer to what had been done below and could  go through and decide why it felt that the factors applied was wasn't one of the factors i read

Start time: 2375.04
End time: 2384.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  through this very briefly but like wasn't one of the factors like essentially the financial gain  or profit of it like if you're using it for money making i guess because like android is

Transcript:  is open source they kind of sidestep that well google as oracle was quick to point out made a  lot of money on the right sure yeah that's where the nine billion came from right uh but but yes

Start time: 2401.22
End time: 2442.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it it it was um you know there are a whole host of factors that go into deciding whether something  is fair use and uh certainly whether it's commercial or non-commercial is one of them  but again they all sort of weigh against each other and uh what the court seemed to be most  concerned with here is there was a lot of discussion of the investment of time and  resources and brain power of the people working with the apis and and were you know was that all  going to go for nothing um shouldn't shouldn't that be something that's meaningful and uh

Start time: 2444.40
End time: 2455.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the court certainly felt that it should did the court consider damage to oracle  did they consider the you know google made a lot of money off oracles back was that i mean i'm sure

Start time: 2455.36
End time: 2480.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that's how oracle feels about it i i'm sure it is no this this seemed to be more focused on the  actual fair use analysis and uh given that there was no recoverable harm because fair use applied  you wouldn't get into the damages phase of anything this was it's kind of the history of

Start time: 2480.50
End time: 2534.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  this case is hysterical because this is not the first time the supreme court has seen it  um it went up to the supreme court uh over this fair use thing and they sent it back to the lower  court saying no no you have to decide this right the lower court decided it was not fair use that  oracle had won at which point google appeals once again to the supreme court now this time the  supreme court can't send it back to the lower court because the lower court did in fact rule  that it was not fair use so they had to take this on um and it and this is why i was concerned i  felt like this is not looking good for google i wasn't rooting for google because they're google  or against oracle because they're oracle although that's tempting but i really felt like any  determination that you could you could close off apis would be really damaging as the justice's by  the way or as bryer pointed out that that that that the whole industry relies on this kind of free

End time: 2585.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  sharing of information um right yeah and and that's why i keep thinking you know again it's it's a  totally different body of law but the courts that had to wrestle with copyright when it came to  search engines had sort of similar conundrums in front of them yes there's copying happen here  happening here and there it was copying of you know things that were arguably creative all the  things that go into your search results the art the writing everything else that you can search  for on the internet and that stuff is being copied so that you can find them yeah uh and and yet the  courts that considered whether search engines should exist found yeah they should and i feel  like that's what's there's there's some of that kind of pragmatic approach going on here people

Transcript:  will be reading this opinion for a long time and i imagine it'll be taught in law schools it's it's  really i mean just in my and again i'm not a lawyer but just in my reading of it i found it fascinating  and i thought the reasoning was very intriguing he bryar does take on thomas's descent and  say it explains why he feels like uh you know we didn't we we shouldn't necessarily rule on this  a copyright issue um it's really it's i think it's historic do you would you agree that this

Transcript:  of the things that we talked about on twyatt was the fourth test for fair use and that is did you  impinge upon the original owner's ability to exploit their work and as you said in the start  java is the most used programming language in the world so obviously it hasn't hurt them no it  hasn't decreased the cut the value of the thing that they own so i mean i i think that's for me  looking down the decision that's probably the most compelling part which is if if google had come in  and done this clean room copy of java se and now no one was using java from oracle slash son then  yes you could claim that you've destroyed something that was of value and therefore it's  not fair use but as it is right now it's just increased the value of that material position

Transcript:  in fact brier addresses that saying this is all about a version of android that is so old only  about seven percent of devices still run it it's basically obsolete so you can't claim that there  was any commercial harm at this point um it's it's really fascinating and they did as you said  denise they did say those four tests are not the only test it's not limited to those tests and the  and the court felt very clearly that it was up to it to decide it didn't have to it was not bound  by those four tests at all so that's a that's also will probably does this become um does this  decision become important for fair use down the road important yeah yeah this is the most recent

Transcript:  can tell from his demeanor that he plays things very close to the vest he's very deliberate in  the way that he speaks any revelations took over yeah there are a few things in there that i think  are interesting the point two stuff you got to kind of read between the lines here he talked a  bit about ar which he's been talking about for a long time now um and he made some kind of strange  comments about uh like wouldn't this show be wouldn't it be greater we're having this  conversation would be better if we could just have like graphs you're like wow tim i know you  really love graphs but i don't think that really is better for most people but but the way he talks  about it is much more concrete in terms of the way he's thinking about it in the past it's always  been it's an area of interest right and we've seen the stuff they've done on ios this feels like i  know there is something coming and it's you know we are going to be doing something around this and  i'm trying to very much talk around it and so you can kind of see in the sort of the negative  space right like and what he's not saying that like there is something there that he is avoiding  talking about so i think it is interesting to see that because you know they'll never talk about  future products say we're working on this or whatever but you you get a very different feeling  from that versus say she asked him about car stuff as well and obviously there's been a lot written  talking about apple being interested in cars and he you know cook is willing to say like oh you know  there's a bunch of stuff you know we look at a lot of things and that feels right much more vague  where it's something that's like we know they're working on something but i think even they don't  know what that is or even if it will become a product right as opposed to the ar stuff which  feels much more like this is something that's coming probably sooner rather than later i always

Transcript:  huge swaths right here's one thing apple probably wishes we didn't know about but this is always the  risk uh with litigation and denise you correct me if i'm wrong but the both the opposite the  opposition gets to to pose your executives and it gets to do discovery and see emails and it's  almost inevitable when you get these big fights that stuff is revealed that maybe a company wishes  weren't revealed very famously in the apple google battle a lot of stuff came out well apple's in a  battle with epic right now over the app store and over epic games and fortnight and uh well a little  bit of a smoking gun here a deposition of eddie q senior vice president of internet software and  services q says in 2013 there were plans to make i messages for android where it would have had  quote cross compatibility with the ios platform so that users of both platforms would have been  able to exchange meshes with one another seamlessly hallelujah uh you didn't say why it didn't happen  craig federighi though during a deposition senior vice president of software engineering  acknowledged that putting i message on android would simply serve to remove an obstacle  to iphone families giving their kids android phones cheaper android phones uh oh and then  and an email from phil schiller really seals it um he said the number one quoting phil schiller's  email the number one most difficult reason to leave the apple universe is i message the number  one thing we have to lock people in in other words i message amounts to serious lock-in  and schiller said that quote moving i message to android will hurt us more than help us this illness  this email illustrates why so all right we thought it we knew it it's not a big surprise but

Transcript:  now we know there's a real reason it's it's their product i mean why would they do that why would  they make a feature that works interoperably with their biggest competitor i i find this story like  a little bit of it on windows yeah but it's a little dog bites man i mean moving itunes to  windows was nice because it let them expand their ipod sales steve jobs fought it tooth and nail  but you're right he ended up benefiting them it benefited yeah and whereas this there's no benefit  for apple for doing that it's nice like people will like it but it's not something that will  sell more products and i you know as a company that's looking at its bottom line i just can't  fathom why they would really consider doing it unless they felt like it's we're gonna get more  people switching from android because they will be so convinced about how good i message is  rather than people who are going like oh well if i don't have to worry about losing i message i  might as well buy a cheaper phone like i think the risks vastly outweigh the passable benefits

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for them on that one now i agree with you in that it makes business sense for them not to do that  any other company absolutely but for me the issue is that apple has always said that these measures  are more about creating about curating the experience than anything else and now that  you've got emails from the executive saying basically uh yeah we could do it but uh we'd  rather them stay on iphone that that doesn't strike the right court that's that's not the apple that  they're trying to portray that's the apple as just another business it's the truth right

Start time: 3972.16
End time: 3990.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's also argue that we're curating the experience and the experience is ios like that's the best  experience why you know steve jobs's famous quote about itunes on windows was it's like giving a  glass of ice water to someone in hell and i think that they would probably say the same thing about  i message on android sure you got i message but you're still using android it's germane though to

Start time: 4040.36
End time: 4067.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  being the lowest comment did not that's why people like apple messages right because it is an sms  client that it's that is much much better than an sms client and it gives you a data experience  that's 10 times better it lets you send text messages if you have to but you but you can use  a positive and you know on i have to say on android you can use third-party apps as your default text  messenger google would prefer you used android messages but you can use it this is why i think

Transcript:  didn't explain it no and i'm a google phi user so i we were we were grandfathered in a little  longer it's gone so i this week made a you know quest to find a replacement it had i had i messages  i would have gladly used that on android i've looked at signal guys they have signal on ios  could have signal on android but it's annoying because it uses your phone number and you can  only have it on one other device at a time it deactivates any so i finally found something  called pulse which is a good tech you can use as your fault messenger on your on your android device  you can use it on the desktop i can use it on linux which is nice and and it but there's so  luke clinker the author says i have an ios app but apple won't approve it because they say  this is an app that requires an android phone and they're not going to prove it  and there you go again with the lock-in because that would be a perfect solution for me so i have  to use a progressive web app which does not work very well on ios to try to use pulse there is  really nothing to replace hangouts which is a little frustrating and apple if if you would  make message i guess here's the point dan yes obviously apple's acting in their own interest  but from day one i remember you know pressing my nose against the glass at the at the computer  store looking at elisa saying if only i had ten thousand dollars and then the mac came out and  i was pressing my nose against the window of macy's and fortunately i had a macy's card and i was able  to charge it and paid for that for years but i got a on imac in 1984 and from day one apple  has been for the rest of us think different they've pushed this thing that we care about  the users we we want to give you the best experience if you really cared about the  users apple you would consider people who have android phones and not make them green bubbles  but the truth is that really all it is a color thing the badge of shame it's part of it it's

Transcript:  someone has used find my dan and find my dan yeah uh leo i was just wondering uh one of the ways that  apple is defending its practices right now is to say that they can charge developers 30 percent  because all that money goes into maintaining the app store and they don't get a lot of money from  the far majority of the apps that are hosted on the app store no just 30 does that remind you of a  business model of an industry from say the 90s that exploded for doing that exact sort of reasoning  and that's basically the music industry oh yeah we charge so much money because most of the acts  we take in don't make money and so therefore this is really the fair thing we even worse than that
