Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Last week I said, oh you know, dog days summer, it's the doldrums, no news stories, and looks  like this week we've got, we've got a three-hour show. We've got more news stories than you can  shake a stick at. Let me introduce our panel and then we'll get right into the stories,  some big ones, too, this week. Speaking of big ones, John C. Dvorak and his big ones are here,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  dvorak.org slash blog. Hello, this is John C. Dvorak. Patrick Norton is here, Mr. Slamdance

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Industry. We're trying to stay cool. It's hot where we are. Hot. Can you hear the fan going?  I heard it was like 108 up there. Yeah, it's just awful. And we have a new guest, Kevin Crewell,  as in Spreewell. Kevin is a former editor of Micro Processor Report. He worked at AMD for many  years and is now at Nvidia. What do you do at Nvidia, Kevin? I am director of strategic  marketing. I do corporate research for Nvidia. Well, it couldn't have been better timing. I  wanted to get Kevin on. In fact, Kevin asked to be on because of our Conroe, continuing Conroe  issues. And we'll talk a little bit about Conroe and Miram in a bit. But really, the big story of  the week, and it's still at the rumor stage, although I think it's less of a rumor than just  a matter of time. AMD, a friendly takeover of ATI for five and a half billion dollars.  Billion. Billion. An interesting merger because, of course, you've got the Nvidia ATI battle and  then the Intel AMD battle. And to see AMD take on a partner here. Now, I want to say right up front,  Kevin, that don't we're going to say right up front, you are not speaking for Nvidia in any way.  You're not here as a representative of Nvidia in any way. That's correct. I want you to feel able  to speak freely. And so I'm not asking Nvidia this. I'm asking you. It is a rumor. It seems

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  pretty credible, yes? It's a rumor that's been around for a few weeks now. It actually goes back  to just before Computex. And it's a rumor that just doesn't seem to want to die. So it's spread  quite widely on Friday. And it's at this point in time, it's looking fairly realistic. It's  something that you would expect AMD and ATI would have denied heavily if there wasn't actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  something ongoing. Apparently somebody in the boardroom at AMD leaked the fact that the vote  occurred on Friday. The fact is that the stock market believes it. AMD declining ATI going up,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  considerably. Yeah. And all the other tech companies were going down on Friday except ATI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. What's the advantage of- Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What was AMD get out of buying ATI? Well, actually, short term, there's a couple things. One,  they get to zing Intel because Intel invested heavily in ATI and Crossfire for the launch of  Conroe. So there's a little bit of a zing to Intel. That's by far not important. That's a transient  type of thing. The most important thing is AMD now can say they have a full complete solution. They  have chipsets that work with their processors. And they've always felt a little bit disadvantaged  to some extent that Intel had their own chipsets and AMD did not, relying on third parties. Now,  that said, AMD's partners, ourselves, Nvidia and ATI, as well as VIA and ServerWorks, have been  doing a pretty good job supporting AMD over these years. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nvidia makes a great AMD chipset, the N4 chipset. Well, thank you for saying so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, but I mean, literally, that brings me back to why would they know? I'm not sure I see  the corporate synergy that justifies a leveraging of assets. Well, you're not alone. The stock

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  market didn't either. They thought that AMD stock tanked. What it is, it's actually a long-term bet.  Partly, it's all the fab capacity AMD's putting in place. So now ATI would get access to that  directly. And even though ATI could always sign an agreement to access the fab as a foundry type  deal, having an ATI design group part of AMD would make it easier. The real long-term issue is about  four years from now, two more process generations. We're going to go from multi-core to many-core.  There will be going from two to four next year and then eight. And eventually, what you have is  Moore's law keeps giving you more and more transistors to play with. And what do you do with  those transistors on the silicon? Somewhere along the way, you really seriously consider adding the  GPU function onto the same silicon with the CPU. Much like back in the 46 days, we added the  Mathco processor onto the same silicon with the CPU. So, Kevin, this is essentially you're releasing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the earliest long-distance rumor about the acquisition of NVIDIA by Intel. I was going to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's always traditionally some tension between Intel and NVIDIA because NVIDIA makes a chipset  competing with Intel's chipset. Not as much as there's going to be after the buyout attempt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe. What do you think about this, John? Well, I've been talking to a lot of people about this  over the past week or so. And the word I keep getting from people, there's actually a number  of things going on at once which may not make the ATI stock run up such a good idea. First of all,  with the AMD stock going down and ATI stock going up, it makes the proposition a lot more expensive  because this kind of thing is a stock deal. And I'm also hearing that Intel knows about this and  they're doing everything they can by pumping up their Conroe and then sending out rumors about  what's going to happen in December, which is apparently some killer chips, to do anything  they can to clear this deal by slamming AMD stock and making it so it's the deal so expensive for

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  AMD that they just simply won't do it. So you're saying Intel doesn't like this. This is a scary

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  thing, this merger for Intel. They don't like anything that AMD does and they just don't want  to see them picking up a chip company that's going to give them a little leverage because right now  Intel thinks they're back in the driver's seat. Now on top of that, there's supposition that if  this deal actually does go through that NVIDIA, even though our guest there won't confirm this  for sure because he can't, but the rumor is that NVIDIA will then get in bed with Intel more closely  hook their products together. And since they really do dominate in the high-end gamers world,  they can literally switch the focus of the gamers from AMD to Intel overnight and it would be a  disaster for AMD. So there's a lot more to this deal than meets the eye. There's kind of a move

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in that direction anyway. I mean people like this, the new core duo. They love the new Conroe,  gamers do. They prefer SLI to Crossfire, which is ATI's SLI technology. So an NVIDIA-Intel  pairing is rapidly looking like the best way to game. Well there's one other aspect too that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  has cropped up in the conversation, which is the possibility that if this deal does go through,  since it will kind of screw NVIDIA, that NVIDIA, if they can maintain their dominance in the gamer  side, they'll simply tweak the next generation of chips so they don't even run on AMD. Now that  would be a complete disaster for AMD. So this deal is not what it appears to be. Yeah, well I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  there are a lot, as John pointed out, there's a lot of negatives to this. In addition, if you look  at even the balance sheet, ATI is much lower margins than AMD. It's going to take AMD's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  margins down if they merge. Is this a desperation move from AMD? They didn't have, you know, they're  looking at the Conroe. The X4 is not out until mid-2007. Are they panicking? How will this help

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  them? I don't understand how this is going to help them at all in the short term. If anything,  it's going to distract management as they try to merge the two companies, just in the time when  they have to be most focused on beating Intel and coming up with solutions that solve the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So why are they even considering this? Could it be disinformation? Could the rumor be bogus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, the rumor seems pretty valid. I think somebody came up with this idea in the boardroom or somebody  and they thought it was a good idea at the time and then they started to pursue it. I don't  think it was fully thought out. I think that's the problem. Well, I think actually the Wall Street

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  analysts have finally discovered DIG and they're now making investment decisions based on the number  of DIGs on a particular article. Because like, I've played rugby with these guys. I'm  drank with them downtown. They make some really interesting... They're just like you and me,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you're saying. They put their lamp out. No, we're much more rational than they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wall Street punishes companies for beating their own estimates but not hitting analyst estimates.  They delivered 55 cents on an estimated 46 cents per share. Wall Street expected 58 so they blew  25% of the value out of the stock and it's just like, wow, you guys are mean. You suck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sounds like, John, you think that this may fall apart, the deal may fall apart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it probably will. Well, maybe stock tanking... A rumor still at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, pretty good rumor. How about you, Kevin? Do you think it'll happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The problem, as John pointed out, is the stock, maybe stocks tank so badly and ATI stocks held  up reasonably well that it's getting much more expensive. Could that be a blessing in disguise  for AMD? Well, I don't think it was a great idea to buy ATI at this stage. Save from themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Save from themselves. They wanted to do a stock buyback so they had to generate a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  rumor to drop the value. Speaking of stock buybacks, Microsoft says it's going to buy back

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  40 billion of its own stock. Why? Because they've got umpteen billion dollars doing nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Money to the shareholders. Yeah. Give the 40 billion to the shareholders. What are they doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Microsoft never does dividends, do they? No, they have a little dividend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But if they gave out a big dividend, that would go mostly to Bill Gates. He'd make a fortune off

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that. Well, he could give it to Africa then, but it's beside the point. Yeah. You know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the shareholders should get that money. It's a little misleading to say 40 billion because  it's going to take them a long time. The board of directors authorized the company  to buy 20 billion through a tender offer on August 17th, as much as an additional 20 billion through  2011. They bought 30 billion back a couple of years ago. Maybe they're trying to go private.  You know, it's not a bad idea. Go private, then split up, then do a new IPO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They could be three companies. I've always believed that that company should be split up into three  anywhere. They should maybe spin off two companies and go up and make them public companies. I know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  nothing about financial markets, but wouldn't that be a very profitable move? You buy back the stock  at its current depressed value. You take the company private, you split it up into three,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and then you do IPOs in all three. Well, you don't even need to take it fully back. I mean,  you don't even have to go that far. You can split it up without doing that. I think they should split  it up. I think it would be more fun for everyone. According to Yahoo Finance, the market cap for

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Microsoft is $243.5 billion. Hey, they're getting there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Quarter of the way there. Sixth of the way there. Something. You can see now why I'm not in finance.  Too high. Companies traditionally do those buybacks for two reasons. Their stock price is depressed.  They feel like they want to get it up, so to speak. And they also want to show confidence

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to the investors. It always looks like desperation to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they don't know what to do with $40 billion. I mean, you could just put 40. I mean, just put it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in CDs. I could think of some things to do. What do you need to buy back your stock for?  I guess could use a couple of bills. All right. Most of the stories that weren't ATI and AMD were  about YouTube this week. A lot of YouTube news, starting off with Monday when it was announced  that the prior week, the weekend in July 16th, YouTube grew to astoundingly, I think, 75% growth  in one week. They've had 300% growth since January. They're now doing 100 million videos a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And it's starting to become a problem. You know what the kicker is to that story?  That it is overlooked. This is the slow time of year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but is it for them? I mean, the kids are home. This is when kids are watching, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm not slow. It's just this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Especially the web numbers for most sites have dropped during the summer when kids are

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're outside enjoying the weather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And it's kind of interesting also as somebody who shares a content distribution  network with YouTube and it turned that MySpace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think YouTube's killing Patrick's bandwidth right now, even as we talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's under the killing bandwidth. It's at the ISPs. I have a strong and rapidly growing theory  that ISPs are starting to throttle pretty much everything coming from YouTube's CDN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ted Stevens was right. YouTube is choking the tubes. He knew what he was talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no. It wasn't YouTube. YouTube is making no money.  Microsoft and Google are clogging the tubes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can't get anything out of YouTube. Never mind that.  YouTube says its videos account for 60% of all videos watched online in the US.  20 million uniques. 20 million unique visitors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And still we wait patiently for a business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't need a business. What do you mean? They got a business model. NBC just announced  that they're going to start using YouTube to show premieres, previews of new shows.  They're even going to put an old show watching that they canceled. Nobody's watching.  They're going to put back on the net via YouTube.  Don't you remember the phrase burn rate?  Well, I probably, yeah. I mean, I imagine that bandwidth is more than they could make.  They've got some good partners. NBC is partnering with them. After suing them,  they decided never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would be really curious to see what a breakdown between the number of girls talking about the guy  that just broke up with them slash... Most of the videos are guys in their underwear pretending to be  Shakira. Yeah. I mean, it's really kind of fascinating to look at what the number one  most viewed video is in the last 24 hours the last week. Because during the World Cup,  it was amazing because there was World Cup content from everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think a couple of things that are interesting. First of all, a lot of mashups and remixes.  A lot of creativity out there. If you want to call it that.  You use YouTube, John. You've got videos up on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I use it. I'm using it more now too. I try to shoot stuff with a little  pocket camera videos. I'm probably going to do a review on this on the blog.  The Kodak V610 is not the world's greatest camera, but it makes a terrific video mainly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because the microphone is so good as you attest. Yes, I looked at your video of Annalisa and it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  looks great. Yeah, you put it on YouTube and you post it on the internet or post it on your website  because you can embed it. You start to realize that you probably should have two or three  of these posts a day. Every other blogger in the world is thinking the same way. That's why

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  these numbers are increasing so drastically. That's an important point. These are not all  going to YouTube's homepage where they could see an ad or monetize it. A lot of these are  just linked into other web pages. Yeah, because they let you embed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google was the first one that did that. As far as I know, I don't know anyone else who let you embed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  some flash. A couple other companies. Video Egg does it now. There are a couple other companies  that do this. I suppose they could put pre-roll or post-roll ads in there and make some money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They might someday. There's a Panasonic online video fest because it was a sponsored ad on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  YouTube. I clicked through. I think there is potential to make money there. I guess the only

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  issue really is they think you make enough. Yeah, because their bandwidth bill is extraordinary.  If they grew 60% last week, it's gone from extraordinary to insane. I heard it's $1.5 million

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a month. That's nothing. It's nothing. It's not. You only have $10 million in the bank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even that statistic is a couple of months ago. They're doubling every few months. That even is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  out of date. I don't have the time to sit down with scratch paper, but I can give you a pretty  good idea if they're doing the... They may have hearing relationships. It's hard to tell really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you're using the same provider, so maybe you would know better than us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do the calculation for us, Patrick. I think everyone would be interested.  We'll wait. We'll just sit here. I'll play Soto's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To keep the subject on YouTube, but to shift a little bit, have you been watching the new YouTube  policy? It's been interesting watching. That's the story. Boing, boing, Brooke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this happens all the time with a lot of these sites. We own anything you post here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. We own anything you post, but when you take it down, we won't own it anymore.  But if we've sold it, it's amazing that they can see it. I have this horrible vision of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  America's funniest home videos. By submitting the user submissions to YouTube,  you hereby grant YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sub-licensable,  and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare, derivative works of,  display, and perform the user submissions in connection with the YouTube website and  YouTube's and its successors' businesses in any media formats and through any media channels.  They left out the clause we used to have in our agreement in any, what did we say, in any world  here to be discovered in any media content. I mean, that's just a normal disclaimer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't bother me, because the fact is you can take it down if you feel like it.  But most of the who cares? Yeah, but they can sell it before.  I mean, I was like, what are they going to sell junk? It's a bunch of crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wish they could sell it. I'd like to see them stick around.  Yeah. You think they'll be acquired?  That's one of the... Oh, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would be Yahoo, of all people, I'm sure. Yeah, I was going to say, unless Yahoo buys them,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  hasn't every other company learned to not buy Flickr? Yahoo has learned. After Flickr,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yahoo has learned. Flickr has a similar issue where you've got a lot of bandwidth,  nothing like YouTube, but you get a lot of bandwidth. And they buy Delicious, too?  Yeah, but Delicious doesn't use bandwidth the same way Flickr does, and Flickr doesn't use bandwidth  the same way YouTube does. Yeah, YouTube really is a classic.  YouTube is now being sued also by a news agency, the Los Angeles News Service.  They're hosting footage of the beating of trucker Reginald Denny, and he's suing them.  This was what I... Truthfully, we interviewed Steve Chen of YouTube in March for Inside the Net,  one of our other podcasts, Amber MacArthur and I. And at the time, that was, I think,  the big concern. I think it was Chen's concern. It wasn't monetization, it wasn't bandwidth.  Are we going to be sued to death? I believe so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My personal favorite is people are putting these little homemade disclaimers that the  replaying of this video is covered by commonly accepted fair use principles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Chen said, look, if you issue a DMCA take down request, we respond immediately to them.  I mean, I think they're covered if they say, look, we've got 100 million videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the situation is a little more liberal than it was back in the Napster days when it was  like they were under total attack. I don't think it's that bad, but I still think it's pretty bad.  And I think these guys are going to get, unfortunately, I think they are going to get shut  down at some point. I just can't see it not happening because in fact, because I think a  lot of people from all sorts of angles are complaining. For example, in Cranky Geeks,  we did a show that will run in probably a week or two with JD Lassica, who's a famous  blogger. Yeah. And he's got our media and he's got all these people and he's very conscientious  about copyright stuff. And he went on a ramp on a rant about how YouTube successes only because of  all the copyright violations. And he went on and on and on about it. And I'm thinking, well, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They became famous with the lazy Sunday video that was stolen from NBC. That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They had the Dave Chappelle show over something on the clips of that and there's tons of anime on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I think a lot of what is most compelling, if you look at the top videos, it's not in fact,  repurposed content. It is from time to time when that's the viral video of the moment, but  most of the time it's it's it literally is morons in their underwear singing Shakira songs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or morons watching, you know, people in their underwear.  A lot of lip syncing going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, while you're while you're on the topic of this sort of videos and morons in their underwear,  there's another website people should go check out. It's very hard to get off of the site when  you get on it because it's so kind of uniquely interesting if you want to study the sociology  of Gen Y and that's Stick'em. Have you seen this site? Have you been there?  S-T-I-C-K-E-M?  No, S-T-I-C-K-A-M.  Stigam.  And it's a and it's people mostly Gen Y people with their cams. And it's like a it's like a wide  open system with all these people on online with cams and people kibitzing with each other.  It's it's come on. That's gotta be the most boring thing in the world.  No, I'm telling you. It's it's so it's it seems boring, but it's like compelling in some weird  way. I just go check it out. I mean, it's it's just odd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the interesting thing about the success of YouTube or the or the problems YouTube faces.  Everybody ignores the financial issues and the legal issues they face. They look at 100 million  videos a day. They look at 300 percent growth this year and they say we want that too. And  there are a lot of copycat sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Have you guys heard of Guba.com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Guba. Yeah, that's weird. Guba has been around since 97 or 98.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you seen Johnny? Have you heard about Johnny, which they put together?  It's a really interesting. It's essentially it creates it'll take it create a hash for a frame  of video. Basically, they took a tool that was designed to detect copyright violation for stills  and they adopted it to detecting copyright violations for video. And they're filtering.  Basically, they're getting a list of content from the list of of of you know, things to look for  from the MPAA, I believe. And they basically run this system on all of the videos that get posted

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  up on Guba. Because they just did a deal with Sony to carry Sony's movies for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the Warner Brothers. They're doing Warner Brothers stuff. But they're apparently they're  actually making going to be making it available to other sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So well, I mean, if you think about it, YouTube smells like the next Napster,  soon to be sued out of existence. You know, the Napster lawsuit is still going on, by the way.  I didn't realize that. And and you're going to need something like that. That was what killed  Napster. They said there's no technological way we can prevent the piracy. Well, one of the other

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  things about YouTube and then these clips, I mean, you have people like Jon Stewart of the Daily  Show who they pretty much freely distribute all these clips of their show. They have sections of  the of the entire program. They put it on their own website and they don't really care if somebody  starts posting on YouTube. And the fact of the matter is most of these things are promotions  in some odd way. I mean, the classic example was that NBC suing them over a clip from Saturday  Night Live that actually indicated to people that maybe Saturday Night Live was funny again. It was  essentially a commercial. They learned their lesson, though. I mean, they did. But I mean,  how many other people aren't learning their lesson? I mean, because most of you don't really watch  anything that runs more than a few minutes on YouTube. At least I don't. I mean, I have

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  watched some longer things. But here's where they're going to get in trouble. And this is like this  lawsuit with the news agency, the news service is this video. This guy sells this Reginal Denny  Trucker beat up video to news outlets. This is his bread and butter. And there's a lot of people like  that. You know, the Zapruder film comes to mind where the Kennedy assassination where that's their  bread and butter. That stuff leaks out onto the net and is widely distributed. They're dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I agree. It's a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple may be doing movie rentals according to ThinkSecret. You know, Apple, this always happens.  Apple's got a conference coming up, the Worldwide Developers Conference next month.  And always the rumor mill goes crazy talking about the next iPod or the next this or the next that.  There seems to be, though, some consensus that Apple may in fact offer movies for rent on iTunes.  Kind of a Netflix, a virtual Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What a shock. Who would have ever even anticipated such a move?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, especially since he's been negotiating for months to try to do movie sales  through iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. I guess if they did it, you would want to see them come up with an iPod that had a better  screen. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which Apple's, you know, what's ThinkSecret says is going to be available in 2007.  And rumor has it there's going to be an Nvidia processor in it to do some 3D for the menuing  system. Since it seems to be rumor day when we're not.  Just a rumor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin, very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  New comment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's always fun to watch the app or rumor get overheated. It's kind of crazy.  I don't usually don't report these. I just thought I'd throw that in since it's got a movie angle.  Moving on. Did you see Jason Calacanis, everybody's favorite hothead?  He created a dig alike on Netscape as a Netscape home page. And now  he's pissing off the diggers by offering to pay the top dig submitters, not just dig,  but delicious flicker, Myspace and Reddit to pay them for their stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is this is actually this is I've read his original posting. And what he said he wanted to  do is he wanted to hire people who basically the people who there's a small group of people who  generate a huge amount of traffic on dig and whatever you are, right. They're kind of the  leaders of it. And what he wants to do is he wants to hire them to post on Netscape.  Right.  He wants to basically, you know, he's basically trying to jumpstart Netscape's home page. And  he needs a core group of people who have that cool hunters, whatever you want to call them.  We have that ability to track down the really cool stories and post them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jason has an amazing ability to not only pick some hot button issue, get a lot of attention for it  and while doing it to piss everybody off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you know, he was also the one he's how much did he sell web blogs for?  What does this sound like? You're paying people to blog. That's against blogs.  Blogs are about being free and breaking out of, you know, corporate media control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it does. It's an important question. Why does somebody like, I mean, look at these guys  are putting up hundreds of stories, like 450 stories a month on their editors. They're just  their editors for free. And the question is, why do they do it? Do they do it for the they do it  for the glory, right? Are they for sale? That's the question. Are they for sale?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This isn't about sale. There's nothing. You know, the only the only the only is that he says,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll pay for your posts over to my place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so, you know, somebody, you know, I look, you know what, if you're good at something,  and somebody offers you to pay you for it, it's like I've got the outside of a couple  of particularly extending out examples in the golfing world who stayed amateur their whole  careers. If you're already spending four hours a day posting on dig and somebody says, I'll give  you a grand a month, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I don't think he has any takers yet. That's an interesting question. I mean,  if you did it, don't you think you'd become a pariah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just use a pseudonym, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I mean, how many people know who it is? You know, you know, you're Johnny 2274 on dig.  I mean, how many people know who you are unless you give a lot of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because I think at least now, while there's no money in it, a lot of the reason people do  this is because they want that, you know, that handle, whatever that handle is to be well known.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it's good to be the the amateur champion of the world. It's great to make a living.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's what Jason's saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How much of a living at a thousand dollars a month?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not a great.  Yeah, but if you think about it this way, if you're spending four hours a day posting on dig or  researching and posting on dig, or maybe you're a genius and you've managed to find 150 to 400  stories a month, you know, in your copious, you know, a minute here and a minute there,  if you can do the same thing and pick up a grand a month, you know, you want to be loyal to dig,  I respect that you want to pick up a thousand dollars a month to cover the fact that, you know,  you're spending.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think that somebody with deep pockets can take a site like Netscape and turn it into a  success?  No, but they can try.  Of course they could try that he is trying. The question is, can you do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Depends on your definition of success. I mean, I don't think they're going to be able to match  dig in terms because there's a, you know, there's also other kinds of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, technically they're bigger than dig, but just because people don't know how to change  their homepage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. They're dumb.  So they pops up and then they immediately move to something else. It's not the same as somebody  goes.  No, I agree. I agree.  So I don't know. I, I, it just seems, I think it's an interesting publicity stunt.  It's a good publicity stunt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a parallel between the relationship with Microsoft and, you know, and Apple for, you  know, most of the previous decade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, it worked. I mean, he got our attention, got my attention. You guys don't care. Have you  ever, Patrick, I know you go to DEF CON. Have you ever been to the HOPE conference?  No, actually.  We have a correspondent. I'm going to bring him in right now. Hey, Darren.  Hey, how's it going, Leo?  Welcome. Darren's joining us. John C. Dvorak's here, Patrick Norton, Kevin Creewell of NVIDIA.  Darren Kitchen is one of the hosts of hack.five at hackfive.tv, right? Or is it hackfive.org?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hackfive.org. H-A-K-five.org. Yep.  And you were at HOPE.  Yes, we just got back from HOPE.  Very exciting.  You said it was really boring.  It was, there was lulls, you know, there was some interesting stuff and there was also some  crazy political activism stuff that we weren't so really into. And then, you know, the whole  general sense of the thing kind of had a loose land party feel going on. There's, you know,  at night, you know, drunk people on segues and people hanging out in hammocks watching movies  on projectors. So, you know.  Sounds like my house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, HOPE is run by Emmanuel Goldstein of 2600, the Hacker Magazine. A couple of interesting  things happened. One was that a speaker was arrested just before his presentation. The FBI  let him off in handcuffs. Did you see that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, that was in the A hall. And I was thinking about it.  How do you say that?  It was in the hall that I wasn't in, basically. So, the session was privacy is dead, get over  it. And I'm looking at the book and I'm like, you know what, I know that. So, I'm going to  go to this other one on password cracking and time memory trade off and then see quantum  cryptography. So, the password cracking and TMO was really cool. And then, decided to check out,  you know, stay in that hall for the quantum cryptography. And the guy comes in and says,  quantum cryptography has been canceled and blah, blah. We're like, ah, let down.  And then he's like, and Kevin Mitnick won't be joining us. We're like, ah, bummer.  It turns out he's in a hospital in Columbia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What happened? Is he okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They don't know anything more than that. In fact, they told us of a hospital in Columbia  and we're like, where? And they're like, I don't know if it's Columbia Hospital,  if it's Columbia in the US, or if it's Columbia. So, that's all we know.  I'll try to find out. I'll ask maybe.  And then the Hope guy is like, so you want to know what just happened in the other room?  And we're like, oh, what did we miss? So, he lets us know the whole story by the Stevens guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stephen Rambam, I can't be pronouncing that right, but that's how it's done.  I can't either.  Rumbum, the owner and CEO of Polarium, a company that builds itself as the largest  privately held online investigative service in the United States. I guess the deal was  a volunteer gave Rambam a few small pieces of information.  Their volunteer was Rick DeConn. And Rambam was going to show how in just four and a half hours,  he was able to dig up 500 pages of personal data and show that data and show how he did it.  We don't know why the FBI arrested him. If it was related to that,  I can't imagine it was or to something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it could be if he's accessing networks, he's not supposed to have legal access to.  Maybe.  But the best thing I think is the guy did the research on DeConn, he actually found  that somebody who's been spoofing their social security numbers since 1983.  Oh, that's nice.  Yeah, I thought that was the best part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He said all I gave him was my email and name. He knew everywhere I'd lived,  every car I'd driven, and even someone else in Alabama who was using my social security number.  He found all my friends' pictures of friends, knew about my brother's criminal record.  Oh, that's scary. So I guess privacy is dead. But you knew that, didn't you, Darren?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. But as soon as I found out that the quantum cryptography session was over, I  caught the last half of the privacy is dead. And, you know, I hate how these conferences are with  all the good stuff side by side and you got to choose.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So who did the conference? I mean, RamBam had been arrested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, well, there's three of them. There were originally four of them. So there were three  others, private investigators. And it was really interesting and the guys were really funny. And  the Q&A session was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It always helps if one of the speakers has been arrested by the FBI minutes before the presentation.  It just gives it that little...  Edge.  Frizzan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, definitely. The atmosphere around the conference right after that was a lot more amusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw a story, maybe you can clarify also about cloning, RFID cloning. Did you see that  demonstration?  No, I didn't.  It looked like what they did is took it out. Somebody had an RFID chip embedded in his arm  and they had a device which cloned it within a minute or two and was able to make a duplicate  RFID with exactly the same information. So something supposedly impossible, according  to the RFID people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You see, that's why I went to the vendor booths and picked myself up a RFID resistant wallet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm made of duct tape, no doubt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's not duct tape, but it's got this mesh inside. I don't know. I know I probably  could make my own for way less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If the US government's going to use RFID in passports and it's easily cloned,  how long before somebody in Alabama is using my passport?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I thought they said that they were going to provide wallets for the RFID passports  that would shield them.  Until you open it, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've got a friend that does RFID, basically his group does RFID attacks. They've already  done a lot of stuff by designing a decent antenna and pointing it. They can basically pick up  RFID tags from distances that are theoretically impossible.  Didn't they do that at DEF CON?  Yeah, John did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Any other stories from HOPE? Any other interesting things happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Besides finding out Kevin McNick was in the hospital, I can't really think of anything  else that really stood out. I think the most interesting thing I saw there was the password  cracking time memory trade-off, which is similar to rainbow cracking or rainbow tables. It's a  different aspect of that. It's a different technique done by this guy, Jason Davis,  and he's doing the site MD5 lookup. It takes a lot more memory than rainbow tables,  but it's 100% effective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For those of us in the studio audience that aren't familiar with rainbow tables,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  what was he talking about?  This guy basically creates a huge database of all the possible passwords and our hashes,  when you're going to brute force a password instead of just trying everything one after another,  you run it through this lookup table and it seriously took one second for everything.  He would do five, it'll take one second because he's put it into MySQL database rather than  flat files. It's really amazing stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is why you use a longer hash or a longer...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What you should be doing, at least with Windows or actually anywhere, is using a pass phrase.  Use something like, my first computer was an IBM PC XT in 1983. That's a bit long. That's maybe a  little overkill, but at least you've got capitals and numbers, spaces. If you use a password 15  characters more on a Windows system, it won't save an LM hash, and LM hashes are really,  really weak and really easy to break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I thank you for the update on Hope. I hope Kevin's okay. We'll see if we can find out,  and we'll let you know. I just checked his website and there's nothing there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I haven't seen anything on the blogosphere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was Kevin Mitnick who got sick.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Kevin's my Skype connection flickered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We should... What's his girlfriend? We should...  Darcy.  Darcy. I'll call Darcy right now while we're talking.  Right now, we're going to let Darren go. Darren, I thank you.  Thanks for having me on.  And I appreciate you're making the effort. Hack5.org, H-A-K the number 5.org, is a really great...  Your second season just began.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, our season premiere is August 5th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it hasn't happened yet. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're going to have stuff from Hope, a whole bunch of coverage of that,  as well as lots of other nifty exploits and mods on stuff.  Yes, we're in our second season. Well, we figured we'll do 10 months on and then take two months  off because we don't do this for a living.  They were brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Patrick, I just want you to know they were inspired by the screensavers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, we've adopted the format. I just never realized they were doing it in seasonal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We didn't even do seasons. We just kept going on and on and on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, we needed to break and not go insane.  We were getting paid to do it.  Yeah.  Yeah. Hey, it's great to talk to you.  One of these days, I hope. All right. Thanks, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It will happen. It will. You got a great program, Hack5.org. Thank you, Darren.  So a little update on Hope. He said it was kind of disorganized, kind of wacky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's extremely disorganized. Everybody knows. It's fun. It's much mellow. Defcon is more of a raging  party. Defcon is really interesting because it takes place after Black Hat. Black Hat is a  pretty hardcore industry conference.  Right. So everybody's there already.  Yeah. So a lot of people basically do the presentations from Black Hat at Defcon.  So instead of paying $6,000 or whatever Black Hat costs, you can pay $90.  And I should also point out, it's John Herring and Flexilis did the RFID.  Set the RFID detection world record last year. Not Herrington.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the other thing I like about it. I've never been to either conference,  but you always come back with great stories from Defcon. And I like these contests to do the longest  Wi-Fi or the longest RFID detection, that kind of stuff. Those contests are kind of fun. Those

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  competitions. And they're getting the Wi-Fi ones are really getting out of control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it was like 30 kilometers last time, wasn't it? Something huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lot farther than that.  More than that? Really?  Yeah. They're getting into the hundreds of miles at this point. Like 125, 200 miles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow. Can you really get atmospheric bending? Because the circumference of the earth,  you just can't do a point to point unless you're really high up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fortunately, there's a lot of hills. Actually, the problem is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so they have to do a high point down to a low point or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. The folks that run the Wi-Fi shootout, they actually spent a bunch of time with maps  to figure out where they could get the longest valley with a high point at either end that was  near Las Vegas. So you had to drive way out of town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you see this Google Earth picture of this Chinese- I don't know what it is. People are  using Google Earth and having a lot of fun. You're just spying. But they found a 700 meter by 900  meter patch in China that is like a scale replica. It's huge, but it's a scale replica of peaks and  valleys and snow capped peaks and stuff. It's the weirdest picture if you see it. I don't know what  it means. Nobody does. It's conspiracy theory time.  You're going to give us a link?  I will put a link in the show notes. You want a link? I'll find one for you to give on the  air. But before I do that, we've got to stay with hacking news because there's another huge  hacking story. Lindsay Lohan says that Paris Hilton has hacked her BlackBerry.  And I just wanted everybody to know that there's some security issues now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why would Paris Hilton care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To quote lewd messages to her friends on Earth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think these people are using a few too many mind-altering substances at this point.  Lindsay Lohan says that someone used her BlackBerry to send some disgusting and very mean messages.  And the wording of the messages sounds just like Paris Hilton wrote it.  No, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or what? They said I'm hot.  Lindsay Lohan is now certified by the Jets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Paris Hilton's spokesperson says, I'm saddened that this happened to Lindsay. I've lived through  this with Paris two years ago when her sidekick was hacked and the loss of privacy is unbearable.  But as far as any suggestion that Paris Hilton would have anything to do with this,  that is silly, untrue, and unfortunate. I don't know. I just love that story.  Has no impact whatsoever on any of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'd probably run up the dig numbers again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a classic dig story.  Yahoo's stock price stumbling 22% on Wednesday, marking its largest one-day drop ever.  Yahoo postponing its Google AdSense technology.  They were going to do something like Google's doing with the text-based web ads.  And they said it's not ready. The market did not like that.  They are doing something interesting.  They are going to offer a Jessica Simpson song without copy protection.  This is an interesting trial.  You pay twice as much. You pay a buck 99 for the song, but you get an unprotected MP3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, if only I could find some DC music to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's too bad I picked Jessica Simpson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a fairly large number of people still buying her music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think they're the kind of people who say, oh, I don't like DRM?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but they're not looking at it as DRM. They're looking at it as being able to download it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's true. And now if you do that, you can play it on anything, including an iPod,  which up to now, Yahoo has not been able to sell something that would play on iPod.  Right.  So it's actually...  What do you think? Would you pay a buck 99 for unprotected music?  Heck no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Buy the CD.  Rip it.  Yeah. I mean, you're talking about $1.99 for a single track.  Single track.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A single track should be $0.25. That's what it should be. $0.25. Unprotected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like a phone call should be $0.10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When I was a kid, a nickel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they don't care if a thousand people pirate that one song because yeah, exactly.  It's a promo to get them to buy more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The premium is for a personalized name version of the song. It says paidcontent.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, wait. She sings, oh, Leo, I love you. Leo, you're my man.  What? A personalized how?  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hold on.  Look, I'm adventuring Jessica Simpson's Yahoo music, Jessica for You page.  Download it. Get it. Pay a buck 99.  Oh my God. That's exactly what it is. Get your name in the song. Download a personalized MP3  just for you. Let's see if they have Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pay a buck 99 for that. So they have some names.  What did you have?  They have a lot of names.  So did Jessica have to go to the studio and sing, I love you, Andrew. I love you,  Patrick. I love you, Kevin. I love you, Dvorak. How do you say Dvorak?  Isn't that Leo?  Of course they don't have Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hold on. Hold on.  Never have Leo.  They have Patrick. I'm sure they have John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you buy that song?  I'd like to distribute it.  Patrick, Patrick, you're my man. Patrick can't do it. No one can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gizmo's giving away free stuff.  This might be nicer. I'll play this.  In fact, here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh dear. Here we go. This is probably violating some sort of copyright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even if it doesn't.  I think we actually do have fair use for this.  Just the first few seconds.  Okay. We're connecting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're buying this on Yahoo music? You actually buy it?  No, it's the free sample.  Oh, okay. I was going to say if you bought it, I'd be impressed.  I probably can't even do it on a Mac, can I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's about enough of that.  We didn't even hear any of it.  Yeah. You know, it's probably not getting picked up by Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No. Yeah. You have to have special techniques.  It was perky.  Get it personalized. All right. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey Leo?  Yeah.  Have it personalized for the Twitch show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they don't. She didn't sing one that says, oh, Twit Army, I love you.  Why not?  I love you so very much. Wait a minute. I'm going to buy one that says John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you really like singing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a new talent for you.  Leo's secret bubblegum pop music passage.  Talent's not the word they usually use to describe it, I'm afraid, Kevin.  It's more like a curse. All right. Let me see if I can...  A curse.  Okay. Credit card type.  Okay. I'll just type in my Americans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now the show is deteriorating. It's filling out forms on the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to say this is even better than watching gaming on G4.  I can edit it out. I can edit it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Get back to stick cam.  All right. You pick a story. You guys talk amongst yourselves while I buy John a song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, one terabyte hard drives.  What about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who? Who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're going to be available before the end of this year.  We had Brian Dexheimer on DL.TV and I did like a 20 minute interview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's one disk, it's not a container with two of them in there, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No. I think the one terabyte disks are going to come later.  Well, I've got a one terabyte disk. We're sitting right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's made by Maxstor. It's one terabyte.  But it's not a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just multiple drives.  Yeah, there's two drives in the box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but this is actually a single drive that contains a terabyte for the end of this year.  They also talk a lot about what's going on with... I'm sorry?  They might use multiple platters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm sorry, but one of the things we should probably do a special show on,  since I wrote a column on it and I'm up to speed on this, which is unusual for me,  is we're coming on the 50th anniversary of the hard disk in September.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, that's amazing.  That's amazing.  I don't think I'd want to buy a single platter or even a single mechanism terabyte.  It just doesn't seem like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It seems like a bad idea.  Single terabyte platters...  You know, if you listen to the fabulous interview with Brian Dexheimer...  I will.  But one of the things he talks about is what it's going to take to get to  terabytes levels of aerial density on a single disk.  And it's coming, but it's a ways out.  We're talking about a terabyte in a single hard drive at this point.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you talk to Gibson about this, he says that...  Because his software, Spinrite, will actually watch the ECC corrections going on.  And on a 200 gigabyte disk, there's whatever it is, a few hundred corrections a second or whatever.  It gets to a very... rapidly gets to a very big number  where it's constantly correcting errors as you get this aerial density up so high.  As you might imagine, really.  Ladies and gentlemen, the musical stylings of Jessica Simpson and a very special,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  personalized song for John C. DeVore.  It's called A Public Afair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's going to sing at some point, I'm sure.  Have I already used up the fair use time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't heard it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to have to plug it in later, Leo.  Oh, you can't hear it?  Oh, wait, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.  Here you go.  Enjoy, guys.  This is for you.  It's not really very well personalized.  All right, that's enough of that.  Yeah, it sucks.  But hey, no DRM, which doesn't mean you can play it on your podcast.  Oh, brother.  Maybe I misunderstood.  I don't know.  I'll give it to you, John, because I have really no use for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, you know, I have a couple of personal notes to make since we keep throwing this stuff on  these broadcasts.  One of them is that I've noticed that we've got no response from anybody World Cup way.  We don't have any listeners, I believe, in Italy or France.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're too busy partying.  I don't know.  I don't think they speak English.  You might be right.  We do actually have.  France is one of the countries that we get a few thousand downloads a month from, but  maybe they're not soccer fans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It could be.  And also, I've been getting a lot of people complaining since last week.  We started talking about cooking and I've claimed that I was going to post my flank steak.  Did you ever do that?  No, you know, I'm going to post it today.  So it'll be up when they go on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How many people wrote to you and said, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  About a dozen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where's your flank steak recipe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a bunch of apparently a bunch of  twit listeners who are like to cook stuff and they're just hungry for recipes.  So I don't know.

Transcript:  Welcome to the latest twit network conference cooking with John Thursdays.  John and Leo.  Apparently, it was the world's first audio cooking show.  Actually, well, you know, there's control chicken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's Alex Albrecht has a cooking show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but I'm talking about doing it, you know, over sound.  Pure audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  Radio cooking show.  There you go.  I asked to do a radio.  What are you doing now?  I used to do a radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Get sure to look hot.  I've done many a radio cooking show.  That's a good format.  It's a long time.  Radio cooking show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, so I apologize to people who were writing in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dying for that.  So before we go, one of the things we wanted to talk about with Kevin Creewell is the new chips  from Intel, the Conroe and Marum chip.  I saw something quite interesting.  I didn't realize this, but at the IDF, and you probably saw this, Patrick,  but I just I wasn't paying attention.  One of the demos they did is they took a motherboard, a Yona, a Dell with a Yona in it.  They popped out the Yona, popped in the Marum and got like 25% better performance on it.  It's I didn't realize it's socket compatible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's platform compatible, so you can just drop it in.  Yeah, that's just one of the best things about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think you're gonna see a lot of people doing that kind of an upgrade?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, actually you can't.  And for one thing, notebooks really can't do that kind of upgrade.  Right.  Yeah.  And most of the time there and then in desktops, they're actually,  I think you require a different motherboard because they've changed the voltage regulator.  Ah, shoot.  For Conroe.  So Conroe has got a different voltage regulator and different control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if it were a Marum, you could.  The reason I'm asking is because there, for instance, a Mac Mini is using a Yona chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's my understanding is that the Mac Mini should be able to,  the Max Mini and the iMac should be able to do it.  Not confirmed though.  Wouldn't that be something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Depends if it's using a socket inside the parts  and that you could access the processor and pop it out and swap it in.  You might need a BIOS upgrade too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you could do such a thing,  what kind of improvement in performance would you expect to see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Intel's been talking about 20% or more on notebooks.  It depends on the application.  If you're doing a lot of media stuff where you use the new SSE instructions  or the new SSE unit, it's much faster than the old one.  Also, if you're doing 64-bit software, the new,  well actually, Yona didn't do 64-bit software, only did 32-bit.  So it couldn't actually do 64-bit software.  You should easily see 20% improvement in performance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let's take those one at a time.  What programs use SSE?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Those would be more like games and anything media oriented.  If you're ripping or video editing software.  Yeah, all that stuff.  Yep, transcoders would definitely use SSE.  Also, it's a bigger cache.  It's a 4-meg cache versus the 2-meg cache on Yona.  Yeah, that should make a difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  On the high-end parts, the high-end parts have 4 megabytes cache.  The low-end parts have 2 megabytes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it sounds like really the significant difference here is not 64-bit or better SSE,  but really a new core.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and it was a really major redesign from the guys in Israel who did the original Yona design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These guys are great in Israel.  They really know what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They really saved Intel's bacon when Netburst turned out to be a dead end road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because no pun intended.  They had this Prescott chip which could actually fry bacon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they did.  They saved them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The kosher bacon.  Well, they backed away from the hole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, they had to see that pipelining was going to work and people were going to optimize  your software for these really long branch predictions and pipelines.  They gave up.  They just made it faster.  They made a shorter pipeline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin used to be at the microprocessor report, so he really knows what he's talking about here.  Is the pipeline shorter on the new cores?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it's shorter than the Pentium 4.  Pentium 4 went up to 31 stages of pipeline.  This is back down to 14.  And you go back to the Pentium 3, it was like an 11 stage pipeline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the clock speeds are not improved clock speeds,  so they must be getting some efficiency somewhere.  How are they making it a more efficient chip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They do more in parallel.  They do it wider.  Actually, they're doing more what AMD did with Athlon XP and Athlon 64.  Interesting.  But they did it one more than AMD did.  Instead of three decoders, they put four decoders.  They put more cache on board.  They sped up all the circuitry that they could find.  They crunched a couple of instructions they could put together  and executed them at once, so they get speed up there.  There's lots of improvements, but basically it's more what,  similar to what AMD did with the Athlon 64,  than the NetBurst architecture, which turned out to be way off into the weeds.  They did take some of the instructions, like the SSE instructions,  and some of the features that they had built into Pentium 4,  and added it to Conroe into the core microarchitecture.  But the microarchitecture itself is more related to the Pentium 3  than it is to the Pentium 4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's one reason, actually, when they introduced the Pentium M.  They're not going to put that in the ads, I don't think.  No.  When they introduced the Pentium M, originally, the Centrino part,  they wouldn't talk about what's inside of it at all,  because it was much closer to a Pentium 3 than a Pentium 4.  And they didn't want that to taint the Pentium M,  even though the Pentium was a great chip.  It formed real well.  And this is just an evolution of that Pentium M chip.  Very interesting.  It actually all goes back to a failed chip from Intel called Timna.  Timna was a chip that took a Pentium 3 core, modified it,  had a built-in memory controller and a built-in display driver, all in one chip.  And Intel never released that chip, because they made a mistake in choosing the memory.  They used Rampus, and Rampus turned out to be a big disaster.  But that's actually the origin of the Pentium M, and now the core microarchitecture.  You never know what a failed program can actually come back in the end and save the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What have we learned here in chip design?  What mistake did Intel make, and how did they fix it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We learned that it's always good to have a Plan B.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If your great idea about long pipelines and branch prediction doesn't work,  have a Plan B.  Have a second idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The 386 was a Plan B for Intel many years ago.  They had a different part called the 432 that was going to be the next big architecture,  and that didn't pan out.  So their Plan B was the 386.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Essentially, to boil it down, what we're seeing with the Merrim and the Conroe  is essentially returned to the Pentium 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Much closer to Pentium 3 than it is to Pentium 4.  That's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not going to say we missed the boat, but I think it is where people don't understand  what's happened here.  It isn't just a new Pentium 4, a new way of doing a Pentium 4.  It's a new core that is in fact considerably faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's faster in performance, not faster in clock speed.  It's more efficient.  More efficient, yes.  It's a good word.  Efficiency is a really good word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kevin, what do you think of AMD's kind of pulling an Intel and saying,  hold off, we've got our 4x4 technology coming?  The hybrid dual socket stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The 4x4 has some potential because you really need a double amount of memory bandwidth  because now you have two processor sockets, each with up to four, the total of four DIMMs each.  You can put tons of memory in this thing and also lots of bandwidth.  It could be a killer, but it's going to be hugely expensive.  It's going to be a really niche product for probably a $6,000 or $7,000 maybe more.  The only other way you can see this is very similar to is what Apple is going to do with  it, probably do with the next Power Mac.  Well, it won't be called Power Mac, obviously, because it's not Power Architecture anymore.  But dual sockets and lots of expense on it.  It's pricey to do it that way, but it does have advantages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think that Apple is going to release a Core 2-based desktop at the Worldwide  Developers Conference next week or a week and a half from now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everybody tries to guess what Apple is going to do next, but it's a great fun thing to do.  But actually, you would be surprised if they didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It seems like it might be easier, though, for them to do a Merum  upgrade to the MacBook Pro first.  Of course, they must be sitting on these chips and ready to do this power, this new Tana.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have to be dying to replace the G5s at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what's interesting to me?  Is that every time Apple sneezes or report on it, nobody ever talks about when Dell is  going to bring out their next chip or when OG Dell is going to or anybody for that matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Dell hasn't been sitting on the same processors for the last two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and Dell has shipped Conroe, or at least is offering Conroe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, how can we never talk about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because they release it at the same time Intel releases their chips.  They're going to tell us, then everybody comes out and says, here we are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, then Apple brings it out sometime later, so that's news.  I don't, I'm just baffled by this.  I think you guys are a bunch of Apple bigots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you're just saying that because you know you're going to get a lot of lovely mail from people.  Save it for your blog, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Save it for your call.  Apple baiting.  Actually, I thought they weren't.  I thought the Cortu wasn't physically going into this, hitting a street until next week.  Are they actually selling them now?  No.  Or just ordering?  I'm going to Dell.  I should say I'm going to Dell right now, John.  Just for you.  No, no, no.  Go, go, go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not, I don't believe you can buy it yet.  I think it's the end of the month or early August.  Yeah, I thought it was the 27th.  Yeah, well, they pulled off.  It's kind of weird.  It's like the striptease of this thing where they release some more information and a little  more information.  And what they did last week was release the NDAs for all the sites that had done benchmarks.  So that's where you sort of all raft the benchmarks, but no chips yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's amazing that they're actually filling the entire channel from the low end.  Instead of just doing the high end version and then trickling the rest of them in, it's  kind of neat to watch them basically.  I mean, this is a total assault on AMD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they said at their financial conference call that they had $200 million dollars worth  of extra units that they found that they could use that were production worthy.  And in addition, they expect to have things, chips in the channel when they launch it.  So that means motherboards and chips, maybe go down to fries and buy one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like that thought.  I mean, I'm just laughing because I haven't built an Intel based system in a really long  time.  So I'm looking forward to the idea that it may be for $183.  I can pick it up as 6300.  That'll kick the snot out of my existing $500 system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And of course you'd use a enforced.  Oh, no, you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could.  Could you?  Well, yeah, there'll be Nvidia support for Conroe.  There will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  They haven't seen it yet, but there will be.  How'd you like how I got that out of them?  Nicely done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that goes to that.  Do you have a ship date for that?  So when am I building my $500 upgrade for my $500 PC?  With SLI and.  You don't.  Yeah, I don't think I'm going to be an SLI kind of guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have two SLI systems.  No, shut up.  Yeah, but John, have you paid for either one of them?  I'm sorry.  I can't hear you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.  It dropped off there.  The GX2s are pretty good.  Actually, it's like SLI on one card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I see.  I try not to own any single graphics card that costs more than the first car I purchased.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're not a big gamer either.  I mean, that's not what you build a machine to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I can be a great gamer.  It's just the problem is it's going to cost me my marriage and my job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As long as we get Kevin on here, would you benefit in anything besides gaming with SLI?  For instance, video processing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you keep a lot of windows open in Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, glass will look great.  No, but really, seriously, is it just for gaming?  No, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Andy, you can do some really good Andy Ailey thing, but I couldn't actually give you a  good answer on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's also good for multi-monitors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Why is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you can pump out four monitors off of a double system.  Like, that's amazing.  Yeah, I'd like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You would, actually.  Yeah, I'd love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I've actually seen like, you know, graphics card, like mid-range graphics card from a year,  and a half ago actually start to choke when you get like 15, 25, 35 windows open in Vista.  You start getting the, you know, your performance is not optimized, although the newer drivers  are helping out with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's a lot of these are early drivers still.  And you're in really beta drivers and the drivers will improve a lot in the next six months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there anybody else that's playing this game besides you and ATI?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In any significant way?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, or what about in the insignificant way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you still have VIAs and S3 around.  Intel's, you got, of course you got Intel.  Intel's integrated graphics has the largest market share in the business by far.  You know, it's good enough graphics is still acceptable to a lot of people, especially  businesses.  It really comes down to, it's, you know, ATI, Nvidia, and Intel for the business.  That's it.  And a little bit S3.  But S3 is like, is pretty small at this point.  You used to be, I remember back when it was S3 and ATI used to battle it out and leapfrog  each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I remember reviewing graphics cards in those days.  Oh yeah, that was fun.  That was really fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it'd be back and forth and back and forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And oh, they used to be like 90 graphics vendors at one point in time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  Yeah, they all had these problems.  Remember number nine?  Yeah, Voodoo.  And Voodoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, not Voodoo.  You mean 3DFX.  3DFX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, 3DFX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Voodoo cars.  Yeah, Voodoo brand.  What happened to 3DFX?  Who acquired them?  Was it you guys who acquired them?  Yeah, Nvidia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we acquired the property and we hired about a hundred other people.  But physically we didn't actually acquire 3DFX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It wasn't much to acquire probably.  But yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know what I liked about 3DFX and it's overlooked, and I think you guys should  really pick it up a little bit, which is they had some of the best tchotchkes.  Like what?  Like what would you get from 3DFX?  Oh, they had some gym bags and all kinds of cool stuff.  Gym bags.  They have a great commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a fantastic Nvidia jacket.  Oh really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I don't have one.  Oh, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, you should subscribe to Valley Schwag, John.  Have you seen Valley Schwag?  No, there's a place where you can swap the schwag.  They're basically saying like if you subscribe, I can't figure out if it's a joke or if it's  serious.  But they're basically there.  The idea was they threw a party and that they're going to be, you'll be able to like  basically sign up and receive shipments of the best in Silicon Valley Schwag.  Can't attend the parties?  Can't get inside?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what I like to do with that stuff?  Although I wouldn't do it with that jacket, but you never know.  Give it away to the homeless.  Now what I really enjoyed doing, this is when I was at, during the era of tech TV,  I grabbed as many of the big thinkers hats and caps.  I could get a hold of a box of them and I'd give them to those guys that are at the freeway  off ramps asking for money.  Excellent.  And I'd get the biggest kick out of seeing some guy begging for money with a big thinkers cap on.  It's just something weirdly strange about it.  It's kind of a surreal kind of an image.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's perverse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just want to say a really brief hello to, and he is a listener and he is a big fan.  I guess his brother, brother-in-law sent us a note and he just wanted to say hi  to him.  What else?  Oh, amazing, amazing statistics from the last episode of Twit.  I got a great note from AOL from Jeffrey Graham, who is our contact over at AOL Radio.  He said the server guys were, there was quite a bit of steam coming off of the server on  Sunday night when Twit 62 came out.  We pushed, I think three and a half terabytes at a peak of very close to a gigabit.  A second off the server.  So a tip of the hat and a thank you to the guys who hose down the servers and keep them  from overheating when Twit comes out because that's an important job.  Don't you just see them kind of in the in the hole there with the boilers?  Oh my God, more coal.  Here comes Twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  I think it's maybe it's time to start staggering how the RSS is released.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, we talked about that before.  I wish somebody would because it's not our it's not up to us is be people like iTunes  or somebody.  We got to find a way Patrick.  The main reason Patrick's on is he has three boxes of crap now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it was originally it was one box of crap for the person who came up with the name.  Okay, and we are going to send a box of crap to the person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody ever came up for the name of this week in tech.  That was I deserve the box of crap because I came up with it.  The closest.  That could be arranged.  No, I don't want it.  What's in this?  What's in this box of crap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's it's it's selections of the selections of some of the finest remnants of my last 10  years in technology.  Oh my God, there'll be at least one GPS device.  One.  Well, there's there's a there'll be a couple of GPS devices like GPS devices for notebooks,  at least one wireless video camera, a few Pentium chips, who knows what all else.  A little bit of software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm going to go back through light for that.  Through the entries because we do have I believe it was a girl, a young girl who came up with this  week in geek, which was the closest anybody came to twit.  And so that young girl who's now 21, but that she was just 14 at the time, but she did.  In fact, I believe come the closest to naming twit.  And in fact, it was when I read her submission this week in geek that I actually thought of this  week in tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So perhaps we can get everybody to sign, you know, something.  We'll put something from the great Leo Laporte library.  We will put some autographs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll put some more stuff in there just but but I am going to send her an email saying  congratulations.  One and a half years later, you've actually won the contest and congratulations to you.  And then we still have two boxes.  How are we going to get rid of the other two?  Well, we'll think of something.  All right.  I'm sure we'll get some interesting requests for you.  We want to do another contest.  Yeah.  Now that we've completed our first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, every every we'll do one every two years whether we need to or not.  I think that's a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Best sweater sent in for John gets a box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go.  John, what address should they mail those sweaters to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They should send them to you, Leo.  Just how people email me.  I got a clear on before I started getting bags of dog crap or something.  No way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody somebody actually sent me a box of crap.  I mentioned this.  I think probably a kind of muted protest over the contest, you know, dribbling off.  And it was just full of power cords.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, you can't have power cords.  Are there any shaver cords?  No, no, no.  Shaver cords are hard to come by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was the cords that everybody has the same cord, you know, that standard PC cord.  Everybody's got a million of and now I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Any of the mouse here cords in there for the old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good.  It was the same was a hundred PC power cords.  And you know what?  You can send it up to my stepson up in Washington.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He sells that stuff on eBay.  But you get like five bucks a pop for those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you think I could get?  I have my own Mac cube.  What do you think I can get for that on eBay?  I give you 20 bucks for it.  I'd probably make more.  And that you can get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think it's worth a lot.  I think people can mod that thing.  They can pull out the guts and put in a good machine.  It's a work of art.  Yeah, it is actually quite attractive.  Hold on. Hold on.  Go on the eBay right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin is thinking, why did I ever say I'd appear on this show?  What a bunch of geezers.  Kevin, I do want to thank you.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Kevin is formerly of the Micro Processor Report, formerly AMD.  Now he is doing marketing at Nvidia.  And you're doing a great job, Kevin, because we all know the name Nvidia.  And I have a jacket.  So you're doing a great job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You and that jacket.  Thanks for having me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I really appreciate it.  Thanks for sending us straight on to Conroe, too.  It's good actually to get that information.  And you couldn't have picked a better week to come on with the exciting news of the AMD ATI.  Rumor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's only a rumor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think we've torpedoed that deal pretty good.  Thank you, Kevin.  You're welcome.  Take care.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  And thank you, John C. Dvorak, for joining us.  Send your sweaters and whatever else you'd like to to dvorak.org slash blog.  Or check it out.  Are you going to put a recipe up or anything up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm going to put the recipe.  I have.  I found all the recipes.  They were all done on Boardwatch.  I'm going to put a little page up with all of them.  Oh, that's nice.  And then I'll add some new ones.  I've been developing some new recipes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is the recipe you came up with from scratch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I design recipes.  I've been doing it since I was a kid.  From the Dvorak Test Kitchen.  This particular recipe for flank steak, though, is not something you wouldn't find out there.  You could find it anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The key is to cut the muscle striations in a diagonal so it doesn't, you know, curl up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, the key is to make sure that you have very high temperature that you cook with.  And you said 800 degrees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you how can you get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where do you get 800 degrees?  You can get 800 degrees off of a smoldering fire of mesquite charcoal.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A really big pile of basically you're searing the meat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, John, thank you very much.  Have a great afternoon.  And of course, to Patrick Norton, my good friend and owner of three, count them three, boxes of crap.  But dwindling now, we're going to get word of one anyway, unless she turns it down.  Then I don't know what we're going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which, you know, if she turns it down, I'm sure we'll, if she turns it down,  we'll give it to the first person who e-mails you requesting the box of crap.  We could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We could do that.  We'll put it, just put it on the front steps at the Twitter headquarters and just maybe  some homeless person will want a GPS device.  I don't know.  Nowhere in the sleeping.  You can, I'll tell you where Patrick Norton's sleeping these days.  It's right under the desk at DL.TV with two or three shows a week.  Is it two or three?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We do two episodes of DLTV.  We do an episode of John C. Dvorak on Cranky Geeks and we do a whole bunch of podcasts.  He works hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hardest work in the show business.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
