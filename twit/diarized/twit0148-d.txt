Transcript:  And by listeners like you.  Thanks for your donations.  It's time for twit.  This is the show where we talk about high tech stuff and John C. Dvorak is here.  Dvorak.org slash blog.  Hello Mr. D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hi there.  You know, Leo, you sound a little bit like you're in a bucket today.  You're working the mic different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, you know what it is.  If I do it like this, does that feel better?  The rule.  I changed.  I changed.  That's definitely better.  I changed my setup.  Here's why.  This is you're now on a, it's complicated.  I, I, you really want the sorted story.  I'm trying to use Skype 4.0.  The new Skype just came out, right?  And it, it Windows only.  It doesn't work on the Mac.  So I have, I have violated my Macintosh MacBook Pro, the 17 inch and I've, and I've put Vista  on it.  So it's running Vista bootcamp, but some things, I think the drivers are not good because when  I send audio directly into it, so I'm using a USB mic in addition to my good mic and I'm  talking to both of them.  And so that's why it sounds like I'm a little distant because the USB mic is in fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there some reason you'd go into an Italian accent to describe this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Is it when you talk about a USB, you're supposed to talk in Italian accent.  We're going to lose a Harry McCracken if we keep this up.  Let's not do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we lost them already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'm still here.  Harry McCracken long, 13 years at PC world just left PC world and is starting a new tech  blog sometime in the month of July called Technologizer.  And Harry, we've never met, but I've, I've long regarded you as one of the, one of the  real greats in the business.  So it's so good to have you on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, thank you, Leo.  I have watched and enjoyed all the stuff you've done for a long time too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, I kicked myself.  I should have called you sooner.  We should also mention, well, first let me introduce Will and I'm going to mention one  other thing that is to redounds to Harry's glory.  Will Harris is also here.  There is no glory in being here except for channelflip.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely.  I have to.  That's my job today.  I have to pimp that out like crazy because we launched this week.  So everyone listening to Twitter just has to go to channelflip.com and subscribe.  Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.  It's my Dvorak moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Channel Flip was going going on for a while and then it stopped cold a couple of months  ago.  Now it's, what do you mean launched?  What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, so we relaunched it.  We redesigned the website.  We raised a bunch of money from some venture capital guys and we built up a nice studio  in London and now we're putting out two or three new videos every day.  Wow.  Tech, games, films and we're going to be doing loads of other crazy stuff as well.  Digital photography.  We're having a whole channel dedicated to that.  So, you know, cool drinks and poker and all kinds of crazy things.  Oh, so it's not just tech?  No, it's just going to be very exciting.  It's basically like, it's sort of pitching as an online men's magazine.  Although obviously women are very welcome as well if they like this kind of thing.  Are there going to be babes?  No, we're not so big on the babes.  As much as I would have a, you know, run a magazine full of babes, the demand isn't really  there I think.  Ha!  But, you know, so...  What world do you live in, Will Harris?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  What world do you live in when you say there's no demand for babes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think the, you know, most of the audience, the Twitter audience, are a little bit more  refined.  They've gone a little bit beyond...  Obviously a Cambridge man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  A little bit beyond the, you know...  Anyway, good to have all three of you aboard.  I just wanted to mention...  And actually I want to get this straight because I...  So Harry, you're at PC World.  What was the deal with Macworld?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Macworld is a sister publication of ours, but I think the story you're thinking of,  Leo, is one that we published on PC World.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The one that, the 10 things we hate about Apple.  That's right.  Oh, okay.  I got it.  So the publisher had just recently come over from Apple, isn't that it?  From Macworld, I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Isn't that it?  He had been a former CEO of Macworld.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Right.  And he says, Harry, you can't publish this article.  It'll cheese off our advertisers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Essentially, he was concerned about Apple being nonplussed with an article like that.  And this was about a year ago, by the way.  He told me, you can't publish that.  And I have to say, I'd been in this business for a long time and not once had I ever changed  so much as a syllable because of concerns over companies being upset with us.  And that's the kind of thing where you can only lose your virginity once on that kind  of thing.  And I wasn't going to do it.  And I resigned over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  God, I love that.  And it was not even a harder decision, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The hard decision would be to cave in on that stuff.  And it was a lot easier to say, I'm not going to do this.  Not going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'm so proud of you.  Of course, he lost his job.  You kept yours.  And the article was published.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He published the article.  Things were okay.  And I stayed at PC World for one more year, which made about 13 and a half and had a good  time.  And then just in the last few months, as much as I enjoyed my job and as much as being editor-in-chief  of PC World is one of the coolest imaginable jobs for somebody like me.  It dawned on me that PC World was very successful before I got there.  It would be extremely successful without me.  And I wanted to build something from scratch.  And as people like you, Leo, have shown, it is entirely possible to do tech stuff on the  web without a big company backing you.  And I wanted to try to build something from scratch.  So I left PC World once again under much more positive circumstances.  And I'm launching a site called Technologizer in the next few weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think that's really exciting.  Congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I figure, you know, I went out and bought, speaking to MacBook Pros, I bought a nice  15-inch MacBook Pro.  And I figure if you have a notebook, a camera, a phone, an internet connection, you can work  from anywhere.  And almost everything you need is free these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So Will, you're probably going to have some things to say to Harry because you were at  Zip Tech, of course, which is a British kind of same idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we were super geeky and super hardcore tech, which is great.  And I mean, I feel a bit redundant now because I'm a bit out of that thing.  I couldn't really tell you all the latest hardware and stuff now, which I used to be  able to do.  But...  Is that what you're going to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Are you going to be like extreme, what is it, extreme tech?  That's the Zipf Davis publication.  No, not really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, as I was thinking about this, it occurred to me we have things like extreme  tech, we have Gizmodo and Engadget and TechCrunch, and they're all doing well.  And the world doesn't need another one of those.  And I'm going to be more of a generalist and probably a little bit more mainstream.  I kind of feel like if you were to parachute into almost any major city in the country  and walk around the street and ask people about those sites, the majority of people  still don't know about them.  The great thing about having worked at PC World is we reached millions of people and  I learned a lot about communicating to millions of people.  And I'm going to try to be pretty mainstream.  And well, I hope that people who are deeply into technology will read the stuff I do.  And I think they will.  I also wanted to be appealing to a pretty broad group of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's really interesting because there's absolutely a massive market of tech  enthusiasts who are not blog stroke and gadget readers.  I mean, just speaking from personal experience, I know so many guys and I mean, I don't want  to generalize, but they tend to be sort of older than 30 who do not have time to sit  and read all the trillions of updates on blog every day.  They like to go out.  They still like to buy their magazines and they're really interested in this stuff, but  they don't want the kind of uber geeky spy shots or whatever.  They just want that kind of slightly more mainstream tech stuff.  And I think you're hitting the nail on the head right there.  There's a big market for that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, certainly more of a mainstream market.  I tell you though, I gladly cede that to you.  I love doing niche and my attitude has always been, I try to talk to TicTacTV into doing  this too, is just get more geeky, more nichey, more specialized.  Every time, it's funny, every time we do a more general show, it does worse.  And the more geeky the show, the better it does.  Is that, I don't know if that's just me, I guess, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think I'll delve into some of the niches I'm particularly interested in, but all the  sites I mentioned, I really like and they're doing great.  And unless I'm a little different, there's not going to be a need for what I do.  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, you got to find your own voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And there are just some huge stories out there.  I mean, if all you did was cover Apple and Google and Microsoft, that's almost enough  material to keep you going forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You left one out.  The big story of the day, Yahoo!  Will the last guy to leave Yahoo! turn out the lights?  Oh my word.  What is going on?  I'm going to put a link in here into our show notes.  We have now show notes at twitlive.tv to TechCrunch's article, the Yahoo!  ExecTracker.  TechCrunch in the last year and a half, 114 executives have left, including, I didn't  know this, Dan Rosenzweig left Yahoo! in March 2007, John.  We were talking about maybe he should take over.  It is.  And this past week was terrible.  He's been out for over a year.  I was, I didn't realize that when we were talking about it.  I thought he was still at Yahoo!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, he left a long time ago.  I mean, I wrote that thing about him becoming the CEO long before he left, but the, actually  I think I was talking about Eric Hippo becoming the CEO, although Rosenzweig would probably  be okay.  But, you know, I've been trying to get a hold of Dan now since he quit and he won't return  my calls now.  Isn't that unbelievable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Now that he doesn't have to talk to you.  So look at, look at who's left in the last couple of weeks.  Jeremy Zawadny, he's gone to Craigslist.  Katerina Fake and Stuart Butterfield, they found a flicker.  They're gone.  They were going to be gone anyway.  Come on.  Well, these guys, some of these guys vested and so they didn't have to stick around.  But, but they, but, but Stuart wrote a pretty nasty.  It was well couched, I thought.  But an interesting resignation letter in which he basically said, you guys, I'm a tinsmith  and you've branched out into so many other things.  There's no room for people who make tin anymore.  It was a rather, I'm afraid, stretched, tortured metaphor.  But the point was that, you know, you've gotten away from your core business, which is the  internet.  The guy who wrote the peanut butter memo last year, the one who said that Yahoo's spreading  itself too thin, he's gone.  The delicious guy left too.  Joshua Schachter, gone.  Chris Bolt, Chi Lu, Jeff Weiner, Michael Geller.  I mean, the list is huge.  What's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a few guys quick.  A few guys?  That company is huge.  I think you could probably run this list anytime you wanted to.  I think it's exaggerated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But these are, these are kind of.  But don't you think, don't you think that the people who are leaving are the super,  I mean, the smart ones.  The smart ones.  The guy who left this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I never heard half of these people myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The guy who was like the VP of search left.  The guy who was like the VP of search advertising.  These are significant people.  The guy who was the VP in charge of like email and groups and chat left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've been in these big companies.  You could lose these VPs until you're blue in the face.  There's only a few superstars at the company anyway, in any company.  These guys are all just a bunch of bureaucrats.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, I don't know if that's true.  These guys were actually the innovators.  Did you see the Yahoo form letter?  The Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who would name one of these guys that was an innovator?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, all of the guys I just mentioned, Schachter, Zawadni.  What do you do?  What does Schachter do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A thing called Delicious.  Well, what is, yeah, that's fine.  What's he doing at Yahoo?  They bought it.  They bought it and they just let it sit there.  That's the point I'm making.  These companies buy these little companies and then the founders of these other companies,  which are used to working for themselves in small environments.  They're always going to quit.  I'm surprised he was there as long as he was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Senior Vice President Strategic Alliances, Eric Chris Boldt, that's significant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Four executives in one day.  A couple of years ago at PC World, we were really excited by some of the acquisitions  they made of things like Flickr and Delicious.  And it is entirely true that they haven't done nothing.  Those acquisitions did not really rub off on Yahoo in the way that it seemed like they  might.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And that's what these guys were leaving are saying.  Yahoo is not an Internet company.  They don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, Yahoo, does anybody's shocked by this?  I mean, Yahoo bought Mark Cuban's broadcast dot com for like three billion dollars.  And what happened to that?  And what happened to Mark Cuban?  And they bought a million other little companies over the years.  And they've all the same thing has been the same old story over and over again.  And now everybody because of the focus being on Yahoo, everybody's all up in arms about  it when this is all would have been anticipated and would have happened anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Joshua Schachter, the guy who started Delicious.  And by the way, the one thing Yahoo did, the only thing is they created they actually changed  Delicious or added a URL.  So it's Delicious dot com as well as DEL dot ICIO dot US, which is the worst URL I can  imagine.  Oh, I thought it was clever.  It was clever, but it's good that they got Delicious dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it is kind of admirable that Yahoo didn't really screw up any of these cool little companies  they acquired, but they also didn't really seem to learn all that much from them.  Right.  It's not surprising these people left, but the fact they all left in the space of four  or five days is kind of startling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think what was really disappointing though with Delicious is like when was the last time  you saw like a feature rollout on Delicious and how has that been getting for it?  They had Delicious 2 in beta for a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And exactly.  Where is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is just piling on piling on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I like well, you know, who's really piling on is Mike Harrington is getting so much,  so much mileage out of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's getting some traffic, isn't he?  I mean, what a, just milking it for everything it's worth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He went on ABC the other day to say what, you know, ABC anchor, Mike Harrington of TechCrunch,  you're an observer of web 2.0 and what's happening on the internet.  What's happening with Yahoo?  They're dying.  They're dying.  It's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Everybody's leaving.  And then, and of course, and then he writes the article that says, and where is Jerry  Yang?  We can't reach him.  He's been out of touch.  He's in Decker running the whole show.  Apparently nobody can get him on the phone.  That's hilarious.  He's on vac, where is he?  On vacation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What a time to have vacation.  I want to stop the conversation right now.  Leo and Will, when's the last time you called Jerry up and got him on the phone?  It's been a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's been a while.  Well, I can't get him on the phone.  I tried, John.  That's what I'm talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you try a couple years ago?  Did you try five years ago?  Did you try 10 years ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.  We used to, I've interviewed him many times, but that doesn't, that's neither here nor  there.  Who was still, you know, in those little, you know, tilt up offices in Sunnyvale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's been a long time.  I don't blame him for not going on the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't either.  But apparently it's not just the journalists that can't reach him.  Now again, consider the source.  It's Mike Harrington, but which is not to say that Mike is making this up, but maybe  he's blowing it up a little bigger than he needs to be.  But he's saying even people within Yahoo are saying, where's Jerry Yang?  He's not, he's not, he's nowhere around.  You'd think, you'd think, okay, maybe this, John, shouldn't somebody in management say,  yes, there have been a lot of defections lately.  Don't worry about it.  This is normal.  We're a business, business is fine.  And in fact, should point out as others have that Yahoo is profitable.  Yahoo, despite the, you know, kind of perceived failure of Panama, it makes more money than  MS Microsoft's advertising.  I mean, we're still the number two search site.  Number two ain't bad.  You know, Avis did okay being number two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know why they need to say this, Leo.  You're doing a fine job of it.  But shouldn't he be saying that?  Shouldn't he be writing a letter?  Why?  What's the point?  I mean, it's like, it's just, I think if I was Jerry, it was not a, he was not an outgoing  guy.  Why should he be taking, all he's going to get is a bunch of abuse.  Why didn't you say, you know, there's not going to be about looking for that excuse.  It's going to be, well, Jerry, how come he didn't sell to Microsoft?  You think it was the worst mistake you've ever made?  Why don't you think you're doing your shareholders a disservice by not selling to Microsoft?  Didn't you have a better offer in January 2007?  How come he didn't sell it to them then?  I mean, I can just imagine him.  Why does he need this aggravation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's probably in Naruba, taking in the sun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He should be on the, on the, yeah, good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Or some might say rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.  So here's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So John, what is, so John, you've obviously got a pretty strong opinion about Yahoo.  What is your prognosis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wrote my column in MarketWatch this last week, which was an open letter to the Yahoo  shareholders saying there are a bunch of whining jerk-offs.  Because mainly because, mainly because it's only in Silicon Valley where you're expected  to sell your company when some big company comes knocking.  Why should he sell his company?  He's like put his whole life into this thing.  There's no reason he should just, oh, okay, well, Microsoft wants it.  You can have it, Microsoft.  What a crock of crap that is in the fact everybody's buying into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think you might be right.  John, I mean, I would love to see Yahoo stay independent because I think that's better  for competition, but it's not Jerry Lange's company anymore and hasn't been ever since  they went public.  He has-  No, it's not unusual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not unusual for a CEO of a big company like this, when it's been decided by the board  that they do not want to sell for them to put poison pills in place, to say no, and  to resist.  I mean, this is not a big shock to anybody who's followed companies that don't want to  be sold.  They're not excited not to be sold, so they put measures in place.  How is this different than what we've seen a million times in the last 50 years when  companies don't want to be sold?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So you say let Yahoo be Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What does that mean?  Well, that wasn't my title.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's a little tautologist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can see where you're coming from, John.  I think the problem is in the situation where, you know, Yang says, you know, I don't want  to sell my company, it's my company, whatever.  But have you got a better idea?  Like what is your alternative?  What are you going to do that's going to deliver value?  And I think most people, you know, they're already delivering more value than Microsoft

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  who has a total no clue when it comes to this entire market.  It's a joke.  I mean, essentially, if you Microsoft by Yahoo, you might as well just give the business to  Google and forget about it.  And the fact of the matter is it's not necessarily the case that they don't have a better idea.  They're not up to something.  If you dig around, you'll find a speech given recently by Decker about some of the programs  that they just in the process of initiating when all this Microsoft crap came down the  road.  And I think they have plenty of potential for growing in different directions.  I'm not that much.  The company makes money.  It's got a huge following.  I can't be I don't understand why everybody hates them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, so you think that this this exodus of executives is just business as usual, nothing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  unusual and exaggerated business as usual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  OK. And if you were running Yahoo, you would stay the course.  What would you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they're not staying the course.  They've got all kinds of programs in place.  I mean, it's not as though these guys are losing as much money as Ford Motor Company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You could point. Well, they shouldn't stay the course.  Harry, you agree. What would you do with Yahoo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the Brad Garlinghouse is one of the guys who left wrote this famous peanut butter  manifesto memo in which he said they needed to focus more.  And I think they have focused a little more in the last year or so.  But this is still a company that just sort of tries to do everything and anything.  And they more than any other company I can think of, they do things that compete with  themselves for the longest time.  They had both Flickr and Yahoo Photos.  They finally shut down Yahoo Photos, which made a lot of sense.  But Google has the luxury of having so much money and so many resources that can do  anything that comes into their heads.  And Yahoo, I don't think has that luxury and probably needs to be a company that does  somewhat fewer things better than they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Of course, Yahoo is considering, according to The Wall Street Journal and other  reporters, a reorganization to be led by Susan Decker, the president of Yahoo.  Some talk about centralizing, maybe taking its consumer products, putting them in one  group.  The David Gaffin running in the journal says, what about Jerry Yang?  You keep him?  You get rid of him?  He says he's a negative.  Harry Blodgett says, you need somebody to do a turnaround.  You need a clean house of every executive committed to a multi-year, that isn't committed  to a multi-year turnaround, bring in new talent, then hunker down and execute.  This sort of leadership isn't always popular, especially at the beginning.  It's also not the sort of leadership one immediately associates with Jerry Yang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Henry Blodgett said this?  He works for Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Silicon Valley Insider, that's a Yahoo property?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, not that, but he works for Yahoo on that tech ticker or whatever the heck it is.  He's one of the paid employees.  What does that tell you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, it tells us that the people at the rank and file may be not happy with what's going  on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he's not that rank and file.  He just started recently.  It just seems interesting to me that he turned on the company so quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  He's not the only one, I guess.  Kara Swisher says, many execs say that Yang has been strangely absent from the communications  around the reorg, which has largely been driven by Decker.  Do you think this reorg will in fact?  I bet you I'm going to predict that Jerry's out or shuffled upstairs to the board.  Don't you think that's what's going to happen?  Who's going to run Yahoo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It would be so cool if he came back and kind of did a Steve Jobs in terms of, of-  That was the hope.  That she didn't change and exciting people, but at least on the outside, there's not a  lot of evidence that's happened.  I think that was the plan, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Jerry's back.  Yahoo, let Yahoo be Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, the thing is, is that the guy had to inherit the mess left by Terry Semel.  Do you think these are all Semel loyalists who are leaving?  No, I don't think so.  I don't think that's, I think it's just a common thing you do.  You're a little, they're all entrepreneurs that are leaving because they don't like working  in a big company.  I mean, when Microsoft bought Hotmail, everybody quit.  And they're vested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It wasn't made big news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They stuck around until they vested and then they just vested and they left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They didn't even vest.  They accelerate the vesting and they get them out of there.  Who needs these people?  They're usually a nuisance to be honest about it.  Founders, they're such a nuisance.  Well, entrepreneurs are in a large corporation are often nuisances.  I agree.  Because they have better ideas usually is the reason.  They don't work in a large organization well.  Right.  But that's beside the point.  The fact of the matter is, you know, Yang comes in, he's only been in for one year and  a couple of days and, you know, trying to get this company to figure out what the hell  is going on would take him at least a year.  I mean, Steve Jobs didn't turn around the apple in 10 minutes.  And, you know, so meanwhile, he doesn't sell the company because, you know, because it  would have made the shareholders an extra two dollars or whatever it was.  It's already down the tank and, you know, it's going to make it 30.  That's a big deal when it was a hundred dollar stock at one point.  He doesn't sell the company.  And the next thing you know, everyone thinks he sucks.  I mean, I just think the whole thing is ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You know, I'm with I'm actually you've turned me around, John, because I love you.  No, you have.  You know, I don't know what I was thinking.  I apologize, Jerry.  Yahoo is a great company.  I didn't want Microsoft to buy it.  That was a terrible thing, regardless of shareholder value.  I mean, for the for the rest of the world, it was a terrible thing.  And I don't know if Jerry's the guy to run Yahoo or not, but it's it's doing fine.  Let's give him some I think you're saying let's give him some time.  Let's see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they got other programs in place.  I mean, I think Decker's good as a, you know, maybe a good reorg person.  I don't think she should be running the company.  I don't know who could be.  I mean, it's not an easy company to run, but it seems if anybody might be able to run it,  if Yang, you know, I mean, I feel sorry for the guy because he's I mean,  it's just like everybody hates him.  I mean, how much no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do you think people hate Yang?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Or I don't know if that's what people are saying.  I think people are saying maybe he just doesn't have their hypercritical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a company that people aren't incredibly hypercritical about.  And I have the feeling that even if Yahoo does start to turn around,  it may be a while before the world notices just because of that.  Right.  They kind of have a dark cloud over them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And let's underscore this.  They're making money.  They are not in the red.  This is a profitable company.  The stock is depressed and stockholders might be depressed, but it's a stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, the stock's not technically depressed because you're old.  The brass is typically the price earnings ratio should reflect  the growth rate in some way, shape or form.  And it does. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But and Harry's and Harry's absolutely right.  They could have trashed delicious.  They didn't. They didn't.  They didn't change it, but they kept it.  They could have trashed Flickr. They didn't.  They've done some good stuff.  I mean, look, Flickr is still great, although, you know,  I have to say when Butterfield and Fake left.  That sounds like a good law firm. Butterfield and Fake.  When they left, I think a lot of Flickr loyalists who knew their names,  most Flickr users don't even know who these people are.  But the Flickr old timers said, huh, what are we going to do?  And there were a lot of articles and what's, you know, where do we go?  Where do we bring our photos? Do you trust Flickr anymore?  It's not like Yahoo is about to delete your photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think this stuff is so it's it's I mean, that's an interesting point,  which is that it's so, you know, it's so inside baseball.  It's not even relevant to most people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, nothing we talk about is relevant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It may not be true.  You know, Will, that's yeah, who you're talking to here.  Right to our audience is pretty relevant.  And the other thing is when I wrote this last piece,  I've written a bunch of pieces on Yahoo and all kinds of different theories  about this and that.  And so I say to the editor, I say, well, I got one more Yahoo thing to to turn in.  And you know, you think I'm, you know, I'm overdoing it.  He says, God knows, apparently the readers of Market Watch  can't get enough Yahoo news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Between speculating on Steve Jobs health, this is good stuff.  This is this is what you hope for, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is your journalism at its best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's a sad state.  You're not going to write about this in technology technologies.  Oh, so are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Technologizer, technologizer, maybe a little maybe a little bit.  But, you know, there the world is full of thousands of people talking about this.  And I'm not sure if one more voice is going to make that much difference.  Who needs another ultimate?  I mean, ultimately, it's one way which technologizer will be a little bit  like PC world is ultimately going to be all about the stuff.  And so I'll care deeply about the services that Yahoo offers.  And if the people behind the company make those services better or worse, I care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But that's a really good point.  We're just I mean, if you just look at the the features, the services, what it's doing  and you don't worry about who's in the executive suite because it doesn't, you know,  that's a business discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, John's right when entrepreneurs should thrive in big companies,  but often they don't.  And I do worry that the Yahoo was smart enough to attract some really cool people.  And listen, hang on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So let's let's think let's think about this.  What was Yahoo's last launch?  What was the last thing they did and was any good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'll give you two.  I'll give you two. OK.  Yahoo video live to Yahoo dot com and Yahoo Buzz.  You know, Buzz has been a huge success.  It's not about this very call.  It's not grabbing the imagination of the didgeridoo like Dig did,

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  but it's bigger than dig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, let's let's talk about that.  And there's also three sixty.  There's actually they do quite a few things.  In fact, they canceled something recently that I was reading about.  I can't remember exactly.  It's like some sort of blogging initiative.  And I went to check it out and it says it closed it.  And I realized that I never even knew it existed.  Yahoo, if it has a real problem,  and I think the reason that people are piling onto the company is the following.  They have obviously no marketing or public relation expertise  to keep this kind of thing from happening.  They don't get the word out about these products.  Everything is like a closed system.  They do everything within themselves.  And so, yeah, if you're a Yahoo nutball, you probably know about some of this stuff.  But I don't know about any of it.  And I'm in the media. I should be writing about it.  They do some one of the worst jobs of promoting themselves,  except for their, you know, Yahoo ad that I've ever seen in a company that that's this big.  They're totally incompetent in this regard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You know who else is incompetent?  We actually talked about this on Windows Weekly.  Microsoft has not done a very good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have pointed this out over and over again.  Microsoft is the only company of its size that has no vice president of marketing.  They don't even have a marketing person.  They have a bunch of little marketing people here and there.  They're just as bad, if not worse than Yahoo in this.  It's amazing to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  For instance, you know, the Apple's just beating them up, up one side and down the other with his switch ads  and no response at all from Microsoft.  Not even like that's not true.  Bill Gates, you know, when he speaks, he says, it makes me mad.  But there's no there's no ads to respond to it.  Is that your Bill Gates?  It makes me mad.  Did you see the Bill Gates slideshow?  Where was that? I just saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to I just want to point out the best Bill Gates article that I saw today,  which is completely a rat hole, was about Bill Gates in high school trying to get all the honeys.  Did you read this? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  We're just going to Bill is leaving at the end of the month.  He's leaving Microsoft at the end of the month.  And so there's all of this, you know, farewell, Bill Gates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And apparently Bill Gates in high school was the sort of computer geek.  And everyone and the teachers asked him to write the class scheduling program  so that everybody, you know, to organize things.  And apparently his high school had just absorbed this brand new girls school.  And he organized the class timetable so that he got all the classes with all the hotties.  It didn't help, though, because he's still, you know, I'm a man.  Nobody else got them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You need your I could thread a projector like nobody.  I'm good.  Thread a projector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Here's the this is yeah, Harry, this the Fortune magazine.  They I guess Fortune says Bill Gates gave Fortune magazine

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  exclusive access to rare photos from the Microsoft archives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is a picture of me at age nine.  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fortune magazine.  Fortune magazine doesn't do anything that's not a puff piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Listen, this is Bill Gates talking about his photo album.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Then we see me in my football uniform in the back center here.  Yeah. I was on the second string team.  That's good. But it was actually kind of fun.  I was one of the better guys on the second string.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Position, but I didn't I didn't get to hear it.  You don't hear this. Are you hearing it?  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This photo is from Lakeside High School,  private school that Paul Allen attended.  Paul was you can't hear it. Oh, it's so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't I don't understand.  Oh, it's because you're using a PC and you don't know what you're doing.  I don't know how to use PCs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, I know why you can't hear it. Yeah, darnation.  Well, it's very funny. Go go.  Basically, at what you know, I'll hear I'll say it out loud while he's saying it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, looking here, you might think he was looking here.  You might think he was about 10 years older than I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This particular particular room was very important because very important  because this is where the first computer connection was created.  The Mother's Club funded that.  The Mother's Club funded that teletype anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's actually kind of fun to look at these old pictures.  He's the biggest geek.  But so it's so it's kind of you know, it's farewell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Bill Gates, we hardly knew you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I tell you who else been selling saying farewell to Bill Gates,  just while we're on general trends.  The number of conversations I've had this week with people who have phoned me up  and said, hi, well, so I want to buy a new computer.  Yeah, sure. Well, I want a new PC, but can I get one with that Vista?  Everything that I read says, says, says I don't want to get I don't want to get Vista.  My Vista sucks.  And I'm like, have you used Vista? No, no, no way.  I wouldn't I wouldn't touch it.  I wouldn't go near.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  People must think it's a car wreck.  I mean, they really I was amazed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, these are universal who attack geeks.  But this is average.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  This is what we were saying is that Microsoft.  It's unaccountable that they haven't tried to fix this problem.  It's just a perception.  And they and they don't they're not now apparently they're going to launch  a huge new ad campaign.  That's the latest news out of Redmond.  They're going to spend big bucks and try to resuscitate this.  I think the first thing they got to do is fix this Vista perception problem,  because it is it's pure perception.  It's not real. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's pure perception. Yeah.  It's partially perception for sure.  But I mean, at PC World, we did performance tests of XP versus Vista.  And even with SP1 on Vista,  it's still dog slow compared to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, but that's but that's always true, Harry.  If you went from 98 to XP, XP was much required.  More resources.  That's the next generation always requires more resources.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's also, I think, just an issue that there's not enough  that's better about Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there was at least more benefit moving from 98 to XP  than there appears to be going from.  I agree completely. It's partially perception,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  because a ton of the people who are very worried about Vista  have never actually used it and can't enumerate any specific things about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People and it's definitely marketing because people say, you know,  well, what is the benefit of going to Vista?  And you're crying out for Microsoft marketing companies.  You know, these are the 10 benefits of going to Vista.  And nobody can name any or say nobody knows what.  Well, there are there are a ton of benefits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  If you do use Vista.  I'm not a Vista apologist,  but I'm just saying there are definite benefits.  It's more I'll tell you what, it's more secure.  UAC works.  It does prevent a lot of there's no security is a huge difference in Vista.  Vista's got a lot of really cool little things like being able to click  the start menu and type the first few letters of the program you want to run.  And it finds a better, much better search.  I mean, there's a lot of Vista is, you know, OK.  First of all, operating systems are mature.  Look at what Apple's doing with the next version of Leopard Snow Leopard.  They're even saying we're not going to add features.  These are mature operating systems.  You can't expect, oh, all of a sudden the great new thing that's been missing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This stuff is pretty. No, I agree with that, Leo.  In fact, I think maybe we should single handedly turn this  this image around, but back to this idea about Apple.  And I just want to mention one thing.  I just got one because I got an upgrade on the Mac I use at Mevio.  And the thing boots faster and it shuts down faster.  I mean, they when they start upgrading stuff, they improve performance.  Microsoft has never shown a sign of doing this.  They make everything get slower over time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, bigger, fatter, more.  And I do applaud Apple.  They announced this at the Worldwide Developers Conference that they for saying,  no, we're not we're not going to add features in the next version.  We're going to make it more reliable.  We're going to improve performance.  We're going to tweak it.  We're going to make everything better, but you're not going to see more features.  And I think maybe Microsoft needs to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How much are they going to charge for that, though?  I mean, every, you know, nobody's going to pay 125 bucks for

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  for something that doesn't have nothing new.  Yeah, there's nothing new. It's just better.  Well, I would presume that they wouldn't charge for that.  And that would be right there. That would be a plus.  So Microsoft has announced this is also in Fortune magazine,  probably part of the fortune hagiography that they're doing about Bill Gates.  They're going to spend two hundred two hundred million dollars  for Windows advertising this year.  Two hundred million, that's in addition to the three hundred million  they've already agreed to spend with Crispin Porter and Boguski  to improve overall image and brand half a billion dollars on better branding.  I think they may be taking this seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but what can it what what what what is this  advertising agency actually going to produce?  I think it doesn't mean that they can make it happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  This is the code name is FTP 168.  You know what the FTP stands for?  Free the people.  Free the people, man.  You're kidding, right?  No, no, I swear to God.  A year ago, Balmer OK'd the effort led by Bill Vigde,  who was responsible for Windows and Search.  He partnered with marketing boss Mitch Matthews.  See, there is somebody, Mitch Matthews.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, you know, Mitch is a woman, I believe,  who is not really a marketing person in any sense of the, you know,  and in a classic sense, they've put together an all star team

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  from across the company.  Well, there's the problem right there.  They they went within Microsoft to find the best experts at branding,  packaging, online advertising and other specialties.  The aim of the campaign will be to talk about, oh, no, oh, no.  Things you can do with your PC that you could never do before.  Oh, recipes.  This is Microsoft does this all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They do. That's the dad.  That is your talent pool there.  That's your you just outlined what the talent pool at Microsoft came up with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Things you can do with your PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's because they think that experiences sell PCs.  And I don't think it's true.  You know, most people don't want new experiences on their PCs.  They want the same stuff they do, but better and more stable.  I know my friends.  Yeah, marketing person will never say that.  And you a new experience in pieces.  They just want their stuff to work.  I don't know what you can do with your PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They don't want to see scrapbooking is now new and easy.  They don't want that crap.  And that's all that's what Microsoft does.  Now you can watch TV with a tablet in your lap.  Change channels with a touch of a stylus.  That's what they've always done. It's lame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that was what the original of the marketing campaign with the wild  starts now is all about. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So now they really I think they this is Mary Jo Foley's writing about this in ZD.  Now I just put a link in our show notes.  What they really need to do is address the I'm a Mac, I'm a PC campaign.  They've really got to spend, you know, if you've got half a billion dollars.  Look, take take 50 million and, you know, say to John Hodgman, hey, John, come here.  We can make a better. Come on, John.  I would like to see John Hodgman beat the crap out of Justin Long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is there's a lot of potential.  I don't think the company has it basically has a sense of humor.  That's the problem.  I mean, if they did, I've never seen any evidence of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No sense of humor and completely clueless about marketing.  And that's why Apple does so well, because just Apple markets  the hell out of their stuff.  And I mean, I'm a Mac, I'm a PC stuff is absolute genius.  And people are actually, you know, switched on to Mac by that.  They've got funny people doing it.  It's kind of self-deprecating.  It's, you know, it's really mass market appeal.  And they go after Windows.  You know, there's some of the ads that they run on the web in particular,  the ones where they've got, you know, they link the banner ads together and stuff.  And it's all about how bad Vista is.  And they just they put, you know, Vista and they and they just.  I think that's where the perception is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think that's where half the perception comes from,  is people seeing these Mac ads and they stick in your mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, here's another thing that's interesting to me in terms of the marketing  aspect of that PC versus Apple ad, is that they don't run the same one much.  And so every time you see one, because in today's world,  everything's going to be fast forwarded because we all have DVRs.  People who use computers will have one.  And you start plowing through to go to the to skip the commercials.  If you see one of those commercials, you stop and watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's going to be funny. You know, it's going to be fun.  Even if you've seen it once, you might watch it a second or third time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they're wondering if you're entertaining, but they also I mean,  some of them are I think are really some of them are dead on in terms of what they say.  And some of them are unfair.  Some of them are told some of them are kind of 1980s in the way they talk about  how PCs are great for spreadsheets, but you can't do anything fun.  And that's just not fair because  there are lots there are tons of strong applications on windows  for doing all kinds of entertaining stuff.  And the best ones are as good as a lot of the stuff that's on the Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. And let's talk about gaming.  It's not even in the same ballpark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, none of those switch ads mentioned that Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  At the same time, Apple is bashing windows.  It's also promoting the fact you can run windows on a Mac. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Why would you want to do that? It's not as good.  I don't understand Microsoft.  There are compelling reasons for running windows.  I mean, there's a lot there.  Look, there are holes you could drive a truck through here.  But Microsoft seems to just be sitting on its hands.  I guess half a billion, maybe they'll come up with something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they you know what it reminds me of?  It reminds me of the point, you know, you know, Bill Gates  once says he always wanted to be the IBM of software.  And it reminds me of the point in the game where IBM had OS  two and it was going going it alone with OS two.  And Microsoft was picking their pockets and cleaning their clocks.  And IBM did nothing. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Is this maybe part of the business cycle?  Is this what happens when you get to be an old mainline technology company?  You get frozen. You can't you can't move left.  You can't move right.  You can't you can't do any fancy footwork because you're so tied up  by your customers, by your parents is by just tied up by them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you're tied up by the people working for you that have stuck around  and they become old farts.  But this is the company.  And this is what, you know, Balmer says, we found the best people  we can in the company.  We came up with this great strategy.  And that's, you know, an example of people that are there, obviously duds.  They need some rope a dope.  You need to get in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A really interesting actually is that, you know, I think Microsoft  subscribes to the kind of marketing policy of we don't talk about the competition.  Because if you talk about the competition, you give them credibility. Right.  And whereas that just gives the competition basically a free reign  to just attack you.  And we've seen this happen before, because we saw this happen with Intel and AMD  for the longest time when AMD was making some kickass products.  Intel was like, we won't talk about the competition.  AMD hammered them.  And then as soon as Intel sort of turned around and said, you know,  actually, we're going to hammer them back.  And they spent, you know, maybe a couple of years ago.  They just turn around and started hammering AMD on the marketing  and on the PR side.  And they've killed again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah. But if I'm Microsoft, what I would say to that, Will, is, well,  we killed them by out out innovating them.  They Intel, regardless of their campaign,  regardless of the dancing guy in the bunny suit, they made a better processor.  And ultimately, that's what won, isn't it?  Or maybe, I mean, maybe Microsoft saying, hey, we don't have to advertise.  We've got better technology.  Well, I did that for John.  That was for you, John.  They found ice on Mars.  This is exciting. We're going to talk about that in just a little bit.  We'll also talk about teens.  They're they're turning away from clothing to and radio to the web,  to gaming and what to TV, TV viewing is up that in a few more stories.  As we continue with this, we can take in our guest, Harry McCracken,  of formerly a PC world now, the technologizer, John C.  Dvorak, dot org slash blog, Will Harris of the brand new channel flip dot com.  But first to mention of our fine sponsors, audible dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  What? Yeah. How long does it take you think?  I should ask Andrew.  His book is five hours and 36 minutes.  You think he recorded that in one afternoon?  No, I don't think so.  He probably took days, weeks, months to record that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you should be reading more books, more and more of these books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I will. I'm going to do a kid.  They're going to have a kids book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it'd be cool if you did.  I screw the kids book.  You should do some big books and you should do them with all the voices  that you have. That would be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I could do the kids book in a voice.  You should. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good night, moon.  Good night, yellow room.  Good night to the kitten who's sitting on my microphone right now.  Good. I think that'll be good.  I'll do it like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, if you did, if your voices were crappy, this wouldn't work.  But I encourage you to do these voices because they're actually outstanding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, thank you, John. You're too kind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will. I will do that for them.  Tomorrow, I'm going to record a book.  Moussensquirrel will do a special book for the audible.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So, yeah, that's going to be fun.  I'm going to talk to Don Katz in the morning.  I'm going to be so exhausted. It's a red eye flight.  I'm leaving the night at 10 p.m.  I get in Monday morning at 7 a.m.  Go right over, talk to the president of audible for two hours.  I'm going to be like a zombie.  Then I'm then we're going to meet for a little while and talk about, you know,  I don't know what. What do you talk about when you do these things?  I don't know. So, wait, where is audible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Newark. You've got to get it right up. Newark, New Jersey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  With all due respect to Newark, it's not the first town I would choose.  So anyway, I'll read a book and and then we'll tell you next time what my book is.  So I'll be the second to have a book.  But meanwhile, if you want to Andrew's book audible.com slash twit,  if you want the Chopin manuscript free and your next three books half off,  audible.com slash twit seven four nine.  We thank audible so much for their support of this week and tech and all the twit  podcast celebrating one year. Of a twit books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Finally, I'm going to get mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I don't know what book they said it's going to be something in public domain,  something the author is dead and has been dead for a long time.  They can't complain about you.  Exactly. They'll be spinning in their grave.  So there's water on Mars.  They this is actually kind of an interesting picture of it.  You know, it looks like they scraped up plaster or something.  There's a white stuff.  And then they wait.  I love it because this was announced on Twitter.  Don't you think that's cool?  Anybody who's following Mars Phoenix on Twitter, the first we heard heard  that there was water on Mars was Mars Phoenix saying, I think I found water  on Twitter. That's bizarre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't it on Mars on Twitter, on Twitter, on Mars?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, I guess it's Twittering from Mars.  I'm very I'm very gullible, John.  Please don't shatter my illusions.  Dice sized crumbs of bright material.  They they watched them overnight and they vaporized.  That means they must have been they thought they might be a salt,  but they vaporized. They must be ice.  Could have been cocaine.  Could have been coke.  Wouldn't that be weird if they found coke on Mars?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would change the model for exploration, I can tell you that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  There'd be a lot of people building rocket ships right now.  I think I'm going to Mars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There could be like the new euphemism,  hey, you want to go to Mars tonight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  There'll be a lot of very agitated people in the background.  I'm going to Mars. I got to get some rocket ship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got to go to Mars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Anyway, I think that's exciting.  The reason it means it's meaningful is a means it could be life on Mars.  You know, the building blocks of life are there organic chemistry.  And B, it means that if there's enough water on there, we could go to Mars  because the real one of the problems is bringing all your water with you.  And it could be Mars could be a if you read enough science fiction,  you know, it could be a a launching point for further space exploration  because you go to Mars, you fill up on water and then you can keep on going.  I can tell you're all very excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe the Martians will sort you out when you get there as well.  There you go. Hey, you want some coke?  Well, they said that the next thing they're going to do is  is test the water for like amino acids and stuff,  the sort of stuff that might be signs of life or signs that could sustain life.  I mean, if they if they I mean, if they find something,  how mental is that going to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's mental. It's mental. It's totally mental.  I'm mental already. It's very mental.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So Mars, Phoenix on Twitter,  John is the real Dvorak on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And by the way, you can go to the real Dvorak dot com now.  Oh, yeah. What's that do?  Send you to Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's a good idea.  I should do that. I should.  Oh, I can't because I'd have to get Leo Laporte dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't you have that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So he's got that. You know, it really makes me mad.  Leo dot com. Remember, I used to talk about how I wish I had that,  but the Royal Bank of Canada got it first because their mascot is some lion.  I should have paid attention because it expired in April.  Oh, and then some guy.  Yeah. Somebody in Hong Kong has Leo dot com now.  A squatter.  Probably think I'll pay him a million dollars for it.  You can afford it.  Yeah. Why not take all the money I was going to send you and send it to him instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't really need Leo dot com.  I think that I think Leoville is pretty good because you could sell.  I think you should probably get something else.  Or Leo Laporte dot com.  You should. You could probably get that on a protest so you can get that.  I don't know if somebody has it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Should have like Russian accent baby books dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Buy my baby books here.  Use baby books the way they were meant to be read by bad Russian.  My board is bad enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The real Dvorak dot com.  And Will Harris is Will Harris with one L on Twitter.  Harry, do you have a Twitter account yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's easy. I'm Harry McCracken.  And I plan to use that as one of the venues for telling people about what I'm doing on Technologizer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's kind of what you do, isn't it now?  I mean, that's what the Twitter has become.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Harry, you should also you should you should get a Twitter account that's  Technologizer and then you should have that feed.  OK, grab that too.  I grabbed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that might be just sort of a straightforward list of everything I'm doing.  But Harry McCracken will be a little bit more personal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, we do that. Yeah, that's exactly what I do,  because I don't want to fill up my Twitter account Leo Laporte with a lot of plugs.  So I also have TwitLive and then when I so and I use that to say,  well, we're broadcasting now or whatever.  So if you wanted if you wanted the plugs, if you wanted the links,  you could you could follow TwitLive.  But if you just want me saying stupid stuff, you could follow Leo Laporte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think there's a need for both people should be able to choose  sort of straightforward links to everything and something a little more personal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe if you know, it's too bad you after the fact you can't combine the two,  Leo, that way you might be able to pass up Kevin Rose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, if you combine them, I'd have like 50,000 because it's like more than 10,000  followers on TwitLive and I've got 44,000 on Leo Laporte.  But Kevin's like a thousand ahead of me now. It's all over.  I think he's pulling ahead. He is.  He's pulling ahead by a few hundred every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry, it's a sorry situation.  There's no excuse for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's you know, it's fine. I'm over it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's OK. At least I got back up under Veronica Belmont.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Veronica Belmont is now behind you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I'm underneath her, but I was underneath the Mac thing for a while.  And then I jumped in front of it again.  I'm not going to catch up to her.  She's got like she's she's I don't know why her numbers are going up so drastically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  People love her because of Tekzilla. That's why the people who, you know,  let's be honest, let's face it, the people who go up the fastest,  the people who plug it the most.  And in the most visible venues, you'd think it'd be enough  to plug it on the most listened to tech podcasts in the world.  But I guess I think we've already plugged or plugged out.  Maybe that's it. We got everybody we're going to get.  Yeah, I think we're dead. Yeah.  And she's cuter than you and me.  Teens are dropping rags radio for Web Games and TV.  It's the tween and teen lifestyle report  that twice a year, March 2008, results are out.  They interviewed teens 13 to 17 and tweens 8 to 12.  Oddly enough, TV viewing went up,  which is a little disappointing.  Teens say email is for old people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Hey, get off of my email, you punks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They they do I am and I even think I am is kind of for old people now.  It's like a Facebook I am and and  I don't know what they do in that chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are Facebook. I am as big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, I can't go on my Facebook page anymore because like 800 people  try to talk with me and I feel bad.  I want to talk to them, but I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  By the way, having just having just mentioned my Twitter name,  my number of Twitter followers I have, which is pitiful,  increased by like 10 percent in two minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  He said, you're under 500 now, but we're going to get you over a thousand.  Easy, Harry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And up until now, I've almost I have no clue how people have found me up  until now, because I almost never mentioned it anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's why it's so low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, you got to you got to be a shameless shill.  What was that word?  You use slap. You got to be a slappy.  So what is it, Will?  A slapper. You got to be a slapper.  You got to be a Twitter ho.  A Twitter slapper.  You've got to slap.  I'm slapping my Twitter right now.  It's a good thing that television's not on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute. It's a good thing I didn't go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm also I'm also going to say I just created a channel flip Twitter feed as well.  So if you just at channel flip, that's all our new stuff on RSS.  That's smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  See, that's good. You're thinking, you're thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Before. Let's go back on.  Let's go. This survey interests me.  So what else have we discovered besides the fact that the kids think that email sucks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Sixty three percent of teens read a magazine for fun or read a magazine in the last month for fun.  That's down from 65 percent.  Magazine readership among tweens dropped 48 percent from the 52 percent of the year before.  It's dropping consistently.  Only 19 percent said they spent more time reading this year than last.  They don't like to read, but they have increased their digital and electronic media consumption.  Average, get this, of twelve point five hours online a week.  That's up from ten point seven last year for teens.  Twelve point five hours a week.  It's like an hour and a half a day.  Is that the teens or the tweens?  That's the teens. Tweens are six point five hours.  Casual gaming, email and IM among the top of the online activities list.  The teens like to go to YouTube, Facebook, Google and MySpace.  The tweens like to go to Webkin, Nick, YouTube and Disney.  These are like the training wheels for the social network.  You know, you go to Webkin's and then you're going to really be ready for Facebook next year.  More TV. That's really odd.  I don't understand.  Mobile phone ownership. Get this.  Seventy three percent among teens.  Twenty six percent among tweens.  And again, tweens are ages eight to twelve.  So a quarter of eight to twelve year olds have cell phones, text messaging.  That's what's really replaced email.  They want something faster. They want something quicker.  Gaming is, of course, huge.  Radio listening is flat.  Nobody's listening to radio anymore.  It's over for radio.  Tweens and teens expected to buy or planning to buy three point one games this year,  up from two point five five last year.  Did you? Has anybody played the Spore Creature Creator?  Do you know I'm talking about?  Will writes new game Spore, which will be out in September.  They pre-released the Creature Creator, which is the thing that lets you design your creature.  You can't play the game. You just design a creature.  Have you seen the pornographic creatures people are designing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that sounds good. What?  Give us a link. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, it's it's it's the revolting big front.  It's it's a whole it's worse than that.  It's actually become quite a meme.

Transcript:  So go to EA Bans to Spore porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, well, they may ban it, but it's too late.  Rockpapershotgun.com slash question mark P equals 1947.  They really need to work on their URLs.  But look what you could do with the Creature Creator.  That's amazing. Let me see if it does it have sound?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they do. It's kind of gross.

Speaker: UNKNOWN

Transcript:  So you're looking at them right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, not for long.  Watch me give you I'll give you a moment.  It's actually quite humorous.  There's a bunch of them.  I'm on the BuzzFeed.com slash Scott slash Spore dash porn.  You know, quite a few of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, it's quite a few.  It didn't take long.  And they're and they're on.  You could also search Google for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I'm not seeing anything that are actually erotic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, no, no, it's not erotic.  They're just laughable.  John, if you were aroused by this, I'd be worried.  And I would be, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not really it's not designed.  I'd be calling a shrink immediately.  So it's actually hard to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So there's a guy in Australia who his wife broke up with him.  He's starting to hate his job.

Transcript:  I mean, I know I hear Perth is gorgeous.  Just hang a left at Ayers Rock and you're there.  So he wants to give away his car or sell his car, motorbike, clothes.  He's even selling his friends.  So you basically he figures it costs about half a million dollars.  You buy this and then you can just move right in.  I mean, it's it's ready to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You move in with his wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, no, his wife already left him, so you don't get that.  Oh, that's good.  A life for sale dot com with the number four.  A life for sale dot com.  You can see the whole thing and it's going to go up on eBay.  We'll report back on it next week.  We'll tell you what he got for it on eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does it does eBay been heard from?  I mean, does eBay I remember in the old days when people would put up things  like bodily organs on eBay, they would take them down pretty quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.  It's still up. There's been a lot of publicity for it.  Let me just see what the current bid is.  Current bid is, oh, see the poor guy.  See, this is what happens.  You get all this publicity.  The bid is now two million, two hundred one thousand dollars.  And even in Australian money, that's too much.  Yeah, they're they're they're they're falling with them now.  Yeah, no, he's going to get nothing.  He's going to get nothing. One hundred fifteen bids.  And it's a bunch of different people all bidding like crazy, going crazy.  They want this guy's life. They want to live in Perth.  It's actually an attractive home.  Although why he put a picture of it behind a wall, I don't know.  Maybe to show that it's private.  He's got a hot tub.  He's got a big screen TV.  That's pretty nice place. Kind of a crappy car, but that's so what's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  what's the link to the home?  You can see the whole thing at a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They said, yeah, they said, yeah,  a l i f e the number four sale dot com.  So sad.  He's auctioning off his life.  It's going to be a new life for him.  FCC has decided to come down on the side of the cable companies.  They are sued Verizon because when you say to Verizon,  your phone company, I want to take my number now and go over to Comcast  or for Time Warner for my phone service.  They apparently use what they know about you to try to talk you out of it.  What do you mean?  Well, the cable companies went to court saying  they're using information, private information  that they know about you and trying to kind of talk you out of it,  offering you deals and stuff and saying, no, no, you don't want to do that.  No, no, no.  So the actually the court ruled in favor of Verizon.  But now the FCC has voted to reverse.  Actually, it wasn't a court, was a staff decision.  The FCC has voted to reverse the staff decision and uphold the decision.  And uphold a complaint that Verizon had violated privacy laws.  The only it was a four one vote, the only dissenting FCC commissioner,  the chairman, Kevin Martin, Bright House Networks, Time Warner Cable and Comcast  said that when a customer switches from one service provider to another,  the existing provider is supposed to allow them to do it.  You know, port number portability, right?  But when Verizon received a request to port a customer's number to a competitor,  it would try to convince the customer to stay offering discounts  and American Express rewards cards.  And apparently that's not allowed.  Now, FCC is agreeing.  Hmm. Verizon says that's a disappointing outcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It allows us to bet we didn't know about this in advance  because the idea would be to pretend you're quitting just to get all the freebies. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can do that with almost anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, they have retained what they call retention specialists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just I'm moving and I just called to cancel DirecTV and  they offered me all kinds of stuff that if I had known about it  a year or two, it would have called and said that I was leaving just to get.  They offered me $10 off a month from really without blinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  See, because I, you know, I I knew about that.  You know, I've heard about that.  So I went to Comcast, I brought my cable box with me and I said, yeah, I'm leaving.  And they said, OK, and they took it.  Yeah, I was kind of upset.  It was like, don't you want to retain me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, you know, if these guys know that much about you, like they say,  then obviously they know you are bluffing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They they they call my bluff.  I'm not playing poker with those guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They know they brought you up on the computer and it says, oh, Leo LaFleur.  Oh, we expected him last week to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  They called my bluff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bastards. Can I just ask on the on the same on the Carrier note,  what has been the result?  I keep reading this week that there's some kind of compromise in Congress  about about telephone immunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, no, no. Yeah.  So the Senate voted one way.  They they voted in favor of it.  The House has just voted in favor of it.  So there's a House compromise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So telephone immunity is go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's a go. We are go for immunity.  Yeah, this is a terrible news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And about even Barack Obama voted for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, there you have it. That's the change.  We're talking about the FISA Amendment Act of 2008 passed by 293 to 129 in the House.  Half of Democrats voted for it.  All but one Republican voted for it.  They modified it slightly. Get this.  OK, so the deal was that the telecoms wanted immunity.  If they were told by the federal government hand over the records  or hand over the wiretap, they didn't want to be sued later by these  by somebody saying, hey, that's an illegal wiretap.  It's not been approved by the courts and they didn't they wanted immunity.  So the deal is the House language.  The problem with the Senate language is the Senate language said,  you got immunity from any lawsuits that receive from any telecom,  regardless of whether the company believes its actions to be lawful or not.  The new language says.  The federal court has to grant you immunity from lawsuits, whether you've received  any lawful, whether you know it's lawful or not.  So the difference, the wording is instructs a federal court.  So it's the same.  You still get immunity, but now the court will give you the immunity.  And of course, all of the congressmen are saying patting themselves on the back  saying, yes, we told you we're going to protect your rights there.  We're going to make a court do it.  It's appalling.  These are the these are the wiretaps of people, Americans who are.  Well, you know, the theory is, oh, they're calling  somebody overseas who might be a terrorist, so we can wiretap them.  But I don't know, I'm a little disappointed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you call Will Harris, they probably wiretap that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So Obama voted for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he said it was a he said it was a compromise that he would look to try  and change later, but it's like if you don't like the company,  but basically said that we need this on the grounds of national security.  Now, I don't think anybody in their right mind thinks that you actually need  to wiretap Americans in it for national security.  But I personally think he's scared of looking soft on national  security against McCain, so he's got to vote for it,  regardless of whether he likes it or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, the lone Republican who vote against it and kudos to Tim Johnson of Illinois.  He said he voted against it because he's worried about its impact on civil  liberties and he believes the necessary authority for the intelligence agency  sees already exists.  He's talked to the people on the front lines and the system works very effectively.  Now, I think that must be what happened is that all the spooks came to Capitol Hill

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and said, hey, come here.  You know what's going to happen if you don't vote for this is  they're going to blow up the White House or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, they're they're showing them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They didn't even have to do that, Leo.  These guys are rolling over on everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You don't think they had, you know, secret briefings  with key members and said, look, let's we're going to we're going to open our kimono.  Let me show you what these wiretaps have done.  Let me show you how many times we have stopped the Golden Gate Bridge  from being blown up because of these wiretaps.  And then and what are you going to do?  You're a member of Congress.  You say, wow, that's OK.  I guess we'll give them to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I just think these guys are soft.  Soft in the head.  I think it's just basically the Roman Senate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So now they're telling me in the chat room that the Senate has not voted yet.  So I apologize. This is the House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is the House and the House claims that maybe this isn't  the greatest thing in the world, but at least it's better than the Senate version.  And the Senate has not voted on that version yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So I don't know, what do you guys think?  You think we need this bill to protect us from getting blown up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In the olden days, they would just do the taps and not tell anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, that's kind of what the idea is here.  But they don't. You know what?  It relates for the telecoms and so they won't get sued.  That's really what it is for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's just that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does it also do the does it also cover the immunity going backwards  as well as the retrospective immunity?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. It's retroactive, which is one of the problems here.  Oh, yeah. We can't sue them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't even live in America and it cheeses me off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but you got cameras pointing at you right now as we speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah. In fact, I could see that weird hat you're wearing.  What's that all about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's, you know, it's just a floppy hat.  I said, I don't know what's wrong with floppy hats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Protect you from the midnight sun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's to protect me from all the,  I don't know, the brain scanning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Put some foil in it and it'll be more effective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And of course, I mean, the irony is that as a UK citizen, I'm watched,  you know, almost 24 hours a day wherever I go,  because security cameras here are so prevalent.  They're on every street corner.  Our telephone systems have been tapped, you know, since,  I guess, the 70s since, you know, the compromise since the whole Northern  Ireland thing.  You know, there's even this massive system that, you know, picks up keywords  and, you know, goes down to the massive government communication center  and in the center of the country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are some of the keywords, Will, that you can think of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can say bomb, slap or blow up or, you know,  slapper, all those kind of things.  Yeah, this was this was this is the echelon system that the US government

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  has never admitted to.  And then British intelligence said, oh, yeah, we got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've had it for years.  They've had it since the, you know,  you know, for two decades because the whole Northern Ireland thing.  And I could just see the CIA guys are going, stop, stop, stop, stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  No echelon X day on the echelon, Che.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wonder what they think of Skype.  I don't hate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Don't you? Well, yeah, because it's encrypted, right?  Yeah. You know, who loves the terrorists are all using Skype.  And you know who loves it is Gary Kasparov, the former world chess champion,  who is now effectively a dissident by being opposition to Putin in Russia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And he says, I love it because I can otherwise I get spoiled on.  So I use this all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was that to use your accent again.  I know. I just bring it up so I can talk like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The no, but he took Amber MacArthur, interviewed him.  And that's exactly what he says. I love Skype because he because it's encrypted  because this conversation is not being sifted through echelon computers.  Otherwise, there'd be guys right now knocking on our door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh, I'll be right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's a time for my payoff.  Any other stories anybody wants to talk about before I adjourn this meeting of the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to the only thing I want to throw out there was to ask Harry  his opinion on the new the new Nvidia and ATI graphics cards that came out this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, big deal on this one, right? The 9800 GTX plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, there's also the the 280, which is the brand super high.  I'm the 40 at 4870 from ATI.  I just wondered what Harry's opinion is on them.  You know, one of the 50.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I walked out the door at PC World about three weeks ago.  And one of the things among many things I gave up, one of them was  having the PC World Test Center, which was just wonderful, because when I was there,  I had answers at my fingertips to all this stuff.  I missed that, too, at Tech TV. Yeah.  And so I would do what I did then, which was recommend that people go to PC World  dot com and check out what what those guys have to say about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You know, we're building the ultimate gaming machine wheel on Twitter Live.  We do it every Friday.  And we've already decided on a quad core  extreme processor, the 9770.  We're choosing the motherboard still.  And we're getting close to the video card choice.  And it's going to be an interesting choice.  I think we're going to do get this three card SLI, three way SLI with the 280.  That's some serious cash.  You know, the bad thing about it.  Yeah, I know. And we're giving it away at the end, by the way.  We're going to build it and give it away at the end.  But the thing I'm worried about a little bit is what you put three of these in.  You feel there's no room for anything else.  These cards are fat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What kind of power supply do you have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  We haven't bought it yet, but it'll be twelve hundred.  Big. I think it's going to be twelve hundred watt power supply and water cooled.  Colleen's going to be a custom water cooling solution.  We're not going to use flooring it, though, because I found out floor.  We are going to use flooring.  Colleen says we're going to use it flooring.  It's how much how much a liter is flooring.  It's like a sixteen hundred dollars a liter.  Non conductive fluid called.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can get a pretty good cognac for that kind of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  She's we should call it with cognac.  That would be the ultimate gaming machine.  Then we're going to use Feser one Feser one is we're going to.  I have no idea what she's talking about, but we'll we'll find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Anyway, that's kind of super cooling stuff. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  We're going to we're going to call it below zero.  No, we're not. OK, she says we're not.  Good luck shipping that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't seem to know much about this computer, do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I don't. I'm just I'm just writing the checks.  And believe me, I'm going, huh?  Huh. And then we're going to give it away on a live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's an interesting question, though,  because the amount of money you've got to spend to get a high end gaming PC these days.  I mean, you are talking in the multiple thousands of dollars.  And when you compare that to the fact you could just buy a 50 inch HDTV  and a PS3 and a 360, it's kind of my that's kind of my attitude is why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it worth it?  Yeah. Is it is it really worth it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I keep saying that I say I keep saying, can't we give away a PS3 and a big screen TV?  But they said, no, we're going to end up this is going to end up costing.  I'm predicting between 10 and 15000 dollars.  It's ridiculous. But some lucky person is going to win it.  I figure it's marketing money as far as I'm concerned to get people  because I want people to know about the fact that we're doing this live video  at live TV and I did 40 hours last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How are you finding it?  Are you still finding you've got enough stuff to talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, there's no. In fact, I could do twice as much.  There's no lack of stuff to talk about.  You know what? You just open the lines and say, what video card should we get?  You get 12 hours out of that easy.  It's great fun. I'm really it's a blast.  And people are watching right now.  How many people are watching right now?  Over almost 3500 people are watching right now.  And not because they want to win something,  because I'm because they can't win anything right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they haven't got any hope of winning it  because that PC is coming straight across to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You dream on.  Well, you got it. You can.  I can win that. You got to be in it to win it.  You got to subscribe to the feed on stick them so you can be part of this.  It's exciting. I think it's going to be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Channel. Can I recommend a product quickly? Yes.  So one of the bits of news this week was Firefox three coming out.  Love it. And it is great.  But the product I actually want to recommend is the new version of Flock,  which is built on top of Firefox and has a bunch of additional  social media stuff like like hooks into Twitter.  And Facebook and some nice hooks into Gmail and Yahoo Mail.  And the one bad thing about Flock was it was based on the Firefox two engine.  But they have a beta out of one which is built on top of the new Firefox.  So you get almost everything that's good about the new Firefox  and all the flock stuff as well.  And it seems to be working.  It's crashed once on me, but it's for the most part, it's worked well.  And it is definitively my favorite web browser right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'm a big flock fan.  I did immediately download the beta.  It's crashed more for me here.  In fact, so much so that I kind of went back to Firefox three.  But I will keep updating it because I agree with you.  And it uses all the Firefox three extensions to like pick lands and.  And then we get all the good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Were you just seeing it on Windows or on the Mac on the Mac?  Oh, yeah. I have one crash other than that.  It's worked fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It may be the site. It's the sites I visit.  You know, it's when people have browser crashes,  it's because some sites are more crashy than others, I think.  But I do love all the stuff that's built in.  It's really great.  It's it's like an ultimate it's like if you took all the cool social stuff  on and added it to Firefox.  So it's like a customized Firefox, essentially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And as with the new Firefox, I mean, it launches a lot quicker.  It seems to do fewer strange things with memory management.  I'm a big fan. I agree.  And I kind of assumed it would take flock months to get around to doing this.  And they did it really quickly, which is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm downloading it now and I'm wondering.  But before I install it, what's cool about it?  You both you say it's cool, it's cool, it's cool. But why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You'll see it has Facebook built in.  It has delicious built in.  It has Flickr built in Twitter built in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You get your I mean, you can see all of your Facebook friends  without going to Facebook.  You can tweet on Twitter without being at Twitter.  It has some good stuff for managing Flickr as well.  I love the Flickr stuff.  You can upload pictures directly from it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, blog directly from it. That's really nice, too. Yeah.  No, it's it's it's it's John.  It's as if you took Firefox and added some specific social networking  plugins, and that's the knock on it, too, is that it's kind of a pre-customized  Firefox. So if you if you don't if you're not a big social networking person  or you use sites that it doesn't support, then it's of less interest.  But if you're big into social networking, I think it's great.  I really like I've used flock almost exclusively for last year.  I just was it was a little crashy.  That's the only reason I and I love Firefox three.  I really do.  I think that's a high bar.  Eight million downloads on Tuesday breaking.  There was no record to break.  They wanted to make a record and they did.  I think that would be a high bar to be eight million downloads  in one 24 hour period for Firefox three.  Will, have you upgraded to Firefox three?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what? You're going to slap me around for this, but I actually use Safari.  Hey, and everybody hates Safari, but I really like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Knock Safari doesn't work.  That's why you know what's better than Safari, though, and what I would probably  you know this, Will, but I would recommend is WebKit.  And the problem is, you have to know what that is.  What is that?  It's well, it is Safari.  It's it's the open source Safari development team WebKit.org.  And you have to update almost every day because you're using nightly builds.  But they've now put an engine the job.  It's the fastest JavaScript engine anywhere.  So if you use a lot of  rich Internet applications like Gmail or Zoho or  rightly that kind of thing, it's much faster.  You'll you'll you'll be blinded by the speed.  Well, not literally.  You'll you'll you'll be blurry.  Yeah, it'll be a little blurry.  No, WebKit.org. Take a look.  That's really cool.  You like Safari. It identifies as Safari.  It looks exactly the same as Safari.  It is Safari, essentially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, the reason I like it is because Safari syncs all my bookmarks to my iPhone.  Right. Oh, and because I like I like the old iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'm loving Fox marks right now, though.  Fox marks is the way to sync Firefox bookmarks.  It's awesome. And it works with also with a flock.  So that's OK. Well, I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was using Google sync engine, which in the last week or two,  Google announced they weren't going to bother to update for Firefox three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, they killed it.  But Fox marks, I think is a little better.  It's not as intrusive. It just does it in the background.  It's Mitch Capore's company, believe it or not.  He does two of the best Firefox extensions, Fox marks dot com and Pic lens,  which some people love, some people hate.  It's definitely a change in the UI.  But if you look at a lot of images, Google image searches, Flickr, YouTube,  it is a different way to look at these.  And it's it really is gorgeous.  P I C L E N S.  Pic lens. So, boy, there's some pics.  John, is there any software you use these?  Remember, John, we used to talk all the time about what's the next killer app?  Yeah. What's going to be the next Lotus one, two, three?  I don't know. Any ideas?  Well, I think the Internet ended up being it.  I think it was it wasn't an app at all.  And I'm really excited about what's happening with these rich Internet  applications. I think that's the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you putting links to these software packages in the show notes?  I will now. I will right now. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And that's something I've been using.  It's kind of cool. I use today called Cover It Live, which is it's been around  for a while. I've had an account for a while, but I haven't.  I never thought of using it before.  It is a.  Live blogging platform, so you get a user interface  and it will go on your blog, or in this case, I put it on Twitter live TV.  So as we've been talking, I've been updating.  You know, people could actually click on links as I've been updating them.  And I think this is going to be part of our Twitter live page,  because I really like it. And then it becomes the show notes.  It's really cool.  Pic lens and Fox marks, let me put that in there right now.  And that will also be part of the show notes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'll see, by the way, a program I've been using recently,  I don't know if I plugged it at all, but, you know, if people I've been moving  some of my DVD collection to the computer so I can watch stuff on the laptop  and handbrake seems to be the absolute best program for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You know, we've never did software picks, never done software picks on Twitter.  It's a very popular part of Mac Break Weekly.  Maybe maybe I'll start doing that because we're supposed to be talking about news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  This is news, though, because all this stuff just came out.  Flock just came out.  Firefox just came out and these new updates and Handbrake is awesome.  Is it Handbrake.fr? I think it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was. Yeah, no, it's France.  You can just put it in Google and you'll find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, it used to be Mach M0K, but I think it's now Handbrake.fr.  Handbrake.fr. It is for the win.  Harry McCracken, it's great to have you. Please come back.  We'd love to have you on again.  And Technologizer, his new site, will launch sometime in July.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We have a little preview up now, but full blown Technologizer in the next few weeks.  Can't wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, the brand new Channel Flip is on the air live and broadcasting  and full of bouncy girls.  It's Channel... Oh, I'm sorry, that's not the other one.  ChannelFlip.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  New videos, at least two new videos every day.  I think that's great. How are you doing that?  With a lot of work.  And yeah, just we film a lot.  We go out to a lot of events and cover some live stuff.  We did a great event, which is the coverage should go out tomorrow.  We went to it. Do you guys get TNA Wrestling?  No. What is that?  Oh, it's it's I guess maybe it's an English thing, but it's a big  it's like a competitor series at WWF.  And we went to the to the launch of their new game.  There's all these wrestlers and we got them to bench press.  Catherine, which was quite hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'm just glad the World Wildlife Fund has found a competitor in Britain.  Exactly. Yeah, it's about time.  ChannelFlip.com and John C.  Dvorak, you could find all over the place, of course, is Dvorak.org slash blog.  But let's not let's let's not forget  Tech5, No Agenda and Men Without Pants.  It's all on Mevio.  I'm sorry, Cranky.  Did I call it Men Without Pants? CrankyGeeks.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, it's CrankyGeeks.  No, that's not on Mevio.  That's Ziff Davis. And that's just CrankyGeeks.com.  And you can also check out the real dvorak.com  if you want to get me on the Twitter list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Get him on the Twitter because he's good.  He's a good Twitterer.  He's one of the better Twitterers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He doesn't. Yeah, I don't waste people's time.  He's no. Yeah, no fluff, no filler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Unlike others, we know like me.  Thank you, John. Thank you, Harry.  Thank you, Will. Another twit is in the can.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Well, shall I ping you his email?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, please.  Get in touch and do some love or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think that's an appropriate use of the term ping.  Well, you're thinking of ping as ICMP packets, John.  No, I think ping is what it means.  It's like you're tapping somebody.  You're just seeing if they're there kind of thing.  I think it's what it's used for.  I never heard of ping used as a synonym for the word send.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, it's a bit of a brishism, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I agree with John, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Forget it. I'm killing you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The problem is there's no connection.  There's too much work.  I've grown into my soul's completely collapse.  I'm killing you.  Hey, hey.
