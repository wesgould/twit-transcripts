Transcript:  mind and pay attention to Skylark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It inhabited the  and for three audiobooks of your choice at a special price go to audible.com slash twit 749  Let's get the show started. He's getting good. He's getting good. He's all warmed up ladies and  gentlemen he's firing on six cylinders. We better start. The big story was of course,  the war. Do we say devore act dot org slash blog? No. Devore act. I'm drinking though. Wait a minute,  let me go ahead. Little Jack Daniels here. Devore act dot org slash blog. The big story was of course  the HD DVD story and that came out four days before CES. Must have put a little consternation  in the bonnets of the HD DVD exhibitors on the floor. Warner Brothers. Not to interrupt again

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  even though I'm in an interrupting mood. Go ahead. Think about the people that had speeches prepared.  Well the party. The whole HD DVD party was cancelled. They cancelled the press conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Microsoft was supposedly going to announce an Xbox 360 with an embedded HD DVD player. Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  No that was never going to happen. You don't think that was going to happen? I completely called BS on that  rumor. I always have. Yeah I wondered. You don't think so huh? No I've never thought so. Why not? They  made great heads selling the $179 HD DVD add-on. There's, Microsoft has absolutely no incentive to  add an HD DVD player integrated into the 360. They want to drive costs down. They want to sell more  units. That's just going to drive their cost up, lower their profit, their margin per device. But they

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  were in the HD DVD camp. They really had a good time. This was a good Mac roller. Did you get a  chance Patrick to see Mac World at all? I've seen everything at Mac World. Yeah what do you, did you

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  like that Macbook Air? What do you think of that? I'm actually, I was one of the eight people who owned  a Macintosh Duo back in the day. I have no problem with having an optical spindle. I hear one more  person go, doesn't have a user replaceable battery. You don't care about that huh? Well on one hand yeah it would be nice to have a user  replaceable battery. It's lithium-ion. It's a finite life. The finite life will end. It will end faster  than you want it to. But Apple says 129 bucks. They'll fix it. They'll put a new one in. Okay. I want to see what the price is like when  people actually need to replace them in a year or two years. But that's not, you know it would cost

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  about 100 bucks to buy one. Absolutely. So 129 bucks. That includes the installation. That's not bad. Personally I think I

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  basically, you know, I'm assuming it's a lithium polymer battery so I can get it, take all that  acreage, keep the z-depth really fast. And it's just, it's a nice looking machine. Yeah I just hate to see

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  something like that in your hands though. Because I just know you just like snap it like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  No actually, um, are you gentle? I think I've actually kept more notebooks alive than you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So I have my OLPC. Did you guys get your OLPC? Huh? Huh? The give one get one. Apparently there's some,  people are a rye rite because they still haven't received their XO laptop. You know those  laptops for one child, one laptop per child. You bought one? Yeah. Well I donated.  So I got one, give one got one. But I got mine when I got, you know, like a couple weeks ago.  Oh. It's cute. I should show you. Have you seen it? It's really cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I'd like to see it. I'll come by when you take me out to lunch at that restaurant. You can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  promise me. Damn. Damn. God. I always open the door. Now what's happened is Robert seamlessly brought his audience over to  Fast Company. So when he negotiated his deal with Fast Company, as I was saying, you know, each of  those people's worth a dollar I think, you know, per year. So he's got whatever, or maybe two or three.  Seven thousand people on Twitter, five thousand people on Facebook. I don't know. Microsoft just paid what,

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  a few, more than a thousand dollars. Well let's get to that. That's the story and that's the reason  you two are on. Nice segue. I couldn't think of anybody better to get on. I mean you guys,  this is a fascinating story and controversial. Microsoft, essentially a hostile takeover bid  forty four point six million in cash and stock for, billion, billion. With a B. Yes. For Yahoo.  Now of course rumors have been flying for the last two years that Microsoft might take a stake in  Yahoo, but this is an out and out attempt to buy the whole kitten caboodle. Jason,  you're sitting on the sidelines. You probably know better than anybody what's going on right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  What do you think? Well, the piece of this that's the most important is the advertising. And so  if you look at the advertising space, search marketing, direct search inventory is the greatest  advertising inventory on the planet right now. It's the most profitable and the most desirable.  And we may have talked about this before, but the reason is pretty simple. If you're typing  Nokia N95, people listening to the show are typing that into Google right now, we know they're  interested in the Nokia N95. That inventory is actually better than Engadget's inventories in  some way because if you're reading Engadget, you might be interested in the Nokia N95, but you might  not be in the mode to buy it right at that point. And then after that comes things like social  networking advertising, which would be like, we know that you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Okay. So offline app. So when the Google appliance, my per seat charge for my...  How many times have we watched, how many times have we watched desktop applications? The big  thing. Now it's Google is doing... I think cloud computing is happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You're saying it's that same old thin client thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yeah. You're calling it cloud computing, which is kind of like, web 2.0, we've got sophisticated  forums about user interaction. We have a new name for it. It's better.  Yeah. So now it's not just, it's not like server client computing. It's not server  hosted applications. Now it's cloud computing. But wait a minute, Patrick. What do you use for

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  your email, Patrick? I use Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Cloud computing? No. More software as a service.  It's HTML based email. It's cloud. Software as a service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Look, instead of running a desktop email client, downloading your mail to your desktop and reading

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  it there, you're doing it all on the net. I do most of it. Not all of it. But I also  pack it up online in an application on my desktop. And I know a fair number of people who actually,  who actually... I know a shocking number of people who use Hotmail.  Yeah. Or you use Yahoo Mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Hotmail and Yahoo Mail are 10 times bigger than Google Mail anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait, what Flickr's doing with photo editing online is...  Same thing.  Cloud computing. But that's cloud computing. The editing of the photo online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I submit that creating or not. It doesn't matter where you're doing it. It's still a big step for  a company to go from 500, much less 5,000 or 50,000 seats of an office application to an online

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  application. So you don't think Microsoft's looking at that at all? Do you think they're  just looking at the online advertising and search? That's what they're buying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I think they're probably looking at advertising revenue in a way to amortize the investment into  live and some of the other stuff. They're probably looking for eyeballs. They're probably  looking for growth that's going to jerk the stock out of the relatively stable position it's been  in because, as John will probably back me up on, the whole point of Microsoft stock was to make up  for not paying people a lot of money. The idea is you're going to go to work for Microsoft and  you'd be a millionaire if you stayed there for 10 years. This is in honor of HD DVD, which

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  kicked the bucket this week. Dead as a doornail. It was kind of like a dominoes.  Starts with Warner Brothers pulling the plug. Then Walmart pulls the plug. Then Netflix pulls  the plug. I love this music. They can't hear it. Play it a little louder. Then Best Buy pulls the  plug. Then the final death blow, Toshiba itself kills HD DVD. Is it over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's over now. No, now the analysis begins. I have a column running at Tomorrow's PC Magazine where I  assert that it was never sincere to begin with. It was just all a scheme by Microsoft to screw  over Sony any way it could to get market share for the Xbox. Some have posited because if there

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  were a conflict between the two HD formats, HD downloads would prove preeminent. That's of course

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Microsoft, right? I think the days of Microsoft being able to orchestrate that level of conspiracy

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  are along behind us. It's not a conspiracy. It's a marketing error. It's like saying they can't  advertise. It was just a marketing ploy. I don't think it was much of a conspiracy because there  was no real conspirators. Who was it? It was Microsoft and Toshiba. Were those the two big

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  players? Pretty much. I honestly think Microsoft is sad to say that kind of inept lately. Their last

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  big marketing attempt was Vista capable. Why did all these people pull the plug on HD DVD? Was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there something wrong with it? It's money. It's a matter of money. If Sony's willing to drop  millions and millions of dollars on movie studios and Toshiba is only willing to drop a half million  dollars or whatever the case may be or just a tad less than Sony, if I'm Warner Brothers, why would  I want to go with a guy who's paying me less? It's pretty simple. It's simple economics as far as

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm concerned. Not the free market kind either. It's like this rogue kid, rogue trader. That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  actually what BlackBerry, what RIM is doing. They're blaming the techies for the outage. This is their  second outage in a year. Earlier this week, BlackBerry was down all over North America.  What does that have? Would they have 11 million subscribers? Completely blacked out and they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  saying, oh, it was the geeks did it. Yeah, that's always good. Throw your tech team under the bus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The geeks did it. Yeah, because they don't have any recourse, right? They're powerless, huh? Yeah.  They don't have any good ideas about how to mess things up. I wonder what happens when the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sorry, when the PR guy's credit rating goes to something ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah, or they're going to be leaking emails from the CEO or looking at the CEO's log files on their  browser and sending them anonymously to somebody. All the salaries will be revealed. Service goes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  out, which it constantly does, and my phone has to reconnect to Power Vision, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Then the whole thing locks up. Then Merlin wanted to bring up the kind of interesting article about  Ed Felton, who is a great security researcher and has done a lot on this, pointed out and observed  that I didn't know this. RAM doesn't lose its memory immediately. That even after you've  powered down the system, the RAM retains the contents for a period of some undetermined  period of time. He further, I'm sure I could just see the graduate students working on this one. He  further found out that if you freeze the RAM using compressed air or something like that,  you actually have the time to take it out of the old system, put it in a new system, and  read its contents. Of course, if you've had an encrypted hard drive using TrueCrypt or  PGP disk or a lot of different full disk encryption technologies, including Microsoft's  BitLocker and FileVault, which is Apple's OS 10 encryption, that the keys are kept in RAM.  If you can get the RAM, put it in a new computer, read the RAM, you'll get the key and you can unlock  the drive. Pointing out that in other words, this encryption stuff isn't going to be,  you know, is hackable. But I have to point out you also have to somehow get the laptop away from the  guy after he logs in, but before he logs out, before it goes back to sleep, you have to take  it over to your secret lair, spray it with the Freon, pull it out, put in another laptop, read  it, put it back in, give the guy the laptop back. So it's not an easy hack. Totally. The reason I

Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  thought it was a little complicated than it probably is. And the fact is drive encryption  techniques are there to prevent people from reading it if they have physical access to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  machine. But they have to, but it won't work unless you've logged in to the machine. In other words,  you have to unlock the drive before this technical work. The key is on the machine. No, well, the  key isn't in RAM until you give it the password though. Yes. No, the key is in RAM. As soon as you

Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  turn on the machine, you can start the drive. Is that right? I didn't realize that part. That was

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  what they stated in the Explained video. We're about to see when the iPhone SDK is released,  where evidently Apple is going to turn this into a store for software. So is this going to be the

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  same thing all over again? We're going to find that out on Thursday. Apple's having a get together  at its headquarters in Cupertino. We don't know yet what they're going to do. It's rumored that  they'll require all applications to be sold to the iTunes store, that they'll control it. And since  Steve did say how much he liked the Nokia S60 verification process, it kind of indicates  he might be kind of going down that path. I just saw a rumor today that said,  well, free applications will be available widely. It's just if you want to charge for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Generally speaking, people who just get on Twitter and they blab about the fact that they're at a  stoplight or they want to show off the fact that they've got a new cell phone that's got a keyboard  and they talk about it or they say stupid things that are just like, oh, I watched the movie last  night. It sucked and things like that. That to me is just a bunch of hot air that is not necessary,  that shouldn't even be in the cloud. But there are a lot of other actual practical uses that  people are developing for some of these systems that are actually quite fascinating. Whether  the shooting a million photographs and having them distributed over pounds is one of them.  I'm not sure, but I can see where it could come in handy in the case of an emergency or if you  had an emergency crew or there was a police department that wanted to, you know, had a bunch  of guys with little cameras and you could coordinate this information, it was used as information.  Yeah, I'm not going to, I mean, I think there's part of it's both and part of it's really pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_23
Transcript:  cool. But I mean, part of it is surely like, for me, what I find, I think, slightly not annoying,  but curious is that there are so many degrees of doing almost the same thing in a slightly  different way. Going from everything from like, you've got a blog, which is kind of more like the  whole payload thing is more long form. Then you've got like a Tumblog, which is kind of like shorter,  but it seems to be more like a pound stream. But the pound stream has got a little bit of like  calendar on there as well. And then from the pound stream, you can sort of go on to like Twitter,  which is kind of mostly just text anyway. But then from Twitter, you've got text messages.  It seems like there's these, you know, and then at the other end as well, you've got Facebook,  which is basically the same friends feed. And with all the applications, you've got adding  your photos and all that kind of thing. It seems like 10 different ways to do basically the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  thing. I just don't think they are though. There we go. Will Harris, you've got your video going.  Oh, for f**k's sake.  I love British people. Oh, f**k's sake.  Oh, let me read. I'm going to read some of your Twitter posts as this thing develops. So you  started, I'm not at the ZuckerSpurred speech. I'm leaving Hilton now. We'll saunter over there to  find out if he said anything interesting. Then you say he's giving a lot of PR answers. Lacey's asking  too many business questions. Yeah. Twitter's hate Lacey. Sarah Lacey lost control of the interview.  Twitter's going crazy with her critiques. She's getting defensive now. Poor empathy for the  audience. The audience is asking better questions. I've never seen such a bad interview of anyone on  the stage here. Totally disappointing. I mean, it's just, it's, is she mad at you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Well, she said, yeah, on her Twitter, she actually Twittered toward me and I just  Twittered an apology. Is she blaming you for what happened? I think she's very defensive. She doesn't,  I don't think she understood what was going on on stage. I think she just didn't understand what

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  this audience was expecting. You said it was even worse in the overflow room. What were people

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  saying? Well, people were saying exactly that. Where's the hard question? Why are you asking  him about being a billionaire or why are you asking him such softball questions and not forcing him  to answer the PR speak? Is it possible that's why she was interviewing him because he knew her?  I don't think so. I don't, the reason she was interviewing him is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I have the inside line on this by the way. All right, Jason Callacanis, what's the story?  Okay. She wrote a book about like Kevin Rose and Mark Zuckerberg and I had dinner with her in France  and a bunch of people and she is really into Mark Zuckerberg. I mean, she calls him like Zuck and  she was like dropping his name like, oh, Zuck this and Zuck that. I'm going to throw up in my mouth.  Excuse me. I would just, I know it, but I think she really likes the guy. She's married. She's got her  husband. I had dinner with her husband. It's very cool. I don't think it's that kind of thing,  but as a journalist, I've watched her operate. She flirts with people to get information. It's  how she does what she does and she was very upfront about that. The South by Southwest audience would  hate that. Oh, of course. So you have, and then she, I don't think that she's a particularly good  interviewer because I saw her do another interview. And so being, you know, what makes for a good  journalist in print versus what makes for a good host on a show like Twitter or whatever,  two very different things and on stage and being able to ask hard questions and shut up and let  the person answer very, very different skillset. I don't think she has that skillset and she's  developed a personal relationship with him, which is really annoying if you're in the audience,  because nobody knows what you're talking about. And if you're a fan boy, then it's even worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  We had a nice woolly coat in the winter. Blu-ray encryption cracked once again by those clever guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  at a Trinidad. I'm sorry, Antigua. Okay. Do the voice. Do a, do a, give us a Trinidad voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We have, we have, we have, we have no unprotected BD plus. No. Okay. Never mind. I can do it.  I can't work on it. I'm working on it. Are you doing it? Come on. We have unprotected

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  ad. Everybody get Blu-ray. So thank you. I just have to get the steel drums in my head and I can  do it. So, um, apparently BD plus is the, uh, was a very sophisticated scheme and a very difficult  to crack. Unlike AACS, which was on HD DVD. These guys at Slysoft are very good. They make a program  which will copy Blu-ray discs and they sell it out of Antigua. Uh, so unexpected. Yeah. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  You're telling me that somebody cracked the DRM. Oh my God. That's astonishing. Wow. They said,

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  admittedly we're not really so actually, I don't think their English is their native language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  His name is Pierre van Huyen. Admittedly, we're not really so fast with this because actually we had  intended to publish this release already in December as promised. However, I don't know what  accent that is. That's a made up. It's a combination Dutch, German, who knows. We don't know. I'm from

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  unnamed country in Lichtenstein. However, it decided for strategic, now it's now he's Russian,  strategic reasons to wait a bit for the outcome of the format war between HD DVD and Blu-ray.  And, and then they say, you know, we fully expect them to change it again,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but he says, we think we can crack it again. Well, you know, I'm on their website now and they don't  have it on there for sale yet. They still have any DVD and they do. Yeah. If you get to any DVD,

Speaker: SPEAKER_23
Transcript:  Oh, here it is. I see the HD DVD and Blu-ray. It's got the latest version has got a support for  amazing BD plus copy protection. I mean, BD plus was supposed to be Sony's, you know, that was one

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  of the pitches expensive. Isn't this thing kind of expensive? It's a hundred dollars. Yeah, but it

Speaker: SPEAKER_23
Transcript:  works to Blu-ray. That's like, that's like five pounds over here. It's only expensive. Five pounds,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  49 euros, which I guess is 75 bucks. But I think that's about 300 us. Yeah. And more all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So, no, but I think the, I mean, of course it's crazy to want a pirate Blu-ray discs. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_23
Transcript:  the blanks themselves cost more than the movie. You don't do this. Yeah, but you're just ripping  it to build a media store. If you got two terabytes of storage, you just want like 720p copies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  You're like psychotic. You're just like, I mean, if you're taking, it takes like five  hours to copy one of these discs, I think like it's for, it takes forever. And they're 25 bucks to

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  buy. You're basically 19. I think they're piracy proof. I mean, who's, you know, you'd be nuts to

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  do this. What's it called when you're addicted to committing crimes? A kleptomaniac. That's people

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  that collect things. A Baron von Munchausen. Someone who's addicted that's actually literally

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  taking stuff, picking it up and stealing it. All right. So same thing. Criminal addiction is

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  basically, that's what you're basically talking about here. I mean, if you're going to take 18  hours to figure out how to do this, you're basically just doing it for the sake of doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And I've always felt most pirates were that way. They collect stuff. They're collectors.  They're junk collectors. They have copies of all kinds of weird crap. They never use it. They  wouldn't have bought it in the first place. I don't count them as against the bottom line. Oh,  we've lost so much money because of piracy. They would have never bought it. They would never

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  have bought it. These guys are like, I have all 20 seasons of The Simpsons. I ripped them myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I remember very well in the early days of the Mac. I remember a friend of mine, I won't say his name,  but he opened his closet door and literally the closet is stacked from six feet tall with floppy  disks. He says, you know, I have every Mac program ever made in there. You're exactly right. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  pack rat mentality. His name is Steve Wozniak. His name is Steve Wozniak. Amazing story. You know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Woz himself, I mean, I don't think Woz ever got off being that. Is there a lot of negative to it? Is  it neutral? Mark, do you feel like, are you an optimist? Yeah, I think I am. I get, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  it's just increased my sources of information. And I do think that there will always be an  opportunity for good journalists to get paid somehow. There will probably be some rough periods,  but with a combination of my using Google search, search words with RSS and RSSing a lot of different  blogs and then reading print paper, people have a tremendous amount of variety and control over  the news that they get. And I think there's, you know, there's always going to be a way to make  money from that. And therefore there will always be a way for good journalists to get paid. So in  the long run, I am not worried at all. In the short term, I think it'll be weird for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's going to be weird. That's, I know Corey says that too. He says, he quotes Theodore Sturgeon,  he said 90% of everything is crap, but that means 10% of everything is great. And if you have more  everything, then you're going to have more great stuff. And honestly, people like some of that crap.  I'm already making it into a t-shirt.  I figure 25 hours of Leo is just not enough. 25 hours of Leo is never enough.  A week! What am I nuts? So I'm going to, so you know, what we'll do is we'll stream everything,  you know, everything I'm doing, all the podcasts, the radio show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The show I can get Randolph on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I want Prager on. What do you mean? Prager is listening and he's not on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know he said that he fired up Skype, but he's like, I don't know why he's not getting this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I don't understand that. This is our third anniversary episode.  I told him that.  If we don't have Prager on, we don't have the third anniversary episode. I don't understand that at all.  Prager! Get in here! You still do that, don't you? Prager!  Prager, hello?  He answered! It worked. It still works.  Nice.  David, you go running with Kevin Rose. You and Kevin Rose go out and jog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, you know what? I need to get some more cardio.  And um, I hadn't been jogging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Kevin said he wanted to go. He wanted to play racquetball. I said, I'm going to go running.  He's like, I'll go with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Racketball? He's in the 60s, the 70s. When did that game die?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  It never died, Don. I haven't learned squash yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to learn squash. That looks fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You guys are so, so changed from when I knew you.  And really all you wanted to do was go out and smoke doobies out back.  Now you're like exercising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh yeah. Next time we have Kevin Rose on, it's going to be talking about being on the polo team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah. Guys, it's time for bloody Marys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Now, polo never got big with the whole 80s Wall Street greeno.  Every sport you guys are listing is a very kind of like 1985.  Let's play some tennis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  We would like to.  David, I'm so glad we get you on because you're one of the original twits. You were on twit zero.  Probably the first 20 or 30 twits.  That was a long time.  It has. This is the third word.  Microsoft Friday raises its offer $33 a share, $44. something billion dollars for Yahoo.  Yahoo's response? No, we're worth $37 a share.  Today, Steve Ballmer sends a note to the troops saying, we're walking away. That's it.  The Microsoft Yahoo merger over.  Or is it?  Wait a minute. That's the end. That's it. It's story over.  No, right. But if you were Steve Ballmer and you actually wanted a hostile takeover of Yahoo,

Speaker: SPEAKER_23
Transcript:  what would you do? You'd walk away from the deal. You'd watch the share price tank.  And then you'd come back in a week later when you pick it up for 25 bucks a share.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not going to happen.  I've seen a lot of that speculation. I just feel like Ballmer, if anything,  you mentioned before the show that you thought he had big ones, but I felt like when the going  got tough, Microsoft didn't know what to do. I honestly read this whole situation as Microsoft  thinking that when they went in with their offer for Yahoo, that they would be greeted as liberators.  And that as soon as Yahoo started putting up some resistance, Microsoft sort of panicked.  And they were like, well, we really don't want to go hostile because we don't know  we're not prepared for that at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, I don't think they did want to go hostile, hostile because then you piss off engineers and  executives and you don't want a company that doesn't want to be part of you. Right?  Jason, you said, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Well, I was absolutely convinced it was going to happen. And I think the one thing that a lot of  people didn't anticipate was that Yahoo's leadership, specifically Jerry Yang, would  basically do so many poison pills, basically was so adamant that they'd not be sold.  So we basically put it at a price that I think Microsoft-  It's a major scorched earth.  Yeah, a major scorched earth threatening to do the Google deal, threatening to go open search  and let anybody have the search results. I mean, all these things they were doing were basically to  decrease the value of the asset. So Microsoft wouldn't want to buy it. Now they've succeeded.  And if Google decided it's going to be a total bloodbath this week on the stock price,  it's going to go crashing back down. And there's going to be a lot of shareholders who are like,  what happened? We would have liked the $33. And if Google shares stay at 20 or 22 for another two  or three years, which is completely possible, or they could go down, there's going to be a lot of  upset hedge funds-  Lawsuits?  There's going to be a ton, of course. I mean, this is going to be just a total mess. And I basically  made a list of people and who won in this. Google's a big winner.  Google's a big winner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  This is what Google wanted. This is why Google kept throwing little bones to Yahoo saying,  come on, you're worth more than that. Come on. You can just see Google behind the scenes.  You're worth more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you going to take that from that guy?  You can listen to that bummer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Google's a huge winner. The VCs and the startup companies, huge winners. It's better to have  three buyers out there. Better to have three than two in the search business. So it's much  better for VCs and for startup companies. For the Yahoo shareholders, they're major losers because  they could have gotten 50% premium or more. It was actually like a 70% premium at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  We're going to continue with our look at the best of and worst of 2008 in just a little bit.  One company that's been with us the whole year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's these little tiny ants. They're called raspberry crazy ants. Their name for the guy who  discovered them in the US. Apparently, they came over on a cargo ship into the port of Houston,  and they started showing up on the southeast side of town. Although I've seen them, I saw them several  years ago. I used to live up by the compact campus on the northwest side of town, the old  compact campus, and I saw them there. But they don't move in the straight little lines that you  see ants move. They move haphazardly, almost randomly. They're crazy. They're crazy. They're  crazy. And they can cover more ground this way and find food quicker, is the theory. They also are  very attracted to electrical current, as are a lot of ants. In fact, fire ants in the same way. I  don't know if there are fire ants where any of you guys live. They're a real problem down here in the  southwest. Fire ants suck. They're awful. And you'll see sometimes, and like you'll see the green  underground electrical transformers. Around here, you'll see a lot of times a fire ant mound piled  up against it. So ants are used to that. But all ants are interested in electrical current. But here,  they've been getting into people's computers if they get in the home and essentially gum them up.  They'll get into the fans. They'll get thick enough in there that they can cause heat problems.  That's disgusting.  It is disgusting. In a townhouse I was living in in San Antonio years ago, we had fire ants get into  an outdoor air conditioning compressor and gum up them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Sorry, I was envisioning fire ants being shot through your AC at high speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is worse. When the repairman came to take the compressor apart, he pulled the motor out and it was sticky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So there's this is Comcast Cares.  I don't know what the... For some reason, I'm getting a lot of Tokyo Metro sounds in here. I don't  know what's going on. Hello, Frank. Are you there? What did you do? Put seagull poop in my food at

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  the ramp? What did you do? I had no idea what you were talking about. All of a sudden, I started  getting all these emails and all these message board postings about some awful incident that  happened at the ramp, which caused you to never speak with me again. I put a restraining order on  you. I didn't know what was going on. It was a joke. I took it really personally because I thought  that you and I were always BFFs. Absolutely BFFs. Now we are again. I'm really looking forward to  our cottage that we're going to share up in Mendocino next week. I'm glad that we're back

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  together. Twin beds are double. I could actually, what I could do if I had four T1s or four DSLs,  I could have four computers, one attached to each, and then each computer could have its own Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  And then I could do it. What I need is four T1 lines, three craze, and a small sack of MIT graduates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It turns out a guy in our forums noticed it and put a forum message up and said,  guys, did you know that your tracker is open now? And my CTO was on vacation for two weeks in Italy.  When was that that he said that? It was sometime like two weeks ago or a week and a half ago.  Recently. Okay. We opened it up the first week of April and it was probably sometime in mid-May.  So the minute that my CTO got back, the next day, which was the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend,  we put the whitelist back in effect. Right after we put that whitelist in, we started getting the  sin flood. And we thought it was a bunch of rogue torrent folks from some shadowy Eastern European  countries. They were like, something's pissed at us. Turns out, no, it was this legit business  media defender that, and I think they just couldn't conceive of the fact that somebody would use bit  torrent for legitimate reasons. And the minute that we shut ourselves down to them, as far as I  tell it appears, they just flooded us with sin without an optical spindle. Did you see that guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  who cut his meat with the air? Yeah, it was a cake. So it'd be meat. Meat would be tough.  Do not use your air to cut meat. In Japan, the MacBook could be used like a knife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  This brisket is so tender. I can cut it with a MacBook. I have to say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  what do you think makes the Android stand out? Well, the thing that was interesting was just that

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  they have gestures, like the ones that we have gotten used to, pinch, etc., that are slightly  different. And they're not the same, but they also seem to work. In other words, it opens up the idea  to developers and users that these tools don't necessarily have to have a one common interface  that's owned and copyrighted by one vendor. And I think that's a pretty powerful, I mean, first of  all, it means that every other phone manufacturer and play, like starting with Nokia, they've got a  big problem because all of a sudden Google is in second place. Interesting. Leapfrogging ahead of

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  everybody else. I mean, I saw an ad for... But is it really Google or is it whoever, whatever handset  makes your maker makes an Android handset? I mean, Google's not saying we want to be in this business

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  exactly. Well, it's very similar to the old Microsoft play with Windows Mobile, except that  it seems to have a slightly different kind of feel to it. Isn't it more, isn't it open source?  I mean, yeah, of course. But I mean, let's not go crazy about that. It's tied to you have to use

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Java in order to write it. Ew, that's not happy. Things are kind of turning up. Now, John, you said  that we're going to have a depression by 2010. Is that still on? Oh, yeah. And no change? Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that's the beginning of the depression. Depression actually is a long-term thing and it hits rock

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  bottom in 2013. Now, Andrew, you're actually an investment advisor. Do you agree with this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I think that it's interesting because John and I have talked about this many times and I question  always if in fact all the stars are aligning and everything looks like 2009, 2010, or give them a  few days or so here and there that everything is going to just fall apart. Wouldn't we kind of be  smart enough to get out in advance? And then the question is, isn't that what maybe is happening  right now? Are we kind of going through the process of lightening up on stocks and various

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  other investment? And I've mentioned this to Andrew, but got Jason Calacanis on. Mike Arrington kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  broke this and tanked the Yahoo stock earlier this week when he said Yahoo and Google are about to  do an ad deal. In fact, Arrington even implied there might be a search deal involved. Reuters  picked the story up and Yahoo stock. And I don't even know if it's come back yet, but it turned out  somewhat was true that in fact Yahoo and Google did do a deal. I guess somewhat similar, Andrew,  to the trial that they had done a few weeks earlier. It looks like an AdSense deal. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  it's so lame. Placing Google ads on Yahoo search results. Right. I mean, isn't that AdSense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah. Yahoo's buying AdSense. Exactly. They're not even buying. They're using AdSense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_23
Transcript:  They signed up with a publisher. Yeah. I get to forget the fucker in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Isn't that kind of an admission that it's not going so well? I'm thinking, oh, it's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  They're going to put on a few of their blogs. They'll get a couple of the plugins. But it's  interesting to me. That's why you're wrong, John. The whole thing is a MacGuffin. It's all set up

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  by the big ISPs. They don't pay anything for bandwidth. Bandwidth is essentially free right  now. It's very cheap. It's getting cheaper. At some point, every one of these guys still have

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to pay for a loop through May East and May West, and that costs money. But most of their bandwidth  is peering relationships. Yeah, that's true. They're not paying. But there's an overhead involved  here with all those servers and all the connections and all the wires. You don't think that counts for  something? Yeah, and they're getting more than enough already for us to pay for that.  Why should we be paying for water? It rains every year. Water is a much more scarce resource.  No, it's not scarce around here. It's in the Bay Area or in some other areas. There's not  scarce at all. There's a lot of places where there's plenty of water, especially in the  northern states. Why are we paying at all then? Because it comes, it rains into the pool,  and it goes into a pipe, and we get it. Why should we be paying? We should just have a flat fee of  five bucks, and that'll be the end of it. That's the same argument. My argument is you should pay

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  what something's worth. I think that, in fact, you're right. Water is worth a lot more than bits.  Bits are virtually free. These guys are just using this just as they did net neutrality as a way  to extort money out of people. It's pure and simple. There's all this dark fiber under the country.  This stuff is cheap and getting cheaper. They're acting like it's getting to be more scarce. They're

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  acting like it's oil, like it's water. It's not. I'm not taking the side of the lies. I'm just  saying it would make more sense. It's based on lies. No, it's not. One of my eight arguments  does not one lie in there. I don't talk about the shortage of bits. It's ridiculous to say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  oh, well, what we should do is charge people through the nose, and then that way spammers  will have to shut down because- Where do I say charge through the nose? Because you're saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  if you're me, you're selling- I'm saying that it should cost you less than you're paying now,  and those guys who are hogging all the bandwidth should be paying more. They should be paying

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  more than you're paying. I will grant you there's an essential element of fairness that people who  are hogs should pay more than people who use a dribble at a time, and that's fine if you want  to have tiered based on speed because the dribble at a time, people don't need the speed, and I'll  pay more for speed, which I'm doing right now, but I don't think it makes sense to charge people for

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the bite because the bite costs nothing. I don't like the idea of having this tiered speed either  because it slows down the implementation of IPTV, which is crucial to the growth of this country's

Speaker: SPEAKER_23
Transcript:  telecommunications system. No, but to meter it would too because nobody's going to download IPTV  if it's going to cost them tons of money per- Why do you guys assume it's going to cost tons of money

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  just because somebody says you're going to meter the internet? This is all about making tons of money!

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Let me ask something, John. If I watch more TV than you do and I have every single- Let's get to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  iPhone real quickly. On Monday, Steve Jobs takes the stage and announces what we all knew would  happen. A 3G iPhone came out. It pretty much had all the features we expected. GPS. What we didn't  expect is a very low price, $200. That's because according to Ars Technica, AT&T has rewritten its  deal with Apple, no longer gives them any portion of the monthly fee, so it can subsidize the phone  price down to $200 for the 8 gigs, $300 for the 16 gigs. The GPS, once you hear all the good things,  much, much better battery life, lower price, GPS, 3G, then come the yes-butts. For instance,  yes, but 3G, HSDPA is only available in a very limited area for AT&T. Many people won't be able  to get it. I won't be able to get it up here. A yes-butt, $200, but you have to pay more money  for the data plan. Now, $30 for the high speed and you get zero SMS messages, which is a major scam  since SMS is just data now. They're charging you like 10 cents for 140 bytes of data. That's  ridiculous. They also, the GPS, Tom Tom jumped in and said, great, there's GPS. We're going to write  turn-by-turn direction program for the iPhone, only to be held back by the sudden realization that  Apple's new iPhone SDK agreement says you may not write under any circumstances any turn-by-turn  applications for the iPhone. So as usual, the reality distortion field set by Steve Jobs is  a little bit taken on by the actual facts, but it takes a day or two for the press to realize that.  John, your take on the 3G iPhone, do you care? I thought your summary right there was better than

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  half the reviews I've read of the iPhone, especially the ones in the press as you stated.  That was good. It's a lot of yes-butts. Yeah, no, that was outstanding. I think you're dead  on on every one of those points. I think the iPhone's becoming a big deal or a bigger deal  than it was. Eventually, they're going to work it out so people are a little more cut loose a  little more. But I think it is heading toward becoming a platform in and of itself. Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  that's what's exciting about it. It may not be, it's still not there. No cut and paste,  third-party applications limited. Yeah, you can get super monkey ball, but you can't get GPS.  I think as you say, it's kind of a ground breaker. It's what everybody's trying to copy.  Samsung's new Instinct, which looks to be the closest thing, now has visual voicemail,  has actual turn-by-turn directions on it. That's coming out soon. I think you'll see other companies.  What they're doing is they're saying, well, people want this. We're going to make it something  somewhat like that. Will Harris, you're an iPhone junkie. Were you excited by the announcement?

Speaker: SPEAKER_23
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm psyched for it because I guess over here, we get a lot less screwed with the  data plans and with the general plans. Over here, O2 is the sole carrier. They're still doing all  inclusive plans with the data, still getting tons of SMS messages. You get a free upgrade from your  current iPhone to the new 3G iPhone if you're prepared to extend your contract. Yeah, we get  that to the software upgrade basically, right? Or do you get the new phone? Yeah, and what they're  letting you do is take your old iPhone and then basically give it to someone else to activate it  on the network on a prepaid card or something for somebody else. See, we don't even have prepaid

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  cards. They eliminated the Go phone option in the States. So you can now basically take that and

Speaker: SPEAKER_23
Transcript:  give that to your missus or whatever. They're going to force activation too. The price plans  are all really good. And they're going to give you a free one. On certain price plans, now if you're  a new customer and you sign up, they'll just give you the iPhone. You don't even have to pay anything  for the iPhone, which is a really chunky, that's a big subsidy. But it's obviously because, I mean,  previously Apple's business model was to make money off the ongoing subscriptions. Obviously,  they want to aim at what they want their model now is shifting to getting as many of these things  as possible and making money off the App Store. I think that's pretty clear what they're going to  do now if they're taking what is it like 25% of every transaction on the App Store. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I like MobileMe. I like the idea they call it exchange-like features for home users,  which is essentially the ability to sync your calendar and address book. You get 20 gigs of  storage, but you have to pay a hundred bucks a year for it, which is, you know, the Samsung  will do that for free. Most phones will do that. My BlackBerry syncs with Google Calendar for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I don't want to be with, but the big talk in the investment community last week, I don't know if  you noticed the stock went down after that, was not so much, you know, of course some of the  financials, but you know what it was? Steve Jobs Health. Steve Jobs Health is looking a little thin.  Thanks to Matt Drudge for that bogus story. Oh, you saw him. He looked a little bit thinner.  And I'm not saying that necessarily. He's a freaking vegan. Yeah. He looks like he's living on

Speaker: SPEAKER_23
Transcript:  grass, wheatgrass or something. What's amazing is that if you look at him as a really good story on  of all places, Valley Wag, we had a pictorial of Jobs over the last 10 years and it's amazing to  see him. Skinnier and skinnier, isn't he? Yeah. Absolutely. Now, the part of the reason that

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Wall Street is afraid is because of course he had cancer, he had pancreatic cancer,  and has been in remission for some time for that. Andrew, it's a publicly held company. Don't they  have to disclose if he's sick? They said, oh no, he's just got a bug. He's on antibiotics. He's

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  already feeling better. I don't necessarily think personal health is a disclosure. As a matter of  fact, it's not a disposable issue. It's not a material? We did a, Teresa Pelletti did a story

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  in Market Watch on this with a lot of reporting. And no, you don't have to report that. You could  be two minutes from dropping dead. It doesn't have to be reported. Well, this is a case where

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  you should have to because nobody can run Apple. Well, that is a problem. This is the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a couple of things I want to point out about this situation. I talked to John Markoff  about it who saw Steve and asked him specifically about this, how he was feeling. Steve says he's  fine. I feel good. What are you talking about? But there was this picture that ran that Reuters had.  You look terrible. Yeah. Well, apparently according to some posters there, there's two things  I learned. One, it looks like that picture was doctored. They made him, not that he's not gone,  but he's not green. And Markoff- They made him green? You say they made him green?  If you look at the Reuters picture that ran in Market Watch, which came from Reuters,  it's a picture of the two of them side by side and on this newer picture, he's got a green,  gray tint to his complexion. If they Photoshopped that sucker.  And Granny Smith. Granny Smith. That's appalling. So anyway-

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Did you, has anybody played the Spore Creature Creator?  Do you know what I'm talking about? Will Wright's new game Spore, which will be out in September,  they pre-released the Creature Creator, which is the thing that lets you design your creature.  You can't play the game, you can just design the creature. Have you seen the pornographic

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  creatures people are designing? No, that sounds good. Give us a link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yes. Oh, it's the revolting- Really big front tails.  It's worse than that. It's actually become quite a meme. It's not safe for work. I guess rock,  rock, paper, shotgun. These things, I'm not gonna show them, but I will give you a link  in our- We're doing this interesting thing now, using Cover It Live. If you go to twitlive.tv,  I'm actually doing the links out live, so you can watch our show notes. So go to-  EA bans the Spore porn. Yeah, well, they may ban it, but it's too late. But look what you  could do with the Creature Creator. That's amazing. Let me see. Does it have sound?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they do. It's kind of gross.  Oh my goodness. I'm reminded of Inca art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So you're looking at them right now? Yeah, not for long.  Watch me give you- I'll give you a moment. It's actually quite humorous.  So what is Bill Gates- What is his accomplishment? I don't think that he really has one.  I do. Okay, well, Jerry Pornell, why should we credit Bill Gates with anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_25
Transcript:  Unlike Jobs, Gates really did have the vision of a computer in every house and on every desk  and in every classroom, and he really meant it. They had that written. That was the mission

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  statement for Microsoft. It had it written in concrete as you come up the path that  Microsoft and Redmond- But people always leave out the last part. A computer in every, whatever,

Speaker: SPEAKER_25
Transcript:  office, home, desk, running Microsoft software. Well, that's fine, but the first part of it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  the real vision and nobody else had it. So I want to hear some stories. I want you old time. I  brought you old timers on for a reason. I want to hear some stories about- Thank you, Jerry.  I want to hear some stories. Jerry, we're going to have to edit your coughing out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no. That's what I'm saying. I'm sorry. I need to get a cough button on this damn Microsoft

Speaker: SPEAKER_25
Transcript:  phone. I push the button and it flashes red for mute.  It mutes us, not you. That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm afraid so. That's all right. I think it's great. As soon as I say old timers,  there we go. No, but the reason I got you guys on is I wanted to have people who go back to the  beginning with Bill Gates, who have some stories to tell. I mean, John, you used to make, you did a,  you used to give speeches with a video of Bill Gates. You'd take his speech and you'd edit it  all down and you used a video toaster, which is a precursor to this tricaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I actually, the one speech, the video I made was I caught one of his keynotes at CES and that's,  and he swallows a lot while he's talking. He kind of swallows. I think they trained that out of him  later and makes a little gulping thing. And so I edited together. So there's nothing but that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And it went five minutes. It's a good, it's a good video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_25
Transcript:  Five minutes out of 45 was just gulping. That's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  He's never been, but you know, that's part of his charm. He's never been a,  you know, a great front man. He's a geek. So Jerry, did you have the ability to call Bill at any time  and say, Hey Bill, what's going on? Or for a while, for a while, but I'll tell you something

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  until he got married, anybody did. Oh yeah. It was the wife that got in the way.  That's always the wife. All you had to do was call the Microsoft

Speaker: SPEAKER_25
Transcript:  switchboard at about 10 o'clock at night on a Friday night. That's who was home. Did he answer  the phone? He answered the phone himself. Microsoft.  Is that your Bill Gates? Microsoft.  I want a hundred dollars from, I won't tell you who it is, but he's a pretty well-known journalist  saying, I can have you talking to Bill Gates tonight, right now. Oh, that's hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Come on, tell us Jerry. No, I'm not going to, but anyway,

Speaker: SPEAKER_25
Transcript:  I dialed it, handed him this guy on the phone and said, he'll answer it. Microsoft.  Well, Bill knew my voice. I damn well wasn't going to say anything myself.  Nice, Microsoft, who can I talk to? Oh, you want to talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Somebody just said in the chat room, Jason and Leo should have their own podcast. They just do

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  stupid voice. The stupid voice cast. Welcome to stupid voice cast. I'm Leo the poet and he's

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Jason. We're here today. Wow. It's, it's zany. It's a, hey, I'm looking for our guest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  He talks like that most of morning radio across America. Exactly. Exactly. Can you imagine like

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  going to dinner with Adam Curry? Like I'll have the Caesar salad on the side and it's crazy. I'll

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  take a refill on this ice tea. Leo off to you. What are you having for lunch? If you ever get

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  didn't work the way they wanted it to. Yeah. And apple blamed AT&T and AT&T blamed apple. It's kind  of interesting. There's a two. That's never happened before. It was a two step process.  The first step is AT&T has to approve your credit and say, okay, you've got an account. Then you  have to hook the iPhone up to a Mac and iTunes. And then the iTunes says, okay, you're activated.  Now, when I did it on Saturday, it took a second for each. It was very, very quick,  but people were waiting for hours. And apparently not just in the U S but all over the world. These  servers were crashing, not just AT&T's in other words, but O2, Vodafone, many of the other carriers

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  were also having similar problems. It's a phenomenon. It's also tough to scale for an event

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  like this. Well, that's exactly right. You don't buy bandwidth year round to handle this kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  traffic in one day. Oh, they should have been able to handle it. Wasn't that much. Well, and you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I have to say maybe there is some credibility in what AT&T's saying because Apple's own mobile  me service, their new dot Mac was down for a long time and then very, very slow too. Mobile me has  not been working very well even now. Yeah, there's your cloud computing for you.  So it's, but I think I have to say I bought the 16 gigabyte. I wasn't going to, I kind of got  sucked in by this 24 hours of iPhone. It was such great marketing tool for Apple that I actually  convinced myself to buy an iPhone. But that took a lot of work. I wasn't gonna, I really wasn't.  And you know what, we're really, it won me over and it's not the GPS or the 3G because I don't  even get the, you see just bought the weather channel. Yeah, I saw that. They bought, CBS decided

Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  to buy CNET instead of the weather channel. Is that really true? Yeah. Yeah. That was the choice.  That was, that was apparently the things they were considering. Yeah. So NBC's the runner up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That must make you feel damn, damn good. It was you or the weather channel. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_24
Transcript:  It's better than the puppy channel. Hey, don't knock the puppy channel. But I had arranged  things that I was going to come down at 10, stand in line. They said, no, no, no, Steve, no, no,  we've got it all arranged that you're from line. I said, no, I don't want to pass up other people  because that's how I am. And they said, oh no, no, they want you to the people in the front of the  line want you to be ahead of them. Right. I remember you, I stood by you. I posted on  that blog. I remember you, you told me that you told us that. I said this comment on the CNET list.  If you go down to the side, I have a post in there that I wrote this morning just before driving to  Vegas. And, and you know, I went to the people in the front of the line. Now, when I got there,  I saw four people. It could be there were some wrapped around a corner that I didn't see  some more, but they said it was a short line. And I went to those people and you know, they said,  yeah, they were okay with me. I was chatting with the guy. I actually made the guy who was  first in the line there before me go in, walk in first and get sort of the, the good camera  publicity, that sort of stuff. You know, he kept wanting to know, no, no, no, you're the big man.  You do it. Come on. You, you know, you were there first. And I try to do that. I do not like people  who cut. I know executives that will get products in advance that will arrange a little black door,  back door, you know, push out of the audit early. I could actually make phone calls and probably get  an iPhone, you know, before anyone else, a lot of different ways, but I won't do that. I love,  I wanted the experience. I waited there from four in the morning till whatever. Now I had made

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  arrangements. Hold on. I'm waiting for this story to load and it's refusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Do do do do do do do. Don't worry. We'll just edit this all out. Do it's going to really only be  like a 10 minute podcast. Do do do. John, what are you making for dinner tonight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've got some some beef short ribs that came from one of the animals that we've

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  we buy animals off the hoof. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  I'm envisioning your backyard looking like some scene out of Apocalypse Now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you have a ranch, John? No, but when you live in Port Angeles, you have a access to people that,  you know, grow a few animals and then they split them up. When did you get fresh?  I got a place up there, but you're not there now. Not at the moment. OK, I was there yesterday.  Do you bring meat back with you from Port? Yeah, it's hilarious to get it through the TSA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Sir, what is this? It's a rump roast. I'll bring a suitcase full. No, no, wait a minute. No, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, a suitcase full of meat. What else I got to bring? I got to put some on the plane to get my

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  money's worth of the shipping. Sure, Mr. Riser, just get right on the plane. No problem. Actually,  haven't you? See, by the way, Kevin, you could just go silent. You don't have to say anything.  I know that if you don't have to confirm it, you don't have to deny it. I don't want you to feel  uncomfortable, but it would have been that whether you were here or not, it's a big story.  The rumor was that Google was doing due diligence on a possible $200 million acquisition of Dig.  Mike publishes this. It's the same rumor. This time, though, instead of just letting it drop,  he actually comes back and said, no, they changed their mind, which as far as I'm concerned,  he could be making up to protect himself. Who knows? But it didn't happen. So I guess, Kevin,  here's the point where I would say to you, you want to confirm or deny, you want to say anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  about it? Well, I mean, about a year ago or so, we decided to, as a company, just like when any of  this stuff comes up, just to never comment on anything. Now Jay denied it once, like vigorously  denied it. He did. He was really pissed when that came out and we did a blog post about it. But  it's funny because these rumors can come about in so many different ways. I remember one time I was  on the Yahoo campus and I was just there. We were doing some biz dev kind of work and forming a  partnership with them. And someone sees me on the campus and all of a sudden they have an ear with  whoever the tech news publisher is. And then all of a sudden there's a rumor that we're going to  sell the company. So, you know, we have, I'm friends with Marissa and everyone over at Google. I think  they're a great group and we're always working on stuff together. So, is Allen and company shopping

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  you around? No, they're not. Okay. There you go. That's all I want to hear. That's great.  So let's talk about Steve Jobs because we did quite a bit on Steve Jobs and the Whipple procedure  that he received. And now the New York Times has finally said, told the truth, John Markoff and  Jonah Serra and the Times writing the story that, you know, that's why Apple stock tanked last week  despite having the best quarter it's ever had. And then Jobs calls no Sarah. You know, it's kind of  funny because Joe, I would have led with that at the top of the story, but Joe buries it at the  bottom. Thursday afternoon, after I've gotten my final Steve's health as a private matter from  Apple PR and much to my amazement, I'm reading from Joe's article in the Times, Mr. Jobs,  that's how you know it's a Times, they call him Mr. Jobs, called me. This is Steve Jobs, he began.  You think I'm an arrogant bleep who thinks he's above the law and I think you're a slime bucket  who gets most of his facts wrong. Steve Jobs talking. That sounds like- Can you believe,  what a great way to start a conversation with a reporter. You're a slime bucket who gets most of  his facts wrong. Then he offers to tell him the story, but only off the record. Guy is a sys admin,  he's hired by the city of San Francisco to set up a very important wide area land for the city.  This is how administrators and others are going to be able to, you know, civil officials are going  to be able to log into the city's network remotely. The guy is apparently a brilliant engineer,  maybe a little cranky, as many sys admins are. By the way, belated happy sys admin's day. We  love sys admins. He won't give up the passwords to, you know, I guess a new guy comes in to monitor  the security and the sys admin says, no, I'm not, who are you? I'm not going to give you the passwords.  They arrest him, put him in jail, $5 million bail. They're afraid that he's kind of holding the system  for ransom. In fact, they tell the story, well, he was worried about losing his job and this was  a poison pill and they're afraid that he's got people who are going to call, you know, call a  special code in and blow the whole thing up digitally. Mitnick all over again. Yeah, none of this  happens. In fact, if you go on InfoWorld and he's really got a champion on InfoWorld who's telling  this story and apparently this guy's actually kind of just trying to protect the network that he  created and he's worried about, yay, who's getting in there and messing the whole thing up.  Well, he finally gives up. I mean, wouldn't you, you're thrown into jail. He finally gives,  after a while, I mean, he holds out for days. He finally gives up, gives the passwords.  By the way, if you want to read about this, the series of articles by Paul Venezia in  InfoWorld is what to read. So he gives up the passwords.  And what does the city do? It puts all the passwords in its complaint and publishes them.  My God. The San Francisco district attorney Kamala Harris publishes 150 user names and passwords  used by various departments to connect the city's VPN as exhibit A. Wait,  was it password or password hashes? Well, according to Robert McMillan writing in InfoWorld,  it's the passwords. That's a good question. They place the passwords into the public record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wouldn't want some of my passwords to be seen by the public, that's for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, this guy, yo, that's a good point. What do you use? Kind of like  ex-girlfriends, things like that? What do you use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no, no. We're not talking about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Anyway, no, you're right. I wouldn't want people, because passwords are embarrassing,  you know, kitty poop and stuff like that. You don't want to use, you know, anybody.  But nonetheless, I mean, it actually proves if I'm the defending attorney, Terry Child's case all  along, these guys are bozos. They don't know anything about security. They shouldn't have  these passwords. Apparently.  The DA's office did not say what the passwords were used. Thank goodness for that. That's a troll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wonder if he collected any lulls for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's my, your honor, I did it for the lulls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_23
Transcript:  I saw that apparently mobile me is back up again now.  Allegedly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  General Isamo Francisco Franco's still dead. Mobile me is back up, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_23
Transcript:  I feel like the, you know, back in the Iraq war where they had that guy, the general,  who was just the most improbable guy, you know, we are slaughtering them in the streets.  That picture of him just with the caption, like there is nothing wrong with mobile me. Mobile me  is fine. We are all fine here. We are slaughtering the invidious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Fine. It's fine. It's all fine. So they confirmed there's water on Mars. That's good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm moving there.  I thought we already knew that. I thought they kept on talking. Every year they have  another thing on Mars and every year, I think they talk about this water.  Yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're right. In fact, two or three years ago when I was up at Telluride at the TechFest up  there, there was this one of our, the NASA guys, it was a Mars expert, I guess he was from JPL,  was talking about that underneath the surface there's tons of water and they all know it.  Now every time it comes around, they're finding water again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  We got more water here. So here's the deal. We've seen evidence for this water  ice before in observations by the Odyssey, which is the Mars orbiter,  and in disappearing chunks, remember the Phoenix saw those white chunks.  It scraped some soil and then saw what chunks and then they ablated, they disappeared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, you sound kind of like Kenneth Mars.  That is. It's straight from the producers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He was a good man. He was a lovely man. He was a kind man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But just open it up and then you tell me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, Kevin, you've become the world's worst tease. Every time you're on the show,  you're talking about something you can't tell anybody. Now you've got the mystery pictures  that only Leo gets to see. So everybody out there that's listened to this show is going,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  what, what, what, why? So I'm not trying to be a tease. Honestly,  I'm just trying not to get people in trouble. Oh my God.  Oh, now it's worse. I'm just trying not to get people in trouble. Like, you know,  the people that send me this stuff, like they, they trust me not to, to, to leak it out on like  a mass scale. So I don't want to like post everything that I get online. I'll just say,  whatever it is that I get, I'll try and come up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But I have to say, Kevin, this looks very real, of course, but couldn't, I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you could fake anything nowadays, right? Well, but look at the fourth page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Leo, could you go to that reverse angle for a second?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You want to see that? Okay, let's, we'll do the tight zoom.  No, I'm not doing that to Kevin. Because, because wow, that's, so the, the thing looks,  it looks like it was extruded. Now I have to say I poo pooed the new Nano. I thought, oh,  that's a joke. Cause the pictures we saw originally, remember those Ryan, they were  just really looked phony. And it was exactly right. So I'm no longer basing anything I say on,  so can I say, I can't say even what this document is that you sent me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, I didn't really appreciate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah. Cause that would kind of give away the source of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. And really I'm getting more and more irked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You get pulled over because you were wearing a Rasta hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I got pulled over while Rasta had baseball beanies.  Oh, I didn't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to make him wear the hat and the kilt on the show when I get back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Cut off leg of a BDU. That was another very popular piece of head gear for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Wait a minute. What's that? What's a BDU?

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  A BDU, battle dress, uniform, basically combat fatigues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And you would take the leg of it and you'd put it on your head?

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I had made a pair of cutoffs and turned one of the legs into a hat.  This I gotta see. This I gotta see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's the first incarnation. When this thing came out on Tuesday, by the way,  it's Google's new internet browser. Just what the world needs, a new internet browser.  It said that everything you create with this browser belongs to Google.  You still have copyright to it, but we could do anything we want with it.  That upset people a little bit. But you know, I said even at the time, I said,  look, this is just what lawyers do to protect you against things like caching.  They don't want somebody to come along and sue them saying,  hey, this browser cached a copy of my blog post. I don't like it.  But even Google said, yeah, we just, they said to save money.  This cracks me up. We duplicate the boilerplate from other contracts and  and it just shouldn't have been in there, they said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wasn't buying that argument. You think that they were telling me that they go through all  this trouble and then they just cut and paste something and oh, oops, oops, sorry.  Funny, it was only when the users got upset that it changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  Well, that's a good point.  Have you ever worked for a big company before? Because it sounds like you haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  This whole thing, if you looked into this IMPC and this, what is it?  IMPC.lifewithoutwalls.com, which I think what they're going at, by the way, even with that  silly sneaker commercial or the shoe was all about the fact that a Mac, when you get it,  you can't do anything with the Mac. There's no freedom, but with a PC, you can take it apart.  You can put it back together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Everybody talked about the kind of the semiotics of those first two commercials.  If there was a hidden message there, it was so buried. I don't think it didn't come across.  It's not like America went, you know, like somehow subconsciously absorbed the message of that.  Let me play a little bit of this. This is IMAPC.  It's a pretty good ad, I have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Play that Steve Bomber one. You see that on the site?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll find that one. He says, I'm a PC, I'm a PC, I'm a PC.  Very loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Here's what's beautiful about it. They have it so that you can record your own IMAPC  and potentially be shown on the Times Square monitors. And that's drawing people in who want  to see themselves and the narcissists out there and all the other people that want to have their  five minutes of fame. But more so, they also have a live stream of Times Square showing the  advertising. I think it's a brilliant idea. I'm not sure it's going to...  Is it going to sell PCs is the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, different story.  Or I'm sorry. By the way, a Mac is a PC. Is it going to sell Windows is really the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  Yeah. I mean, I think this is like Coke and Pepsi. Like, you know, I don't think these things are  going to affect adoption of the product either way. I don't think, you know, I think for the  incumbent, it doesn't make a difference. For the upstart Apple, it does. But for the incumbent,

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Mike Arrington said an interesting thing. He first was going to pan the ad, but then he realized it  made him feel like the Apple ads were a little elitist and that maybe he wasn't going to be  able to watch those Apple ads with the same kind of smug satisfaction as he had in the past. Does  that make sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah. Because also people said that the PC character was actually more endearing than the  hipster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, that was obviously intentional. I think Apple was frankly brilliant  when they made the PC sympathetic. If they'd made it a negative,  Windows users would have been pissed off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But this effectively killed the Apple ad in a way because now every single time the Apple ad is run,  you're thinking about this ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's Mike Arrington's contention. Not only killed it that way, but killed it because you  think, oh, they're snooty elitists.  iPhone could very well lose to one of these other competitors. I think if Apple keeps it closed,  I'm with Adam on this one. I think Apple's made a big mistake by deciding to go with a single carrier  and making a closed platform. It's Steve Jobs and a power grab. They're doing the iTunes thing.  It's going to fail with iTunes because the record labels are moving away from them with copy  protection. And it's going to fail with the iPhone, not because it's not a great platform,  but because it's closed. If there's an open alternative, people are going to go for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apple has no history of being open, so why should they start now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_23
Transcript:  No, you're right.  I don't think it's that people even want it to be open. I think it's just certainly a lot of the,  as far as I can see, most of the blowback on it is coming from people like us who are the  sort of high tech guys in the developer community who are so fed up with the fact they could develop  an app for six months and it might not end up on the store. So either Apple needs to go open or  they need to be really, really, really clear about what they are going to allow and what they...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  ...the vision that's actually on my panel and I'm doing this on Thursday. This is why I'm in town  and they said, well, can you prove it? I said, well, yeah, I have an itinerary. Would you like  to see it? They go, yes. And then I said, well, hand me my MacBook. I got to go on the internet  because it's on my Gmail. So they hand me my MacBook. I plug in my Verizon card. I power it  up. And the first thing Firefox does when I boot it up on my Mac is it asks you to clear private data  and just instinctively I click yes. And then right away they grab my laptop back thinking...  Destroying evidence.  Yeah, which I wasn't, but that was besides the point. So they grabbed it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  So you claimed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Believe me, if I was going to hide something, the whole hard drive would be encrypted. There  would be no forensics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I guess what I'm saying is like, this sounds more like a comedy of errors and a bad run of luck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So you can see how the agents might have thought something was going on there.  Yeah.  Besides, if the four horsemen are coming after you, you're not going to worry about what kind  of wine you're going to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Dwight, are you there?  I am.  Are you ready for the end times?  I'm ready. Bring on the pestilence.  There are frogs outside coming from the sky.  We are in a tech bust. There's no question about it. In fact, if you go to TechCrunch,  they have a layoff tracker. And according to their layoff tracker, 19,683 jobs eliminated  since mid September. That's not including the 25,000. HP is going to lay off as a result of  its merger with EDS. It is including 3,000 at Xerox, 9,000 at Dell, 1,500 at Yahoo, 1,500 at eBay,  six at Mahalo. Makes you sound pretty good.  Yeah.  But as a percentage, you laid off about 10% at Mahalo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah. Essentially, we looked at it and said, we have three years' worth of capital left.  We did something really smart. We raised a lot of money in the upmarket. As I always say,  what smart entrepreneurs do in an upmarket is raise capital and sell their companies  for the highest valuation possible. Then in a downmarket, what smart entrepreneurs do is  build value. We raised money when the market was very hot a year and a half ago. Now we're  going to build value in the downmarket and not look for an exit or not look to raise more capital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So your cash position, it gives you what you call runway.

Transcript:  They call it runway. How many months can you go without raising capital? A typical startup

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  company has six to 18 months. Look at all the great technologies  we're still using from that PDC. Like, hmm, oh shoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, moving along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So Rafael, how many PDCs have you been to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I would say two.  Okay. You're the youngster here.  Yeah, unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The newbie. Were you impressed? Was this an interesting event?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It was very interesting. Now we all kind of knew the cloud platform would be unveiled and  that we'd be thoroughly confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  We thought it would be Strata, but instead it's Azure.  Right.  Right. Or Azure or Azure, Azure audio, whatever the hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  But the unveiling of the taskbar was awesome.  The what?  The unveiling of the taskbar was awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Really?  From Windows 7, yeah.  Is that like a big, that's like the big deal is the taskbar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And that's, I know it sounds silly, but it is kind of a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So what's new about the taskbar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's, it's glassy and shiny and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Let's take a step back before we talk about individual features.  Microsoft announced basically two big things, Windows 7,  which by the way is not a code name. This is going to be the name.  That's the real deal.  This ain't no Longhorn Chicago thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes. Windows version 6.1 will be called Windows 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, in the world of Microsoft, that actually makes a lot of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, and I talked a little bit about this on Windows Weekly.  And I've been ever since, like I'll go to sleep.  It's by the way, a great way, better than counting sheep,  go to sleep, trying to count the versions of Windows,  trying to get to seven with the next one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you can't.  You can't.  You can't do it.  For all things pertaining to either book.  And I said to Jonathan, let's, you know, we should do,  we should probably include a reading of some kind.  Let's drive people crazy and do the 700 hobo names.  And he was game.  But I didn't realize that we weren't going to drive people crazy.  We were going to drive us crazy.  Right.  Because the idea was we would sit in his, what was then his office, now his children's room.  And we would record it on his computer while he played.  It was a very low tech operation.  We had a single microphone and he had his guitar out and he played  Big Rock Candy Mountain, the great hobo anthem of our time.  Behind me, over and over and over and over and over and over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  How many names per iteration of Big Rock Candy Mountain can you get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm going to leave that to your listeners.  I would like to know the answer to it.  And I'm not really interested in finding out myself.  So I'm going to crowdsource this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So Google says to Yahoo, you know, the Department of Justice,  just a little too hot right now.  That ad deal we were talking about, forget about it.  So Jerry Yang at the Web 2.0 Summit.  Says, you know, I think it'd be a really good thing for Microsoft to acquire Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  He still thinks so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  How high did that offer get?  33 bucks?  He wanted 37.  And what is Yahoo at now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Heading for under 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And he still has a job.  This is what's amazing to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's his company.  Yeah, but why?  Can I interrupt here and just say what I keep hearing in the chat room about you just having

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  won an award?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I don't know.  What award is this chat room?  The best hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Not you, Leo.  Tweed, I think.  Tweed won a podcast award.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  We win those every year.  What did we win?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Round of applause.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A shiny, shiny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I'd love to win a podcast award.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A key fob.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  See all the awards in the shelf?

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Did they just do an award?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, I'm very grateful.  I appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Who's we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What we used to do.  He has a mouse in his pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  And if you aren't ready, mayhem ensues.  What's really great is if you get a phone call from somebody who's just had that happen  and they have no idea what was going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  My toilet just squirted at me.  The best part is there's two settings.  The first shows a letter W, curvy, which is your butt, with water shooting into it.  The other button shows some weird piece of anatomy that is for the front, let's say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Is it identifiable or is it obscure?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  It sort of looks like a little man.  Are you saying there's a wee-wee washer button?  There's a wee-wee washer button.  But I couldn't tell from looking at the icon.  If the icon was modeled after a male or female, I think it's a hybrid.  So it's sort of like this hermaphrodite.  It's a generic wee-wee.  It's a generic wee-wee, but it will clean your wee-wee as well.  And anyway, this is what you're in for at Tokyo.  But if you go, you have to go.  I'm excited.  It's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  Evidently, Will Smith is a big fan of these toilets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Anyway, AHN says Google's layoffs appear to be larger than previous reports.  The original reports were just some double-click duplication.  According to Web Guild, since August, hundreds of Google staff have been laid off  and the number of jobs on the chopping block could rise up to 10,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Now, what's the number on Google's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_25
Transcript:  This can't be.  Like 30,000?  They have 20,000 employees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They cannot fire half of the staff.  Half of them?  That doesn't sound right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought it was 30,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  First of all, they laid off last week all of their part-time and contract labor.  That was the first thing they did.  That's about 10,000 right there, isn't it?  That's a huge number.  No, it was a smaller number than that.  It was...  I don't remember the number, but I know it wasn't very...  It wasn't really that large.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Because they, like Microsoft and a lot of companies, do that little contract employee thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Which is smart.  I mean, that's smart just for this kind of circumstance, right?  Yeah.  But they do have a total, I'm saying 20,000 employees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But it says, according to this story, an extra 10,000 hidden as temporary workers.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And that's the one that they said they're going to just take out.  That's the one that's just going to reduce down by.  And of course, listen, everybody...  I think we get carried away with the Google concept.  I mean, Google is an advertising company.  That's it.  And I got to tell you something.  I know some people at a variety of different companies, as you do, and they're nervous.  I mean, the people that are expecting to run their companies by advertising dollars.  Don't forget, the financial industry is one of the biggest spenders of money  when it comes to online advertising.  Now, they're not...  I don't know if you noticed this, but they're not doing so well right now.  Yeah.  And the fact is that you have this situation where all of a sudden they say,  wait a minute, this company goes out.  What are we going to do about our revenue?  We have no other revenue stream.  Where else does, for the most part, where else does Google get their money from?  Of course, they get it from their search, but that's being cut down as well.  And really, the whole thing is all about the advertising.  There's no secondary opportunities for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  How many people in California stopped making phone calls on their cell phone?  Not my wife, apparently.  She's calling right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Leo, what is taking so long?  You through with Twit yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Are you still Twitting?  I'll be up in a minute, honey.  She probably got dinner upstairs.  So we're down in my basement.  Many people don't know that this whole operation is just down in my basement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's weird, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'm going to get lights on those back stairs.  I know it's a little scary going down there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  What about that musty smell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I can't.  I tried.  I can't do anything about that.  Some say a body was buried here, but I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  It's, you know, a window would be so nice.  Well, it's a basement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  There's no windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can tell you that Patrick Norton hasn't been on the show.  He feels a little uncomfortable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Maybe it's Patrick.  You know, I don't remember him leaving after that last time he was here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Ah, Patrick's dead in here somewhere.  Oh, man.  That's what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There was a little bit of a funk.  Mustiness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  So what I did was I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Isn't texting not illegal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  You can't type.  You can't do you can't be distracted while driving.  So they'll get you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Quick videoing is a little borderline.  I'm waiting.  I've done it with my camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I usually carry a camera and I'll flip it on video and I see some maniac driving across  the road and I'll video him just because I figure maybe, you know, he gets into a pile up.  I'll have a pretty cool YouTube video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You keep hoping, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Citizens arrest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Come on.  Crash.  The real Dvorak slash.  I'm trying to get members.  Dad, die, damn you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The real Dvorak.  What was that again, Jason?  Oh, yeah, the real Dvorak.  Yeah, people are on Twitter.  They should put that in there.  All right, let's do a Twitter plug to get out of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  This was also, by the way, the year of the Twitter.  There's no question about it.  Twitter was really took off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Twitter started to run my life this year and I can't get it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Are you a Twitter holic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I've been using FriendFeed a lot as a gateway.  It's because you hate Twitter.  I do hate Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We brought this up last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You don't hate Twitter.  I don't hate.  I love Twitter.  I love hate thing.  I hate the fact that they're named Twitter, which I met somebody last night at dinner  and he said, is that Twitter?  And I said, no.  You must get that a lot.  I get now there's this new site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait, back up.  What do you mean at dinner at your house?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, we invite bums in for dinner and the guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Somebody wait, let me get this straight.  Somebody came to your house and you had dinner with you and didn't know the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's my point.  My mother thinks I own Twitter.  Now there's this new site called TwitBlogs.  I don't even want to give them a plug because it's TwitBlogs.  It looks just like our logo.  It's Twitter.  Has nothing to do with Twit.  What is it?  It's a blog for Twitter users.  That's what?  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're looking at it from the wrong side.  This is giving you more publicity than they're getting from the other way around.  I think this is a positive thing.  I'm going to France.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11

We just scrambled the BitTorrent packets, if that's what you were thinking,  because that ain't right.  That ain't right.  We can use it for anything but BitTorrent, HTTP, HTTPS, and IRC.  We only block like 12 ports, 15 max.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  We're going down another rat hole I didn't mean to.  Seems like we've lost control.  These guys, I mean, there's a different game entirely.
