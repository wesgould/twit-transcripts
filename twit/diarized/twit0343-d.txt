Transcript:  So it was the original ipad announcement and they weren't streaming it  It kind of makes me mad that apple refuses to stream this they put the video out shortly thereafter  I think they're worried that something might untoward might happen and they can't control it or edit it out  in this case  Although you know, they've not you know remember that ever happened  Well, remember the big fail when steve had to kind of yell at people turn off your phones turn off your phone  They didn't edit that out of the stream. Right? So there you get so they don't cut stuff out anyways  I'm, not sure why they don't stream it. I wish they would because they let bloggers in live blog it  So what we're kind of reduced to doing in fact, it really isn't good to be in there because you can't get anything out  Except to type so what we do is we sit here and tom merritt sarah lane and I  We'll sit here 9 30 on wednesday am pacific and we'll just watch the live blogs  It's almost like one of those baseball games where you go  And he's running down right we're reenacting thirties.

They don't want me sitting there or anybody sitting there going  You know when you go to the letterman show same thing happens. Well, they got a guy out in front  They have a bunch of guys with clipboards  You're waiting in line to get your ticket. He spotted me. He said  What was amazing?

They put you away in the balcony because they don't want you to then they don't want to say hey look who's here  They there's also distracting and in fact apple also  As you well known puts in the front row puts apple employees. So there's always this  Yeah, routers  Shills they got it down. They know what they're doing  Uh ipad will it be three will it be hd?  Do we we don't even know what it'll be called is the presumption ipad 3 but I think it could be called the ipad hd  Because we will have an a retina display i'm sure I think with the iphone for us

Start time: 503.98
End time: 530.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, look at that screen that event. Look how that looks. I think it's uh, not presumed  It's not a presumption. It's an assumption to say that anybody really knows. No one knows. I mean you've got digi times  Sources in the supply chain saying it's gonna be a seven to eight inch ipad and everyone's talking about the display or the photos or whatever  Can we just say we don't know but here's a fun game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would suspect it's going to be probably not as  Grandios as everyone expects that's the jolly o'dell theory. It'll be a four because what they always do  They always over promise or they don't over promise  They let the public over promise and then they under deliver as if they're doing more than you would have expected  And so it'll be an i you know, I don't think it's gonna and I think it's gonna be called ipad 3  Since they didn't go out of the numbering scheme for the iphone and they're at up to four

Transcript:  You know, I was I when I was in college  I was writing I was a music critic for the daily tax and I wrote um a column predicting that disco was dead  And then a few months later saturday night fever came out. So i'm not really good at  Well, you're just a little early. We're just yes. Yeah, so um, I I like the the uh, the retina display or at least the double display  the 2048 display  And I like um the faster processor rumor and I like the um, I was liking the lte rumor  But i'm kind of feeling less  Uh good about that. I don't think there's going to be lte in it. I think  uh  We have a a store here in houston a new apple store that's going to open  Uh on the 16th and they moved it up from the 17th  And my suspicion is they did that so they could start selling ipad 3s on that day  So I think it's going to go on sale on the 16th gotta be it  and uh, well and  I have some sources who are pretty good  I think on this one and I would have to say that it is I I like john's port idea  There was a rumor out there about a smaller  Mini doc that the the 30-pin doc is kind of so  Uh old and clunky technology. I think apple's about due to update it so I could see that that coming as well  All right, i'm gonna tell you the answer you guys obviously the answer

Start time: 837.42
End time: 873.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have one prediction. I do have one and that is uh, if you just follow the money you will see that apple is kind of  Seeing a lot of heat no pun intended from kindle fire and all those other sub ipad  Uh tablet hybrids. I think that they are going to do something to make some sort of ipad cheaper  I don't know if it's going to be a smaller one or a down to seven inch or two  No, they'll never do a seven inch or like uh, nope. Nope  dumb version of the ipad 2 I don't even think they have to do that going to make something in the  Two to three hundred dollar range with that. That's too low. I two to three hundred three to four three

Start time: 873.12
End time: 882.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you think three to four? Yeah, because they because they're apple they can charge more  No, they're not going after the kindle, but they want to provide something that's lower cost  I think they'll take the existing ipad to reduce it to 350 to 400 dollars

Start time: 884.04
End time: 886.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a significant reduction. I still don't think it would cut into

Start time: 887.92
End time: 891.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  299 they're not trying to beat the kindle 299 is good price the people who would pay

Start time: 892.24
End time: 894.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what knocks guy thinks and I think so I think he's right

Start time: 895.06
End time: 970.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. I'm gonna tell you I like the 299. I have I have put on my steve jobs thinking cap  There will be a retina displayed. It'll be 2048 by 1536. That's 2x each way  And the reason they do that is so it scales well, that's what they did with the iphone 4  It's what they'll do with the ipad  I predict it'll be called the hd not the 3 because they want to really emphasize this hd now remember apple for a long time said  And it's on a screen that size  1024 768 fine 720p is fine. That's h they're going to completely reverse that story and say oh no  You've got to have 1080p and we've got it. They're going to push this hd  They will announce a new apple tv hd as well  And the availability of 1080p content in the itunes store across the board. That's going to be a big push for apple  So I think they'll call it the ipad hd  I do believe it'll have an 8 megapixel iphone 4s style camera in it  I'm interested to see if they put siri in it. I think they might depends on whether their siri  Servers can hold up. They haven't been doing very well lately. They will not do lte. You're absolutely right  Dwight for several reasons the international market being one  It's really not well penetrated in the u.s. And it really cuts back on battery life and  Requires a different chip than the cheap qualcomm chip that they're using so I don't think we'll see lte this time around

Start time: 971.06
End time: 994.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Except except the one the one the one but on that I know what you're gonna say verizon  The verizon also the fact that if they're gonna have 1080p  Content they may want to do lte in order to deliver that because  Lte can give you faster speeds than a lot of home broadway and connections that wire the wi-fi is connected to good point  So they that's one possibility for lte

Start time: 994.32
End time: 1022.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's also the fact that verizon said we're not going to sell any more stuff that doesn't have lte  But that might have been a little saber rattling. I don't think they turn away the eye  So, how did you combine all these i'm not done no extra ports exactly the same some can some speculation  There wouldn't be a home button. That's bs. There will always be a home button  And I predict it will be available for the exact same price as existing ipads  They'll cut the ipad to price by about 100 150 bucks  And finally and this is the this is the shocker just by the way

Start time: 1022.96
End time: 1026.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

I have a little insight of information  No, that's not a prediction then says it'll be available friday, which is actually very good news

Start time: 1057.80
End time: 1067.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  March 9th, but because that's right. That's like then a couple of days later and there's a good reason for that  They don't want to cannibalize sales of the ipad 2 for any longer than the reason they're going to wait for 10 days

Start time: 1067.76

Transcript:  You're bad man john  Keep on you smoking once you got them everybody. I want to say hello to our good friends at carbonite.com  Backup done, right? What does that mean? I say it all the time. It's very simple  In my opinion any backup solution has to be automatic  You can't have to think about it  It has to happen all the time because if it only backs up once a week on a schedule  What happens in the middle of the week when you lose everything you've lost days worth of work  Nope continuous backup. Uh, what else would I want to see? I'd want to see it encrypted so nobody can see it  Uh, also the transmission should be ssl, right? Yeah should go to the cloud not next to my computer  It's good to have it back up next to your computer  But you know if a fire flood somebody breaks and steals everything you can't have it's just sitting there  You want it somewhere safe in the cloud?  That's what carbonite does and the best of all is they do that at a really really low price  I don't think anybody can give you a better price in carbonite  Everything on your internal drive for less than five bucks a month 59 dollars a year  Uh, they also have plans for multiple drives external drives multiple computers small businesses visit carbonite.com and take a look  And then when you decide you want to give it a try there it is right there  You see they try the home free or the business free you get it free for 15 days  Which is usually enough for that first backup and  And you don't even need a credit card. You just need the offer code twit  Right there what says offer code t w i t just do that 15 days of carbonite  I like a company that believes in itself well enough to say hey try it free  We're not even going to get your credit card. Just give it a shot  And if you like it, we know you'll come back besides if you decide to buy after the two-week trial use twit again  You'll get 14 months for the price of 12. That is a very very good deal carbonite. You got to back it up to get it back  Do it right  Carbonite  Yeah, as cain says with the new eco boost engine  Cain cain's got it all mushed together in his mind  um  windows 8  first of all, um  I don't I wish I had it on this machine. Did you have you installed it on anything?  I have I put it on my machine in the other room and I have it at home  But I don't have it on a machine here  So I can't show you but if you've seen the metro interface on a windows phone if you've seen the developer preview  They released a few months ago. It looks pretty much the same big tiles looks the same no start button

Start time: 1293.60

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 1297.52
End time: 1325.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's still even in the desktop. There's no start button, but they but you can go down and hover and you could still you know  many of the features that people were used to windows 7 will  Probably be able to find there's a there's a still a run command. There's still a command line  There's a console, you know system management console all those things under the hood  But really they're focused on this tablet interface the metro interface. I know john's gonna say something  So let's let's go this way this time and let dwight start with all right. What do you think?

Start time: 1326.68
End time: 1399.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's you're right. It's very much like the developer preview and it's clearly  microsoft  um  Trying to make the the tablet environment and the desktop environment cohesive  So you could move back and forth between one and the two of them  one of the frustrating things I found about using it is that it's kind of jarring going back and forth between metro  and um  And the traditional desktop, you know  Your legacy apps have to run on the traditional desktop and they have some some interesting apps in metro  But and they do this kind of shift thing that looks a lot like the ipad when it changes apps  You know things kind of slide in front of each other and it's jarring going back and forth  Maybe as you get used to it and you use it more  um, but I you know looking at  Every day users who are loathed to change and some of them who are just now gotten used to the to the  Windows 7 changes for windows xp  I think this is going to be really hard for a lot of everyday users to to take initially unless they have a tablet  You know, the thing is is that it's so tablet oriented  You know  I want microsoft to to get us get reviewers tablets with this on it so we can see what that's really like  Yeah, you know

Start time: 1399.16
End time: 1423.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We actually did a review of windows 8 on a tablet and it was snappy  It was very responsive beautiful easy to use intuitive and that metro interface is what we've been loving about the new phones from microsoft  It's just gorgeous  Uh, and but it is very different from any windows experience that's been thrown out so far  And i'm wondering if your normal consumer is going to be able to handle it, but it's gorgeous. Well, you're windows users

Start time: 1423.58
End time: 1477.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, I am. Will you go to windows 8 when it comes out?  I mean would you if you weren't a journalist you would I will anyhow you would anyway  Yeah, not known how much it's going to cost they say this year probably late summer. We don't know for sure  Um, although it feels pretty ready. I haven't been able to crash it. I've been using it for several days now  It's been very as you say speedy snappy reliable  Um, it feels done or close to it  My concern and john i'd love to get your thought but my concern when we we had this conversation when windows 8 developer preview came out  And I agreed with you  I thought uh, you cannot make one interface to rule them all  And it's a mistake to take the tablet metaphor and put it on the desktop  I have to say after having used this consumer preview for a while i'm gonna have to modify that  I think it's not bad. I like it. In fact, why?  Uh a couple of things first of all  If you're a new user and and a lot of people are now going to come to computing from their phones, right?

Start time: 1478.06
End time: 1504.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So for those people I by the way, I dispute that comp comp you don't think so  I think people everyone's got a computer and I don't think that somebody's going to get a smartphone and say gosh  All these years. I haven't been using a computer but now that i've got this phone i'm going to get a computer  I just think it's saturated. I just don't believe that there's a whole generation growing up though  They're they've been raised with the computer since they're little kids. Well, they've been and they've been using that

Start time: 1504.44

Start time: 1521.72
End time: 1545.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can let that go  Uh, I do think that for a lot of people a tablet interface just is a better interface  I think that the tiles are going to be very intuitive for a lot of people  Those of us who use a desktop will be able to get to it. I'm not sure I agree with the way that it's confusing  Um, I think the word the better word is schizophrenic  Well, that was my initial concern  I feel like it's a little bit more unified than I thought it was going to be I feel pretty comfortable with it

Start time: 1546.06
End time: 1554.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When you hit that I would stay on the desktop. I just you know, I never very rarely go to the tiles thing  Well, there you go. So i'm fine. It gives you that option  But then i'm thinking what do I need this for with these tiles?

Start time: 1555.30
End time: 1589.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, the key the key will be what developers do with it one of the most interesting apps that's available in the in the  Market, which is all free right now  Look at the uh, usa today app  Um, that is a really cool application that takes advantage of the tiles and meshes well with media  You know, it's very photo oriented. Um, you can get to you can get to stories  The difficult thing is when you get to a story you have to scroll sideways to read it and the text is big and on a  Traditional monitor. It's kind of it's a little odd but um, it will depend on what developers end up doing

Start time: 1590.34
End time: 1595.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Let me get this straight. You have to do side to side scrolling. There's a lot of that. There's a lot

Start time: 1595.86
End time: 1618.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a lot of that but I and I agree on a mouse. It's very weird to do that  I have to say though. It's interesting  I was for instance one of the things I don't like and apple's doing this too is these new full screen apps  But I I think for most users  They don't do the multitasking that we grew up with john with a windows interface with one window open here another window open there  You know browser you yourself users are very full screen focused you yourself

End time: 1645.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But she but that wouldn't be an issue if we're all full screen. That's maybe she works lots of no no no  She no no, it's because she doesn't know their windows. She doesn't know their apps  She's she's a really good example of of the truth is that I think most users do one thing at a time. Well

Start time: 1647.24
End time: 1652.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Generally, yeah because you can't really do two things at once and so why not have a full window open?

Start time: 1652.30
End time: 1661.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's it's less confusing. It's all there. It's very intuitive very easy to use. I think that this may be  Uh, maybe actually a look at they understand they took a chance

End time: 1684.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They they said we're gonna reimagine windows and they did so the great irony here is no more windows  I mean this obviously trending in that direction. Yeah full so we go to like uh screens that are  1900 by 1080 with one big screen most most massive amount of real estate we could ever imagine and it's going to be full screens  All the time it's going to look like this. This is what I do looking. It's not idiotic

End time: 1748.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So so as i've been playing with windows 8 on a traditional desktop with a mouse  I've been thinking I would love something like the magic touch pad that large it begs for that fluid  But the problem is that no windows  Uh pc manufacturer has yet made a track pad. This is fluid as apples  And if someone can make something that is that is big like this  For use and it works as well as the magic touch pad  For a um for a windows 8 pc. I think they'd have a killer product and it would make windows 8

Transcript:  Work really well on a traditional desktop. Yeah, what i'm seeing more of oh, pardon me  No, like in the microsoft store and whatnot. I'm seeing more people focusing on here. Let's take a big glossy, uh tablet  And just hook that into a keyboard for when you need it and I think  That's another word experience is really focused on that  I think you know there's um, we were saying earlier. I believe it was my friend john noting that uh, or was it you leo saying that  taking the desktop experience to tablets to the phone and making  One os for all is kind of  Impossible, but it's such a trend. I mean google is trying to do that with um, you know chrome  Yeah, chrome and also with uh ice cream sandwich their new mobile operating system  That's supposed to work on tvs and tablets and phones and who knows maybe laptops. I had severe misgivings

Start time: 1796.92
End time: 1807.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought that's crazy. Why do that? Why not? Why not create an operating system that speaks natively and you're right  It's easier for developers and it may be easier for users who do now go from device to device  They use a phone they use a desktop

Start time: 1808.16
End time: 1823.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They might use a television well, and they go from you know, the console or gaming console to their mobile gaming device and I think  Consumers once they get used to the idea that they can do that  They'll begin to expect that so you need to have the operating system and the browsers and all that stuff ready to sync from device

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It can be unfortunately Ubuntu is moving. The irony is Ubuntu linux is moving towards his tablet interface as well  However, it's a trend there will always be  Geeky linux with multiple windows and the command line and I think that that's good  There means that for those of us who like that and want it  Who will increasingly look like old farts?  We'll be able to get that but I think the future I hate to say it because  Yes, but you say it saying I was wrong. Well, it's saying I was wrong

They ran out of pot and they're like, okay guys  I'm coming down

Transcript:  Oh says so my theory is that every other version of windows is going to be a piece of crap  And if you look at it that way for a long time 95 was good 98 actually 98 was pretty good me terrible  95 wait a minute. Okay, then vista terrible 95 was good 98 was good. So there wasn't one skipped. That's not true  They actually pre-announced windows  97 and could not release it it counts because it was so bad  No, it was 98. They couldn't get it out the door  So there was a 97 that was a turkey and 98 came out was good and then emmy was was was bad and then 2000 was good

Transcript:  I didn't even know about it. You discovered this. Oh, yeah  No, this has been discovered by somebody else apparently. Yeah, this has been floating around this piece of information  Let's microsoft delete apps from your windows. If you buy them from the app store  Microsoft has a hook supposedly then they won't deny it  The question that they really don't want to talk about is can they kiss kill the os?  And which is the one that gets where I wrote the column  But they have a kill switch which was kill switches are really cool because google uses them and apple uses them  Every mobile device has Microsoft is putting it in so they can pull  Because it could be a dangerous app and they don't want to do a big patch  You know patch two they just pull it and so next thing you know your app is missing

Start time: 2071.56

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So when the question of my mind where I wrote this column pc mag.com you can check it out  Uh the the question on my mind is what if they if they decide to really get hardcore  Which is a term that microsoft really likes to use  about piracy of the os  And just and kill it from a distance. They said it look there's no doubt in our minds that this is a bootleg version  I know they don't want to do this  Just as a general policy because they're fearful that they're going to start because they're so incompetent by the way in this level

Start time: 2121.08
End time: 2139.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, they would kill a bunch of os's that were legitimate and they'd get sued remember the windows genuine advantage program in about five  They even admitted about five percent of all it was  You know pirate air piracy messages were bogus were false positives  Yeah  So so they were so imagine five percent killing five percent of legitimate machine you kill one legitimate machine

Start time: 2140.02
End time: 2155.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got a lawsuit so they can well depends on the way the license is written  But whatever the case is I believe they've got this thing rigged so they can do whatever they want  And I who knows what you know this could come in handy or not handy or it could be a disaster who knows  But I believe there's a kill switch in there

Start time: 2155.74
End time: 2164.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think what this is symptomatic of is really that these desktop  Os's are becoming mobile os's and all the features of mobile os's are migrating to the desktop including the kill switch

Transcript:  And uh, there was a microsoft security essentials update and for around 3 000 people it zapped their chrome  And then they threw fits and then microsoft was like you've ever had your chrome zapped. I think I think it quarantined it  Totally didn't make that up. Yeah, I think you're right. It was a security essentials bug

Start time: 2202.68
End time: 2247.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or a false positive  um  I I think that for instance and i'm pretty sure to correct me if i'm wrong and the chat room will do that  Uh, they do it even when i'm not wrong  It looks like the memory management in this is also like a mobile app, you know  One of the constraints of a mobile platform is you have less memory you have less cpu  so if an app but you want to put in multitasking because frankly it's a bad idea but consumers demand it so what you do is you have a  Kind of aging process in which apps that are not used for a while just get killed  They they're released  You don't ever have to quit an app on a smartphone, right?  Because they just release them and I think and I might be wrong  But I think I noticed that happening on my windows 8. I had a camera. That's correct. It does do that. Doesn't it?

Start time: 2247.70
End time: 2262.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, in there's there's no on a lot of the apps on a lot of the metro apps. There's no obvious  There's no quit exit or quit. Yeah kill switch. I wasn't my imagination  Okay, right, right  And so you simply move on to something else and the mimp and windows itself handles when it gets turned off

Start time: 2263.04
End time: 2322.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See that's for jennifer, too  She she doesn't leave windows open because she wants them. She leaves windows open because she doesn't know  To click the little button in the corner. She's no, no she does but that doesn't on a mac  That doesn't even kill the program. It just closes a window unlike, uh, you know  This is one thing that might be a black little circle. It kills  No, this is one thing that microsoft did differently than apple and I think microsoft got it right  If when you close the last window on an app on a windows machine, it closes the app  Yeah, when you close the last window on an app on a mac nothing is the app still runs  And so she's always running apps sitting on the app some of them do close some do most of the time at the app  It's inconsistent. So I do think that the the whole notion of quitting is going away notion of windowing is going away  Um, I think apps are going to be more and more bought in app stores  Because it's more convenient and well, the only kind of app you can sell in the app store for microsoft is a metro app  So that means more and more apps will look like metro apps. This is where we're going  We're going it is a dumbing down

Start time: 2322.98

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it is but I think it's making it easier to it's giving you less control over your programs  True, you can't quit them. No, you can't and I don't know  I can imagine a day when it would be difficult to get open source software. That's not in an app store  Well, that's a very good access to

Start time: 2343.62
End time: 2360.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For instance in the apple corporate hooks all over the apple linux in the apple app store  You can't put demos you can't put betas and you can't put open source because it would violate the open source license to put it  In the app store. So there is no open source in apple's app store. I would guess the same thing will be true in microsoft  Do you know anything about that dwight?

Start time: 2362.28
End time: 2375.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I don't I don't think that um  That they allow  In the uh in the microsoft app store that they allow  Open source because of for because of the issue of a malware. I think that leaves it open the malware

Start time: 2375.62
End time: 2385.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

I said yes because every day you wait it goes down in value  Don't I mean it might be a buck might be 10 bucks. Why wait if you know you're getting an ipad 3  So this is one of the reasons gazelle  Advertises a lot this week is because they know that this is you know when the new iphone's come out the new ipads come out  That's when they are the busiest  Because people use gazelle to finance their upgrade and why not let me see i'm just going to see what my ipad 2  I have I happen to have the you know the big top of the line actually mines for ryzen 64 gig 3g  and 370 times that's  No, show my screen  Because i'm i'm i'm that's how much that's worth now. Here's the thing  That's by the way  It could be worth a little bit more because that's assuming some scratches or sign of wear if it's in perfect condition you even get more  What happens is you don't have to take your data off you send it?  To a gazelle they pay the postage in fact get a box because you're going to throw all your old gadgets as long as you're doing  This get a bunch of gadgets  Throw them in the box. They pay the postage their data experts remove your data  They of course they're checking to make sure it matches  The the condition that you said and then they will send you a check or a paypal, but this is the one I recommend the amazon gift card  It's as good as cash.

Start time: 2971.02
End time: 2999.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As more people use it that level was coming down  So we started hearing from people who were hitting it at two gigabytes, right?  Which is less than the three gigabytes that they sell now for 30 bucks same price you pay for that  So it's still unlimited they argue but it's like through a straw, right?  And suck all you want and they said I love this double box  They said it was for network management, but it's clearly trying to drive people to offer that to the tier

Start time: 3000.08

Start time: 3004.58
End time: 3030.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so what they've done now is they've gotten so much heat that they've essentially moved the bar up to three gigabytes  Which is at parity with the thirty dollar  So a dollar tiered amount so they take away the fairness issue  And people will not get there as quickly so they won't have as much screaming but it's still unlimited  But it is unlimited through a soda straw when you get past three and we talked about this last week

Start time: 3030.96
End time: 3045.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think you were here john  There's ample evidence that the that this kind of throttling does not help you with network congestion  No, not at all. So it I think it's pretty clear. I mean the evidence is clear. It's just mean-spirited. It is

Transcript:  Or say it in morse code

Start time: 3094.62
End time: 3126.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. So so verizon in the fight verizon does throttling, right?  They have the same policy. They have a top five percent policy too  But what they do is they don't invoke it until you're actually at a network tower that is congested  They can throttle you while you're connected to that or while it's congested and then when situation normalizes your speed comes back  Or if you move to a different tower, that's a good idea  That's how you manage your network not the way at&t is doing it. So but that makes perfect sense and you and it's

Start time: 3126.84

Start time: 3128.40
End time: 3162.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and it may be that that with the way at&t is doing it  Is technologically limited in other words, they can't do what verizon is doing  But what's interesting is that t-mobile?  Does almost the exact same thing at&t does but what they do is they say  We'll sell you five gigabytes and when you get to five gigabytes, we won't charge you over  But we will throttle you and they say that up front, right?  And it's different when you say it up front and say, okay, we're going to be cool about it  At&t is kind of moving to the t-mobile  Approach where they're saying up front at three your throttle
