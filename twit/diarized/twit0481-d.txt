And fortunately, we have a very accomplished panel to help us dissect it. Starting, let's see, we'll start all the way with our senior member, Philip Elmer Dewitt.  For many years, been at Fortune.com writing about technology. But he is actually one of the senior members of the tech journalist clan.  Started Time.com, started Times Technology Coverage and worked at Bult, Baranek and Newman in the early days of the internet. Philip, welcome.  Thank you. Thanks for having me. It's great to have you. And you can you probably can tell just looking at him that he's in Massachusetts.  I've got my Massachusetts shirt on. And the room is heated by a fireplace, one in every room. It is. It is. I could tell. I know. I grew up in Rhode Island. I know what these things are like.  Also from Taiwan, joining us, the man in charge of Stratecary, Ben Thompson. Always great to have Ben on. Good to have you. What time in the morning is it?  Six in the morning. Thank you for getting up early. I can't. I can't thank you enough. No worries. Happy to be here. We love having you.  And Stratecary is a great and very insightful blog about the tech industry.

Transcript:  So since we've got somebody from China, this is actually we're going to start with kind of not one of the top stories, but still an interesting story.  Mark Zuckerberg in Beijing meeting with or talking to. Who's he talking to? Chinese people, I guess. Yeah.

Start time: 254.40
End time: 269.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tsinghua University. And you just waded into it by calling it someone in China when I'm in Taiwan. Oh, God, no, he's not in China. He's in Taiwan.  See, now you're in the middle of it because now you just. Now I'm going the other way. The other half of your audience.

Start time: 269.30
End time: 277.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've swung the other way. I forgot. Yeah, you're in Taiwan, which the Taiwanese consider China. No, it's complicated.

Start time: 279.04
End time: 289.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. With the official US status anyway is that it's undetermined. So. Oh, great.  He's easiest. Easiest. Leave it. Leave it there. He's in Taiwan. That's what we really need to say.

Start time: 291.28
End time: 297.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So in the middle of this talk, he starts speaking Chinese. We did the whole thing in Chinese. 30 minutes. Yeah.

Start time: 298.34
End time: 313.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But everyone's mind like he immediately, you know, asked him to introduce himself. He started speaking Chinese. They loved it.  I switched to English and he never did. He did the whole thing in Chinese. The thing that's amazing about the Chinese people in general, my experience, I studied Chinese in college,

Start time: 314.28
End time: 321.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is you can have the most excruciating Chinese, the worst accent in the world, and then to a man will say, oh, you sound great. You sound really good. Right?

Start time: 322.28
End time: 379.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, absolutely. I mean, it was actually I thought it was very, very impressive. Let's hear. Let's hear Mark speak Chinese.  I mean, he sounds like an American speaking Chinese. He said, he said, he said, my Chinese is very terrible. And I said, that's that's not wrong.  Yeah. Basically, he has a very impressive vocabulary. But his pronunciation is very poor. He's not getting the tones. It sounds like. Right. He has no tones at all.  No tones. So they're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Like those are three different words. And he just kind of all says it just as well.  Basically, it makes sense. It sounds like someone who studies quite a bit on their own. Right. But very rarely like has a tutor or speaks to someone who actually, you know, regularly.  Can I just say it's damn impressive? No, it's amazing.

Transcript:  Here's a man who kills and dresses his own meat. Runs one of the biggest companies in the world is easily the richest person under 30. Actually, I guess he's 30 now.  But for many years, the richest person under 30. And oh, by the way, he's been studying Chinese in his sleep.

Start time: 395.30
End time: 471.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's a great time. It's incredibly impressive. And I thought people, you know, giving him especially, you know, the whole like white people want to show they're good at Chinese, giving him crap about it.  I thought it was I thought it was was what was. Yeah, I don't think it was very fair. And I think it was you're right.  I found just speaking a little bit of Chinese is everyone's. Yes, it's great. But they're also I think there's a lot of appreciation for I think particularly in China.  Again, this is they appreciate the effort. Well, it's not just that.  It's not just that. I think with the risk of wading into, you know, these sort of things, I think there's there's going to be a sense in China, you know, that like there, you know, we used to be kind of the center of the world economy, which is true.  And we've been held back in the last few years. And now, like, we're regaining a rightful place. And to have someone of Zuckerberg stature, I come to have clearly spent the time to come in and speak Chinese.  I'm certain tremendous generated a tremendous amount of goodwill. And I don't think it's going to get Facebook unblocked in China.  But, you know, I could not be more impressed and think that there was nothing but upside as far as as far as him in China goes.  And I think all the people saying is he spoke like a seven year old sound like whiny seven year old.

Start time: 473.02
End time: 480.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That ain't bad. I'd be glad to speak as a Chinese seven year old. His wife Priscilla is Chinese, but she of Chinese ancestry.

Start time: 481.58
End time: 516.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's Cantonese, actually. She's from Hong Kong, which I was surprised he mentioned that she spoke Chinese. I actually looked it up. I don't think I think she mostly speaks Cantonese, which is very different language.  It's like French to English. It's not. Yeah, it's like in the same general family, but it's definitely a different language.  But when I said his Chinese sounded like he doesn't really speak it, he more, you know, practices a lot.  But like I said, it's incredibly impressive. I think I don't think there's nothing but good, great things to say about it.  He's got book learning. Yeah, no, that's exactly what that's exactly what it sounds like.

Start time: 517.06
End time: 536.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, what impressed me was that he was cracking wise and getting big laughs.  I mean, this is a guy who was very uncomfortable on stage in his native language and that he was able to, you know, it was like he was like a comedian.  He was like doing stand up. He's much more comfortable speaking in Chinese than he is in English.

Start time: 537.68
End time: 541.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a very good point. He's come a long way in general.

Start time: 541.48
End time: 564.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But yeah, I think the other thing just in general that I think is a great example.  I mean, I think there's there's lots of people in any language, but I think it tends to be a challenge in in this culture.  That's if you're not perfect, you're not doing it exactly right.  Very fearful to kind of, you know, step out and do it.  And he he was not perfect, but he he did it.  And I thought it was awesome. So sure.

Start time: 566.32
End time: 574.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So let's listen a little more. I just want to hear a little more Mark Zuckerberg.  The audience loves and if you're making joke in another language, that's pretty good grasp of the language.

Start time: 575.00
End time: 577.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the first part of the show is very good.

Start time: 580.44
End time: 651.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somehow he sounds like the Apple iPhone stream.  No, I'm sorry. That was just a bad joke.  Speaking of China, Tim Cook went to China.  I don't think he was speaking Chinese to the vice premier.  We kind of speculated that the CEO of Apple went to China because  China or somebody somehow in China, the Great Firewall of China was blocking actually  intercepting traffic to iCloud.com along with live.com capturing the login and then passing  Chinese nationals along to iCloud, presumably to gather credentials to to the iCloud server.  This was discovered by Great Fire.org, one of the watchdog groups that monitors the Great Firewall of China.  The Chinese government immediately denied it said we're not not wasn't us.  Although it's hard to imagine who might have been able to do that.  And very next day, Tim Cook shows up in China and even the Xinhua News Agency even said to talk about telecommunications.  I doubt he was speaking Chinese at the time.

Start time: 654.20
End time: 716.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also, no, specifically to talk about security issues.  Yeah.  So, you know, the the the speculation that he flew there just because of this turns out not to be true.  He was all he's on the same board of the same university that Zuckerberg was on and he spoke to them as well.  So this was this was a pre-planned trip.  He he had a lot of the Apple things.  You know, he went to Foxconn, made an appearance there.  In Shenzhen. Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. Making iPhones as fast as they can.  He spoke about their renewed commitment to build 40 Apple stores in China, which would I guess would triple the number of stores they have now.  But, you know, the security issue is an issue.  And, you know, that he got an audience with the vice premier and that they had what politicians usually call a frank and open discussion, which means they hated each other and yelled.  It's significant, I think.  And we'll see what comes of it.

Start time: 716.78
End time: 765.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's interesting to see the picture of Tim Cook and Vice Premier Ma Kai together because it's kind of it's the same.  It reminds me very much of the same picture of Richard Nixon with Joanne Lai sitting in the big comfy chairs, stiffly acknowledging each other, tea between them.  But you've got to know that this is a very here's the picture is you got to know this is a very important market for not only for Apple, but also if Facebook could get that market for Facebook.  You may remember at the Apple event, Tim Cook spent a fairly long time standing in front of the Chinese flag, clearly a photo op talking about the iPhone entering China.  And of course, this was the iPad event.  And it is said that he was also very anxious to talk with the Chinese government about Apple Pay.

Start time: 768.40
End time: 802.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple Pay and Apple Pay seems to be he said that that was in an interview he gave on the last day he was there.  He said that was the number one thing on his agenda.  That's what he wants to get into China.  And, you know, why it wasn't there from the day from day one, we don't know.  You know, as soon as 8.1 came out, it worked in America.  But the phones went on sale in China last week and and and Apple Pay wasn't turned on.  So it's it's I'm actually not shocked.

Start time: 803.10
End time: 811.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, if if if CVS and Rite Aid won't use Apple Pay, I'm not surprised that they won't use it in China.  I mean, there's a few things around here.

Start time: 812.00
End time: 816.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, I mean, first off, China has a different payment network.  It's called Union Pay.  They already have a network.

Start time: 818.00
End time: 819.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it a tap tap to pay style network?

Start time: 820.00
End time: 842.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, I mean, like MasterCard and Visa are networks that tie banks to merchants like they're not actually like the American Express to separate markets.  This is an actual bank.  But China has an equivalent to MasterCard and Visa called Union Pay.  And there was actually a rumor before the event that Apple had signed an agreement with Union Pay.  I don't know if that's the case or not.

Start time: 842.00
End time: 847.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they would need to make a deal with the Chinese bank just as they need to make deals with banks in the U.S.

Start time: 847.06
End time: 971.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They would. And there's I'm sure there's going to be significant challenges when it comes to government approval and regulation.  And I'm it's interesting because I want to say I'm certain that this this this interception of passwords like that was a coincidence.  But if it's Tim Cook certainly did not fight an apple because this happened, you can't it's not outside the realm of possibility that the Chinese government did it right before he came to China to send a message to soften him.  I mean, it's incredibly opaque and complicated sort of environment.  But as you noted, it's one that's really critical for Apple.  The reality is, is Apple is the only Western tech company that has a future in China.  If you're a service like Facebook or anyone else, you're going to be blocked.  If you're a software provider like Microsoft was traditionally, you're always going to be pirated.  I think Apple's kind of business model where they sell hardware differentiated by their software makes them actually uniquely equipped to succeed in that economy.  Unlike pretty much any other, you know, West provider, I bet the only ones that have been successful have been other hardware manufacturers like Samsung and stuff like that.  But now they're, you know, because they're not really differentiated on the software side, they're they're struggling right now.  So Apple has a tremendous opportunity there.  It's super important to them.  But on the flip side, that actually means that Apple has a lot more risk in China.  You saw it happen with the iPhone.  To me, it's very hard to tell for sure what's happening.  To me, it was a bit of muscle flexing by the Chinese government to kind of remind Apple who's in charge.  Again, this is pure conjecture because we don't really know.  No one really can know.  But it's it's good.  It's one of the most important relationships in the entire business world, to be quite frank.  And it's going to be really fascinating to watch it and see what happens, how things change.  And and yeah, it's kind of absurd to speculate about, you know, how these weird things might be connected.  But hey, welcome to welcome to China watching.  Really fascinating.

Start time: 973.02
End time: 983.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I guess then it's no accident that that sit down with Ma Kai looks so much like detente when Richard Nixon reached out to China for the first time.  It is a business detente.

Start time: 984.31
End time: 1058.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, absolutely.  I mean, it's a and the reality is, I mean, Apple is one of a whole bunch of companies that have been impacted by the the Edward Stone revelations where the US has traditionally been very unfriendly to Chinese technological companies for reasons of suspected espionage.  So Huawei, for example, was forced to give up on the US market.  They provide telecommunications equipment.  And so what the US market is basically uncompetitive because you can only buy from from Ericsson because Huawei isn't allowed to compete in the US effectively because they're accused of providing spying for the Chinese government.  So then you come along and there's tons of examples of this.  There's the thing about like a Chinese government wanting to buy a port a few years ago or buy like an oil refinery.  And there's a big uproar in Congress.  And then this comes along and says, oh, there's the US is putting back doors in is doing all these sorts of things.  And the Chinese government, rather justifiably, is like, wait, what's going on here?  You're you're not giving our companies a fair shake.  And meanwhile, you're doing the same thing.  And so a lot of US companies have been pretty significantly impacted in China.  Microsoft's having a lot of trouble in China right now.  Chinese government forbids the use of Windows 8 one in.

Start time: 1060.06
End time: 1062.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's not just that they're under like this this amorphous antitrust.

Start time: 1064.00
End time: 1106.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're being investigated.  That's right.  And same with Qualcomm.  Qualcomm's facing like a billion dollar fine in China.  And maybe it's what it's in China.  Like you can because stuff how stuff goes down is all you're never quite sure you can always be caught on something.  And meanwhile, in Chinese and in China in general, there's this big crackdown on corruption.  There's the new premier really solidifying power or president sorry around himself.  And so there's really a lot of uncertainty in general.  And the other thing for Apple is they're very impacted by the Chinese government.  It's their it's their third biggest market.  It's well, if it's not their second already, it's going to be their first in a few years.

Start time: 1106.50
End time: 1115.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If they're going to get Apple, which is stagnating in the iPad business, for instance, they're going to find growth.  They're going to find it in developing nations.  But more even than that in China.

Start time: 1116.88
End time: 1134.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, the reality is, it's just a size thing.  People billions of dollars.  I remember when like the five C came out, they're like, oh, that's a that's a month salary in China.  And that was so misplaced because the reality is China is huge.  Over a billion people.  It has massive inequality.

Start time: 1135.20
End time: 1140.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you take if you're a one percenter in China, you're one of one hundred million.  There's plenty of them.  Right. Exactly.

Start time: 1141.10
End time: 1167.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A million to be exact.  But there's a lot of people that can afford Apple products.  In Chinese culture in particular, there's there's it's very fine and accepted to to demonstrate your wealth show on your object.  Yeah, things like that.  And so there's absolutely something where you take out an iPhone you put on the table.  That means something.  And, you know, that there's no surprise the Apple Watch, you know, the first editorial was in Chinese Vogue.

Start time: 1167.48
End time: 1204.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, you can't really cover the cover of Vogue China had the model was wearing an Apple watch.  So it's no accident then that when Apple talked about this hijack attempt, they didn't use the word China at all.  They did put out a page saying how you could use a browser that would detect certificate fraud and warn you.  Apparently, the most used browser in China does not.  Chi Hu does not.  But Chrome does.  Firefox does.  And, of course, Safari does.  So Apple doesn't mention China.  They just say just in case you probably should use a browser.  You probably should use one of these browsers.

Start time: 1206.54
End time: 1260.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, Apple has improved a lot their kind of public response.  They're not.  Well, there was a year ago, I think there was a Chinese in Shenhua.  There was a report about Apple warranty problems and reliability or something.  And Apple was their typical Apple and PR not really responding, responding, kind of being like, yeah, give me a break.  And that did not go over well.  And Apple had to do quite a bit of damage control.  And now you see when these sorts of things go up in China, they're very fast.  They're much more.  I mean, Donnie's subservient, but that's almost kind of the tone that Western companies need to take in China.  And it's obvious.  It's obvious what a priority it is for them.  And from a business perspective, very understandably so.  But it's I mean, it's definitely something to be aware of as far as a risk factor for the company.

Start time: 1260.36
End time: 1298.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I understand a company's fiduciary responsibility to make money.  Apple's a publicly held company.  This is a big market.  But there is a risk going.  There's a huge number of risks going into China, one that the Chinese would just steal your intellectual property and say thank you very much.  That's not likely.  But that's what happened to Microsoft.  The other possible the other issue is how is the rest of the world going to react to a China or to an Apple that moves into China, ignores human rights issues,  ignores how the factories are run and just says, yeah, we got a great new market.  We don't care.  Isn't there a risk?  They've already been dealing with that, right?

Start time: 1300.79

Transcript:  After that New York Times expose.

Start time: 1307.38
End time: 1335.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, but those of us here, you know, we we tacitly support that behavior in Apple because we buy their property.  You buy their product about a nine hundred and five.  That's it. Right.  So you have a nine hundred and fifty dollar iPhone six plus if you want the you know, the biggest one.  And that's great.  But in order to get that price to nine fifty, they need to have underpaid by our standards, underpaid workers.  I don't know if that's the case.

Start time: 1335.22
End time: 1349.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it probably costs them one hundred fifty two hundred dollars to make.  Isn't somebody was saying Apple's price model is you multiply it by three and add fifty bucks.  Isn't that right?  Come on.  Well, that doesn't cost them nine hundred bucks to make the iPhone six plus.  Well, the labor costs are there.

Start time: 1350.71

Start time: 1354.67
End time: 1392.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. I mean, they've got to iterate on these things.  They can't develop an iPhone and then let it sit for six years.  They've got to come out with a new one next year.  Right. And so I think if if they did move that manufacturing into the U.S.  or started paying people in in Foxconn U.S.  wages, which would be totally crazy for a lot of reasons, it would cause a lot of unrest, I think.  But but if they chose to do that, it would make all of us who complain about Apple supporting unfair labor practices happy.  And then we would also get to pay the price for that because you know that Apple is not going to eat that cost.  They're going to pass it along to us as every business does.

Start time: 1394.04
End time: 1465.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, we have an interesting case case here of Apple.  There's a lot of pressure on Apple to to build in the U.S.  and to use U.S. suppliers.  Of course, they the reason they use Asian suppliers is because that's where the good suppliers are.  And it's a very well developed network.  And, you know, everybody uses it.  Everybody's paying the same cheap labor costs.  It's the world's factory.  Right. So so I don't know if they're responding to the pressure, but they make one deal with a U.S.  supplier to supply sapphire and the whole thing blows up.  A terrible, terrible, really.  Nothing nothing went right.  The company, you know, can't deliver on the price they promised.  They go bankrupt. They sued.  They just dragged the whole thing into court.  And Apple is, you know, I'm not sure what they're doing.  They seem like they're they're doing everything they can to keep this company alive.  And then when it when it collapses, they're still trying to say, you know, trying to figure out a way to continue to work with them.  I just have the feeling that none of this would have happened if they'd been dealing with a Taiwan.  Yeah, I got to point that out.

And it wouldn't actually be that much higher in the U.S.  because, you know, the degree to which things are automated and reality is a lot of the manual labor is creating is further down the supply chain.  And it's all the suppliers and the entire, as Philip said, the entire ecosystem that goes around it.  Yeah, I mean, there's it's like, you know, back in the heyday of the U.S. auto manufacturing system, it wasn't just the auto makers in Detroit.  It was all the suppliers in Toledo and Akron and all these sort of places.  Like there's an entire ecosystem that goes into creating these things.  And that's entirely gone in the U.S. for the most part.

But the reality is, is like, and I think Steve Jobs said this at some point about like they're not coming back and the jobs are not coming back.  Right. And what that had to do with was again, not because of cost.  It was because we've lost that we've lost the ability to to compete effectively in these sorts of things.

Transcript:  And from Taiwan, Ben Thompson of Stratecary, our show today brought to you by the folks at Citrix.  The folks at Citrix who do Citrix GoToMeeting.  See how we're doing this.  I just love modern technology. It's really amazing.  Here we can do a show with people all over the world, sit around the table and gab.  Of course, we're using Skype, which means it's not working very well.  See, if we were using GoToMeeting, it would be working a lot better.  Maybe we have to think about that.  GoToMeeting is the way to to collaborate, to work together.  It's more than just video.  Of course, they have crystal clear video with their HD video conferencing.  Also, screen sharing. That's how GoToMeeting was born.  The idea that you could share a screen with somebody else all over the world.  You could collaborate. You can work together with teams, distributed as they are today.  This is an incredible solution.  All over the world, at your desk or at your iPad, it works on mobile.  It works on Mac. It works on PCs.  It saves you time. You get more work done. You travel less.  I love GoToMeeting.  Schedule meetings in advance. It's so easy to use. You can meet on the fly.  Just press a button. Start a meeting.  And by the way, I know teams all over the world who collaborate with each other through GoToMeeting.  They just leave it running.  GoToMeeting. It allows you to work smarter, more efficiently, take more control of your time and resources.  And it's free.  For the first 30 days when you visit, go to meeting.com, click the try it free button.  GoToMeeting.com, click the try it free button.  And we thank Citrix, as always, so much for their huge support.  Dave, have you purchased anything with Apple Pay? Have you tapped your phone yet?

It was literally five minutes after I did that, we started getting the emails in saying, hey, Rite Aid's going to cancel.  I'm like, no, it literally just worked and it worked perfectly.

Transcript:  Yeah, no, no, I went right down to buy some toothpaste right away.  And where did you use it?  You know, I usually go to CVS.  But because CVS wasn't part of the team, I went to Walgreens a little further away.  Doesn't say open 24 hours, not quite as nice a store.  But it worked. And then, you know, like Dave, I found out that, you know, this...  What's the name of the thing?  It's called Currency. Currency.

Start time: 1813.30

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this is a system called MCX that actually was, I believe, created by Walmart.  And will be adopted by, yes, Rite Aid, yes, CVS, wah, wah, come and go.  Never heard of some of these places.  But the idea is that... Get how this works.  Apparently, Rite Aid and CVS have shut down. They had tap to pay.  It wasn't even designed for Apple Pay.  It was designed to work with Android Wallet and other tap to pay solutions.  But the NFC... You know, what Apple is doing is not Apple only.  It's a standard Eurocard MasterCard Visa, EMV standard that is a global standard.  And so because Rite Aid and CVS already supported tap to pay, I remember I've used it at my CVS store.  Who knew it worked fine with Apple Pay until they said, whoops, we don't want it to work with Apple Pay.

Start time: 1870.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they're not just shutting down Apple Pay, right?  They're shutting it all down, which tells you how few people use it.  That's it. And show or conversely shows you how successful Apple Pay is or people predict it to be, despite the fact that it has been out.  Well, I mean, as of the time when they announced it, four days, right?  I mean, because it basically came out Monday when we were able to get 8.1.  And so it's out four days. Oh, it's it's been available.  Like you said, you could go and do this at Rite Aid. Nobody cared.  Now it's been out four days only works with the iPhone six, right?  Both of them, but only them because they have the only ones with NFC.  That's right. And there's no watch yet.  So we can't use it with the you know, the iPhone five and that.  And yet, no, no problem until Apple pays here.  And now immediately we've got to shut it down.  This is in violation. And it always has been in violation of this MCX is the company or the consortium.  I guess nobody nobody used it because nobody used it.  That's right. Yeah.

Transcript:  So you so the way it works.  And by the way, I've got a Google Wallet here on my Galaxy Note four.  And it's the same thing. You add a credit card to it.  Apple has a nice little feature where you can scan.  People said take a picture, but you're not. You're scanning the credit card.  It's it sees the number.  If it's by the way, one of my credit cards, it was it was there was so little contrast it couldn't.  But on the ones it could, it would see the number, it would see your name, it would see the expiration date.  And all you had to enter in was the security code.  It was so it's pretty easy to get a credit card into the Apple Pay wallet.  Unfortunately, a lot of banks aren't yet supporting it.  So most of my credit cards didn't work. But American Express did.  One of my master cards did.  And any Apple any card you have registered with iTunes is going to work out of the box.  You just have to have to enter in the security code.  And then it's a pretty simple process. Right, Dave?  You go tell me how it worked when it worked it right.  Oh, yeah.

Start time: 1986.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. It was I mean, I it's and this is the thing versus currency.  Right. But you go up, you take your phone, you you wave it close enough.  You could tap the little unit.  You don't have to. But you don't have to get close enough.  And suddenly the phone lights up and it shows me my default card.  And and I could pick another card if I wanted.  But but I went and set my default card and that's the one I wanted to use.  And it said just hit your touch ID and you're done.  That's real fast. 100 percent.

Transcript:  It's we have Chad the video of of Needles doing it.  Yeah, I mean, pull it up because we sent out one of our intrepid reporters,  Jeffrey Needles, to the local whole worth to buy chicken fingers.  And he did it. And so I think we have video of the process.  Now, get this while you're thinking how easy that was, especially once you've set it up.  It's really it's just putting your thumb or your finger on the touch ID.  And that's it. There's no entry here.

Start time: 2038.14

Start time: 2041.00
End time: 2126.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because even if it's off, you just touch the touch ID.  So there by pause it right there real quick or go back a little bit so we can see it.  Because this is the whole earth of it's this is Vera Vera.  What is it? Vera phone. Right. So it says AMEX Apple Pay.  It's got that universal logo, which looks like a fish dinner with just the bones left.  It's got looks like pay pass from MasterCard and Visa discovered.  All of those, if you had a pin in them would work. Right.  So anything with NFC, you would just tap it and it would work.  OK, go ahead. Let's play it because he's going to he sees the Apple Pay.  First time in the store. Yeah. I think.  What do I do? This is what do I do? It pops up.  You put your finger on it. You don't even press. And really, seconds later, you're done.  You've you've got chicken fingers. OK, get my money. Right.  So get this. And they get a little picture of pumpkins because it's whole foods and they're earthy crunchy.  So get this. This is what currency how currency would work.  So before you can go to your right, AID or CVS, by the way, this won't work till next year anyway.  But before you could go on your Wal-Mart or your right, AID or CVS, you'd have to download the appropriate app from the app store or Google Play Store.  By the way, this won't work with all credit cards, just certain debit cards and loyalty cards.  So you have no credit cards, no credit cards, in fact.

Start time: 2127.42
End time: 2131.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right. Just debit cards and loyalty cards. That was the whole point to get away from paying.

Start time: 2131.10
End time: 2149.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't want those. We don't want to give any money to MasterCard.  So then you say you go up to the crash register, they ring you up and then on the screen appears, get it doesn't work with NFC, a QR code.  So now you go into your phone and you find the app, you launch it.

Start time: 2150.44
End time: 2159.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know before you go into your phone before you can launch the app, you have to wake your phone up and unlock it.  Oh, yes, of course. That step.  I mean, there's a lot of steps here.

Start time: 2159.00
End time: 2207.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then you launch the app and you take a picture of the QR code, the phone, choose on it and goes, OK, and then sends it off to the cloud for authorization and then send.  I don't know how it gets back to the merchant now.  Does a merchant have to take a picture of a QR code on your phone?  Your phone also needs to have a data connection.  So you turn your phone around and say, oh, I got a QR code here.  And then it goes back. Five hours later, you've paid for your chicken fingers.  This is easier to write a check.  It would be easier to cash check.  But the whole point of this and this is why Wal-Mart created it is they get your address, they get your phone number, they get your purchases, they get it all, all the information and they give no money to MasterCard or Visa.

Transcript:  You know, here's the thing.  When I used Apple Pay at Rite Aid, Rite Aid, we have a wellness points account with them because it's in our best interest.  Right. We're willing to share our purchase history with them.  And then we get pretty significant discounts off of stupid things like cough drops.  Right. And so it's worth it.  And before I did my Apple Pay thing, I entered in my Rite Aid number.  So I opted in at the point of purchase as I do every time to do this.  Now, if, say, I wanted to buy something that I didn't want on our thing, I could just not opt in.  And there I am. All good.  Apple Pay or not, they're not going to get my information if I don't do that.  So Rite Aid's already got this tracking thing.  Yeah, they still got to pay MasterCard.  There are two points or whatever it is.  But it doesn't make any sense.

Transcript:  Here's a picture. Dan Fromer posted a picture of his.  He says, can't wait for the mobile payments app from the company that designed this receipt.  And this is true. You go buy one thing at CVS, you get a four foot long receipt from them with coupons,  mostly for stuff you've already purchased at CVS because they know.  So you say, Philip, this is a non-starter.

Start time: 2273.18
End time: 2388.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, a couple of things.  First of all, I think the killer feature about this Apple Pay thing is how fast the line moves.  Oh, I like that.  Yeah, because you know what it's like to wait behind people who are fishing in their wallet for their money  and then they're counting their change.  Women, for some reason, count exact change. Men never do.  Pulling out their credit cards.  You know, when you see people just sticking their phone there, making the purchase and moving on  and everybody else gets to move that much faster, that's really going to sell this service.  The other thing, the reason I say it's a non-starter and Van Juten may know more about this than I do,  but apparently Alibaba used QR codes for their payment thing in competition with UnionPay,  is that what it's called?  And it turned out to be so it's much simpler, but it turned out to be easily hacked.  And people were putting little Trojan horses.  They were redrawing, I guess, these little robot fingerprints and putting Trojan horses in  and stealing people's bank information, then stealing their money.  And the Chinese government in March halted it.  They said Alibaba couldn't use QR anymore.  So, you know, here you've got Apple Pay with the most secure payment system we have that works with a tap  and it's everybody's going to move through the line faster.  And then to have to, you know, the idea that all these companies are going to go to the back of the old QR system  that never really took off just doesn't seem like it's going to happen.  And I predict that all those two or three dozen companies that are supposedly part of this Walmart scheme  will be trying to get out of their contracts as fast as they can.

Transcript:  No, I feel just said the key thing, though, is the contract.  All these folks are signed up for the umbrella service is called MCX Merchant Exchange or something.  And they've all signed exclusivity agreements, whereas the MCX solution, the currency,  will be the only form of the sort of payment that they'll take.  And from what I understand, I haven't seen the contract, but I've talked to people who have talked to people who have seen the contract.  There are there are significant penalties for breaking this.  And so it's likely that CVS, I think there certainly is an angle where they where they and merchants in general are not happy with Apple Pay  because they do lose identifying customer data, which is very valuable.  And they do sell. I mean, people who are outraged at what Facebook and Google track.  Boy, if you ever had an idea of what what is tracked about your day to day purchases would be frankly,  frankly appalled. It's it's it's pretty incredible.  That's I that's a part that's part of it for sure.

And I think it'll be fascinating to see the sort of pressure that happens here.  To me, the big news here is kind of buried.  It's that I don't think anyone really realized that Apple Pay would just work.  I think there was an assumption that merchants would have to sign up and agree to accept Apple Pay.  But actually, it turns out if you have the hardware, it will just work because it's really a standard.

Start time: 2530.30
End time: 2551.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Exactly. And so you do need the banks.  But Apple has understood that they have a lot of leverage versus the banks because there's a little it's a little complicated.  But I think from a merchant perspective, you only use a merchant occasionally.  So, yes, maybe some people will avoid CVS and go to Walgreens.  But the reality is most people are going to go to what's close to them.  Like in the moment of decision, like convenience will win.

Start time: 2552.00

Start time: 2555.35
End time: 2652.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Exactly.  But when it comes to a bank, like if every time you can't use Apple, because your bank doesn't support it.  Like now it's impacting you so frequently that you will go to the trouble finding a new bank.  So I think there's the leverage Apple has versus the banks is a lot different than they have versus merchants,  which is why Apple's taking a skim off the banks, not off the merchants.  Right. Apple, I mean, if Apple understands anything, it's leverage.  And but and then you combine that with by October 2015, merchants need to support chip and PIN or else they, you know,  they assume a lot more risk in the transactions.  Well, all if you buy a new payment terminal today, it almost certainly has NFC just because everything will have NFC these days.  And so the implications are, again, I've been operating the assumption that Apple would not just need the hardware there,  but also merchants to to agree to take it.  That's not the case. They just need to have the appropriate hardware in place and it will work unless they turn it off.  And and, you know, there's been tons of research about, you know, if you have someone opt in,  it's basically opt in versus opt out.  Anything that's opt in is going to have much lower adoption than anything that is opt out.  And this is the case here.  And so at the end of the day, I think this is actually a great sign for for Apple in that one,  there is going to be way more merchants that support them.  I think any of us realized and to just the terrible PR bloodbath that CBS is going through right now is going to, you know,  make a lot of merchants have pause about one about turning it off for whatever reason,  because they want data or whatever.  And two is going to put a lot of pressure on this coalition because CBS isn't going to be the only one that feels the pain.

What it is, is I think what will move the needle is if retailers that use Apple Pay are actually seeing lift.  I mean, Apple's Apple's consistent argument to these sort of companies, to music companies, to movie companies,  to whatever they might be, is that you're giving up incremental sales because by making it more convenient and easier,  people will buy more often.  And you can be sure Apple will be marshaling evidence that oh, so and so you can see the keynote now next to WWDC.  Oh, ex retailer, you know, adopted Apple Pay and their sales went up X percent.

They're charging the banks, right, in order to use Apple Pay.  But that's normal for this type of thing.  Right. The banks get charged.  There's a cascade of how things work.  Because the banks pass it along to the merchant as credit card charges.

Transcript:  It's just how it works.  So when people say the banks are paying Apple Pay fees and it's not the merchants and therefore not the customers, that that sort of rings false.  I mean, of course, the merchants are going to get it.  But hopefully with both Apple Pay and and more so chip in.  Well, it's not chip in next year.  It's chip in sign here in the U.S. for October.  And but when that comes in theory, fraud costs go down and then in theory, your discount rate goes down as long as you're, you know, opting in as a merchant to the system and using it properly.  And so maybe this incremental cost of Apple Pay, which is only 15 basis points to the bank.  So it's not a huge number.  But still, you know, maybe your costs go down and maybe it's a wash and you don't really notice it in the end.  But it's certainly merchants and and therefore consumers are going to be eating these these Apple Pay fees in one way or another.  Your bank's not just going to say, oh, yeah, out of the goodness of our heart.  Still a win, though.

Start time: 2859.86

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The issue is that the fees are the same, whether you use a credit card or whether you use Apple Pay for the merchant.  Like you're paying two point nine percent in both cases.  I mean, it varies by credit card.  So no, no. But the point is like that's why I think it is valid to say that merchants aren't paying anything because they're.

Start time: 2878.02
End time: 2889.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it used to be that way with loyalty cards.  The banks ate the fees and then they decided, wait, we're not going to do this anymore.  We're going to pass. We're not just going to bake it into the discount rate.  We're going to pass it through. It's how it works.

Transcript:  Eventually, I mean, Apple, I mean, Apple is not a stupid company.  They're not going to sign these contracts with the banks and and then allow the banks to pass it on.  I would I would strongly suspect the agreements are kind of a most favored nation clause in that the banks can't charge more than their standard rate for an Apple Pay transaction.  I would be shocked. It wasn't the case.  So we'll obviously no one's going to see these contracts.  I do think it is chip and pin coming. But regardless, everyone's going to need these new new sort of terminals.  So it's going to be interesting to see how chip and pin can't come to the U.S. yet.

Start time: 2928.04
End time: 2951.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then the terminals will support it.  But the problem is we here in the U.S. will have no way of putting a pin on our card because it would require revamping the ATM system, which is why we're go to chip and sign first.  And then hopefully over time, as ATMs get their hardware revamped, we'll be able to go to chip and pin.  But in October, it's October of next year rather is is chip and sign here in the U.S.

Transcript:  And by the way, it's important to note that the reason that Wal-Mart created MCX and these merchants are doing it is not so much because they want a better payment system.  They just want to screw the credit card companies. Mike Dudas, Crote's former Wal-Mart CEO, Lee Scott.  I don't know that MCX will succeed and I don't care as long as Visa suffers.

That that is given that Apple is the number one retailer of music in the world or at least in the U.S.  That is since the start of the year, 13 to 14 percent.  Huge drop global revenue from downloads, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry fell last year, 2.1 percent.  So it's accelerating.  And it probably explains why Apple bought Beats.  Not good news for music sales in general, because musicians do not make much money from Beats or Spotify or any of these other solutions.

You would if you got into a decades long career where you really started to control your own stuff, but especially with the labels involved.  You know, for the first your first wave of whatever your contract is, you didn't make any you didn't make a penny from selling your music.  You made all of your money out there touring and like like Philip says, schlepping your equipment or perhaps paying people to schlep your equipment.  And yes, all those roadies get paid out of the band's funds, not the labels funds.  Right. But, you know, you're out there earning every dollar, you know, plan to hopefully larger and larger crowds.

Creating a CD was always, you know, trivial as far as cost go.  But there's something in consumer psychology where there's just a greater willingness to pay for a physical item than it is for digital one.  And it's not I mean, if you think about it from a very sort of pedantic sort of standpoint, there's it's actually quite rational.  I mean, because it really doesn't cost anything to create to create that.  And I think you'll see this with more and more things.  I mean, it's the way this way my business works.  It's the way any lots of these businesses work where you offer a product for free and you get and you get some small percentage of that that will pay for additional content, will pay for T shirts, will pay for concert tickets, will pay for the the vinyl boxed version.  That's that's cost one hundred dollars and has extra photos and collectibles and all these sorts of things in it.  And, you know, it's it's in some ways, I think, a return to the way music really was almost the last 50 years of of the money that was made in music or in newspapers or in lots of other these sorts of industries have been disrupted is almost an accident of history.

Also here, Philip Elmer Dewitt from Fortune dot com.  And this is a lot of fun.  We'll talk more in just a second.  Philip was in the courtroom this week when Apple and GT Sapphire perhaps made a deal.  We'll talk about that.

So I don't know if, Phillip, you think this reflects on the American tech industry or it reflects on Sapphire or it reflects on Apple?  GT Advanced was offered almost half a billion dollars by Apple alone to build Sapphire furnaces.  For some reason, this Sapphire supply was never used.  People thought Apple might use it on the iPhone 6 Plus.  Shortly after the iPhone was announced, GT went bankrupt, filed for Chapter 11 reorganization.  Because Apple apparently hadn't used its Sapphire and they owed them a lot of money on the Sapphire manufacturing plant in Arizona.  During the back and forth, some information was revealed about the contracts Apple had required of GT,  including a non-disclosure clause that had a 50 million dollar penalty for leaking any information, secret information about their relationship with Apple.  50 million dollars.  On Monday, apparently they reached an agreement, an agreement not yet approved by the court,  that GT would sell the Sapphire furnaces and whatever they got, however little, they would give to Apple and that would satisfy their debt to Apple, which was hundreds of millions of dollars.  You were in the courtroom. The judge still needs to approve this, right?

Start time: 3586.26
End time: 3678.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. And he's a tough judge. He's very skeptical.  And he basically warned Apple the week before that he'd looked at these documents that they're trying to keep secret.  And he didn't see, he was having trouble finding anything that justified the kind of security raft they were trying to put around it.  I think there's a lot of things going on here.  I think the 50 million dollar per violation of an NDA agreement may be the most interesting piece of news to come out of it.  We all knew that Apple had some magic way of keeping secrets.  Now we know.  It's not magic at all. It's 50 million dollars per violation.  And GT, here's the thing. When you file for bankruptcy, you're supposed to tell the people who you're not going to pay,  to whom you owe money and you're not going to pay it back, and the employees that you're going to lay off, you're supposed to tell them what went wrong.  That's part of the deal with bankruptcy.  And GT does a lot of things. It makes furnaces. What it was doing for Apple was something different. It was actually going to make sapphire.  It was going to go, it was not just in the, not just make the furnaces, but actually make the sapphire.  Had it not made sapphire before?  No, its business was to sell furnaces to people who made sapphire.  Oh, interesting.  Yeah. So it was really a change of their business practice.  And it turned out they weren't as good at making sapphire as they were at making the furnaces.

Start time: 3680.30
End time: 3694.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't know what happened. There were rumors that the yield rate was, once the sapphire got to the assemblies in China, that the yield rate was 25 percent.  And that might be why Apple killed it. Maybe it added significantly to the cost. We don't really know what happened.

Start time: 3694.06
End time: 3733.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, we don't. They finally did file the agreements with a lot of things X'd out.  And mostly what was X'd out was the amount, the quantity of sapphire and the prices.  And you have to think that it was a matter of money, that they couldn't deliver the sapphire of the quality they needed at the price they needed.  And it made it uneconomical to put sapphire on the iPhones. That's the assumption.  So we have these documents. The main one is something called the Squiller Declaration.  This is the COO.

Start time: 3734.70
End time: 3741.00

Start time: 3741.12
End time: 3758.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the Squiller Declaration is an affidavit by the COO of GT Advanced Technologies, who presumably knows what happened and what went wrong.  He gave this affidavit and laid it out. And Apple has been trying ever since to keep that secret, to keep it sealed up.

Start time: 3759.00

And Dow Jones has a lawyer there every day saying, wait a minute, wait a minute, we have a right to know what the story is.  And they're going to continue to fight for it. And the state of New Hampshire, this is the largest bankruptcy in the state of New Hampshire.

Transcript:  It's a Manchester company. So that's where they care.  Anyway, well, I spoke to a lawyer who knows about this stuff over the end of the week.  And she was saying that we won't know until we have a hearing where the judge actually says what his reaction is, whether he buys it,  whether the stuff that they delivered, the redacted agreements and I don't think they've released any of the squiller declaration,  whether he's whether whether enough has been revealed about what went wrong for him to approve this deal.  I think they've made a strong case that it's probably the best thing for GT.  They go back to the business of making furnaces. It's probably the best thing for Apple.  They're going to get some of their money back. They're actually a buyer of these furnaces.  They're they they want they they may be bidding on these things.  There's a lot of language in the agreement about how much Apple would have to pay or what the deal is if Apple turns out to be the company that ends up with these furnaces.  So anyway, it's a complicated mess.  And, you know, one of the one of the virtues of moving from New York to Western Massachusetts that it turns out that the courtroom where this is happening is in Springfield.  And it's a 40 minute drive from me. So I get to have some fun as a reporter.  You and the Dow Jones News Service.  Right. Those poor guys.

End time: 4088.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  None of this.  There really is a lot. There's a lot that really stinks here in my in my opinion.  I mean, the GT Advanced has in their filing, they have more assets and liabilities.  So what they had was a liquidity issue where basically they didn't have enough money to they didn't have enough free cash to pay their bills, even though technically they still had more assets and liabilities.  And that's due. That's usually due to a management error when it comes to keeping what's called working capital.  Like you should always have enough cash on the hand to pay your to pay your debts.  And and there's a lot of I mean, a lot of people I think just reading around like were thought that the contract the deal in general with Apple wasn't a great deal.  And it was that supposedly some companies turned it down before GT Advanced agreed to do it.  And meanwhile, their stock took off like a rocket.  And oh, by the way, their CEO has sold ten million dollars worth of stock in the last year.  The day before.  Yeah, it was like seven hundred thousand dollars.  But over the past year, he sold a significant amount when the year prior he hadn't sold any.  And now it almost I mean, again, there's all these details that no one knows.  I think, you know, Phil's being much more careful about it than I am.  But I mean, it's it kind of regardless of what happens, the the CEO and several other executives have profited handsomely.  And they're out of this contract that they suddenly decided was onerous that wasn't onerous a year ago.  And Apple has taken probably pennies on the dollar for what they were not just that, but they're out of the contract for a management error, which I mean, there was that was that an accident.  Like how how does this happen that you you make you make this mistake when it was presumably you knew it was coming for a while.  There's a lot that stinks here.  And I suspect that this is going to drag out for a while, whether it be through this hearing, whether it be through shareholder lawsuits or whether it be through through all kinds of stuff, because the reality is, is there's a lot of people that are out of a lot of money.  And there's no better way to generate lots of activity around finding the truth than when there's a couple of billion dollars at stake.

Transcript:  Quite late this year.  Yeah.  And I don't think that'll be delayed.  I did a little bit of research about this.  And apparently there was actually a little bit of a...  The last numbers I could find were about 2012.  There was a little bit of a glut in Sapphire production actually.  Which to me suggests that the plant...  There's lots of speculation about whether this plant,  whether the iPhone 6 was ever going to have Sapphire.  To me, this bankruptcy and the fact that they even did it  suggests that they did want to do Sapphire on the phone,  which would require a tremendous increase in capacity.  Right.  But there's plenty for watches.  Yeah, well, it's not even all the watches.  The low end, the sport watch, the $350 one, will not have Sapphire.  So it's only the more expensive watches.  And the surface area isn't that great.  And the yields are going to be better because it's a smaller...  It's smaller physically.  So I don't suspect this really having any impact on the watch,  on its timing at all.

End time: 4338.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I don't think anyone really knows how much of an impact  it's going to have on the results.  I mean, Apple is the iPhone company and will be for the first...

Start time: 4339.00
End time: 4363.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We know Apple can make and break a business.  I remember from the Steve Jobs biography that when the iPhone  first came out, they wanted a hard material for the surface.  Corning had developed Gorilla Glass, but had shuttered the plant  because there was no market for it.  Jobs found them and said, can you reopen that plant?  We think we could use this Gorilla Glass you've invented.  And of course, it's now.  I'm sure it's a huge profit center for Corning.

Start time: 4364.05
End time: 4368.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 4383.12
End time: 4392.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Jobs saw it all scratched up and said, whoa.  Surely, as I remember, shortly before launch,  I mean, like a month or two before launch,  they said we need a better material.

Start time: 4393.53
End time: 4414.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they said we upgraded it, right?  That was their marketing, which was genius.  We've upgraded a product that you don't have yet.  Yeah, that's right.  But I wonder if we'll see the same thing with the sport version.  Now, Sapphire is not cheap, but the sport watch, to me,  seems like the one that you would want Sapphire in more than any other  if you're using it while you're bouncing around and doing other things.  Yeah.

Start time: 4415.78
End time: 4436.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the minimum price we know, because Apple announced it, is $350.  And is that the sport watch?  Yeah.  Right.  With the plastic band and kind of crappy looking and the one that they could say,  the one that they could say is $350, but nobody wants.  And then the next...  I expect to be the biggest seller.  You think? Well, yeah, because who's going to spend more than $350  on such a speculative product?

Start time: 4437.63

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is going to be like five...  I mean, most people agree if it really is 24 karat gold, it's going to be $6,000.

Start time: 4448.31
End time: 4514.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If it's $6,000, I'll buy every one that I can and sell it for the gold.  There is not a single gold...  Seriously, look around at watches.  There's not a gold watch on the market for less than 10 grand.  Really?  And most of them are in the $20,000 range.  Yeah.  Whoa.  Yeah, you want like a two-tone watch, then maybe you can get into the, you know,  four to eight grand range, right?  But if you've got real gold in that thing...  Are you kidding?  No.  No.  And here's the thing.  If I buy a gold Rolex today, let's say, right, and I spend $25,000 on it,  in five years, I can sell it for that same $25,000 used, and in 10 years, I can sell it for $30,000.  Right.  Okay.  Now, I buy a...  Let's say the gold Apple Watch is five grand, and there's no way it's going to...  I'll eat these words and it'll be a great meal of crow because I'll have a gold Apple watch on while I do it.  But let's say it's five grand, which it's not going to be.  Now, two years from that day, even two years from now, and it's six...  Let's say it's three months from being released.  Two years from now, that watch is obsolete.  It's worthless.  The tech in it is old.  Zero.  Worthless.

Start time: 4539.61
End time: 4625.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No name.  So I think there's a few things going on here.  First off, I know John Grubb and I were on a podcast and kind of speculating that what  if...  Which would be shocking that the S1, which is this kind of resin, it's already this entire  system in a chip.  What if that could be upgraded?  That would kind of change the entire conversation.  Just swap the inside out.  Yeah.  Two, what I've heard kind of through the grapevine is there's a strong suspicion at a minimum  that you will be able to trade it in.  The gold one anyway.  Who knows?  This is pure speculation.  But three, again, coming back to the Chinese market in particular, there are definitely  people that will buy a gold Apple Watch because they can buy a gold Apple Watch.  Because you will wear that and it will have a lot of status attached to it.  It will be a very sort of thing where it's valuable because it's expensive.  Again, I suspect Apple's going to have some sort of program to deal with the obsolescence.  I agree.  It's going to be several grand, probably five grand or above.  And no, they're not going to sell a ton of them.  But at the same time, they're probably going to sell more than most people suspect.  I apologize.

It would do things.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Now, I'm sure there was a limited path you could walk and they knew this path, which  stands to reason.  Oh, they didn't let you touch it.  They touched it.  I got to, I did not get to wear the one that was interactive.  But you got to touch it?  But I did get to touch it.  Yes.  At time.

You know, and I'm, but really he put it on my wrist and it's important to say he put  it on my wrist, right?  I didn't put it on it.  I think it's because they wanted it tight enough for that tap engine to work.  Oh, interesting.  Yeah.

But I knew at some point I would feel these taps and two or three minutes in him.  Like this is a four minute demo that loops on the watch.  He said, how come I haven't felt it yet?  It was because I was waiting for a cell phone style buzz.  It's not that big a buzz.  It's not a buzz.  It literally feels like someone is tapping you with two fingers.  That's too creepy.  It's weird, but it's nice.  It's not jarring like a buzz is.  It's a nice touch.  It's a, it's good touch.  It's good touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I own more than I should.  But I don't, I will buy one of these because this is my job.  But in, you know, in order for the Apple watch to work, I think it's going to need to be  your daily driver.  It needs to be the one you wear 90% of the time in order for it to do all the things  that it's going to do for you, at least from a tracking and fitness thing.

End time: 4845.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't want to give up on, on all my other watches.  Right.  Right.  So yeah, Apple has a weird thing because they either need to convince watch guys like us  to give up on everything else and only wear the Apple watch.  That's one segment of the possible market.  Oh, and we have to have an iPhone 5 or later already.  Right.  Or they need to convince people that don't wear a watch to now start wearing one.  It's an interesting little twist that they've got going on.

Start time: 4910.16
End time: 5000.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's feasible.  It's big.  It looks ridiculous.  It's huge.  And the battery life is atrocious.  Yeah.  But no, to me, that's the end game here.  I mean, it's...  And the kind of key thing here is this will flow to the smallest, most personal item that's  always with you.  And I think actually in five years or so, we will actually have large phones.  We'll have iPhone pluses or Android equipment.  Isn't that funny?  We're moving in that direction.  Well, no, exactly.  Because it's better for everything except for portability.  Right.  And which leaves a great opening for a thing on your wrist.  And so we'll actually use our phones less.  The problem now is because what's on our wrist can't stand alone.  But to me, that's okay.  It's okay because everyone is already carrying a phone with them.  So it's not like making your life any more difficult to wear a watch.  It's more additive.  But then a few years down the line...  And so you have the watch in the market.  Your developer's building for it.  You have it getting better, just like the iPhone got better.  It's like Android got better.  And then in a couple years when technology has improved to the point, or battery technology  in particular has improved to the point where it's viable to have a standalone watch, you'll  happen to have the entire ecosystem there.  You'll have the UI worked out.  And you'll end up, I think, leaving your iPhone in your bag or sitting home a little more  often than you did today.

A smartphone makes sense in retrospect.  No, I predicted...  No, I have a video of me predicting this exact thing 15 years ago.  It just made sense.

If you want to get some chicken fingers, I know a place.  Our show today...  Good to have you all, by the way.  Great panel, great discussion.  Our show today brought to you by Shutterstock.com.  Let me just check, because every time I do this, I like to see how many 43,766,976 royalty-free  stock images on Shutterstock.  They added nearly 300,000 images last week.  And you might say, well, how am I going to find the image I want?  They have a great search.  I mean, it's a remarkable search.  Give me a noun.  How about donut?  We just had some delicious donuts.  Oh, there's some donuts.  Now, that's just the beginning, because now you can refine your search.  I've got donuts, but maybe I want photos or vectors or illustrations.  Do I want horizontal or vertical images?  How about the categories?  You want donuts with people?  How about only donuts with people?  In fact, how about only donuts with people 70 years or older?  How about you can, I'm not kidding, you can narrow it down.  And with that many choices, you're really great.  You can also choose the color palette.  And if you're a blogger or you have a publication, you're really going to want to make sure that  it looks great with your site.  I just am a huge fan.  They have new, they have popular, they have relevant, and they have undiscovered.  That's always the place I go at Shutterstock.com.  These are the undiscovered donuts.  People haven't found these yet.  Hidden donuts at Shutterstock.com.  They also have, if you click the footage tab, a lot of great video footage, more than 2  million royalty free stock video clips.  If you sign up for Shutterstock now, you can get free images, free video clips every week.  You don't need to give them a credit card.  See, they got music too.  Podcasters love this.  I'll tell you though, I've been noticing in the credits lately of a lot of movies, you  will see Shutterstock credited because filmmakers use Shutterstock all the time.  Bloggers, publications, it's just a great resource for horseheaded people.  Shutterstock.com, I want you to take a look, sign up for that free account so you can save  images out to your, there you go.  There was one.  There's an old man eating a donut.  I love it.  You can save those images out to your lightbox, share them with friends, all of that free.  You don't have to give them a credit card.  But if you decide you want to buy a subscription, we have the 25 image a day subscription.  It's awesome.  Do use the offer code TWIT1014 and you'll get 20% off, 20% off your image subscription  package.  That's a great deal.  Shutterstock.com, browse around, create an account.  It's free to do so.  And then if you decide to buy 20% off when you use the offer code, it's TWIT1014.  We love them.  Shutterstock.com.  By the way, somebody was looking for your podcast, Ben.  It's not called Stratechary.  That's the site, Stratechary.com.  The podcast is Exponent.  Exponent.fm, is that right?  Oh, he disappeared.  I said he could disappear if he wished.  He has a three year old who is now awake probably.  Roku, according to the Wall Street Journal Dealbook, is considering a public offering.  People briefed on the matter on Friday.  They're working with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch City Group.  It's because this new jobs act allows you to do stealth groundwork for an IPO.  They actually could be doing this already under the jobs act.  If you have less than a billion in revenue, you could file confidentially.  I think it's an interesting play given that Apple is about to, I think, explode the Apple  TV sometime next year by putting in apps, put an app store.  You already see people like HBO and now Lionsgate announcing that they're going to go direct  to customers.  I think that's fascinating too.  OK, Ben's back.  We can...  What's the podcast?  Exponent.fm, is that right?  That's right.  OK.  People were looking for it.  So a very interesting story that Lionsgate is going to consider taking not all but some  of its films along with the Tribeca Film Festival and sell them direct to consumers.  I think when you combine that with CBS's announcement, it's going to stream online, bypassing the  cable companies.  HBO says some point next year HBO Go will be something you could subscribe to without  a cable company subscription.  We're about to see a very big shift in IPTV.

Two, the stuff they sell directly is for games that are not televised otherwise.  So they're games that you can also get through NBA League pass.  If you get NBA League pass or MLB or whatever, the nationally televised games are blocked  out if you're in the US.  And the point is to protect those contracts.  And the reality is for the HBO thing, to my opinion, has been way, I do think that change  is coming, but the HBO thing has been way overplayed in my opinion.  And the reason is because HBO was already only ever making money from people that watch  HBO.  Like HBO is not part of your standard cable package.  You have to pay extra for it.  So it's a small step to go from people paying for HBO via their cable company to people  paying HBO directly.  But the fundamentals of their business model have not changed.

Transcript:  But the difference...  But HBO, like right now, Time Warner rejected news corporations' bid to take them over.  They have a lot of pressure to show growth.  So they're much more motivated to take on these sort of risks now than they were previously.  The difference with ESPN and any other cable network is ESPN makes money from every single  cable subscriber, whether or not they watch ESPN.  Which means...  So ESPN charges more than anyone.  It's like $5.50 per subscriber.  So ESPN is making money from all these people that do not watch ESPN.  That's very different than HBO.  That only makes money from people who explicitly get HBO.  And so for ESPN to change this model is to forgo much, much, much more money than HBO  is forgoing.  Got it.  And so HBO, I think, is way overplayed as an indicator.  So you're saying when ESPN goes, then pay attention.  HBO will be the last to go because they have the most at stake in the current system.  And that's why they paid out the nose for NBA.  That's why sports fees are going through the stratosphere because you see lots of people  on tour at the HBO thing.  Well, I just need sports now.  I can cut the cord.  Well, guess what?  That's the...  Everyone knows that.  Which is why sports aren't going anywhere.  You're not the only one saying that, buddy.  Exactly.  Sports is one of those things where you gotta watch live.  You gotta watch live.  People will pay for it.  They'll pay begrudgingly, but they will pay.  And that's why the fees are so high.  The fees are high.  It's not just the advertising thing, watching it live.  They're high because it's people...  People will pay for cable simply to get their sports.  And that's also why we have these great shows like AMC, for example, like The Walking Dead  or Mad Men or FX, the Americans, creating this amazing TV.  What they've realized is the best way to make money is not to get more commercials.  It's to create must-see shows where you can increase your carriage fee, that you can charge  the cable companies, which of course is passed on to us.  And all this sort of stuff, all this great TV we're getting is actually a byproduct of  this system that we all claim to hate.  But actually, if you look at it from a strictly economic perspective, it's actually a pretty  good deal.

Transcript:  Larry Page is reorganizing Google promoting Sundar Pichai pretty much to his number two  man, although Google's at great pains to say he's not a candidate for CEO.  Pichai, who originally started with Chrome.  I met him when he was pushing Chrome OS.  We had a great debate over the future of Chrome OS.  And Sundar, I'm sorry, I was wrong.  I thought there's no future.  It's a browser.  It's not an operating system.  Little did I know.  Now he has research, search, maps, Google Plus, commerce, ad products, infrastructure,  Android, Chrome and Google Apps.  Is there anything left?  There's YouTube.  That's Susan Wojcicki.  Apparently Nest will stay with Larry Page.  But basically, Page, I think, is saying you run this business.  I have some other things I want to take care of.  He says he's taking care of the bigger picture.  Nothing to say about that.  Moving on.

Start time: 5819.76
End time: 5926.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  That's the exact point.  And the issue is that relative to mobile, relative to connected devices, they own a  lot less.  Whereas their absolute numbers are still fine.  They're still a very profitable company.  And I think that this is connected to the HBO thing, actually.  I do agree with you, Leo, that there is change coming.  The tipping point is actually probably going to come more from the advertising side, where  there's all these new formats we're figuring out.  So things like Facebook, the new Facebook, the display ad in your feed, especially on  mobile, it's a very compelling ad unit.  There's the Pinterest promoted pins.  And Pinterest, I think, is a massive giant that just only hasn't even scratched the surface  of its potential.  There's advertorial type native advertising.  There's all these sorts of new advertising formats that are way more compelling than  old display ads ever were.  And as these are kind of figured out and become more effective and have all the benefits of  digital advertising, like the tracking and the targeting and things like that, you're  going to see more and more money move from television.  Because if you take the advertising industry as a whole, the search advertising is $50  billion.  That's a lot of money.  Advertising as a whole is $500 billion.  So search is only a fraction of that, which means by definition, if a lot of that $500  billion moves online, and Google still only ever has search, it's not that their business  goes away.  It's that it just becomes less important, just like Microsoft's PC business never went  away.  And so when I said peak Google, it wasn't that the business is going to decline.  It's that their relative importance in the arena that they compete in, which is advertising,  will decline.  I don't disagree with you.

Start time: 5926.12

Start time: 5932.44
End time: 6017.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not a mobile thing, though, I think.  I think the challenge for Google is there's a very, very large exception here, which is  YouTube.  Setting aside YouTube, the rest of Google, like Google is really all about the algorithm  and what and that's not just about the search results, but also about the whole the way  they serve ads, the auction system.  It's all highly automated.  It's very targeted.  And it's a great system because people go to Google, they already want to buy and Google  presents the opportunity to buy right in front of them.  It's a fantastic business.  However, the reason why there's so much more advertising at the high end of the funnel,  to use the term, is because a lot of advertising is making people aware, aware that they have  a problem, aware there's a product that fits their needs, or maybe just making them feel,  especially when it comes to things like toothpaste.  When Philip went to Walgreens to buy his toothpaste, people generally don't research toothpaste.  They don't do comparisons.  They don't do check feature checklists.  They go there and they grab a toothpaste.  They don't really think much about it.  But that choice has actually been heavily influenced by advertising.  And it's something you buy toothpaste every month, every year for your entire life.  And so there's a lot of value to these companies to create affinity for a particular brand  of toothpaste.  And this is the sort of advertising that Google and Google's properties are not as good at.  Again, YouTube is a big exception here.  And I probably didn't spend enough time on YouTube because it's a fantastic...

Transcript:  Isn't there a longer term issue that Google's got to at some point deal with that their  main source of revenue is advertising and it's mostly coming from the US and Europe.  That's what's funding Google.  Yet Google is supplying the internet to the whole world and the growth of the internet  in the whole world is not in the US and Europe.  It's not saturated.  It's in developing countries, China, India, Brazil, that isn't spending money on the kinds  of stuff that Google advertises.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  But isn't there a disconnect between what's paying for the internet and where the internet  is growing?  Isn't that a problem for Google in the long run?

Start time: 6150.58
End time: 6222.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think there's a fundamental challenge with all businesses, which is one is just  maintain the current business and two is growing.  I think what you're articulating is a challenge to Google's growth going forward.  I know Horace Dedue of Asimco has put forward a very provocative theory that it's a known  fact that Google's revenue growth correlates to the growth of internet penetration and  that's set to peak in 2015, I think.  And he wonders if Google's growth is also set to peak for the same reason.  I don't know.  It's very possible.  I guess what I...  And so, yes, that plays...  It's the same thing again, to go back something like Microsoft.  The issue is not that they were shrinking.  It's that the growth possibilities were seen to have become much more limited.  And that's what kind of limited the stock price a lot of ways.  So I think it's a reasonable thing to ask about Google.  That said, I mean, search is not going anywhere.  It, I think, will remain for a very long time the best means of direct response advertising,  which is advertising that's meant to elicit a purchase immediately.

Start time: 6223.04
End time: 6227.46

Start time: 6228.00
End time: 6283.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  And I think that's where I think they're going to have less of a foothold than people will  think.  Again, the analogy being like Microsoft with mobile.  And I think to extend the analogy, it's just because the skills and the what's needed to  win in that category is actually a lot different than what's necessary to win in direct response  advertising.  And I just think Google's not in as strong a place either from a product perspective,  like Google Plus, not Facebook, but also I think just more from a kind of a cultural  approach perspective.  And again, it doesn't make it a bad business.  It makes it an amazing business that I'm not by any means trying to sell short, but does  not necessarily mean they'll be as dominant in online advertising in five years or 10  years as they are today.  That's kind of the way the world and technology, this stuff moves a lot faster.

The problem with the web is you can track the click, right?  But nobody tracks the number of cars that crash into them as a success metric, right?  One is one too many.  It's true.

Transcript:  And we get to thank Google for that because Google was really smart.  When they came out with the whole AdSense and AdWords thing, they didn't sell people  on the results of the ad.  They sold people on wanting a report that looked good, right?  Which is how people are.  And so Google built reports that showed you everything, but focused on the one number  that Google charged you for, the click, right?  And this was brilliant.  And it sucked for us, right?  Because we were previously in the business of brand advertising and it worked.  People saw Lyft, all this stuff was there.  And then Google came in and said, hey, we can bring DR to the web.  It's like, no, this is it's better elsewhere because people, you know, the whole click  and then buy thing, tracking the success of an ad by the number of people that click on  it is so counterintuitive to the way advertising and branding and human minds work.  And yet it's what the entire business wants to look at.  And people are wrong to look at this, but it's it's total human nature to say, oh, there's  a number I can finally look at.  We've been advertising for hundreds of years and suddenly now we decide that, oh, the most  important thing is tracking the number of people that touched on my ad.  No, no.

Exactly, exactly. And.  That's it. So I use the word native ad in my article and I almost regret it because  people immediately think it's a different meaning for articles.  But what I mean is, like, I think podcast ads are a great native ad and native to the  media. You mean native to the media.  Yeah. And so people are working out or they're driving their car.

Transcript:  Go to inbox.google.com and request one.  People some of the people in our chat room have said  they've got one within a few days of asking for it.  If you get one, you get, I think, three invitations.  Don't ask me. I've already given mine to Mike Elgin and Sarah Lane.  What it does is it really lets its fast email triage.  They're basing it.  Others have done something similar.  Mailbox was the first to do this kind of swiping to  to handle a message.  And Outlook, we have to give credit to Outlook.com.  Microsoft invented the idea of sweeping your inbox.  But altogether, I am really impressed with this.  And I have a horrible inbox.  One of the worst.  So you can look.  So these are bundles or folders.  Anything I want to see here?  No, I'll sweep it. Goodbye.  If I say, oh, I want to I want to respond to this later.  I can open it and I can either pin it.  Let's sweep it over and say, I'll deal with this tomorrow.  Deal with this tomorrow.  Deal with this tomorrow.  And then sweep away the stuff I don't want.  It's really fabulous.  Really fabulous.  Mobile only.  No, it is mobile and web.  So if you go to inbox.google.com, once you've set it up with your Google  Gmail account, it will work on the web, Android and iOS.  But here's what's interesting.  It's just another interface to Gmail.  So everything you do on inbox modifies your Gmail account.  I am very impressed.

Transcript:  Yeah, I'm going to I'm in trouble.  You're in deep, my friend.  No, it is a it is a much more compelling sort of experience  and immersive sort of experience.  I don't know. It'd be interesting to see what would work from an ad  perspective in there or not. I mean, certainly, you know,  that there are there are ads in Gmail, famously so.  You haven't seen any ads in this yet.  Right. Well, of course not.  Not when they want a new product.  But one can imagine it being much more effective delivery for ads  than a traditional Gmail interface would be.  I mean, they've tested, I think, having basically emails or you have them,  I think now in your Gmail interface, like the top thing is like an ad.  It's right. It's in there.  But A, it's clear it's kind of clearly an ad and B, were it not clearly  an ad and be indistinguishable from spam. Right.  I mean, just advertising and emails are tough.

Start time: 7230.46

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have and they do this in the categories on Gmail to this promotional.  They automatically filter promotional stuff in there.  And they've been putting ads in there, by the way,  knowing that people look at it and they still have that.  I I think that that's not a bad idea.  Just acknowledge, hey, there's going to be ads in here.  I just, you know, I sweep them. Goodbye.  But I guess at some point,  hello, dot co, the Facebook killer that is going to kill Facebook  by being private has taken another big chunk of venture capital,  five and a half million dollars.  They know, of course, that that makes people worry  because anybody who invests in a website like L.O.  Dot co expects an exit at some point.  So they signed a legally binding charter.  Shackle themselves to their manifesto  that they would never sell ads or data.

Start time: 7288.26
End time: 7299.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do they enforce that if someone else?  Do they sue themselves?  I think they sue themselves.  If they sell the company and there's new management,  how's the new management bound by that?

Start time: 7299.92
End time: 7304.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's probably right. They're not.  Maybe, though, I don't know. I'd have to read the manifesto.

Start time: 7304.97
End time: 7419.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they are.  I think the way it works is they are bound by it, even under a sale.  I think that's part of it.  I mean, the bigger issue is that it's not clear  who's going to want to buy them  because they're not going to be successful.  Right.  So there.  I mean, the problem is to start a social network  is already unbelievably difficult.  I mean, there's a reason why they're so valuable  is because they're very, you know, they're...  They got some attention.  They're amazing products, but you have the whole network effect.  You have to get people on.  And the problem is because their number one priority  is not creating a social network, it's avoiding ads.  And that's a small distinction, but it matters.  And the reason it matters is because how are they going to monetize?  They're going to monetize by selling premium features.  That's what they said, yeah.  Well, by definition, like, for example, there's a conversation on Twitter,  like, is your data portable?  Well, you can pay for it.  Well, OK.  The problem is that by definition,  they are not offering the best possible product that they can  because they need to keep something back to sell.  Right.  And which makes it even harder to get new users  because there's...  It's not...  Like, it's already so hard to get users  and you're putting yourself behind the eight ball  by actually holding back features.  There's a reason why all social networks are ad-supported.  It's because they need to be super awesome  from a product perspective for anyone to even use it.  And they need to be free.  Like, there needs to be zero barrier to entry for users to get on it.  And yes, in the long run, you can argue that ads detract from user experience,  but the reality is Facebook is very highly motivated  to make it compelling to use  because they know they're adding ads to it  and making it more annoying in some ways.  Neo is to say I'm...  skeptical.  LAUGHS

What's happening on the internet is really...  Lately, and I think in our little corner of the world,  is really kind of appalling.  It's one thing to talk about, to be an absolutist,  about free speech and the importance of that  when you're in an analogue environment,  but you have a thing like Twitter where people can generate  just untold number of anonymous accounts,  and no one knows who you are and it's anonymous.  There's some very real issues, I think, that are being raised now.  I think it requires a lot of thoughtfulness.  It's been a long time talking about it on this week at Google.  The internet makes everything easy.
