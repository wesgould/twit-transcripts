It's time for twit this week in tech show where we cover the week's tech news in this case the year's tech news. It's our last show of the year. Next week it's going to be a twit best of and we like to do on our holiday episode. I always like to do something special. This week we thought this year we thought we'd bring in the OG twits. People who have been with our shows.  Practically since the very beginning Paul Thurad I hear you laughing. I feel old. You're an original gangster Paul. Just accept that. Oh gee. Windows Weekly started on this network when? I have to go look and see Windows. 2006. Oh gosh you don't deserve to be here. You're practically a youngin. It's only been 14 years. We've only recorded 700 episodes. Amazing.  Amazing Paul. Of course the hearst of Windows Weekly. Really nice to have you. You're in lower Mccungee township in Pennsylvania where you are. How many feet of snow? We only got maybe nine or 10 inches. Oh they got more in New York. Mary Jo got more. Yeah and it might rain on Christmas Eve. Oh that's awful.  Also with us I think he's the longest running twit host. Security Now started on August 2005. Steve Gibson. Old timer. Hi Steve. Hey everybody great to be with you all for this holiday episode. Yeah. From Orange County.  Where I think all the ICUs are full so Steve don't fall or stumble or anything. And the youngest member of our team the host of this week in Google since August 1st 2009. Look at that kid. 2009 why that? I'm so happy to be at the grown ups table at last. Paul can you pass the cranberry sauce please? Yep.  I should have brought you turkey or something but I figured you turkeys would be enough for this show. We're going to do this year. Every year we kind of do this. We look back at the year gone by and I think you three are actually perfect for that because between Security Now, Windows Weekly and this week in Google I think you guys cover the waterfront.  But what I've decided to do and Jason Howell helped me out. Thank you Jason. He's been he worked pulled an all nighter getting this all together. Is we just go through what I consider kind of the top 10 stories of the year and get your thoughts on it. Kicking it off with ironically I think this happened last year.  The biggest story of the year this year is the story that just broke a week ago. The hack of the Commerce Department, the Treasury Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Energy. Yes the department that controls our nuclear arsenal.  Many localities including the city of Austin Texas as many as 18,000 enterprises. The SolarWinds hack. This is a brand new story so we probably don't have all the details. I know we don't. There's a lot more to come out of this. But over the last week and a half it's really developed very rapidly.  Steve you spent Security Now talking about SolarWinds but even since Tuesday we've learned more. More importantly maybe we've learned how widespread this hack is. How bad is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well everyone is calling it the worst hack in history. Of course they're using the term in the popular press of an attack but it's much more properly described as cyber espionage. It was bad because it was clearly by design.  So it's being attributed to Russia and there are so-called indications of compromise, IOCs, which strongly suggest that they're behind it. That Russian state sponsored cyber groups are there. I'm sure there is much less publicly known than is now known in the depths of the NSA and the CIA.  The very recent news is that there are some indications that SolarWinds was not the only point of entry. That is they have found some commonality of indications of compromise on systems that did not have the SolarWinds Orion system in it.  Leading them to believe either that there was some lateral movement that was initiated through SolarWinds compromised networks or that there was some other way in that has not been determined yet.

Start time: 438.18
End time: 468.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Brian Krebs quotes sources saying it might have been VMware that was a vector, whether related to the SolarWinds DLL hack of their Orion product or not. The NSA warned way back in December 7th that VMware, we talked about this I think on Security Now, was being used to impersonate authorized users on the victim networks.  So the authentication part of VMware was being used, VMware Access and the Unity Manager.

Start time: 468.78

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I think really the takeaway, one of the themes that we often discuss on the Security Now podcast is the truth that security is porous. It's got porosity for lack of a better term. I haven't ever come up with one.  And the degree of porousness would be how hard you have to press in order to get yourself through a barrier. And so there are things that are easy to do, low hanging fruit is the common term, and things that are much more difficult.  This was a high finesse attack where presumably Russians somehow got themselves into the SolarWinds network. They got access to the source code repository that is on servers, there is source code for like this Orion IT management software.  They inserted their Trojan code, merged it in with the existing source code, knowing that the next time the SolarWinds guys made some incidental tweak to their Orion system, and then rebuilt the software, that that Trojan would be incorporated into the rebuild,  which would then automatically go out to all the Orion customers. Once upon a time, there was a page on the SolarWinds site bragging about everyone who was using their stuff, and probably it listed all of the US government agencies that they counted as proud customers.  Well, that page is gone now. So consequently, when all of these customers updated their copies of the Orion IT management software, they all acquired the Trojan. The Trojan then stayed quiet deliberately for a while, and then it reached out to a deliberately arranged local IP.  That is, the Russians also set up VPN endpoints around the world so that the Trojan wouldn't be seen making an outreach out of the country, but to somewhere local. So the point is that at every step of the way, this was not easy to do, but highly skilled hackers did it.

Start time: 627.56
End time: 643.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I read that the code they inserted, the backdoor code, was actually 4,000 lines. It was not a trivial thing. How could SolarWinds not have noticed a commit to their repository of 4,000 lines of malicious code and then just built the update?

Start time: 644.96
End time: 652.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As a fraction of the total SolarWinds code, it was still miniscule. So it was super tiny.

Start time: 653.14
End time: 659.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do we know it's Russia? Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said it was Russia. The President has notably said it's China.

Start time: 663.19
End time: 675.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Look at the map that Microsoft published and notice that the only major country on it that hasn't been hacked is Russia.  There you go. Russia and Greenland, I guess. Even countries in Africa.

Start time: 675.30
End time: 740.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The one other really important point I think to make is that we only know about this. Remember, this began the first instance had a SolarWinds security certificate signed on March 24th of 2020.  We only found out about this because about 10 days ago, the Russians made their first mistake and did something that tripped an alarm at FireEye that then caused FireEye to say, Whoa, what?  And how do people get in? And that's the only reason we know. This would still be going on. This kind of pervasive penetration into our highest levels of government networks, unless that mistake had been made, something tripped an alarm.  And they probably did all of the other things they wanted to do before they decided, well, let's go hope we can creep into FireEye and nobody will see us.

Start time: 741.06
End time: 751.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were probably looking for hacking tools that FireEye had. In fact, I think there was some evidence those were exfiltrated.  Here's the map you were talking about, Paul, from Microsoft. It's either Russia or Burkina Faso.

Start time: 753.12
End time: 755.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Madagascar is a little suspicious.

Start time: 756.52
End time: 788.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's some candidates, but there's a little purple is, I guess, where there's some outbreaks and it is pretty much everywhere.  And very notably, there's this big landmass called Russia that has not, but nor has Scandinavia.  Yeah, interesting.  I don't think the Finns are hacking our systems, though. China was hacked.  The president says it's China. Pompeo says it's Russia. Isn't it notoriously hard to source these?  Yes.  So you can't be sure, right?

Start time: 789.58
End time: 797.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's also possible to set up fakeouts where you deliberately leave some information that is elsewhere.

Start time: 798.52
End time: 815.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This happened when the North Koreans supposedly hacked Sony. The federal government said it's the North Koreans.  You and I said, well, how do you know? And they said, we know, trust us, but we're not going to tell you how we know.  And this is the same kind of thing. They're not revealing the information.  But apparently, cozy bears fingerprints are all over it.

Start time: 817.10
End time: 860.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And what's really interesting, too, is if we assume that our intelligence, you know, like we have hackers, too.  We know that, unfortunately, from the public disclosures that we've had a lot of time discussing.  It's interesting that our penetrations into Russian networks apparently did not pick up the fact that they had penetrated ours.  That is, they're clearly keeping their cyber espionage deliberately separate from the rest of Russia.  Otherwise, we would have seen because it would have appeared in their networks, stuff that they shouldn't have from ours.  And that would have raised the alarm, too. But that didn't happen.

Start time: 860.64
End time: 876.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's it's like the enigma. When we cracked the enigma machine, the British had to be very careful about the use of that intelligence,  because that would have told the Nazis we knew their codes and we were able to break it.  So presumably, the Russians have the same limitations on what they could do with the intelligence that they gain.

Start time: 877.76
End time: 892.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So, Steve, I'm delighted to be here with the expert of experts.  How does the forensic analysis of what's been compromised work?  How do you ever really know what has been seen? Is there any way to know that?

Start time: 893.54
End time: 940.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. Well, OK, maybe, but not necessarily.  One of the things these guys have done is they've and even the non experts are repeating what the experts are saying,  which is these these hackers have demonstrated the highest level of skill.  So which is to say, you know, they're as good as anybody.  And it is notoriously possible to cover your tracks.  Sometimes backup snapshots from like will capture old logs.  Right now, you can imagine that there is scrambling going on retroactively looking at like for traces that weren't appreciated at the time.

Start time: 941.12
End time: 988.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's rumors. There were stories that we there were rumblings about this back in October.  You know, they got in in March, we think there were there were signs in October, but it wasn't until FireEye got hacked that we were sure.  So part of the problem is that these guys have been have had six or seven months to just wander around unobserved.  They could have exfiltrated stuff. They've been able to cover their tracks.  And I think even there's even a larger issue of what other payloads have they injected in some.  There's 18000 potential sites, right? Each right with millions of endpoints.  This is going to be almost impossible. It's like cockroaches.  You can't you can't eradicate it. Right.

Start time: 990.04
End time: 1015.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so to answer Jeff's question, you know, the the the famous hacker approach is you get into a system, you do a bunch of things, then you delete your own.  You delete the logs that demonstrate what it was you just did and hopefully get out undetected so that even somebody who's looking at the log says, yeah, look, there's nothing here.  Nothing happened because it is all digital and it is all digital forensics.

Start time: 1016.90
End time: 1021.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it's not backed up. So you don't you don't offload your logs.  So you have a you might you might.

Start time: 1023.36
End time: 1040.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right. So it might be that a snapshot of a server in the past would be able to show something.  I mean, it's a it is, you know, you can imagine a lot of people's Christmas holidays, a lot of IP IT Christmas holidays just got wrecked.

Start time: 1041.60
End time: 1060.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's is, you know, and if with the Sony hack, they exfiltrated, they downloaded movies, you know, terabytes worth of data.  So I guess you might see unusual traffic.  But it sounds like these guys were pretty were so savvy that if they did anything, they did it very carefully and probably were able to obfuscate.

Start time: 1061.32
End time: 1096.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You really want to be surgical because they recognize they had they managed to establish an incredible advantage.  So the last thing they would want to do, for example, is to shoot terabytes of data out of some network connection.  That's the kind of thing that would immediately trigger alarms.  And, you know, we do have cyber intrusion stuff.  And it's, you know, Einstein is the system that we've heard of that our federal government uses specifically to keep this from happening.  And it just, you know, the Russians know about it.  And so they said, OK, let's, you know, not trip Einstein up.

Start time: 1096.82
End time: 1152.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the other problem is that it's notoriously difficult to catch what are called supply chain hacks.  So true or not, there was that Bloomberg story last year or two years ago, I guess now about the super micro motherboards that had rice kernel size chips added to them in this as it went down the supply chain to put spy devices on there.  Never found any proof of that.  Bloomberg never retracted it.  We really will never know what the truth is there.  But but that was a warning at the time.  You've got to be careful about your supply chain.  You cannot assume that those updates coming from this, you know, signed updates coming from a trusted security company are legit.  And I do hope this becomes a warning to be more careful.  But everybody I've seen talking about this says this is really hard.  A supply chain hack is about the hardest to do.

Start time: 1153.06
End time: 1157.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Was the Huawei paranoia legit or politics?

Start time: 1160.30
End time: 1198.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Steve, I have no firsthand knowledge.  Yeah, and I'm I know it's again to Leo's point about that motherboard hack.  Even if it didn't happen, we know it could happen.  You know, there have been proof of concepts.  You can bury a little microprocessor in the net in the LAN network connector now so that you don't even know it's under the little metal shell that protects it from RF radiation.  And you just you look at it looks just fine.  But there's something squirreled away in there.  I mean, this is the world we're in today.

Start time: 1198.62
End time: 1255.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's nobody that makes all their own hardware and software.  So everybody has a supply chain.  They have external suppliers.  And I guess to some degree, you need to trust them.  Although Google has been promoting this zero knowledge architecture where you trust no one inside or outside the perimeter.  But I don't you know, the the the GSA had done a survey a couple of months ago because they were concerned about this.  This is not really a surprise to some.  And they found that government agencies had done very few, if any of the proactive protections that the GSA had recommended.  These these guys not only were not doing zero knowledge architectures, they weren't even checking for malware.  They were just assuming the best.  And so we were wide open to this.  Now, the question is, maybe I don't know if anybody knows this, but are we doing the same thing to them?  And if not, why not?

Start time: 1260.90
End time: 1315.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Given given the Snowden leaks and the WikiLeaks revelations, we we we really got a surprise with clear evidence of the extent to which our intelligence agencies have very actively developed espionage capabilities.  So and that was some time ago.  So it's hard to imagine that we're not every bit as good as they are.  And that in fact, it's secondhand.  But I heard someone say that Michael Hayden was asked about about this whole issue of cyber espionage.  And and he said former director of the NSA.  Right.  Right. He said, we are so deep into Russians networks.  I'm just hoping they're not as deeply into ours.

Start time: 1316.87
End time: 1327.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is that braggadocio?  Or do you believe maybe impressions?  And yeah, and Michael is a fan of this network, by the way.  Oh, really?  We are.

Start time: 1328.08
End time: 1410.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you know that we have to be nicer to him.  We've said some mean things about him, I believe, Steve.  So  No, that's I think that that's the problem is that cyber.  This is the new form of warfare, right?  It's not conventional warfare.  It's not nuclear weapons.  It's not armies marching and invading other countries.  It's cyber warfare.  And perhaps the saving grace is there has just as there was with nuclear warfare,  there has to be some notion of mutually assured destruction.  That's what kept us from destroying the planet was the knowledge that it well,  if you fire nukes at us, we're going to fire nukes back at you and there'll be nothing left.  If we are doing the same thing to them,  maybe that's the only thing that's keeping them from doing things like that.  You know, I have to presume if they're that deep inside our networks,  they could screw with our financial markets, for instance, or the electrical grid.  Right, Steve?  They may have capability.  We've seen that they've been in the electrical grid for some years.  They did a trial power outage in the Ukraine, in Ukraine, I'm sorry,  I know the in Ukraine a couple of years ago.  And we think that that was a test of capabilities.  It may be the only thing keeping them from doing these kinds of acts of war is that we could do the same thing back.  Yeah, I hope.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We see evidence that we discuss every week on the podcast of individual hackers who are really gifted.  So I wouldn't say it's impossible for it to not be a nation state.  You could imagine that there was some desire to to sell this as requiring the elitist of the elite,  just so there isn't a sense of like, oh, yeah, you know, anybody could have done this.  It's like we have a guy in New Jersey basement.  We don't want to think that.

Start time: 1463.34
End time: 1506.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there is a kind of a Pareto principle that most of the hacks,  80 or 90 percent of the hacks are performed by script kiddies who really don't have lead skills.  But no matter what they say, they're running scripts they got from elsewhere.  We've talked on the show about ransomware as a service.  There are a number of companies, I guess you call them companies that offer ransomware service that you could subscribe to.  There are a number of companies that offer DDoS attacks as a service.  And so there are a lot of little low level script kiddies around using this stuff.  I guess there are enough elite hackers around that any country that has the wants to could hire enough of them to be a threat.  Right.  Yeah.

Start time: 1507.79
End time: 1542.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the other problem is the inside man problem.  We don't know, for example, that it wasn't a programmer at SolarWinds.  And I'm just making this up.  I have no evidence of this.  But who is in serious financial trouble due to gambling and was approached by someone who said,  Look, you know, you're really in trouble.  We've got plenty of cash.  So we need you to add this module and we'll solve your problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Couple of months ago in October, you and I and Bruce Schneier and last passes CISO Jerry Bukele did a really great along along with red versus blue attack panel.  Actually, you weren't on that one, Steve.  It was no father Robert and Cheebert where they attacked.  They defended. And really, I think Schneier had that kind of the seminal quote from that event, which you should all watch if you haven't seen it, which is there is no such thing as perfect security.  You can layer it. You could do the best you can.  But ultimately, nobody is impervious, especially if the attacker has unlimited limitless resources and limitless desire to get in.  Would you say that's fair, Steve?

Start time: 1585.92
End time: 1597.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's absolutely right, which is why I use the term porous.  It's there is no wall, which is impenetrable.  It's just varying degrees of effort required to penetrate.

Start time: 1597.52
End time: 1623.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So at this point, I feel like it's no longer almost not a tech story anymore.  At this point, it's a political story because the next stage is is is diplomatic is political is our government and their government coming to some sort of detente.  We've got the weapons. You've got the weapons.  I don't think there's a technical solution to this.  They're in there. They're going to be in there forever.  I don't think you could ever say with any certainty they've been eradicated from the networks.

Start time: 1624.40
End time: 1668.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yes. And it's you know, we know of a growing number of high profile government entities which have been penetrated because we do have really good people there who are now able to look in and go, oh, shoot.  But what we know that eighteen thousand somethings downloaded the update and that that update then did a phone home within a couple of weeks of being downloaded.  So within those eighteen thousand, there are thousands of smaller organizations that are like, oh, do we have anything here?  Oh, we turned our logs off. Well, we don't really know.  But probably not. Everything seems fine.

Transcript:  It's going to be a fun twenty twenty one on security.  I want to move on. It really is funny because that is a story we would have been doing on any twit.  This is probably the biggest tech story of the year.  So we brought it up here and it's a developing story and it's fresh.  And I think next year we'll be spending time talking about this.  I might imagine we will continue. It's not going to be the Steve Gibson show that we have other other topics.  Paul Thurotte, it's great to have you.  Jeff Jarvis and Steve Gibson.

Transcript:  No, none of that will happen.  We're going to talk about some of the other the top 10 stories of 2020 as we continue.  Ironically, the number one story, I think clearly of 2020 is this solar wind story.  But we have more to talk about in just a sec.  Our show today brought to you by ExpressVPN.  You may not be able to prevent a supply chain attack,  but you probably can prevent the spying from your Internet service provider.  Logging the sites you visit, the searches you make.  A lot of people say when we talk about privacy, hey, if you got nothing to hide, I got nothing to hide.  No big deal.  But I bet those same people close the bathroom door behind them.  You don't want random passersby checking in on you.  So why would you let people look in on you while you go online?  ExpressVPN protects your privacy, protects your security, and it does it better than anyone else.  You know, I think by now, anybody who's listened to our shows knows they want a VPN both at home and abroad.  But the question is which VPN?  Because really, you've got to trust the VPN.  And that's why I recommend and use ExpressVPN.  First of all, they are thoroughly audited.  They use PricewaterhouseCoopers.  They vetted their privacy policy and they said, yep, ExpressVPN does not log.  That's exactly right.  They even vetted the trusted server technology that ExpressVPN uses.  They're so committed to not tracking you that when you use an ExpressVPN server, it spins up in RAM just for you.  It's dedicated to you.  You use it as soon as you leave.  It goes, you know, goes away.  Cannot write to the hard drive.  It's sandboxed.  So they couldn't log if they wanted to.  And by the way, PricewaterhouseCoopers verified that that does work exactly as stated.  ExpressVPN is fast, fast enough that you can use it to watch Netflix in the UK, even if you're in the US.  It's secure and it's totally private.  That's why I use it.  It's also very affordable.  ExpressVPN is the number one rated VPN according to CNET, according to Wired, according to The Verge.  They trust it. I trust it.  Roughly seven bucks a month.  Now you might say, well, I can get a free VPN.  Yeah, good luck, because if you're not paying for the VPN, they're paying for it somehow.  So I would suggest you want to pay a reasonable amount for the VPN.  I think that's very, very fair.  If you're like me and you believe your online activity is your business, you should secure yourself by visiting expressvpn.com slash twit today.  We got a special deal for you.  Fifteen months for the price of twelve.  When you go to e-x-p-r-e-s-s vpn.com slash twit.  Three extra months free.  Expressvpn.com slash twit.  I trust them.  And I think that's really the most important thing.  They're a good company.  And we thank them so much for supporting us all through 2020.  We're talking about the top 10 stories of 2020.  It's not a tech story exactly, except that there are tech elements to it.  Of course, COVID-19.  It's so funny.  I was thinking back.  It was you and me, Paul.  We're talking about CES.  That seems like a hundred years ago.  Back in January.  Different world.  It really does.  It was a different world.  Did you?  You didn't go to...  None of you went to CES this year.  I did.  And I feel like I...  Boy, super spreader.  I could have dodged one.  I did dodge one.  Yeah.  In fact, it could have been a really bad thing.  We knew that some people at CES did have COVID-19, but it did not...

Transcript:  That's when we knew it was serious.  Apple started shutting down its stores in China.  Ironically, here we are almost a year later, and Apple is once again closing down all its  California stores.  The Tokyo Olympics was called off.  Tony Awards called off.  Burning Man, Burning Man, called off.  But in a way...  South by Southwest, very last minute.  South by, that was a big deal, right?  Because South by did not want to cancel in Austin.  That's in April in Austin.  And I think Austin said, no, you better cancel.  But this was a huge economic hit to the city of Austin.  Lots of people come to town, stay in hotels.  They're all booked up.  Restaurants are booked up.  It's not just the tech festival, the interactive festival.  It's also the music and film festival.  That was a huge loss to Austin.  But again, it all seems so long ago, the distant past now, because it just got worse and worse  and worse and worse.  And yet coronavirus, COVID-19 was kind of a boon for some companies.  The richest people in America made more money.

Wow.  And they do.  And top experts, whom I trust immensely, go on there.  And so today, there was a controversy where various privileged white male journalist arm  chair epidemiologists were criticizing CDC proposals for who should go next.  And Dr. Greg Konsalvis, who's a top Yale epidemiologist, comes on and says why they're wrong and how  with a lot of snark, too, which I enjoy.  I'm looking for what's happening in the UK with the variants now in the genome of the  virus, and is it really a problem or not?  I go immediately my Twitter list and there's a woman named Emma Hodcroft, who's been studying  this out of Switzerland, who's brilliant about it, who says, well, here's what we know and  here's what we don't know.

We talked about for a long time, the decommissioned nuclear missile silos that people had turned  into escape pods, little small underground apartment complexes that you'd pay millions  of dollars to get into that would have their own private guard service.  And I think there were some people who actually moved to these silos.  Where is Peter Thiel these days?  Yeah.  But I think they're out of there by now.

Transcript:  Vermont's a little chilly right now.  I prefer Barbados.  It's also a little safe.  One of the things, though, that did definitely happen because of the virus is that the social  contract kind of fractured.  And the fault lines that have been here all along really showed up.  The difference between the haves and the have-nots, the kids who had fast internet and had laptop  computers, and the kids who were forced to take beat up old Android devices to the Taco  Bell parking lot to use their free Wi-Fi so that they could go to school.  That became very clear.  And I'm hoping that the result of that will be that we'll do something about it instead  of just muddle through until it's over and then go back to the same old, same old.

Transcript:  You know, Leo, it strikes me that the latest cruel paradox is that, as we all know now,  too late, African Americans, people of color, Latinos are the worst hit by this pandemic.  Yet when it comes time to stand in line for the vaccine, when maybe the political will  would finally give them the first shot, of course, having been so distrustful for a good  reason, they're going to lose out again.  And it's a terrible paradox, I think.  The systemic racism just hits you from every which way.

And it continued into the 70s.  And so as a result, I think a lot of blacks and other people of color are very reluctant  to trust public health when maybe now is the time to do it.  If there's anything good that came out of it, you could say Quibi, the failure of Quibi.  Quibi was an attempt.  It will be a punchline for a long time, won't it?  It's like, just say it, Quibi.

There was, remember the article saying New York is over.  People were leaving the city and never going to come back.  Not true, is it Mr. New Yorker?  Wait a minute, you're living in the burbs.  You're living in New Jersey.  I know, listen to me.  I'm out here in the woods.  Yeah.  But I think it's clear that the world will be different when we come out of this, whenever  we come out of this.  I wonder if people will move back to San Francisco and New York City or if these exoduses are  permanent and the beginning of something even larger.  But more than cities, isn't it offices?

Transcript:  One of the things that we talk about on Security Now often is the great power of inertia.  And I think if nothing else, this shook things and forced people to see whether they could,  for example, need to go into spend hours a day on the freeway commuting to go to the  office, or if they couldn't get the job done at home.  And so before this horrible pandemic, people were doing things that they had always been  doing for a long time.  In some cases, retailers were still in business just because they had been in business the  year before and the year before that.  But there wasn't any real reason for them to remain in business except inertia.  So this is sort of shaken everything.  It'll be interesting to see it as you say, Leo.  My guess is we will not be returning to where we were.  We'll be returning to where we where we need to be after the pressure to change has been  lifted.  We'll be somewhere else and actually probably better.

Transcript:  Certainly the big tech leapt into the fray by April.  Apple and Google announced an API for COVID tracking that they were going to build into  iOS and Android.  A few months later, it did in fact ship.  Initially, they said it'll be designed to support the apps that government and health  officials might want to make for COVID tracking.  But now, at least in some places here in California, the Apple system works without an app.  But I put works in air quotes because it doesn't seem to do anything at all as far as I know.  I can tell.  And a lot of people were very suspicious of Apple and Google and the idea that they might  put tracking into a phone.  Do you think that big tech is using or has used COVID as an excuse to enhance their or  government, for that matter, enhance the tracking of people to spy more?  And do you think that will go back to normal after it's over?  Or will they say now that they're in the phones, oh, good, we're going to stay here?  There's definitely been concern among some people.  I know, Jeff, you probably.  They've done a crappy job of it so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can't work.  Right.  And I guess my feeling is that the technology is now in iOS and Android.  And it may be good for us to have it for next time.  Because all of the people who know this stuff are looking at the intervals between these  massive epidemic outbreaks and are noticing that the intervals are decreasing.  These are happening more frequently.  We keep hearing this will not be the last one.  So I think if nothing else, you know, this has proven to be horrible, but not, you know,  the end of humankind.  We'd like to prevent the end of humankind.  So I would say we're in far better condition for preparedness next time.  This all got everybody's attention.  The fact that you got to wear a mask wherever you go outside and even among your own family  members, that's a wake up call.

Transcript:  The other, I think, big technology story around COVID is the mRNA vaccines.  These are very advanced, high tech vaccines.  In fact, I think a number of AIs were early on assigned the project of figuring out how to create a synthetic vaccine  against COVID-19. And it worked.  It worked.  Anybody want to address that?  I know none of you are biotech guys.  But this is a great.

Where there was AI, there was data, there was preparation, but it was also easier to put together the tests.  The actual testing was still to spec from everything I can see.  But everything else got truncated around it.

Start time: 3017.48
End time: 3146.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, also, the fact that it really didn't happen quickly.  It took more than a decade because the vaccines that we're using now from Moderna and Pfizer are based on vaccines for the original SARS epidemic that were created in the early 2000s.  This was a technology that they've been working on ever since.  So in a way, we're kind of lucked out that SARS happened, which is a very closely related virus.  And the mRNA vaccines development began then.  In fact, credit to the researcher who came up with the notion and was demoted at her university because they said, oh, that'll never work.  I'm going to see if I can find her name.  Because here it is.  This is from Stat.  The story of mRNA, how a once dismissed idea became a leading technology in the COVID vaccine race.  Both vaccines come from research that was done many years ago.  Let me see if I can find her name.  Kathleen Carrico spent the 90s collecting rejections.  Her work attempting to harness the power of messenger RNA to fight disease was too far fetched for government grants, corporate funding, even support from her own colleagues.  She did not give up, even though after six years in the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania, she was demoted in 1995.  She'd been on the path to full professorship, but with no money coming in to support her work on mRNA, her bosses saw no point in pressing on.  She was back to the lower rungs of the scientific academy.  She kept working on it.  And in fact, it was her research that eventually made its way to Pfizer and Moderna.  The key discovery, Carrico and Weissman figured out if you incorporate modified nucleosides into mRNA, you can kill two birds with one stone.  That research paper came out in 2005, so she'd been working on it for 25 years.

But yes, as always, there was some researcher in a closet somewhere at the University of Pennsylvania had been working on it since 1995.  But again, that's technology, that's science, and it's pretty amazing.  There was early on a lot of news about, of course, Black Lives Matter and the death of George Floyd was this year.  And the protests in Minnesota, violent protests.  According to Boy Genius Report, Minnesota was using contact tracing to track protesters as the Minnesota protests escalated.

Work from home.  Certainly because of COVID, we learned how to work from home, and that might end up being good news.  That might change the way we think of work.  Certainly for us at Twit, we sent all our employees home late February, early March.  They haven't come back except for the absolutely essential engineers who have to push the buttons and run the machinery.  And that's worked out all right.  It's not been perfect.

Some people won't.  I think, like Steve said, the future is going to look different.  But it's going to be a hybrid work world, I think.

So they wanted to be out on the street and we teach them to go and show up and be with people.  And then we say, no, don't show up.  Maybe not.  Stay home.  Yeah.  You know, for having helped start a program in social journalism, this is its time because finding people online and connecting with them through social media, that's what you have to do.  So they leave with a greater expertise in that.  So I've told them all they had some rough times.  They had some tender moments.  But I've told them all they're going to end up just being so darn resilient from this that they're going to be able to face lots of things in life.

And his view of this coming NBA season is that they're going to start the season with  empty stadiums and that there's going to be some kind of inflection point in March or  April and they'll be able to start letting people back in.  And he's not saying they'll be full exactly, but by the time the season ends, probably  mid-summer next year, we're going to be approaching normal between vaccinations and whatever else.

There were people who didn't believe this was real.  And what happens is-  Oddly there still are and I don't understand what world they're living in.  When people you know die from this or you're impacted by it, all of a sudden the switch  flips and I think, I mean, unfortunately, because of the way things are going, more  and more people are being impacted and it's become apparent, I think to at least a large  segment of the population that this is an applaud against the president.  It's not a China thing.  You know, it's real.  It's a pandemic.  You know, it shouldn't be going to a gym not wearing a mask.  Just a thought.

What we're learning is that this thing leaves people worse off often than they were before.  It's not like a common cold that you get over and you're fine.  There can be, you know, they call it long hauler syndrome, lots of weird things that  it does to you.  So, you know, at this point where we have a vaccine probably a few months away, especially  the O.G. group who may have some priority over the youngsters.  It really does make sense not to get it and to get vaccinated.

We're covering the top 10 stories of tech stories of 2021, although already you can  see the intersection between real life and technology.  In some ways, that's kind of the big story is that what was 10 years ago when we first,  the three of us started working and doing shows on Twitter was really kind of a, you  know, a subculture.  Technology is now mainstream in every possible way.  It impacts everything.  And the biggest stories of the day are tech stories as much as anything else.

Well, we have something in common.  We've reached a taunt.  Jeff says, if you stop bringing it up, I won't yell at you.  I said, okay, fine.  Fine.  No.  Well, we'll do your commercial.  I got some Facebook stories coming up in a little bit.  Our show today brought to you literally, quite literally by Cashfly.  All year long, Cashfly has been our content delivery network.  I remember in the early days back when Steve Gibson had hair and Paul Therot wasn't quite  so gray and Jeff looked exactly the same.  We were trying to distribute this by web downloads.  I remember going to people saying, please seed our BitTorrent so more people can listen  to the show.  That's when Matt Levine at Cashfly called me and said, Leo, can we help?  This is ridiculous.  I at the time didn't really know what a CDN did, but boy, was I glad to find out.  Cashfly has servers all over the world, servers that will cash your content, bringing it closer  to your end users, whether it's a podcast like ours or a game, a video stream, a software.  And by doing that, it's five times faster.  It's more reliable.  In fact, Cashfly has a 100% uptime SLA guarantee and industry leading global performance.  And that's really benefited us.  We are big fans of Cashfly.  Early on, we discovered something Cashfly now is offering everybody.  They call it SOS, Storage Optimization System.  The issue with a CDN is it's great once your content is cached on their servers all over  the world.  But the first time somebody requests your download from their local server, it has to  go out to your origins.  In our case, it was S3 or wherever it is, get it, then put it on the server and then  offer it to the customer, which means it's going to be slow.  It's going to cost you money because you're going to have origin traffic.  You're suddenly reliant on the public internet.  What you don't want is a cache miss.  That's what SOS does.  It guarantees no cache misses, which increases download speeds, eliminates buffering and  can save you a lot of money and data transfer out fees.  We've been using it, it turns out, for years.  We've stored our content on Cashfly.  The first thing we do when we upload a podcast, we upload it to Cashfly so that when their  caching servers, their points of presence need the content, they get it directly from  Cashfly itself through their own peering, which means five times faster than the origin,  hyper fast downloads, low latency, highly scalable.  That's good news.  Now you can do it too.  SOS is available to everybody.  But the other good news is Cashfly is expanding rapidly.  They just added six new points of presence, POPs, in South America.  What's great is they're serving 10 times the traffic in Latin America over the last year.  And not only have they maintained, but they've drastically improved their performance in  the region while taking on a much higher traffic load.  This is why I love Cashfly.  We have listeners all over the world, wherever your end users are, North America, Latin America,  the Caribbean, Europe, the Middle East, Asia Pacific, your content will be delivered quickly  and reliably with 100% uptime.  They guarantee it.  So check out Cashfly.  Cashfly is giving away a complimentary detailed analysis of your current CDN bill and usage  trends.  Chances are you're spending 20% more than you have to.  Twit.cashfly.com.  Bring your CDN bill or your usage trends.  See how much Cashfly can save.  See how much better Cashfly can be.  And by the way, thanks to Cashfly during this crisis, they've been helping the World Central  Kitchen deliver warm meals.  They've donated over $50,000 to serve 300,000 warm meals to people who are struggling.  Cashfly is a great company, great people, and they've done so much for us to get rid  of the pain of getting our content out to you.  You should find out what Cashfly can do for you.  Twit.cashfly.com.  Thank you, Cashfly.  It's been a great 2020.  Here's to 2021 together.  We've got the OG Twits on the line here talking about the top stories of the year.  I guess we have to talk about TikTok, the gift that just kept on giving.  If I look at the TikTok, and I'm going to throw into this Huawei, WeChat, all of the  kind of concern about the Chinese apps that might be spying on you, and I compare that  to what the Russians have been doing all along with SolarWinds, the TikTok story isn't just  a sideshow.  It just seems like misdirection at this point.

Start time: 4149.40
End time: 4161.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_12

He's one of the top executives.  Here's how I interpreted that, Paul.  I thought that was really interesting too.  To me, that was Chris saying this was never an effort...  Distance himself.  Yeah, this was not an agreed upon effort by the leadership team.  This is something we want.  He gave reasons.  Yeah, it's good.  It's always good to acquire more users, get a strong user base, blah, blah, blah.  I'm putting words in his mouth here, but my interpretation reading between the lines  was, you know what?  This was a phone call from Sachin Adela and the president.  The president said, would you be interested in buying them?  And if you do, will you give me $5 million?  And Adela...  Seriously, I'm not joking.  Fighters feed.  I know.  I am not joking.  It's still ludicrous.  And Adela politically said, yeah, of course.

This had nothing to do with Microsoft and their intent to do anything.  It's just very hard if you were a CEO of a publicly held company in the United States  to say no to the president when he calls and says, would you do me a favor?  Of course, Larry Ellison has agreed to do that favor.

I think it's a step ahead of the rest of platforms and that you can put up a piece of audio and  people can build on it.  You can put up a video and people respond to it.  You can create Ratatouille the musical entirely on TikTok with choreography and costumes and  songs and scripts.  To me, it just begins to crack what I think is the true nature of the net, which is collaboration.

Transcript:  You could say the prudent thing to do would be to have no business with any other country  in the world and seal our borders, but that's not practical.  It's not doable.  The proper response, it seems to me, is to weigh the risks, to deal with the most serious  risks and certainly be aware of them.  I think there are diplomatic roots, the political roots that you could use to encourage China  to do the right thing.  I would hope we would use those.

One of the things that I know you are focused on, Jeff, is because I listened to you on  this week in Google, is the changing feeling about privacy as a function of age, where  young kids are just like, oh yeah, we don't care.  We're just putting it all online and letting it hang out there, whereas these OGs here  are like, wait a minute, you gave them your what?

It also goes to, I think one of the great talents of young people online and other communities  online is that they create their own languages.  They don't find privacy the way we do.  They hide in plain sight the things that they do.  And it's true of young people.  Dana Boyd has done great research on this.  And I just read a book by Andre Brock Jr. on black culture on Twitter.  And there's the creation of languages and structures and understandings that if you're  not inside the community, you're not going to get.  And it's in that in plain sight view, which is a really interesting strategy then for  how to deal with the internet.

The judge ruled that shutting TikTok down would be a significant penalty to these influencers.

And whether it's in China or not, people are using it to be able to talk to the public  and to have their voice.  And you try to shut that off from government.  That's a violation of the First Amendment.

Transcript:  I think it's pretty clear.  Now don't yell at me, Jeff.  I don't yell at you.  You're the one who yells at me.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm yelling at you.  I won't yell at you on this.  This was actually a story this week because Apple changed its privacy reporting with the  most recent version of iOS.  And there was a very long, several screens long reveal of all of the things Facebook  potentially was collecting from you on your iOS app.  At which point, Facebook took out full page ads in the New York Times, the Wall Street  Journal and the Washington Post saying, it's not us.  Think of the small business people who are going to suffer if you tell them what we're  collecting.  Apple said, look, we're not saying you can't collect it, Facebook.  We're just telling people they have the right to say no.  And Facebook was up in arms.  And I guess my point is Facebook is doing and admittedly doing more probably than TikTok  is.  The only difference that Facebook is doing is their American company and TikTok is a  Chinese company.  Is that the difference?

Transcript:  TikTok, there's a fear they might have do something.  With Facebook, they literally are doing it.  That's the one thing.  But also this Facebook protection of small businesses is like the mob claiming that if  you take them down, no one will protect the small businesses on the street because we're  collecting money from them.  Shane, what could happen to that nice bakery of yours?  Yeah, I'd hate to see anything happen to your small business.

Transcript:  Kara Swisher's opinion piece in The New York Times said, Facebook's tone deaf attack on  Apple, the company declared in newspaper ads it was standing up to Apple.  It's a desperate ploy that's unlikely to work.  She says, casting itself as a protector of small businesses in full page ads in irony  alert big newspapers.  Facebook is criticizing Apple for planning to give users of its popular devices more  control over the data they share with third party apps.  Think of the small businesses.  That's a new kind of moral panic, isn't it, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So just to be clear here, I agree with you on this story.  It was the other story you brought that called Facebook a doomsday machine that I had a little  problem with.  This story I agree with.  Facebook is tone deaf.  They do all kinds of things that don't make sense.  Yeah, they don't have my biggest complaint about them is they don't operate with a North  star that you can test them against to say, why do you exist?  And we're going to test your behavior against that.  Instead, they have a book of statutes.  You can't show a female breast unless it's attached to a kid.  But why?  What's the higher view of why you exist besides we're going to connect people?  And that's what I've been urging them publicly on this show and in my writing to do.  And they don't.

Transcript:  In any event, I guess the reason I bring it up in conjunction with TikTok is they're both  doing somewhat similar things.  And there's always the threat that TikTok could be used somehow to propagandize American  public or and you could say the same thing for Facebook.  In fact, I think you could say Facebook has been used that way in Myanmar and the Philippines  and other dictatorships.  So so is the president trying to shut down Facebook as well as TikTok?  Or is it just that it's it's a Chinese 230?

That's where I think it's going to that's going to be the battleground for next year  and where odd bedfellows come together because of the, pardon me, moral panic about the  Internet, that what suffers in the end is all of our speech.  Yes, it's not about Facebook.  I'll back you on about Twitter.  It's not about TikTok.  It's about our rights online and what's going to happen there because of this panic that  goes on and 230 is going to be the target.

Transcript:  Actually, perhaps one of the top 10 stories we should have covered  is is the benefactors, the gifts, people like Craig,  Jeff Bezos is X.  He's got Mackenzie,  Laureen Jobs, these very wealthy  tech benefactors have really put a lot of money,  Bill Gates, into into good causes.  That seems to be more and more for a long time.  Silicon Valley was very much criticized for not participating,  for not being charitable.  Steve Jobs famously said, I'm too busy.  We don't want to.  I think secretly he might have been donating.  But now Apple is very much in the forefront of  of gifts and charity.  So that's probably a big story, too, for 2020.  How much did Mackenzie Scott give away?

She got thirty seven billion dollars in her divorce,  but it's now worth sixty two billion dollars,  thanks to the run up in Amazon stock due primarily to covid  over the last nine months.  And so she decided to give a lot of it away.

Start time: 5290.92
End time: 5328.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  By the way, sorry, you know, I got money  in the disinformation thing with my school from Facebook,  which almost all of it we gave away.  So I was kind of a short term  for about 10 minutes, philanthropist of sorts, right?  A grantor instead of a grantee.  And it's hard.  It's very hard work, oddly, to give away money.  Because everybody's going to come after you  and you need some sense of what impact you're going to have  and some sense of data around it.  And, you know, I didn't know how to do it.  And I hired people who did,  but it's amazing to watch how that works.  This is not easy.

Start time: 5328.36

Transcript:  Yeah, very famously, Mark Zuckerberg gave a hundred million  dollars to creating an education foundation in Newark.  That was just kind of a flop.  The other philanthropists matched the grant,  200 million dollars.  And as far as anybody can tell,  it closed the store for five years  with very little impact on Newark schools.  So it's hard.  It is hard.  Bill Gates always said, I'm not going to give away money  until I have the time to do it right.  He started a little bit before his retirement,  but I think Melinda had a lot to do with that  in the bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has  since his retirement, not only given away a lot of money,  but really done a lot of good in the world.  Been leaders.  Yeah, really been leaders.  So that's a good story.  That's a nice story.  People like Mackenzie Scott, Bill Gates.  Zuckerberg's an interesting story because the Zuckerberg  and Priscilla Chan, his wife's foundation  has been more politic in its giving, if you will.  I think that's a story perhaps for 2021.  Our show today brought to you by Zendesk.  Customer service is everything, isn't it?  I mean, that's the best run companies in the world  are the ones that treat their customers  like what they are, the most important part of the business.  And how many of us, I guarantee you, every one of us  has a customer service horror story to tell.  Customer service is job one if you have customers.  And how many times have you been on the phone  and just hung up in fury or been kept on hold for hours?  Even the best teams can struggle to make their customers  feel taken care of.  Zendesk does award-winning support sales  and customer engagement software that helps businesses  give good customer service at scale,  because that's the problem.  It's easy when your company's small  and you have a few customers,  but as that customer list grows,  it can get harder and harder to give  authentic customer service.  That's what Zendesk helps you do.  Create conversational, authentic experiences  that keep customers happy.  And you know this, when a customer, I know this,  when I have a bad experience, I tweet about it,  I tell the world, those guys kept me on hold for 14 hours.  People will say when they have a bad experience,  but similarly, I think people will tell others  when they have a good experience.  Zendesk gives businesses what they need  to stay connected with customers,  communicate seamlessly across every channel.  And that's important too,  because we all have different ways we want to communicate.  Email, phone, chat, messenger, community forums,  help centers, social media.  Zendesk uses that phrase conversational experience.  Connected, ongoing, natural customer interactions.  You don't want customers feeling  like they're talking to a robot.  You want them feeling like they're getting heard by humans.  And that's made possible  with Zendesk's complete customer profile.  So when your customer service reps  are talking to a customer, they know what's going on.  They're not, the worst thing in the world  is to be on hold for an hour with some,  let's not say names, cable company.  And they say, oh, oh, well I have to transfer you  to somebody else for that particular problem.  And you have to start all over again.  Zendesk makes sure that each customer service reps  knows what's going on.  They've got a unified set of tools  to give them the context they need  to deliver great service in every conversation.  Know who are you?  What's your problem?  I just told you.  Most support software requires expensive consultants.  Months of setup, you'll love it with Zendesk.  In hours, you're up and running,  but Zendesk has the capability to scale  and change with your needs.  So it's a perfect blend of easy to set up, easy to use,  but powerful enough to be flexible enough  to be customized to fit exactly what you want.  Zendesk gives organizations the flexibility to move quickly,  to focus on innovation, to adapt to growth.  It's not a surprise, 150,000 paid customers  and over a decade of experience,  they're pretty good at customer service themselves.  No matter what you need in business,  Zendesk products are flexible enough to pave the path  that's best for your organization.  See for yourself why the best customer service experiences  are built with Zendesk.  Zendesk.com slash twit, Z-E-N-D-E-S-K,  zendesk.com slash twit.  We're talking the top stories of 2020.  I guess we can't forget when Apple, Amazon, Facebook,  and Google all came to testify.  Well, they didn't come anywhere.  They didn't fly their big corporate jets.  They just sat down in a Zoom room  to talk to the House Antitrust Subcommittee.  That was quite the experience.  And then again, later, a strangely bearded Twitter CEO  and a strangely unbearded, in fact,  somebody who looks like he had never had  any facial hair at all, Mark Zuckerberg,  testified to the Senate.  Big Tech is being investigated by Washington, D.C.  and of course, it ended up with a trust,  antitrust suit filed against Google,  an antitrust suit filed against Facebook.  In fact, the only company really left out  of all this scrutiny was Microsoft, Paul.  What, did they suffer their penance 20 years ago  and now they're in the clear?

Transcript:  So by the way, I've had that reaction to a few of these.  The Google case, the quality of the writing.  I know this is such a weird thing to say about government,  but especially our government today.  But I actually pointed it out to my wife.  I said, if you ever doubt that our government  is incapable of intelligent acts,  you gotta read this paper, it's crazy.  I think that's, I found that to be very striking.

Start time: 5761.08
End time: 5809.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It contrasts so, and here's why it's striking.  It's so well-written, so well-thought out,  and then you get Jim Jordan with his sleeves  rolled up going, brrrr!  And it doesn't, the two don't seem to be related.  The two different planets, exactly.  So there's on the one hand, this kind of visceral hatred  of social media by the president and Republicans  because the social media dares to say,  well, that's not right, or that's not true, or, you know.  And then there's this, I think fairly well-thought out,  and maybe even justified, probably written entirely  by staffers in Congress, indictment of how big tech  has gotten, how influential it's gotten,  and really how predatory, and really the issue  is how predatory it's gotten with this monopoly.

Those of us who were present during the whole  Microsoft antitrust stuff, when you're hearing this  about Facebook and listening to it, it's like,  oh, does that sound familiar?  Oh yeah, I remember that, oh yeah.  I mean, it really is just exactly the same, abuse of power.

Start time: 5836.88
End time: 5874.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've asked this on several shows,  but I wanna ask you guys.  It's my sense that, you know, I mean,  the Microsoft thing dragged on for years, almost 10 years.  Eventually, it never did settle.  There was a consent decree.  Microsoft said, all right, all right.  We'll let an ombudsman come and watch what we do.  We'll agree not to do this again, this again.  The same thing happened in Europe.  They had the browser ballot and various things.  Disconnect IE, yeah.  But my sense of it is the real success  of the case against Microsoft was that it just made them  think twice before they did some of them  more predatory practices that they had done  on their bill of gains.

Start time: 5874.46
End time: 5877.58

Start time: 5893.82
End time: 5944.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh, because, you know, when I entered the industry,  I sort of think of myself as someone  who covers personal technology.  Most people that know about me think of me  as someone who covers Microsoft,  because when I came in, Microsoft was personal technology.  It was 100% of it.  And the internet and mobile and a lot of other things  have changed that, but Microsoft might have done  to a nascent Google or a nascent, a re-nascent,  if that's a word, Apple in the early 2000s, or a Facebook,  what it had done previously to WordPerfect and Netscape  and Lotus and so many others.  But they were shackled.  And Bill Gates, in that timeframe,  said that Microsoft would not be distracted.  And if you talk to him about it now, he says,  oh yeah, yeah, we were distracted.  Heavily, yeah.

Start time: 5945.18
End time: 5951.75

Transcript:  Well, what you could look at is what has happened.  So is there a company on Earth that  could have built a search engine to rival what Google did?  Yes, that company is Microsoft.  Is there a company that already had an incredible,  successful-for-the-day mobile platform that could have taken  on the iPhone?  Yes, that company was Microsoft.  Microsoft was 100% of the world, of my world certainly,  until it wasn't.  Until 1998.  Yeah, and by the way, I think it's a good thing overall.  I felt very strongly at the time that Microsoft  should have been broken up.  I was horrified by what I saw in all the testimony.  In fact, one of the most horrible experiences of my life  was sitting through.  I actually requested anyone in any journalist  could have gotten this is the, I don't remember how many it was,  21 tape, like literally VHS tapes,  of the Bill Gates deposition.  If you think it's hard to watch the entire Godfather  trilogy at once, I would challenge  you to watch any of this.  It is the hardest thing to watch.  Sizzling he ate.  It is awful.  And if there are lessons to be learned by Google today,  and Apple, and Amazon, and Facebook, there it is.  Don't do that.

Transcript:  You know what?  The big commonality here is that all of those companies,  the four we're talking about today at Microsoft,  are what they call gatekeepers.  And this is the challenge.  I think you'll see because of so much antitrust action right  now, and legal action against these companies,  even Apple, which is in many ways very  belligerent about this kind of stuff,  has taken steps this year to scale back from the cliff  a little bit with regards to their relationship  with developers, for example.  So I think in some cases, you'll see companies  make changes voluntarily.  I think you will see stalling.  Some of these things are going to take years, and years,  and years.  The hope is that the impact, however it comes about,  it will be similar to what happened to Microsoft.  Which, by the way, today is literally  right the second is probably the second biggest  company in the world.  So it's not like they disappeared.  It was good for Microsoft in the long run, right?  That's right.  Sometimes you need to go through a little bit of pain  to get to the other side and to a better place.  And Microsoft, that was forced on them.  That's not something they would have done voluntarily.  And we'll see.  These companies, they're all going  to react in their own unique way, I guess.

Transcript:  So there's this kind of thoughtful attempt  to figure out what's going on and what to do about it  on the one hand.  And then the other hand, there's a lot of frothing at the mouth  and threats against section 230.  What is section 230, Jeff?

Start time: 6145.58
End time: 6161.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Section 230 says that a platform or publisher  is not responsible for the actions of others  on their platform or publishing platform  so that we would encourage conversation.  It creates a safe harbor of swords.

Start time: 6166.22
End time: 6195.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It gives them the sword, which says,  you can choose to take down stuff.  And if you miss stuff, which was part of the problem  with case law before, you won't be in more trouble for trying.  So please try.  And you can allow conversation to happen  without getting in trouble.  So it gives you both the opportunity.  Because Congress, in its last smart act,  knew that this internet was going  to be a platform for conversation.  And without this, if everyone were  liable for anything everyone did on their platform,  they would allow nothing to happen on their platform.  We'd be stuck with mass media still.

Transcript:  And honestly, it isn't section 230  that is the problem for the president.  That has nothing to do with section 230.  He's upset, of course, because first Twitter and then  Facebook started to label some of his tweets and posts  with fact checking.

Start time: 6217.30
End time: 6227.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is where we're stuck in the paradoxes.  The left goes up to the platform saying,  take down hate speech.  Then they take down the hate speech.  And then the right says, hey, that was my speech.  And that's what Trump is basically saying.

Transcript:  By the way, if Twitter labeled one of your tweets  as misinformation, would that cause some self-reflection?  I mean, I think most people confronted by that  would pause and think, maybe I'm not doing  the right thing here.

Transcript:  They've done it so much in the last month.  But I have to point out they only started doing that  a couple of months ago.  That's right.  Yeah, they finally grew some.  For four years, anything he or others posted,  regardless of its absurdity, was just, you know.  It's just left hanging.  Left hanging.  And it was only when they started to fact check  and say, you know, this might not be true.  You might want to look at other sources.  As benign a kind of a, it wasn't even a slap on the wrist,  a nudge, as one could imagine,  that he really started to say, all right,  we got to do something about these platforms.

We're one month away from the inauguration of president-  Why are we limping?  Joe, we're limping home.  But do you think in the months remaining  he did threaten to veto the defense spending bill?  It was passed with a veto-proof margin.  It would be a very interesting thing.  He still has not vetoed it.  If he vetoed it and forced Republican members of Congress  then to vote against him,  that would be an interesting contraton.  Do you think that anything will happen at 2.30  between now and January 20th?  And then the next question,  maybe that's for the end of the show,  but the next question is,  Biden himself has said he doesn't think  2.30 is such a good idea.  Will it continue to be under assault?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  there are several technologies that make up 5G.  They're real, they're not made up.  But the problem is by overhyping it, overmarketing it,  buying, I don't know what Verizon paid Apple  to inject the word 5G 100 times into their keynote.  But that has actually done more harm to 5G.  That's just created a whole nation of people going,  yes, so what, 5, who cares?  Right?  I mean, eventually 5G could be something.

There are so many, so on the one hand,  Elon Musk has single-handedly revived  our aspirations to go into space  with amazing launches and technological superiority  and the landing of the, twin landing of the rocket.  Was that this year, John?  That was this year.  The recovery.

The bringing back of the booster was a minor.  That wasn't really what they were testing.  This was, by the way, the rocket  that's going to bring humans to Mars.  So Elon, I mean, look at that.  Those beautiful rockets landing in synchrony.  It's like ballet.  On the one hand, it's doing these amazing things.  On the other hand, it's saying, free America now.  There's no COVID.

And yet, SpaceX launched two NASA astronauts  to the space station.  Somehow he still does smart things.  The Japanese astronaut who rode in the most recent  Crew Dragon said it was the best ride.  He's been on three shuttle launches.  It's the best ride he's ever had.  They used Baby Yoda as a zero gravity monitor.  He's also, by the way, the second richest man  in the world now.  So I just think Elon is a gift that keeps on giving.  This is Elon Musk.  Maybe he's PT Barnum.  I don't know what he is.  He's unique.

Former Google and Uber self-driving car engineered  pleaded guilty to trade secret theft  and was fined kind of an unimaginably large amount  to which he promptly declared bankruptcy.  Talking about Anthony Lewandowski.  Let me ask you, Steve, because you're the most geekiest  of the bunch here.  Is it harder to do a self-driving car than we knew?  I remember in the very earliest days of the DARPA challenge,  remember this, they wanted autonomous vehicles  to drive in the desert.  And for the first five years, the cars would go two feet  and go careening off the road.  That was almost, it was humorous.  And then all of a sudden,  none of them completing the DARPA challenge,  but they're putting people in these cars  and they're driving around Phoenix  and other parts of the country.  And then a self-driving car kills somebody.  And then Tesla seemed to keep running into things.  Is it easier or harder or both  to do a self-driving vehicle?

Start time: 6946.96
End time: 7076.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's completely insanely impossible  to even think that this should be done  or it's a good thing.  I mean, I'm on record years ago on the podcast saying,  what, they're gonna drive themselves?  No, that's clearly crazy.  I mean, there's, I mean,  it's been a good learning experience of, okay,  so way, way back, I worked for several years  at Stanford University's AI lab.  And this was in the early 70s.  And we thought we were gonna,  like there was a cart project.  It was a completely computer controlled robot cart in 1970.  And the thing we learned was that this was impossible.  I mean, it was like, back in the early days of AI,  oh yeah, we're gonna make smart computers  that are gonna be intelligent.  Well, it is amazing that we have lost jeopardy  to an automated machine.  That's astonishing.  But what these exercises in attempting to solve  these problems always do is teach the people  who are trying to solve them  actually how hard they are to solve.  And there's just, there's so much that we take for granted  about what we see in our visual field  and how we interpret it,  from the millions of years of evolving  to be able to do this for reason of our own survival,  that what you learn when you try to do it with a machine  is how much you take what is natural to you for granted.  So, and we've talked about all kinds of games  that you can play with the car driving AI,  where you paint some weird stripes on the road  and the car just stops because it thinks there's a wall there.  But no, there's just some particularly shaped paint  on the road. If it's a white truck in the road,

A two-year-old can recognize its mother,  but a computer has a hard time figuring out  if that black person committed a crime  or is a Supreme Court justice.  It's both harder and easier than it seems.  And we're kind of caught in that middle ground now  where it works, but it doesn't work.  It's a...

Transcript:  One of the nicest examples of a compromise,  and I've used it a lot, because I think it's so cool,  was the Palm Pilots idea of asking the user  to adapt a little bit to the limitations of the technology  with graffiti, which was Jeff Hawkins' creation  that allowed this really low power little PDA  in the early days to do a perfect, I mean,  P with a capital perfect, job of recognizing handwriting.  So what I could imagine is a future  where we adapt our streets a little bit  to the needs of self-driving cars.  If we decide as a society  that this is something we really need to have  is that we need to just remove the windows  and get into a black cube that navigates us  to where we're going, then it makes sense.  We have this technology.

Transcript:  You know, Jeff Hawkins, I completely agree.  I mean, he was absolutely brilliant,  the creation of graffiti.  He then, in 2005, after Pilot, he sold Pilot  and then he went on to found a company called Numenta.  I interviewed him.  Yeah, Hierarchical Teporal Memory, HTM.  Yeah, he's trying to create chips  that duplicate the function of the human brain,  which is a very different process  from the von Neumann architecture  our computers currently use.  It's massively parallel.  Our brains aren't that fast,  but they're so massively parallel,  they're able to do things that chips can't do.  So I don't know if Numenta's a dead end.  I haven't heard much from them,  but he's a brilliant guy.

It didn't have sensors in the bottom part of the door  where your head would be.  So it would like balk at opening in the garage,  it would say, oh, it's not wide enough for me.  But if there's somebody standing on her,  it'd go, boom, right on her head.  It was terrible.  It was very Elon.  It was very Elon.  All right, another big story,  and actually this is a huge story in 2020,  which was Intel's self-destruction.  The rise of not only AMD and amazing thread ripper  technology, but the rise of Apple Silicon and ARM.  Intel never got to 10 nanometer.  They announced in 2020 that their seven nanometer chips  wouldn't be out for two more years, maybe three.  This was a company that powered the PC industry, Paul.  I mean, it was Windows and Intel, hand in hand, arm in arm.

Transcript:  This is a story that's actually been years in the making.  And I think the M1 thing has driven it home  for a lot of people, but I don't know,  three, four years ago, Microsoft partnered with Qualcomm  to have some alternative to Intel,  because they didn't want to monoculture.  And the reason they went with Qualcomm  was because AMD was, in their words at the time,  circling the drain, which of course is not the case today.  But Intel is, it's so weird because they're such a huge  and important and powerful company today still.  I feel like they're on the edge of disappearing.  Isn't that sad?  They seem almost irrelevant all of a sudden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  The mistake was probably hubris,  but I mean, it was just a technical inability  to scale down in size at a time where their competitors,  which in this case, were not actually companies like AMD,  but rather the manufacturers that have these processes  that can rival Intel.  And then the Apple thing is,  the Apple stuff is just kind of an exclamation point  at the end.  Apple kind of came up out of nowhere on the side  and it's been a very public story.  And I think this is the thing that normal people,  non-technical people, people not in the industry  are aware of this, that all of a sudden there is this thing.  And remember when Intel used to be in all the computers?  They're not really there.

Transcript:  First movers also often have a problem.  IBM had huge mainframes and created a market,  but they're not making PCs any longer.  Microsoft was super strong, but is unable to make a phone.  Other people have done that.  Intel basically got completely behind an architecture,  this CISC, the complex instruction set,  which was great as long as you had large power cords  going to your devices.  But the world went to battery power  and the ARM architecture turns out to be the right one  for battery power.  It can be far more scalable and power conserving.  And so Intel, in all of these cases,  there was too much corporate inertia.  And one by one these behemoths end up falling  and they're just not adept enough to move  as quickly as they have to.  So along came ARM and that was the right answer.

Transcript:  Ben Thompson wrote a good article in June.  In a way, Jeff, it's kind of a form  of the innovator's dilemma.  The worst thing a company can have is great success.  And Intel had huge success with what Thompson calls  their integrated model, where they would build the fabs,  they would design the chips, build the fabs.  They integrated both design and manufacture.  And for 35 years, profit.  It was incredibly successful for them.  But there was success of this integrated model.  Ended up blinding them to the model that ARM  and TSMC and others were following.  ARM would design the chips,  TSMC would manufacture the chips.  And so by separating this out, they were more nimble,  it was less capital intensive,  they were able to do better designs.  And ultimately, by focusing on manufacture,  only TSMC got down.  They're now at five nanometers, the M1 is a five nanometer  chip and they're talking about three nanometer chips  while Intel's still stuck at 10.  So it's a story told as old as time,  or at least as old as the tech industry,  of being too successful and then being tied  into your model.

Transcript:  We just talked about Microsoft and the impact  of the antitrust stuff.  Intel is the hardware equivalent of Microsoft  and they didn't change like Microsoft did.  Also the other way to look at it is,  I talked about Microsoft being 100% of the market  back in the day from a software perspective, that's true.  From a hardware perspective, it was basically Intel.  Today, Intel is the biggest fish in the smallest pond.  Mobile is much, much bigger than the PC.  Isn't that wild?  265, 275 million computers are gonna be sold this year.  Two something billion-ish mobile,  smartphones will be sold this year.  It's not exponentially bigger, but it's dramatically bigger  and year after year after year.  Intel hasn't been the biggest microprocessor company  arguably in years.

Transcript:  Now here's the funny story and this isn't really,  this is just the button on the whole thing.  Every time Apple does something,  it seems like Microsoft says, oh, we can do that.  Apple came out with a touchscreen and they had the surface,  I can't remember what they call it, the surface table.  Surface studio.  We've got that.  Apple comes out with the M1 chip.  Microsoft, according to Tom Warren, writing the verge,  is now working on designing its own arm-based chips  for surfers and surface PCs.  It feels like me too.

Start time: 7789.96
End time: 7820.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I don't actually think this is a reaction to the M1.  Microsoft has for years been partnering  with other companies to design specialty chips.  Microsoft has for years been making its own chips  for use inside its computers, not the CPUs,  but other special chips, and also in their data centers.  So I think Microsoft has tried to do what it's always done,  which is partner with other companies,  and that it's seeing the limitations of this  and that this didn't just happen,  this story just came up.  No, I agree.  You don't just start a chip design business.  They've been moving in this direction.

Transcript:  Yeah, right.  And I have to say the tensions  between Intel and Microsoft are age old.  Oh yeah.  I remember Andy Grove saying,  oh, if Microsoft would just do a 32-bit operating system,  we make these 32-bit chips, what are they thinking?  And it's just been forever.  And I think maybe that's the real key  to Apple's success here is total integration.  We'll do the software and the hardware.  We'll build everything ourselves  or get somebody to build it for us.  How would you like to be an Apple partner today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they're gonna replace everything.  And actually, that's why I thought Microsoft  would be hard for Microsoft to do their own chips  because how many OEMs are there  that make Intel-based Windows hardware?  If Microsoft doesn't sell those chips to those guys.

Transcript:  Yeah, but everyone's looking for diversity.  When Microsoft started making Surface PCs,  every PC maker on Earth started making Chromebooks.  Every PC maker on Earth now has AMD-based PCs  as well as Intel-based PCs.  Some of them have, I would say most of the big ones  have Qualcomm-based PCs as well.  Everyone is kind of hedging their bets.  But that's the problem with the ecosystem  and also the strength, but part of the problem,  Apple just goes all in on one thing.  On the PC side of the fence, the Microsoft side,  everyone's, we're trying different things.

Transcript:  We try to pull together some of the best people we can,  and I'm so happy.  And of course, honored always to be.  The shows that continue are the ones  with the smartest folk.  So I appreciate all you've done over the last years.  Our show today brought to you by Forward Networks.  This is looking forward to the future.  Forward Networks, I talked to these guys,  was founded by four Stanford PhD students, graduate students,  seven years ago.  They were looking at the pain network operators suffered  by not knowing what was going on in the network.  You know, that puffy little cloud we call the internet,  it's cute to us, but you know what network engineers see?  A complete fog.  I don't know what's going on in there.  Forward Networks developed some empathy  for these network operators.  They said, what if, and this was their PhD project,  we could develop a software only model,  a mathematically identical model of the network  that you could use to reduce network outages,  to improve troubleshooting, to eliminate errors.  So what Forward Networks does, their advanced software,  it delivers a digital twin,  a mathematically accurate model of your network.  It does it in software, and it gives you,  this is the dashboard, if you're looking at the video,  that's the dashboard.  It gives you a single source of truth for the network.  This is amazing.  This is what you, as a network engineer,  have been dying for.  You can verify that your network is configured correctly.  It's in compliance with policies,  it's behaving as you intend.  And here's the best part,  you ready to make a change to the network?  They have something called behavior diffs  that allow side-by-side comparisons in one view  of the current network and configuration changes  and what that's going to do to your network.  No more do you have to try it and then roll it back  because everything broke.  You will know ahead of time.  Forward Networks can accurately predict the impact  of a proposed change across every possible traffic path.  So network operators can roll out changes with confidence.  This makes sure that your network is healthy, is agile.  You'll get insights with visualizations  that you can easily understand.  You can export, you can show others.  You can automatically create an always accurate  network diagram with full details  about the topology of your network.  PayPal used this.  They were, as many big companies,  they had lots of endpoints,  lots of network stuff all over the world,  and they realized they didn't know what was going on.  They were about to build something.  They found Forward Networks and they said, this is it.  This is the software we've needed.  Anytime there's a change in the network,  it's immediately reflected  in the Forward Networks mathematical model.  It saved them time and money.  Goldman Sachs, same thing.  They were, we can't figure out our network.  We don't know what's wrong.  We're going to make changes.  We don't know what the impact will be.  They found Forward Networks.  Now, by the way, they're the lead on their C funding round,  their series C funding round.  Goldman Sachs, Mark Andreessen and Andreessen Horowitz,  also huge fan.  People saw this is something the world needs.  50% faster resolution of trouble tickets,  90% faster fixes related to audit processes,  but the most important one is 33% reduction  in aborted network updates due to identified errors.  And if you're having problems,  imagine just searching your network,  just like you would search with Google  for what's causing problems.  That's what Forward Networks let you do.  This, you need this.  You got to get this.  Get network automation and verification  for your intent-based network with Forward Networks.  Your business may depend on it.  You can get a demo.  It's a really cool demo at forwardnetworks.com slash twit.  Forwardnetworks.com slash twit.  I was so inspired when I talked to these guys.  They even have a podcast if you want to listen  called Seeking Truth in Networking.  I love that name.  You can download it wherever you get your podcasts.  And I encourage you, if you're responsible for a network  or you know someone who is, stop tearing your hair out.  Forwardnetworks.com slash twit.  No more mystery.  Forwardnetworks.com slash twit.  We thank Forward Networks for supporting this week in tech.  We thank you for supporting us by going there.  Forwardnetworks.com slash twit.  Now, John, press that magic tricaster button.

Oh, I have to thank the great Jim Cutler,  his wonderful partner at Dawn,  because all year long, Jim Pro Bono,  he's the voice of ESPN,  he's the voice of many TV and radio stations  all over the country.  He's a commercial voiceover guy  who I couldn't come close to affording 30 seconds  of his time.  But for the last, I don't know how many years,  Jim and Dawn have provided us with announcing,  especially those promos and the funny  little comments at the end.  That's amazing.  He is a great friend of the network.  You know, Twit really wouldn't exist  without people like Jim and you guys.  It's really a group effort.  So I'm from the bottom of my heart,  I'm absolutely sincere, thank you.  I'm just very, I'm incredibly fortunate to know you guys  and to be able to do this.  It's a real privilege, so thank you.  I don't even know if we wanna go through  all of the things that came out this year.  The iPad Pro, the MacBook Air, the M1 chip,  the iPhone SE, Apple announced a new cheaper version  of the Apple Watch,  along with a more expensive version of the Apple Watch  and an Apple Watch for seniors.  There were a number of Surfacy,  the Surface Go 2,  Surface Book 3,  Surface Headphones 2, the Surface Earbuds.  You know, this was actually the year  of the overpriced headphone earbud combination, right?  God, they were all so expensive.  And of course, you know why?  Because you can't put a wired headphone,  a cheap skull candy, you bought it at the Five and Dime  store headphone in any of these phones anymore.  A Mac OS 11 Big Sur came out, the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra,  the Pixel 4A, which I think widely considered  to be maybe the best phone of the year,  the most expensive phone of the year,  which I have one and I don't know what I'm gonna do with it,  the Galaxy Fold Z2.  Don't laugh at me and my $2,000 phone.  Old buyer's remorse there, boss.  Oh, yay, yay.  I did buy a Surface Duo and I was able to return that.  You know what?  I think both the Surface Duo and the Fold 2  are gonna be around for a long,  the Fold will be around for a long time, so will the Duo.  There's something going on there, right, Paul?  There's some value in that.

Start time: 8482.52
End time: 8511.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think we've latched onto  what the real value is.  Microsoft pushes this notion that when you have  two different things on two different displays,  something clicks and you become more productive  or you become more creative.  I don't think that's it.  Actually, since we're all the OG Twits,  I think we can all, we all agree, looking at a phone,  it's a little tough at this age,  and having a bigger screen is nice.  I love that.  Yeah, the Fold is great that way.  It's nice if you're using it for maps in a car,  it's nice if you're watching a movie, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you want to explain, Steve?  Back at the time, so it's been my experience  that sometimes the world moves on past the perfect solution.  It doesn't just settle on the perfect solution.  For example, I happen to have here within reach,  that was not set up ahead of time,  the most perfect calculators that were ever created.  No, I have the new one.

And they're gone now.  I have about 20 of these,  because it's the, I don't ever want to be  without this calculator.  They're going to make a TV show about you or something.  The best one ever created.  It's called Hoarders 2.  Yeah, Tech Hoarders.  Now, as it happens, I was wrong about the Palm Tungsten.  I have several of those in the freezer,  and I don't think I'm going to ever thaw them out,  because I now have an iPhone.  Explain to Paul why you put them in the freezer.  Well, both, because the battery chemistry  needs to be kept cold, so that it does not be a bad.  Not metaphoric.  No.

Transcript:  No, actually, I think they're in the refrigerator,  because you don't want to freeze a lithium polymer cell.  But you do want to cool it off in order to slow things down,  and it is possible to actually get  fresh replacement batteries.  But again, in that instance,  I will not be going back to there.  I used to read books, e-books on my little Palm Pilot.  That was wonderful.  But we now have iPhones, that's the right solution.  But we have no calculators that are equivalent  to the fantastic HPs.

Start time: 8695.54
End time: 8728.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, as a matter of fact,  that it's going to be a problem for me.  I'm not sure what I'm going to do,  because everything I'm doing is x86,  and we're clearly seeing the world  moving away from that architecture.  So, you know, maybe the ARM will be able to emulate x86,  and then it'll only be, you know,  I'll have to create drivers for non-Intel based systems.  Hopefully I'm old enough that the x86  will last just long enough to move me out of a point  where I want to be profitable.

Start time: 8728.60

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember moving from 68,000,  which was a very nice assembly language.  Oh, beautiful design.  And the memory architecture was, you know, flat.  All orthogonal instruction set.  And then going to x...  Well, I guess it was x16, I don't know what it was,  but going to the Intel platform and its segment of memory.  8086, maybe, yeah.  Was written by an insane person.  Oh my God, and it's not any better.  So, you know what, you might actually embrace risk.  You might say, the problem is you probably have  a thousand macros written in x86  that you're going to have to rewrite or something.  I imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, yeah, they're loud, loud, loud, loud.  When they make a quiet drone,  that's when we should all be worried.  I'm sad to say Boston Dynamics got sold  to another company, the Robotic Dog.  Now that would have been a product  that came out this year  that maybe I wouldn't have mind having around the studio.

I think probably the PlayStation 5  and the Xbox Series X would be viewed  as one of the most important products of the year  if you could just buy one.  Yep.  In both cases, and I guess we should throw in  some of the newer Nvidia graphics cards.  These things sold out probably to scalpers  so quickly that nobody,  there'll be a lot of unhappy children  coming down in the States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I mean, the post-COVID world  is going to be a lot like the COVID world in some ways,  more working from home,  more, you know, a thousand new Microsoft Teams features  by the end of 2021, I'm sure.

Start time: 8974.94

Start time: 8977.92
End time: 9027.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  They really-  Well, I mean, it's, you know, in the Microsoft space,  certainly, I mean, I think Zoom was a bigger deal,  but, you know, for Microsoft,  it's the next big platform, so it's big.  I don't know, to me, one of the things  I want to see more of that was really good this year,  and there weren't that many things that were really good,  but low cost, kind of high value smartphones,  you know, the iPhone SE, the Pixel 4A, like you said,  or the Galaxy S20 FE,  are low cost phones that aren't terrible, you know?  And I think that's an important trend,  especially with all the uncertainty  and the fact that people are holding onto their phones  longer and so forth.  It's nice to see phones in the $350 to $700 range.  I think we're going to see more of that next year as well.  And maybe-  Well, we had a theory on Twig that Google's latest,

Start time: 9028.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I didn't notice, I didn't mention the Pixel 5,  which would have normally been one of the big releases  of 2020, but Google acted as if, you know,  they were taking a nap and they had this phone  and maybe you'd be interested, but maybe not.

Start time: 9046.88
End time: 9053.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_12

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the 4A was a great phone.  The 4A was the phone probably we deserved last year.  I don't know what Google's going to be.  You know what, Google should have been one of the  top 10 stories, just Google wandering off,  losing interest in life-  But they do this all the time, don't they?  And just drifting away.

Transcript:  It's a strange company.  I find it weird from being outside.  Every fall, Google will announce some smart home products,  and they have five or six of them.

We didn't even mention ransomware gone wild in 2020.  I think a safe prediction for 2021  is more of the same in that regard.

Start time: 9136.30
End time: 9262.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's clear.  For me, and we talk about this constantly on the podcast,  the most interesting issue is this fundamental tension  that exists between governments and encryption.  And our right to privacy,  and the fact that in the US, privacy is not an absolute.  You have privacy and a right to have it,  except if a court will give a warrant  saying it's in the public interest  for some particular target to sacrifice some aspect  of their privacy for a specific purpose.  We talk about encryptions and backdoors and all that.  My feeling is that there's a different way  to solve the problem.  And it's gonna be interesting to see next year,  maybe it's gonna be the year after,  how this gets resolved.  It's not necessary to weaken encryption  because first of all, we can't.  That math has already escaped.  So you can do perfect encryption,  so you can do perfect encryption.  But we forget that on the opposite ends  of that encrypted tunnel, the data is not encrypted.  So it would be entirely possible for the government  to legislate that high volume consumer products  like Pixel phones and iOS devices  have to be warrant compatible.  That is, they have to be, like by law,  they have to be subject to a search warrant.  And all that means is that you get the data  either before it's encrypted or after it's decrypted  under some sort of constraint.  So I think the problem can be solved  without weakening encryption, but just by recognizing it  that there are times when encryption isn't present  and you can snatch it at that point.  But to me, that's one of the big issues that as a society  we haven't yet come to grips with.  And maybe next year.

Start time: 9265.00
End time: 9292.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a scary thought.  And the thing that scares me is the only, as usual,  the only people disadvantaged by that  are the less sophisticated because hackers, bad guys,  and you and I will always have encryption.  The math is out there.  There's nothing anybody can do about it.  It's just normal people use iPhones  and other phones will lose it.  Right.  So the bad guys aren't going to be disadvantaged.

Start time: 9293.92
End time: 9336.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if your phone itself is able to be tapped  at the keyboard and the screen,  then any encryption that you apply within the phone  can be snatched ahead of time.  Now, if you want to send documents back and forth,  then you could create a document,  do your own offline encryption, and then mail it,  and there's nothing anyone can do in order to crack that.  But for mass market products,  I can see that the government might well say,  look, you've enjoyed this honeymoon period,  but we have to have warrant compatible access  to these devices.

Start time: 9336.64
End time: 9379.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a jump from that though to we've got a back door  and we're watching you at all times.  Right.  I doubt that's going to happen.  First of all, that's a lot of bandwidth,  a lot of storage,  and a lot of people watching what you're doing.  It's much more likely that they just say,  but at any point, if we should decide we want your phone  or we want your account,  we can go and get it and see what's on there.  Exactly.  Yeah, but I think things like encrypted messaging platforms  and so forth are probably going to continue on.  I don't see how they can stop signal.  I don't know.  This will be, you're right.  This will be a big story in 2021.  I agree with you.  Jeff Jarvis, your big story for 2021.

Transcript:  It's an interesting thing because one,  I know he's getting advice to say, hold on.  Hello, OG.  Hold on.  I think there's a lot of ways to look at this.  There may be other ways to look at this,  but there's a pincer movement against tech.  The problem is I think what's going to happen  is at some point the progressives are going to wake up  and look and realize that they're on the same side  of some of this as the Trumpists,  and that's not going to be a comfortable place to be.  Yeah.  And freedom of expression for communities,  too long not heard in mass media is what I care about most.  We have the Digital Services Act  and the Digital Markets Act, which are going to come in,  along with UK regulation on antitrust  and also on digital harms is coming up.  Australia has its Murdoch law trying to go after them.  We have all kinds of things I think are going to be happening  in the next year.  And the platforms, my problem is,  that they're the ones who need to defend the internet  and they're the worst defenders of the internet,  and that's what bothers me.

Start time: 9471.96
End time: 9502.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Right now it's a politically volatile situation.  Maybe that'll get less so in January,  and then maybe calmer heads can prevail.  But I think that the investigations the FTC  and Congress have initiated, those are not going away.  The EU, Marguerite Vesteiger has become  more and more aggressive.  Those aren't going to go away.  So yeah, this is going to be the year of reckoning  for big tech.  There's a book coming out in March

Start time: 9502.72
End time: 9528.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I just read for blurbing purposes by Nuret Weissblatt,  who's a researcher at I think it's USC or UCLA,  I suddenly forget which one,  and about the tech clash and when it started.  And we'll talk about it when the book comes out,  but it's a fascinating, you ought to have her on.  It's a fascinating bit of data as to when media  just suddenly did a 180, and it wasn't what I expected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My story for next year that I think is going to be  interesting is one that's been developing this year,  but I think is going to take off next year,  which is the advent of streaming.  Of course, this was the year streaming gaming got pressed.  And in fact, Cyberpunk 2077 seems to be only played  playable on streaming services like GeForce Now and Stadia.  Google engineer has said we have ported Stadia to iOS.  So they've gotten around Apple's restriction  on streaming gaming by just making it work in the browser.  And apparently work quite well.  This is Thumper, which is working in Safari  on the new version of iOS in beta and working in real time.  But it isn't about gaming in the long run.  It's about things like Windows Virtual Desktop.  I suspect that more and more of our computing  will be done with a thin client.  Maybe that's why the fold is so interesting  because that could be your thin client,  not just for gaming, but for Windows,  for your operating system.  Amazon has put Mac minis on AWS.  Soon you'll be able to use a Mac and Mac OS over the cloud.  I think that's going to be a big trend in 2021.  And it's going to very much change how we think of computing  and desktop computing in particular.  And I'm hopeful, Steve,  I think one of the things that's driving this  is ransomware and security.  I'm hopeful that these professionally managed  operating systems in the cloud will be more reliable  and more secure than, they'll do a better job  than we have been doing on our systems at home.
