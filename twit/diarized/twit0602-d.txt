Transcript:  Nebraska, let's talk about nebraska. How often do we talk about nebraska on this show?  Nebraska is one of I think six states that are looking at  laws  To give you the right to repair  Nebraska, new york, tennessee, wyoming, minnesota, kansas, illinois and massachusetts  The theory being you own a product like a john deere tractor or an iphone. You should have the right to fix it at any  Fix-it shop you want including third-party fix-it shops  Apple does not like this among others. In fact, they are now lobbying nebraska lawmakers  To kill the right to repair legislation saying  Unauthorized repair will turn the state into a mecca for hackers  That would be a great license plate for nebraska nebraska hacker mecca  I don't think nebraska will ever be a mecca for hackers, but uh, what is there some  Justify let me ask you christina some justification for apple not to want to get these laws passed

Start time: 377.30
End time: 409.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that their justification is that when you have unauthorized people performing repairs  They can often do repairs that might not be of the quality  Um that that apple would want their products to be living up to so if they you know repair the phone, you know  Your screen that's one thing but if they're they're doing  um other sorts of logic for repairs things like that there could be  problems with the phone that then apple could  Would be responsible for that apple would reputation would somehow be tied to it actually happened right last year

Start time: 409.64
End time: 457.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was an ios update that fixed the error 53  Uh, and it bricked iphones that had been repaired at third-party repair shops and apple's rationale was well  Yeah, because if you repaired it, we don't know that touch id the fingerprint reader  Is still going to work properly and so we can't secure the phone  On the other hand kyle weens who's been a big advocate. He's at iFix is of right to repair course iFix it  Which which has been a sponsor on the show in the past makes manuals and sells parts to repair stuff  Says that the rationale that an independent mechanic ought to be able to bypass things  Like error 53 that are designed to prevent repair  In other words, he says apple did error 53 to fair it out and put out a business third-party repair companies  Apple's uh taking this seriously

Start time: 459.56
End time: 487.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, I mean are we surprised right?  This is the company that that's all about sealed boxes and not tinkering really and we see there one  Computer that you know, you could actually upgrade easily  Uh, the mac pro is just like it's been ignored for so long  This makes a lot of sense for apple the bigger problem now is the touch id stuff, right?  If uh, if you go get your screen or something fixed  Yeah, they have to they have to make sure everything is in line and it's a lot tougher. I guess if independent parties do that now

Start time: 488.84
End time: 536.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but caveat mtor that's  That's always been the case  If you want to have a cheap repair done and you want to you want to save some money you take the risk that  It's not going to be of the quality that it would be if you went to an apple store or an authorized repair shop  but to preemptively say  That it's illegal  for  Someone or even even if I own it myself  To buy to to scavenge parts, you know to go to a place like swapa and buy a phone  That's no longer functional and take it apart and  And cannibalize it for parts and then use those parts myself  The the point of a law like this would even prevent me from doing that which is  nuts

Start time: 537.72
End time: 633.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree. I mean my main issue would error 53 happened and then apple ended up issuing a software update that basically  Made error 53 no longer an issue my issue with that wasn't so much  You know even that they'd said well look for the sanctity of touch id and for other stuff we need to have  repairs done a certain way  Um, that's all well and good to say well if you want this to work you need to go to an authorized repair center  But to your point at a to say you can't do this at all  And it should be illegal that's insane  But the secondary problem is that when you're outside of the united states or major cities in other parts of the world  Going to an authorized repair center is often difficult if not impossible  So if you're you know, one of the error 53 cases that the guardian had written about when that issue broke  Came out was you know a journalist who was in a part of the world where there were not apple stores  And he needed to get his phone repaired and it had very important information on it. And you know, then his phone is bricked and so  The issue for me isn't so much that they say we would prefer people to have their phones, you know repaired by authorized  Places or apple stores. It's that there are plenty of parts of the world where that's not a possibility  and so I think this sort of legislation has the potential to be dangerous if it were to to gain acceptance because  Apple stores are in most cities in the united states, but they're not everywhere and  I don't want to be in a situation where I need to have my phone repaired and I can't get anything done  Because i'm four hours away from an apple store. This story this story comes from

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jason cobbler running at writing at motherboard. He says that he learned about it from nebraska state senator lydia brash  Who was visited by an apple state government affairs specialist?  What the guy didn't know apparently is that not only is a brash a farmer  So she you know is very aware of the john deere issue. She also works remotely for a software company in atlanta  Has a background in computer science. She said I think they were surprised to learn that I know what they were talking about  She also said  A lot of times with apple there's almost always two interpretations one apple's and this is a perfect example  Acting in the best interests of its customers to protect their security to protect the integrity of the phone  The other apple's acting in the best interest of its profits  Uh, and in in this case you could it could be either way this might lean you in one direction because apparently apple also said  Just take the phone part out of the bill and will go away  They don't care about  john deere who also wouldn't like people to you know john deere's afraid people are going to pirate their  softener in their farm equipment  Uh brash said it's tempting but we need to repair consumer technology, too  The story they're telling is we need to be afraid of technology  She says you don't have to be afraid of technology  You have to be afraid of the people who are trying to prevent you from knowing the things you know  Are these companies in it for the greater good or the greater dollar?  Good going senator brash  Wow, seriously, yeah when we talked to kyle weens one of the things he said is only one state needs to pass this there eight  Considering it he said the best one probably be massachusetts  The reason is if any state passes it all the manuals all the parts have to start to be sold in that state  That means it's accessible to anybody in the u.s  So if one state passes it it's as good as done

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean I can understand the concern too because apple refurbished iphones has become a bigger business for them  Uh, yes, you know, they've made especially in india. That's how they're gonna that's how they're gonna get into the indian market  For sure and if you have all these third-party repairs happening and you don't know the quality of the repair or something  You know that phone is inherently less valuable. I understand both sides. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, there's that and honestly the hacker issue  It may be sound a little overblown  But you don't know what somebody's doing with your device when they take it to back room, you know  And start picking it apart and a lot of the times you have to unlock your phone or give them certain access to it as well  Uh, they may not even need that but people they may tell somebody that they do so  Yeah, there's a certain value in making sure  All the apple people are doing it, but we don't know if they're trustworthy either, right? So it's tough

Start time: 790.94
End time: 798.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's this particular part might be moot with the next iphone because apple has patented a on-screen  fingerprint reader

Start time: 799.30
End time: 816.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As opposed to it's going to be the same it's going to be the same deal, right?  The whole it's the secure element and tying that to the actual  Whatever is reading the fingerprint that's I just had to get my screen replaced and they had to do a whole thing to make  Sure that that was all connected with the new touch id samsung does that too with nox, right? If you

Start time: 817.66
End time: 832.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  if you if you attempt to modify or root a samsung phone they have a  Special counter and as soon as it's been rooted nox and all that whole secure stuff just turns off  Right, which I think is a better way to handle and I think isn't that how apple eventually handled error 53?

Start time: 833.42
End time: 920.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, that's what they wound up doing the the and which is which I think is acceptable what's not acceptable is breaking someone's phone completely  Um when they might not have had a choice in how the repair was done  But yeah, I mean I think to defender's point  I mean it even though it might seem silly you can't conceive of if someone were to come up with some sort of exploit or  Make some sort of hardware modification to your phone or install something, you know at that level  That's a kind of a scary prospect of then taking your phone to some unauthorized dealer  and now that's that's allowed because you have right to repair and and  Telling the difference between the phones for me. I think that would be the big consumer issue is how do you know that this refurbished phone?  Has gone through the same steps as this refurbished phone  right now, you know if you buy one from apple or if you buy one from  Some of the various, you know places, you know, it's gone through  Different different levels and and have used official parts. I wouldn't want to buy a phone that had  you know a  Battery made by someone that might not be up to spec or had you know a screen or even a home button that wasn't  As good who knows so I see both sides, but I think that  Saying that you don't have the right to repair  Your technology no matter what your rationale is is a dangerous thing to say and obviously you're going to get pushback from  From a lot of people including, you know  The senator of nebraska who as as you guys were pointing out is very well informed on this issue

Start time: 921.78
End time: 943.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it seems kind of pointless to even fight the law too, right because the devices are getting more and more integrated  It's going to be tougher just to even like  Replace individual components and that's something we can't really stop and we can't really legislate against I guess  But that's what's going to happen as the iphone gets thinner and you know  All the components just become one piece of the logic board or something. I fix it just gave the air pods

Start time: 943.82
End time: 957.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the it may not be the first time but one of the first zero zero repair abilities because it's just  There's is glue throughout the entire body. Yeah, so you can't which is fine  Yeah, I mean on 150 dollar pair of headphones. I guess that's okay

Start time: 958.32
End time: 975.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, honestly, I think that's completely fine. I mean the the the replacement cost  Is you know 70 dollars per airpod or you know, it's about the same as buying it's slightly less than buying a new pair  I'm completely fine with that. I mean if to make things that small would it be nice if you could do more self-repairs?  I mean, sure, of course, it would be nice but

Start time: 975.74
End time: 1026.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gotta think about here's an example other stuff from my own experience. I had a macbook. This is many years ago  um, and before the magsafe adapter, you know, the the power cord had gotten pulled out and it bent and actually broke the  Connection of the power cord to the motherboard brought it to apple  They say well the the way we fix that is we replace the whole motherboard. That'll be a thousand dollars  Brought it to when this place existed the an independent mac store in san francisco mac adam  And the guy said yeah, we see this all the time. I just solder it back back on  15 dollars  and uh, I  I was really glad that mac adam existed and the guy I understood in was able to fix it that quickly because I didn't  Want to buy a new logic board?  But that's kind of so that's why you should have the right to repair and by the way, I think you do have the right to repair  computers, yes

Start time: 1026.86
End time: 1037.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so and somebody in in a on the chat was pointing out that this is really about making  Um third party repair manuals or making the repair manuals available to third parties and parts manuals are parts. Yeah

Start time: 1038.64
End time: 1056.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple does not and by the way tools they have special purpose-built machines in the back to disassemble for instance  You know, you can't disassemble an iphone with just take a screwdriver to it  So they have all these special purpose. I understand i've never been back there  But they have special tools back there special machines even

Start time: 1057.58
End time: 1071.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not just about those third party repair people too. It's the competition right apple is always about keeping  Its trade secret so close to the vest i'm sure samsung and lg and everybody has spent a lot of time disassembling these phones  But if they had the exact manuals too, you know, that'd be a little different

Transcript:  So I feel I feel like i'm very uh, you know, i'm very futuristic. I'm a global guy when I say zed  And solder I said I sold it it sounds wrong  Our show day brought to you by fresh books the ridiculously easy cloud accounting software I discovered at first  12 years ago when I was a freelancer flying up to vancouver actually was toronto  To do a call for help up there  And you know as many freelancers at the end of every month I had to sit down and it was the worst thing  I hate it if you think you hate paying bills  I make creating bills is just as bad invoicing people  You know, it's you got to sit down with i with word or excel it was I had to bill them in canadian dollars  I had to change the currencies  I you know, I had to figure out what my expenses were so I could you know get them to pay for my travel and  It was just a pain in the butt. In fact, sometimes I just put it off and of course what I learned quickly is you don't  Invoice you don't get paid  It was amber mccarthur who told me about a brand new toronto startup in 2004. It was called fresh books  Here we are 12 years later  And now 10 million people use fresh books and it's not just to do invoices, of course, that's that's where it starts makes it really  30 seconds to a great invoice and because the invoices  Have a button on them that says pay me, you know, they they support online payments. You're going to get paid an average of 11 days  11 days faster  You'll invoice faster you get paid faster. You can also see which invoices have been sent viewed even yes viewed  So, you know more clients saying I didn't get your invoice. Yes, you did. In fact, you looked at it yesterday  I see that right here and paid you'll also know what's overdue what's outstanding and you can even send a gentle reminder or not  So gentle reminder they'll do that automatically  If you're you know, if they're late, but but it's not about that  It's really about making it easy for your clients. So you get paid faster. Everybody's happier. You can even set up recurring payments  So not only do you send out an invoice automatically they pay you automatically and believe it or not a lot of clients like that  Freshbooks now is really a total accounting solution the fresh books dashboard brand new front page  Will tell you something so many freelancers don't know whether you're making a profit  Because they know your expenses they know your accounts receivable  They can tell you there's even times tracking built into the website and their fresh books app. So if you bill by hours  You can you can easily incorporate that into the invoice automatically even divide it up by project and client  Track your time to the minute you can manage team time sheets. That's in there too  Track expenses and when you when it's time for tax time soon  Uh your accountant will love it even if you are your own accountant because you can get all those, you know  Accounting reports like sales tax summary profits and loss statements and all of that  So the dashboard is great for you because you don't have to be you know, a bookkeeper to understand it  You know exactly where you stand and when you do need those  Specific reports for your bookkeeper. You've got those two  Freshbooks.com join the 10 million small business owners who use fresh books  Free do it right now for 30 days freshbooks.com slash twit  And enter this week in tech if you would when they ask you how did you hear about us?  Because that way we'll we'll get credit  freshbooks.com slash twit we thank you so much for their support of this week in tech. Did you see  This story in fact was just on snopes and snopes says whether because of this  The way security services work. We can't really verify this story  But I feel like it. I think it's true  uh sid bikin avar is a  Scientist at jpl the jet propulsion lab  He's us born. He's a citizen. He's a nasa engineer traveling with a valid u.s passport. He was in south america  For car racing because he does that when he tried to get back in  early this month  He was detained by homeland security  He was stuck in a room where people were sleeping on cots the people stranded under the muslim ban  They seized his phone and wouldn't give it to him until he gave him access  For the pin now. He said this wasn't even my phone. It was a jpl issued  Phone and he had been instructed to keep it secure  For  But they also told him the cpb told him if you don't give us the phone you're gonna be sitting here for a while  We do have cots so you can rest  So he said, all right, i'll give you the phone and the pin  He said half an hour later. They came back with the phone after having copied  His data he says i'm now this is his facebook post and the reason he posted is  I am i'm removing my facebook page. I'm removing my social media accounts until I know what they got and what they want  They have passwords they have everything and he's been he gave his phone to jpl to run forensics on it  They were apparently fairly upset about it  And he's working with legal counsel at jpl  so  This is important. This has been the case for some time, but I think it's ramped up  When you enter the united states whether you're a citizen or not  They can go through your bags, right?  But the issue is can they also go through your electronics and lately the opinion has been of the cpb and of  federal officials that they can  They have the right to look at your computer the right to look at your phone  My I guess my advice and my what my practice will be  Is it enough to just turn off everything before we re-enter the us because i'm going to be traveling this year  Ed what do you think ed you're muted? I think to turn it off. Yeah that oh there you go. Now you're back

Transcript:  Oh, I was yeah, maybe that was us sometimes. I mean, yeah, I think so because I don't recall muting and at any rate  Probably the border protection folks did that to me  No, what I would do is let ed speak  if if I had sensitive data on my  On my computer  First of all, it would be encrypted  And I wouldn't give up the password for that for any kind of social media apps  If I were in a situation where I felt I were at risk of being  Searched and having that information inspected at the border. I would delete the app  And wipe out the cache on my phone before I re-entered  Because at that point at that point there's nothing they can do and it's trivially easy  Once you get back into a place where you feel safe to reinstall the app  Or go to a different device enter your password do the 2fa and uh, and you know and and and there you are  Uh, but but no I would I would literally for social media in in particular  It's that the simplest and best solution is to simply delete those apps and wipe the cache

Uh, that's that's just information that but it isn't incriminating  Uh and a password or anything that's in your mind  The police don't have the right to that because of the fifth amendment and the right against self-incrimination  so  but note  That might be different coming over the border  They the border patrol people and the eff has weighed in on this and say, you know, technically  ACLU said if you're asked for your pin or password  call us  But you want to come home?  Yeah, you don't want to be spending the next few days in detainment at an airport airport jail cannot be good  uh, and  I I can see why?  bickanavar and almost anybody else would say well fine just take the uh  pin rory cell and jones who writes for the bbc writes about technology brock has about technology really great guy  Ask the british embassy what their advice would be if you're going into the united states  Actually, i'm sorry the u.s. Embassy in london all international travelers arriving to the u.s  By the way, apparently all all american travelers as well are subject to u.s. Customs and border protection inspection  This inspection may include electronic devices computers discs drives tapes mobile phones other communications devices cameras music  And music why do they want my music music and other media players and any other electronic or digital devices?  Keeping america safe and enforcing our nation's law in an increasingly digital world depends on our ability to lawfully examine all materials  entering the united states  uh, so assume  that you will that you're subject to this and um  Golly, this makes me sad that uh, yeah, and the reason is I you know, I think that  To some people your luck searching your luggage and searching your digital devices is equivalent  To what should it be?  Should it be isn't isn't your digital device? This is really the debate this goes back to san bernadino  And the pin number and fbi wanting access to that phone  It feels to me like a phone has more of your personal stuff in it than your suitcase

That's well within their rights to make that's interpreted the wrong way  You know, you could people could be detained  Or questions to be asked and in that that's kind of a scary place to be  I'm very fortunate and that I have a lot of privilege having you know, uh, and a last name and and a skin color that  That might preclude me from some of these things  But that doesn't mean that it it's it's not a real problem and that I i'm not concerned  Um as as a journalist at this state in time, you know leaving  When things are the way that they are

My worry is that we have all these, you know  Just normal civil workers people who are just doing their job  But at you know, the stroke of donald trump's pen they become willing participants in his like vision of fascism  And that's kind of how it begins, right? It's just people doing their job somebody doing their job  They take your phone somebody doing their job to detain you here  Authoritarianism creeps up. Yeah slowly. It's terrifying. Yeah  Yeah

Uh, and and you know, so you gotta push back on stuff like this and to your point about it being inconvenient to be  Uh to be stuck in an airport, you know, I appreciate that  On the other hand, I appreciate the fact that uh, there are people whose names are attached to  uh  landmark court decisions who  Did more than just inconvenience themselves?  Uh, they they they put themselves in harm's way and and spent years  fighting back  So that so that they could establish these principles so if somebody wants to do that to me  Uh, you know great. Let it be, you know bot versus the united states. We'll uh, you're volunteering good for you.

End time: 2264.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

I think that there is a group of people who are in it for the lulls  That's the 4chan people  I don't I think there's more than that. There there are a lot of reasons, uh  Why this is going on, but it's a very interesting read  And I think it's worth it's worth reading  It's on medium  Uh, and he says, uh, you know, he he was an early 4chan user and back before 4chan a form.

Start time: 2428.46
End time: 2434.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And but that's where these guys came from right? They kind of be yeah, not everybody look I played violent video games  We all probably did but but a certain percentage of people  Um became very antisocial  uh, and uh, and and a culture was created I think you can't disagree that  That there was a culture created and and that's created. Um  I I I know it's really politically incorrect to say this  But I kind of feel like that's what happened

Start time: 2464.28
End time: 2479.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean there are separate things right? There's the culture there's you know gamer culture in general  And there are like subsections of that and I don't I don't know. I don't know if I blame the games themselves  It could be anything it could be any sort of game like this. No, but I don't mean the game. No, no, please

Start time: 2479.30
End time: 2541.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't get I don't I don't know. I'm not blaming the game, but i'm blaming this kind of isolated culture. So  Yes, yeah  kids in the last  20 years  Have had the opportunity just to kind of not go outside  Uh, not even relate to people in real life irl  But instead relate to people on the internet relate to people, uh through forums and gaming and and become uh, you know  I feel like it fostered  a kind of lonerism  that is  as it turns out could be  Destructive not only to the person but to the rest of the world  I think trolling is a result of it  I think trolling is the direct outcome of this and the for the lulls and and a lot of this I  I maybe it's I want you to talk me out of it. Maybe i'm just an old man now and it's just uh you kids  You see I told you you shouldn't you should get out some fresh go get some fresh air. I told you  Except i'm not just the kids. Yeah, well me too. I spent the kids

Start time: 2543.41
End time: 2546.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  They're your guys age, right? Right

Start time: 2548.94
End time: 2584.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But but I also think that part of it is that there became like social currency and I mean real social currency in pop culture  in other places where acting, you know  like a troll  Would would lead to a certain amount of popularity and fame and attention  so  You know like there's there there are whole television networks and shows and and real entertainment  They're kind of built on these same sorts of jokes tv's just as much to blame  And so I mean honestly, I would say that I mean if there's any blame at all to be said, I I don't know  I think blame's not the right in certain ways blame is a mistake

Start time: 2584.98
End time: 2591.06

Thank god. I remember in high school  Thermonuclear war. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I would that's my generation in high school  um, you know, I had that same kind of snarky and I knew others that had that same kind of screw it all  Make fun of establishment mentality that jokey mentality, but I couldn't  I couldn't weaponize it because it was just a few of us and there was no way to talk to everybody else who was doing that  But now it's been I think it got weaponized by the internet

Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think so. There was that so there was the whole there was a whole book  That was that was written about that and it's a it's a very very good book and and worth reading  But I think the second thing that's maybe more important is that our our social media networks  Have made the same mistake that the internet made in its early days. It was designed  optimistically  Uh nobody so the internet was designed assuming that people were good and benign assuming that right  that uh and and  so instead of  So twitter for example was uh, you know nobody ever thought  Nobody at twitter, you know, uh ever thought jack and evan those guys never thought  that uh nazis  Would take over twitter if you had told them that in 2007  When you know the first tweet said just setting up my twitter

Start time: 2775.36
End time: 2844.76

Transcript:  Let that's the mistake but that's the mistake the mistake has always been that  Uh bad speech a small amount of bad speech  Can always drown out good speech. That's why  That's why you don't read the comments because the number of trolls we've learned that lesson, haven't we holy? Yeah, you know  But but I mean that and most of these systems were were never designed in in such a way  that they could  resist  the cancer  of  of of these, you know of hate speech  and  And malicious and actors with malicious intent  And as a and because these things were designed mostly to make money and to grow big  quickly  Without without any concept of of how to grow big  Safely and securely for the entire community. That's how you got  Viruses for pcs. That's how you got spam taking over entire email servers and that's how you have  Nazis taking over twitter

Transcript:  I don't fake news taking over facebook. The interesting thing is I think a lot of these aren't really nazis. I watched um,  And boy, it was painful milo yanopoulos on bilmar this week. It was really painful  But he's the guy who was banned on twitter because he used his real name and he said i'm not doing you know  He's one of those people  I might have been that kind of person. I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just having fun  Unlike that he obviously likes the intention. I don't think he I think it's possible probably he doesn't believe anything  He's saying but he masked an army of people on twitter and the reason he was banned not because of the things he said  But because the things he said incited whole groups of people to go after other people  Uh, he was very adept at manipulating a mob on twitter in effect  And I watched him and I think that a lot of these people are like him. I don't know if they they're not  ideologically  Nazis, they're probably not even ideologically racist. They're in it for the lulls. It doesn't matter. I agree. It doesn't matter  Yeah, it doesn't matter. But this is so this pewdiepie story is is related right because pewdiepie of course  We've talked about this a little bit  But he was banned in fact, I got a number of tweets last week after talking about it saying you misunderstood this entirely  pewdiepie  Uh was banned, uh from he had a deal with maker studios part of disney and  Well, actually, let me tell you what happened and then  And then we'll take a break because ossy geek girl in the chat room has to go to the bathroom  but as soon as uh, I go through this so, uh,  Uh, what pewdiepie says he did is there's a service called fiverr two r's you give somebody five dollars to do stuff  And he thought well, it'd be fun  If he just tried it and paid five bucks to get somebody to say death to jews  And a couple of guys in india took the money  Pewdiepie then and this is all on the video and you can't see it's been taken down  professed shock and dismay that fiverr would a allow him to do that and b that somebody would take the five bucks and do it  Oh my god, i'm shocked and this is kind of what pewdiepie does is this kind of  This is this is how he gets how you get 53 million subscribers on youtube  and uh  But you can't but he crossed the line obviously and this kind of anti-semitism will not stand disney dropped him  Even youtube didn't they didn't kill his channel's notice.

Transcript:  um, but I think this is another example of this kind of culture where  Oh, look what I did  and the question is is  Is it okay is is say is  Is  And I think so the the the emails and tweets I got were well, you don't understand pewdiepie  This is he's mocking he's showing he's showing holding up a mirror to culture and mocking the culture and that's a sense of humor  It's funny  Right, and I remember when I was 16 doing kind of not that bad  But doing snarky funny kind of sarcastic anti-establishment stuff  But it's been weaponized now, right pewdiepie did it for an audience of 53 million people on youtube  Yep, and you did it in your friends. You did it my friends and we left and they kind of knew the context and that  That was it

Transcript:  And I sure didn't do it for a teacher or a parent. Well, I mean, I think people have made the the kind of the  The comparison said why is what pewdiepie did?  Not okay and what you know south park and it's always funny in philadelphia and other programs do why is that okay?  I mean, and I think that's a fair question ben could share at polycon wrote  I thought that his response was pretty good to that. He was like, well, they're funny and  Pewdiepie's big biggest sin was his  But is that a crime not being funny?  Well, I mean I think that if you're going to actually try to shed a light on a you know  A social mirror or a construct of these sorts of things  You have to do with a certain amount of nuance and you have to do it with with a certain  Deafness that he didn't have obviously  Having said that even if he had been very very funny and very skilled in the way he did it  I still think that there would have been backlash and  I mean, that's fair. Both things are fair to me  I think that he has the right to make videos that say whatever he wants to say  And and whether his jokes are funny or not if his audience enjoys them  Even if they don't enjoy them, he has the right to make those videos  By the same token, you know advertisers and companies like the walt Disney company have the right to say  We don't want to be associated with this sort of content. Both things to me are completely fair  He can continue making his videos  Advertisers can come can say we will or we won't right allow advertise on with you

You know, that's just the way it works  But I feel like we've spanned so much in this conversation leo  So I just want to quickly say like the bigger problem for me isn't that you know  It started with all these kids just being at home alone and you know not allowed to go outside  But it is the power of communication and what the internet enabled you could look at talk radio  You could look at so many things reality tv, you know what people watch and do  Extends far beyond the internet, but the internet became the tool for rallying together  So yeah, I my early time on the internet  I spent a lot of time uh chatting with people about video games and anime and stuff like that  And now you go and look at kind of the subcultures that are forming around some things. It's gross  It's disgusting because of kind of what the internet has become and how widespread it's become  So yeah, that's it's a problem of communication and my big worry is yeah this loss of empathy

It was the first use of mass media for very much the same thing  And film so oftentimes new technologies  Uh offer new opportunities and there's I think there's never been a more powerful technology than the internet  and  But ad you said this is the inevitable consequence.

I said it's uh  It's something that needs to be taken into account during the design  Process for any kind of system  Like this, uh, I don't know, you know, I mean certainly twitter  there's  There's a million things that twitter could be doing and they're doing and and they're doing one or two maybe  Uh, and you know you say, uh, oh, I don't think these people are literally nazis  But you know what if somebody if and I know people and mostly they're women  uh, who whose  Twitter feeds have been polluted.

Well, the supreme court actually came up with the test it  Uh  in miller versus california the test was  Serious, let's see if it's utterly without socially redeeming value  Then it's pornography if it uh, if it lacks serious literary artistic political or scientific value  those are  You know, I I mean I could look at at pewdiepie  Is there is there any redeeming social value in the work that he did?  Is there any serious literary artistic political or scientific value there?  Perhaps let someone make the case for that. I feel like but you know what some random  twitter  Account with a pepe the frog beam attached to it that is uh spewing  pictures of  of auschwitz  To people with jewish last names there's you know, I I think twitter ought to be  Canceling those accounts and making sure that the people behind those accounts don't recreate them  You know, it doesn't seem they say they're doing that although I haven't seen any evidence of that

I come from white privilege, right? So i'm not going to suffer  Uh, and of course, it's the ultimate white privilege to say oh, this is just joking. It's you know kids being kids  No harm's meant  It's not a muslim ban  um, uh  Because I I don't have to worry about it  Uh, so i'm trying I i'm it's very I am challenged and I bet you many of us are challenged  About how to think about this what it really means where we're headed. What is the upshot of this?  I really thought the internet was going to be a voice for everybody the ultimate democratization  Uh, it was going to it was going to liberate the world  And it's very sad if this is the final  Result that's I I can't accept that there's got to be a way forward

Transcript:  I wouldn't say this is the final result, but this is a result, right? This is the  it's a result of many things to it's a response to um, you know having barack obama as president for eight years to like that's  led to a lot of  A lot of resentment a lot of pushback in other ways in politics and that kind of led to trump as well  There's a lot more going on I agree yeah, we're stepping through  You know these stages as a society the the internet now is the greatest communication device we've ever had  What i've always loved about twitter is that it's sort of like that to me  It's like the matrix timeline of what's going on in the world, right?  It's just like looking down seeing code and like seeing what's happening in the world  And that's there's good and bad to that and we have to figure out how to move beyond that  But I also think we kind of have to yeah get a little more enlightened as a culture to do that

Yeah, so that's the one thing and and the other thing that I just thought was weird  Was to do this thing.

Um pro rather, you know, you've got the macbook which starts at  1300 dollars so or or 1200 dollars. So you're you're in a spot where  This kind of is  They're they're less expensive option

They're not even someone the first iphone app  Yeah, that one's nice  But compared like to the earlier iphone ads and the ipod ads like I remember seeing the first commercials for the iphone 7  And it was so weird and dark and fetishistic like it was like a david fincher commercial  For like, you know a very dark movie like look at this all black iphone. Isn't this amazing?  There's nothing there was no fun about it  There wasn't anything about how this would make your life better  It was more like look at this awesome model is of a thing  And I I don't know if they can get their messaging back.

These are the first and dell's doing it now in asus mid-range  Not super cheap, but not pixel expensive chromebooks, right?  And i'm starting to wonder really if a tablet is the right choice for a lot of people that  For a student, I don't think a tablet of any kind is the right choice when you can compare it to a chromebook  a 450 dollar chromebook with touch with a pen  Convertible with the android store and chrome os.

Transcript:  And I just feel I'm I'm just seeing more people do it  Yeah, I I don't think I would be able to do it  But I do think that with the the keyboards the the new ipad pros I have the 9.7  I the other one is you know, the the big 13 inches too big  Um, it's a very powerful machine and and I think word on the ipad is  Fantastic and you can do a lot of stuff with that and the split screen stuff does work very well  And some of the creative apps from people that i've talked to who are more creative than I am or at least have better drawing skills  Than I do really like things with the apple pencil  And can do a lot of work on it  but I I don't know if if it's if you I don't think I'd be more productive on an ipad than I would be  on a computer whether it was it was windows or a mac, but I do think that you can be a lot more productive than you might  Initially expect which might just be the point of these ads which from I mean, you know in in fairness to apple  I think that this is strictly a youtube campaign  I don't think that these are actually going to be area on television  That doesn't necessarily you know make them any better, but I think it puts them in a slightly different  Qualitative thing in in the you know apple marketing  I guess hierarchy of youtube ads are a little bit less than television ads

Because they they they don't I mean their cycles are  You know a year  They don't have a huge range of products  They've kind of really doubled down on certain kind of pathways  Uh, and and and on the pc side and on the chromebook side you're seeing much more vibrant ecosystems much faster cycles  Uh android phones, you know, I look at something like this surface studio  This microsoft, uh, you know touch  Hybrid thing it's probably a limited market. But the fact is there's much more choice  Out there and I feel like in the long run  Apple's almost a monoculture and it's going to hurt it in the long run  Because they can't throw things against the wall in the way that the chrome in the book industry the android industry the windows industry can do  Is that does that make sense? What do you think david?

Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's uh apple's in a really strange place, right?  Because they've been so innovative for so long with the iphone the ipad and that's all worked out really well for them  and it feels like things have been really  Kind of static for the past couple years, you know  The biggest thing they've announced was the apple watch and they didn't even quite know what to do with that  It was almost inevitable, right?

Transcript:  Yeah, it's the innovation the innovator's dilemma. I think there's a name for that  Um, but yeah in these in cases like this like apple has in the past just kind of killed its starlings  You know when the iphone came out we knew that was going to kill the ipod  When the iphone came out, um, and that ended up happening eventually  But apple could do that as a company, but now they've gotten so like  They're they've been living off of iphone profits for so long  And that's been so good for them  I don't know what they could do that would be hugely transformative moving forward and even basic things too like the apple tv  I think they finally started doing some stuff with it, but there's still no cave 4k version yet  There's still a lot of that hasn't fully lived up to its potential either  So they're in a weird spot right now and yeah, just look at that last batch of macbooks

Transcript:  This article from bloomberg alex webb and alex sherman writing apple struggles  To make big deals hampering strategy shifts. I have a big problem with that article. Yeah, okay good  So let's talk because I had never heard this particular point of view  um  So what so tell me what your problem?

Start time: 4831.26
End time: 4950.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What does the article say and what are your problems with the article is basically saying that they don't make enough big deals and that  They should be working with more mna  Advisors and and big banks to acquire big companies and then they need to make they need to buy netflix  Basically, that's what the article is saying  They need to buy netflix because that's the only way they're going to be innovative and the fact that they have historically  Beats was the biggest acquisition at three billion dollars, you know, most of their acquisitions have been under 500 million  Um, you know, they make mostly smaller acquisitions that that's a problem and that that's holding them back  I think that that thesis in and on its face  Is untrue, I mean you can make arguments that maybe they should be  As a company making bigger strategic bets in other ways, but I don't think for instance that apple spending 19 billion dollars on whatsapp  The way that facebook did would have in any way opened them up to a newer market or would have helped them in any conceivable way  I don't think that apple, you know making some of the acquisitions that some other companies do would change anything buying netflix  A that's not possible if that was possible it would have been years ago, but it's not a possibility  They would have to do do I think they should spend their entire cash reserves to buy netflix because they want to get into video  No, I mean, I think that that's  That that makes very little sense if you wanted to talk about, you know buying the wall disney company or or buying, you know  Time Warner which was apparently something that they discussed at one point that might might make more sense if they were trying to do that  But I think that the argument that the article is making is that the reason that they're they're not as innovative is because they're not  Making enough big enough acquisitions and I just I don't think that's the case at all. I I think  I would if you could show me one acquisition that they missed out on  That would have ended up paying huge dividends for them that and if you could also show me conceivable proof  The reason they didn't get that acquisition was because they weren't willing to pay that might be one thing  But as it stands, I mean, I think john gruber did a pretty decent analysis of this too  You know, this was a lot of uh of mna people complaining that apple doesn't do enough

Start time: 4951.62
End time: 4967.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but it was also I mean, I think the revelation of it was that apple  Is arrogant when it comes to market. They don't they don't work with investment bankers. They dictate terms  They say take it or leave it  Uh, and this isn't how you make deals they have the money

Start time: 4968.06
End time: 5009.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, you're not wrong. But but again, I mean I would feel a lot better about this that supposition if you could show me  What's a big deal they lost out on what should they buy right what they should have bought because again  You look at the big acquisitions that google and facebook have made and even some of the ones that the microsoft has made  You know microsoft made a great acquisition of linkedin, you know, 25 billion dollars or whatever it was or was it more than that?  That made sense for microsoft strategically that would not make sense for apple strategically. So  You know other than other than I mean I look at that and I see as investment makers  Upset that they're not led into enough deal flow and also investors who are mad that apple didn't buy netflix and it's like  Netflix isn't gonna sell anyway, like netflix is not gonna sell like I don't

Start time: 5010.08
End time: 5037.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and in a way that the the article tanks itself because  After they show the graph of the big deal famines and how little money apple spent  They say right in clinton instead of closing big deals cook has so far focused on growing apple service businesses  Including apple music the app store and iCloud that's beginning to work  Yeah, the company recently forecasting annual revenue of 50 billion dollars. They made 23 billion dollars last quarter alone on services. So  Gee, this has been a terrible strategy

Start time: 5043.24

Transcript:  Basically, you know basically apple is in the position now  That microsoft was in in around  they were  You know the the cloud stuff was taking off, but nobody could really see it yet

Start time: 5059.12
End time: 5065.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were a dominant monopoly in desktop software and operating systems and they were  minting money

Start time: 5067.12
End time: 5169.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they were using that to build another business another cloud business and diversify themselves  And and so what you have right now with microsoft is a company that has  You know 10 or 12 different businesses that are each worth  You know several billion dollars in revenue per quarter  Uh, you know, that's I mean that's really well  Seven or eight that are worth at least a billion dollars per quarter and collect and several of them that are worth much more than that  And as a result, you know, they've managed to be successful even when many people had written them off  apple is  apple can coast  On the kind of growth scenarios that you just described things like services for for another 10 years continuing to grow  In a way that would be healthy for any other company except for the fact that they're the largest corporation in the world  um, and and they need to find  You know, they they need to diversify because at some point  The iphone is going to become the next ipod and and you know, like you said, you know with the  With the innovator's dilemma there they have, you know, they need to find another hit in there  but you know, but when you get you know, bloomberg and  In other publications they are writing for investors. They are writing for people who are buying stocks  They're they're not writing for the people who buy the products and they're not writing for the people who make the products  They do have a you know, so the the point about making deals is just well  That's traditionally the way that smaller companies get larger, but apple I mean, they're so huge  Really? There's there there's almost no companies that you can think of that they could buy that would allow them to actually grow

Start time: 5170.30
End time: 5210.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although maybe some good options would be the companies that they've consistently failed to make deals with right?  Like so the time Warner thing kind of made sense  We've been hearing them having a lot of trouble trying to form deals with cable networks for some sort of like over-the-top apple tv  Uh, you know content distribution there. So that's where I think it'd be good  As we're pointing out like apple is going to be in a good place for a while tim  That's what tim cook is good at but it's also like yeah microsoft back a decade ago  Bomber was really good at kind of you know, making money at a certain point  But not as much with the big ideas and the big innovations and then we've seen microsoft make some big shifts with satya satya nadela  I'm wondering like yeah, what does apple need to kind of get that mojo back?

Start time: 5211.92

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's interesting. I'm looking at the not and again, you mentioned this is stock price isn't  Uh, isn't everything by any means but i'm looking at microsoft's i've screwed up the the graph somehow i'm looking at microsoft stock price  Uh, and the period that you mentioned they've been flat for years, you know, they're big microsoft's big stock growth  Was in the late 90s  Uh, they've been flat for years  and then uh  So this is the big growth here then flat flat flat flat flat then along comes satya nadela  And a new attention to the cloud and microsoft's been really on a tear over the last three years. Yeah  So it is very telling I remember for years we said, you know, well microsoft stock yawned what you know, it's why is it going nowhere?  Um, so so there is so this would be something to set for that strategy. What would you do though if you're apple?  I mean, this is challenging  You can you can only sell so there's only so many people in the world

Transcript:  In fact, they're hurt a little bit by all these supply chain leaks now  because  Last couple iphone announcements we knew what we were going to get ahead of time took all the fun out of it  Uh  Show today brought to you by having fun with this great panel of people from ed bod at zd net to christina warren  From gizmodo and gadgets to vendra harder war  You guys are great  Fight, you know, I like to have panels in in in studio with us  But somehow skype doesn't seem to slow any of you down you do great  I appreciate it  Our show today brought to you by a fantastic product called  The tracker it's a bluetooth tracker. I think a lot of times  I want to kind of do a little education on the tracker people look at it and they assume  Oh, that's a gps device. It's not because you couldn't that would be crazy talk  You'd have to you have to charge it up every night. It wouldn't be a very useful tracker  Uh, and it couldn't be the size of a quarter and it couldn't weigh, you know, just a few grams  What this is is it bluetooth device that pairs to your gps in your smartphone?  And helps you locate anything you lose  According to newsweek the average american spends 55 minutes a day  Looking for stuff they own but can't find  55 minutes a day  L-e  for looking for lost keys and wallets and luggage and musical instruments and bicycles and  pets  55 minutes a day and all you got to do is put a tracker on them  You can pair up to 10 trackers to your smartphone. It's bluetooth le so the battery lasts a good long time  and  Tracker is one of the few bluetooth tracking devices that has a replaceable battery  So there's you know  It really bothers me that some of these other devices when the battery does you throw you're expected to throw it out  And buy another one not the tracker easy to pop in a new battery and get another year  You can you can customize two-way separation alerts  So if you leave your key, let's say I put them on my keys  If I leave the keys behind my phone goes hey you left the keys behind if I leave my phone behind  The tracker beeps at me. There's even a button on the tracker. You can press it'll make your phone  Scream, even if it's silenced so you you know, that is really useful  It's about the only thing I ever use the apple watch for frankly  You don't need an apple watch you can get a 30 tracker to do it for you now  The neatest thing about the tracker they've sold they're selling like hotcakes. I talked to them a little while ago  I think they were doing 100 000 new trackers a week three and a half million devices shipped  And that's a good thing for you as a tracker owner  Because of the tracker crowd gps network the largest in the world. In fact, if you show that map  And scroll out you'll see there's trackers all over the world  So here's why this is a good thing for you  When you get out of a hundred foot range, obviously bluetooth isn't going to track  So you'll have on your phone the last place it saw the phone  But what if somebody picks up your keys and mails them to malaysia?  Why I don't know because they're bad people  Well now you think your keys were left in las vegas, but they're actually in malaysia. How would you know that?  Well, there's tons of tracker owners in malaysia  And if any one of them walks by your keys with the tracker in it their phone goes. Oh, I see leo's keys  And sends you a message  So so this is really awesome you're it's like you have three and a half million people helping you find your things  Go to the tracker.com and never lose your possessions again. Actually, the hardest thing to find will be the site  Because they spell it funny t h e t r a c k r no e at the end there.

I reason I bring that up is we is you know, we're  It's going to be that crazy season again mobile world congress is coming up  We're to see new samsung phones next month the galaxy s8 not at mobile world congress, but after  HTC is doing something interesting. Apparently they've they're eschewing the low end  And they're going to go with high-end  Hardware, they're going to kind of follow the apple route apple's always avoided the inexpensive phones  This they've announced this a month or so ago and i'm hoping we're going to get it soon  I ordered one, you know, because I want to review it. This is the htc ultra  It's all about you the letter you  And uh, you know, there's some personalization features and so forth htc has always had interesting  Audio stuff. They also have a second screen with icons on it  That they've they've also abandoned the headphone jack. They're going to have a type c jack  But they're uh, one of the things that they're justifying that with is this kind of uh, weird  And I don't know how it's going to work  Uh audio thing where you put in the headphones and it creates a personal audio profile  I don't know if you have to do as you have to do with samsung a hearing test samsung does that  Uh, or if it just somehow knows  It sounds like it just somehow knows because your inner ear is as unique as your fingerprint  htcu sonic audio platform analyzes your analyzes your inner ear  And automatically adapts the sound profile to optimize your listening experience  Sure, okay, sure, whatever sure that's a thing  It's not a thing, but maybe it is maybe I just didn't know I bet you have to do a hearing test  um  Why did I bring this up? Oh, I know why they're so grateful that I pre-ordered one  They sent me a backpack with all these toys in it  And a personalized thank you note, oh nice with little android toys and a thermos bottle and a  t-shirt  Does now I don't think I don't think that I think they say I bet you they're saying this to everybody orders one of  These things because they're expensive.

So that'll probably all be tied into the iphone h or whatever they call it  but you know what valve is uh  Sitting there as a company with a ton of money and with a partnership with a company like this  They should just buy htc just that's what I was thinking about phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's only okay when you're when you're doing it. That's how it goes  But for zuckerberg like I wouldn't be surprised in eight years or even somewhere down the line that he'd be thinking of this because you know  Everything we've read about his personality reading his biographies and everything  It seems like he's changed quite a bit from you know, the early days from his college days  He's built facebook to be a really interesting and fascinating company  I don't think it's going to save the world like he thinks it will but he's a very interesting person, you know to consider in  that sort of role because what he's doing in facebook is  That jump for instagram like you know, um  paying that sort of money, uh, I think ended up  Being a very smart move for him. So there are certain things I think he's doing that could be

Start time: 6769.22
End time: 6793.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Interesting and smart for president. He took a company public that was already making a lot of money and made it incredibly profitable  Like when you compare, you know facebook to to twitter or to snapchat or to any others. He's run a very good business  I don't disagree. Um, and I I also agree with you defender. I had the same immediate like gut reaction  I was like, oh, well, this is definitely part of the stump speech. This is definitely the manifesto that says laying out  You know my my candidacy candidacy

Start time: 6794.64
End time: 6809.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it used to be the way you would do that. By the way is you'd write a book, right every president up to  Obama you write a book books. Yeah. Yeah exactly now but but but zuckerberg is a child of our century and he  Facebook manifesto

Transcript:  If you just if you just cut the right I just make it bigger and just cut the right part off  It looks just like medium  This is why I have a surface studio. I can cut off the ads on the right  So these are the these are the five questions that he wants us to answer  How do we help people build supportive communities by the way note the use of the word community  How do we help people build a safe community? How do we help people build an informed community?  How do we help people build a civically engaged community and how do we help people build an inclusive community? I mean, these are all nice  Anodyne sentiments. There's nothing wrong with any of this  I don't know if it inspires. I don't actually i'm not going to run to the barricades over it, but

Start time: 6870.62
End time: 6895.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it fits into sort of what we were talking about though like the need to kind of change how we are looking at online community  In communication in a way. Um, i'm not a fan of how much facebook has  Basically taken over the internet and instant articles and everything. I love the open internet, but I don't know  Maybe at some point we'll need some sort of ways to kind of  Make it a more welcoming platform for people in general mixed feelings on this

Start time: 6895.32
End time: 6910.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know and I always told people who use medium or facebook to publish that really you ought to own your own and have  Your own website. That's really old-fashioned. Yes, but I mean  Facebook doesn't replace the internet. There's still an open internet. It's just one of the things you can do on the open internet

Start time: 6910.56
End time: 6914.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, okay  And maybe this is a little devil's advocacy and I remember talking to om malik who said this is you know  Rejected it out of hand saying it's just a form of imperialism and india knows better after the raj and the you know english  Colonization of india that not to not to go for these freebies, you know  but  From mark's point of view. He's looking at a giant population that has no internet can't afford an internet  He's trying to find a way to subsidize  Sure part of the internet obviously you can't do the whole thing  But he gives you wikipedia and health women's health centers and things like that in addition to facebook

Start time: 6955.02
End time: 6960.82

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As but i'm just saying like the like the broader picture is like, oh, that's a nice thing to do  But that's not coming without strings. That's coming with strings where you're saying we will be  Deciding what people see and we will be the tunnel in which you see it  And that is a very different thing than saying well  We are going to give free data access to anyone to access it any way they want  No, they're saying we want you to access it through our lens and that's  You know, that's that's understandable. That's that's saying we want to get people online  But not because we want them to be online. I mean, maybe that's part of it. We want them to be online through facebook. And so  Yes, I understand why that was rejected  because  It does come across as very imperialistic where you're saying well  People are going to be gaining access to things. They might not have had access to but instead you're you are, you know  Creating a whole new class of customer who are only going to know the internet as you and not know as as anything else

Instead of even going to a publication website they'll end up on something on facebook. That's what's worrying me

Well, you know everybody's trying these out, you know, we're talking about universal basic income  We're really kind of trying to figure out what is this new world?  Where jobs are disappearing to automation artificial intelligence is spread like a peanut butter over everything  What does this new world look like and how do you survive it? And I I commend people like bill gates for at least  Trying stuff. I don't know what economists might think but we'll take a break and we'll talk about that our show today  By the way, great panel.

I don't know if he's um, just kind of blue skying or if this is  Like serious, but it kind of made sense to me. Maybe that's because i'm not an economist  But he says if robots are going to take our jobs, they ought to be taxed  Yeah, and pay social security. Yeah

But this is kind of how you get that started

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I think you're right because  So many people are moving to automation  Even when it doesn't always make sense, sometimes it totally makes sense to move to automation in some cases  It can actually you know cost more and and and not save  A huge amount of time because they want to cut down on workforce spending and taxes and other things and and that's all well and good  But if you're going to be doing that, I mean, I do think that's a very interesting idea to say  Okay  Well, you've got to at least pay for some of the the corporate taxes or some of the other taxes  That you would be missing out on because of this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the economic concept involved here is called externalities  And it's something that we as a nation, you know  I talked about how the internet was developed without  People thinking about the long-term consequences of how it was being built about how it would be  Well, those are externalities that you know cars were built without thinking about oh all the carbon  they're going to be putting into the environment or all the you know, or or the  The roads that are going to have to be built there  So they were given that the you know, the car makers were basically given free subsidies early on  Because they weren't paying for the externalities the the pollution that their devices  were  Emitting that were causing that were causing impact on third parties everywhere in the world  So it's nice to have someone thinking early on in the process about  building  A way to compensate third parties for externalities, you know into the into the thing, you know, bill gates has turned out to be  Uh, you know, he's he's a pretty smart guy. I'll tell you what I knew him  You know way back when um, and the transformation that he has made  from  you know ruthless capitalist to the guy who uh,  Who?  You know is obsessed he is he is as obsessed with saving the lives of children now  As he was with you know selling pcs back in, you know 1983  uh

Transcript:  It's you know, it's amazing. Did you speaking of that? Did you see I mean speaking of saving lives?  Uh the bill and malinda gates, uh annual letter  This year for their foundation was great. They start with a letter from warren buffett to them  Last december saying, you know, because buffett made a historically huge if I think the huge the largest donation ever in history  to the bill and malinda gates foundation  and he said now  of course, a non-profit a foundation isn't the same as  Uh as a business and so an annual report on your profit and so forth isn't the same thing  But it would be nice for me  and others to know  What you did with my money  In other words a scorecard and I loved it because bill and malinda, uh took him at his word and said, okay  They said 10 years ago when we got first word of your gift to the foundation. We were speechless  It was the biggest single gift anyone ever gave anybody for anything  And we know we owe you a fantastic return on your investment and this is the the return that they said the number of children's lives saved  122 million since 1990

Transcript:  You know, uh, wow and they they explain what this this number comes from the number of childhood deaths  Uh since 1990 kids under five has been cut in half  And it's in great part because of inoculations  That the the gates foundation has provided worldwide reducing childhood mortality  Uh education nutrition they say the best deal is vaccinations  Uh global vaccination coverage is at its highest that it's ever been  And a lot of this comes from that money  That warren buffett and bill and others gave to the foundation  Uh, it's a great letter. So you're right. I think he is a really interesting  um  It's a it's not like andrew carnegie who felt so guilty  right about  trust about the the steel  business and busting unions that he built libraries all over the place to assuage his  Guilty conscience. I think bill really, uh, I don't I don't think he has anything to apologize for for the success of microsoft to change the world  And I love it that he says i'm going to give it all away  And I think warren buffett wants to do the same

Transcript:  And relating it to zuckerberg too like it's nice that he's always looked at  Yeah, like mark is looking at him as a role model and that is probably the best news we could see like look at their foundation  That you know zuckerberg and his wife are starting to yeah, so I think with that sort of role model in place  Yeah, it would be yeah fascinating to see what zuckerberg could do if he were to run as president eventually

Transcript:  Yeah, because well, there's no unlimited it is unlimited but after 22 gigabytes at least with uh, verizon it'll slow down a lot

Start time: 8025.24
End time: 8044.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, 22 gigabytes with verizon. Um, and 28 with t-mobile  23 with sprint and they don't guarantee that they'll slow it down, but they say that they can then there is the limit of tethering  So if you want to use it for hot spot, you're limited to 10 gigabytes of lp  They used to charge for that. That's part of the deal now. So that's good. We used to charge for that

Start time: 8045.32
End time: 8050.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Didn't verizon. Oh, no, they couldn't right they had a consent decree exactly. It was all part of the same thing

Start time: 8050.02
End time: 8091.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think at&t  Um, i'm not sure how it works. I know the at&t unlimited plan does not include tethering at all  um, but verizon and sprint and excuse me t-mobile and sprint used to charge extra if you wanted to use your  Quote unquote unlimited accounts with uh tethering now you don't have to uh, but if you use more than 10 gigabytes  Then you get shut down to 3 g speeds on verizon and t-mobile and 2 g speeds on sprint  Um, but I mean look hell has frozen over right? Like I I don't know about you guys. I never thought  Like in in 2017 we'd be even remotely talking about  With an asterisk or not anything with the word unlimited and verizon in the same sentence

Start time: 8095.64
End time: 8155.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For sure. Yes. Yes, I would say that he definitely  Forced everybody else's hands in my opinion  I think that he with and then t-mobile subscribers have you know gone through the roof like they are still very much in third place  But like they passed sprint and sometime last year and that was a big deal  And and they continue to add new subscribers every single quarter  And I think a lot of it is because john ledger has been so aggressive and t-mobile has been so aggressive with their pricing  That it kind of forced everybody else's hands. And then what happened was when verizon followed suit, which was not expected at least  I was surprised  um, you know t-mobile had to immediately follow up and and take some of the  Worst caveats and their plans and make it part of their official thing sprint had to make changes and then finally, you know  At&t who you know had been a really big holdout almost as big of a holdout as as verizon  Came back and said, okay, we'll do  Um an unlimited plan as well. So you know who I want to give credit to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I I would agree with that. I would agree with that. And then of course that you know now and now it's out the window  Now it's usually out the window in soft bank  It's very interesting, you know before the the rumor was that you know sprint wanted or the the the  Not the rumor the story was you know sprint wanted to buy t-mobile and then sprint would basically run the two companies and now  There was a Reuters report that basically indicates that soft bank is willing to  To sell itself to to doish telecom and basically say okay, how much will you give us?  uh for for sprint  which uh is  We'll see if that would be allowed to happen or not. I mean, obviously at&t was not allowed to buy t-mobiles  sprint wasn't allowed to buy t-mobile  but we'll see with with the different administration if if if  T-mobile and sprint could actually merge

Transcript:  Yeah, and christina you mentioned that you were surprised to see this news, too  I'm actually i'm not that sure about it because I feel like we had to get back to unlimited data  We've been they all these companies have been selling us networks are supposedly super fast crazy fast in some respects  Like lt is faster than most people's home broadband and we have you know, we all are basically driving around with a super powered  It's like we're driving, you know  Really really fast cars and we could just drive them up around the block a couple of times like we've been incredibly limited with these networks  And with it's like owning a ferrari on the 405.

Transcript:  We're gonna we all get unlimited data right as they're about to start the introduction of 5g  And once 5g comes out I guarantee you I guarantee you that there will that these unlimited plans will not work with 5g  They're gonna start the the charging thing all over again  I mean because that's what happened with with 3g right like you had the unlimited 3g  But if you want lte and then for lte you'd have to pay more and then eventually those companies people who were on those  Grandfathered-in-plans were forced to get the 4g support  But it took a while and it took like lawyers getting involved and say no you can't actually elon is gonna fix this

Transcript:  They did file an application uh spacex file an application on tuesday for uh with the fcc  for uh  As many as a thousand satellites to be launched as soon as 2019  Uh, the idea is these are very low earth orbit. That means a low latency, right?  And that's been a problem with satellite internet. It's really the big problem. That's why project loon is thinking about  stratospheric balloons while while mark zuckerberg is thinking about  Killer drones, i'm sorry. It's not killer. It's a killer  drones, uh  Because the lower the better the less latency  And in fact the spacex says that they think latencies will be 25 to 35 milliseconds, which is better than many  terrestrial uh internet service providers  You think this is pie in the sky?  literally  Coffee cans in the sky. Well, anyway, you know much historically, uh, the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The way to bet on any  Technological development on this is to bet against the people who are saying it's going to happen  really soon  and uh and and to put all your chips on on uh, you know about four years after that, uh, because everyone  overestimates the short-term  Uh disruption and then they're disappointed by it  But then in the long term everything turns out to happen and be much more impressive  Than anyone said in the first place. So yeah, this isn't pie in the sky. It's all going to happen  It's just not going to be on any of the timelines that people are talking about right now

Start time: 8414.18
End time: 8449.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean we'll see too like what they're proposing with 5g and everything is that it could  Get us much much faster speeds  Um across longer distances and things like that. So  Yeah, I don't even I don't even know what the point like if 5g is as good as  What they've been building up for so long. Um, yeah  This may be kind of redundant at a point and to what you were saying to christina like, um  Lt isn't going anywhere, right? Um, it may get a little faster once at 5g networks start getting implemented  But even if you're limited to unlimited or sorry  Yeah, if if you're stuck with unlimited lt speeds, I like limited to unlimited. I think that's a good phrase

Start time: 8450.04
End time: 8472.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I agree with you. I agree with you defender. I mean the reality is I mean  I actually  22 gigabytes is pretty good  But at this point I do hope they will and you know  As networks get bigger start to increase those limits because more and more people can start to use  Their phones as their primary isp because frankly it's faster and in many parts of the country  Better than what you might get, you know through through cable
