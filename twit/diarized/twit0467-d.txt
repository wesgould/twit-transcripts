Transcript:  It's time for Twit this week in tech. Ben Thompson from Strattacere joins Dan Gilmore and me as we talk about the week's tech news, those big layoffs at Microsoft, revelations about the security of the iPhone, even iOS 7, and why Netflix seems to have all wrong about me.

How's that going for you?  Good.  And promoting entrepreneurship.  I think promoting entrepreneurship is probably an easier thing to do with young people today.  I think they realize that if they don't make a job, they're not going to have a job in many cases.  Thanks for joining us, Dan. We appreciate it. Also here from Stratecary, one of the most insightful analysts.  I'm quoting him all the time on the scene today. Ben Thompson. Good to have you, Ben. Welcome.  Good to be here.  Monk Bent on Twitter. Is there a beat for Stratecary? I know you do a paid newsletter that's kind of your bread and butter, but you're not aiming at investors or anything like that particularly, are you?

Transcript:  I think, I mean, I do think it's a great, great service for investors because it gives a lot of context to what's happening, but I don't give specific buy-sell advice or anything like that.  Which doesn't limit how much I can charge as well.  But no, I think the way I think about it is I've been doing Stratecary for about a year and a half now and, you know, giving pretty contextual, you know, hopefully very contextual analysis of what's happening in tech.  And what the newsletter just does that is does that every day, three items, not as long as the articles on Stratecary, but much more like direct and to the point, this is what's happening. This is why I think it's happening. Things to think about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's definitely the thing that can be most, the most value added. There's so many voices with the tech news, the tech story, but there's so few, I think, voices talking about what it means.  And I think Dan and Ben are both really adept. That's why we have you on Twit, because that's what Twit's all about too, is trying to understand what's going on.  The biggest story, of course, Satya Nadella dropped the other shoe and is firing 14% of Microsoft's employees, the largest layoff in the history of Microsoft.  They announced this, of course, on Thursday, but Nadella had kind of telegraphed that it was coming in a couple of cryptic emails in which he implied that we are realigning the company.  Most of these employees, something like 12,500 were Nokia employees. So I think while it is a huge layoff, it does seem to me that of these 18,000 jobs, the vast majority really are redundant people that were acquired when they merged with Nokia.  Ben, is this a sign that Microsoft's in trouble or is Microsoft doing the right thing?

Transcript:  Well, it's funny because I've actually been on vacation for the last week, which is unfortunate that these came down at the time.  This is your natural beat, isn't it?  Yeah, yeah. One thing I've written about, probably more than anything else, is Microsoft specifically, the challenges they're facing, how I think they need to align themselves going forward.  And actually, I thought the first memo in particular was very encouraging.  He got you too.  Well, I mean, I'm happy to go to the mat on this. I think a lot of the criticism focusing on word length and all this sort of stuff was...  3,000 words.  But I mean, when you're dealing with a company of 130,000 people, it's easy enough to sit on the side and say, it ought to be like this, without appreciating this is how it works in a very large corporation with tons of people who are going to be hanging every word.  And you know, you're keeping the company moving.  So there's a lot that goes into these emails. I agree in a vacuum, it would be great if they could be short, succinct and punchy with a comedic twist towards the end.  But that's not the way these communications work. And actually, for Microsoft Communications in particular, I thought it was pretty clear.  We're going from a company that just a year ago had their CEO saying everything is about Windows, Windows matters, Windows, Windows, Windows, to a yes, very long email that said the word Windows, at least in the context of the PC operating system, one time.  It said the word Nokia one time. And people focusing on that, oh, there's no change.  Like, could, to my opinion, could not be more wrong with that. And specifically, like it was a complete refocusing of the company.  And, and I wrote, you know, it was very clear that there are further step, there were further shoes to come down. And obviously, one of them came down this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what John-Louis-Guez-Say said. This is the typical email from a CEO. I know I used to be president of Apple, where you where you're you don't want to be too specific.  But you want to kind of be able to point to the email and say, see, I warned you we were going to be laying people off. I told you.

Start time: 445.58
End time: 451.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I mean, the last words that I thought they were quite clear in the email.  It was obvious they were going to have to be. Organizing.

Start time: 451.08
End time: 457.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what? When they acquired Nokia, it was obvious that Nokia has what? 25,000 employees. There were there was a lot of overlap.

Start time: 458.62
End time: 502.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's probably the most disappointing thing. I actually honestly is the fact that hosts Nokia, they're still larger than they were pre-Nokia.  And I've actually been writing and suggesting that they're going to need more layoffs.  There I've been right there. You need laughs before the Nokia thing even happened.  Yeah, which which I do still think is the case.  We talk about being a productivity company where you're not one of the major platforms.  You don't need 100 or that now 105,000 people.  And so I would have been better, in my opinion, to have cut deeper and to try to have done it just one time because I'm not sure that this is going to be enough.  It's pretty clear the stock market likes.

Start time: 503.02
End time: 514.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, John Stockmarket always likes cutting jobs because that means lower costs, theoretically higher profits.  But the stock market reacted pretty well. Microsoft stock took a fairly big jump.

Transcript:  My wife's been socks have been sailing. I mean, they are up like they were at stuck between 25 and 30 for like a decade.  Yeah. And they've been in the 40s for quite a while.  And and again, I don't think that's like I think that's because for anyone that's being serious about it, like there's been very clear shifts like you don't turn an oil.  I was actually I was I wanted to write something.  I was trying to look for the right analogy and try to find like how long does it take like turn a supertanker and write something like like eight hours like once you like start the turning process like it takes.  It doesn't happen right away.  And this is the thing with with Microsoft is if ever there were a supertanker in tech, it's them for better or worse.  And that ends to me.  That first memo was saying, OK, turn starboard and the actual process of turning a starboard to to then express disappointment that it hasn't yet turned around is is to me to be kind of there's a word for it.  I can't know what it is, but it's it's not a nice one.

Start time: 580.87
End time: 595.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You remember you don't want to say it.  Dan, is it like it's sometimes I feel like we're only talking about Microsoft because historically they've been important.  But is Microsoft still relevant in the in a world where everybody's using smartphones and tablets and and the cloud?

Start time: 597.79
End time: 663.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, of course, it's still important.  And everyone's using those things.  But, you know, a few hundred people are also use a few hundred million people are also using PCs and Windows.  So they're clearly important.  There's their document formats are still largely standard.  They're doing a lot of stuff that is going to be with us for a long time to come.  And I agree on that memo.  The it was certainly wordy and it was certainly all over the place.  But you had to read it, I think, in the context of like a State of the Union address where every department in the government is fighting to get some language in where it's almost always a giant mess.  And most presidents go on way too long when they give it.  I think it's in that category.  And I really agree with Ben that this is a significant shift.  I I still don't quite understand why they bought Nokia in the first place.

Start time: 664.20
End time: 671.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, they're retrenching a little bit because there's Nokia X devices, which were Android phones.  Looks like at least some of them are now going to be Windows phones again.

Start time: 672.08
End time: 686.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I'm sorry just to jump in.  But this is the thing that really irks me about this is people saying blame like I don't know, Nadella, but but to blame him for Microsoft State as a lot of this criticism.  Oh, no, he inherited it. No, no, no, no. Yeah.

Start time: 686.30
End time: 691.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, he's doing the best he can to dig out from years of mismanagement.  I think what wasn't just the years of mismanagement, though.

Start time: 692.76
End time: 718.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, what Balmer did on his way out of the company with reorganizing and then buying Nokia like compounded to a significant degree all the problems that Microsoft had and and actually left him with Windows 8, a giant Nokia acquisition and a whole new goal, devices and services.  It's not a goal. It's a tactic and it's a tactic that makes no sense.

Start time: 718.28
End time: 721.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and as Nadella abandoned devices and services as an idea.

Start time: 721.78
End time: 736.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, that was that's that was the best thing about the memo was he actually very explicitly moved on from devices and services.  He's like, this was nice, but we need to move on.  And this is what we're going to do instead.  And so that's I'd have liked to have been at that board meeting.

Start time: 736.36
End time: 747.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Steve Balmer is still on the board.  Bill Gates is on the board.  I'd like to I'd like to be on the fly on the wall.  Satya says, Hey, by the way, we're going to change that.  You know, that devices and services thing, we're not going to do that.

Start time: 748.24
End time: 782.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I have it right here.  Actually, I'm going to quote from the from from the memo.  It says, More recently, we have described ourselves as a quote, devices and services company.  Well, the devices and services description was helpful in starting a transformation.  We now need to hone in on our unique strategy.  Like that is corporate speak for the Lord.  The previous guys messed up and and all this stuff now is about unpacking Steve Balmer's like last six months.  Yeah, it at the time I wrote it, lots of people wrote it.  It still boggles my mind that a he could have done all that on the way out the door.

Transcript:  Patterson in our chat room, Dan says all CEOs have to remodel the kitchen.  Is this kitchen remodeling or is this something going a little deeper?  Oh, it's way deeper.

Start time: 791.38
End time: 842.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's pretty clear that, by the way, when the board hired this guy for the CEO job, they knew what was coming.  He put it this way.  Microsoft is not an incompetent company.  Their board is a bunch of smart people.  Plainly, he said, Here's what I'm going to do if you make the CEO.  And they said, Fine, I'm certainly willing to believe that Steve Balmer was not thrilled with that.  But, you know, he's one guy on the board at this point and owns a lot of stock.  But that's not enough.  I think this is an important shift.  I don't know where it's going to go, but Microsoft certainly was sort of running along in place.  But keep in mind that when they run in place, they're still printing money at a pretty spectacular rate.  But you have to plan for the future.

Start time: 843.02
End time: 872.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know that that's not going to continue forever.  Or you're going to, you know, you know, IBM's still around.  Whether they're as relevant, I don't know.  But, you know, at some point you have to make a shift.  Now, the good news is it strikes me, and I think the reason that Nadella got the job,  because he was running the enterprise side and the Azure side, the cloud side,  the good news is the future strikes me.  The future really is a cloudy future, a cloud-based future.  And that Microsoft is well positioned with Azure to do that.

Start time: 874.01
End time: 907.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The other thing, too, is Nadella opposed the Nokia acquisition.  Did he?  So, I mean, he's, like, he is, you know, he is absolutely 100% cleaning up a mess that he did not create.  And actually, it's that acquisition that, yes, they are smart people on the board,  but I do think I'm going to be looking for changes there over the next year to see, you know,  just how much change the company is really willing to think about and go forward with.  Yeah.

Start time: 908.64
End time: 925.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The devices thought, I mean, I've never been believing that the devices were their future in particular,  but I have to say when they really put their minds to making some good hardware, they do a hell of a job.  And, you know, the Xbox is terrific.

Start time: 926.54
End time: 933.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, okay, Xbox 360 not so terrific, but Xbox One is good.  I mean, they've stumbled a few times.

Start time: 934.38
End time: 962.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have, but they've also gotten some stuff right.  They've created a real platform with the Xbox.  The Surface, the new one, looks really nice to me.  I'm not saying this is, you know, there's an element of, well, let's be Apple in some of the newer stuff,  but that's obviously not going to happen.  And I think they had to cut on that one quickly on the phones because they're just not going anywhere with those.  The other thing...

Start time: 963.08
End time: 1047.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I don't know, but the phones...  Oh, sorry.  No, no, please, Ben.  I would say, well, the phones they're cutting though, they're cutting all the feature phones and all the low-end phones.  Like, they're keeping the Lumias.  And the problem I have with the devices is, you know, the Lumias are very nice and the Surface is,  especially the most recent version, as you said, is very nice.  The problem, though, is the way you sell a device for a premium is because it's differentiated,  and you differentiate it most effectively with your own services and your own software on top of it.  The problem is the motivation to do that is exactly opposite the motivation you need to be a great services company full stop.  A services company needs to work on all devices.  It needs to work on iOS devices.  It needs to work on Android devices.  It needs to work all over the place.  And what's encouraging is Microsoft is making great strides there.  Office for iPad is obviously the most visible part of this.  But it's problematic for the company to have these two diametrically opposed incentives going on.  And especially given its history of being a platform company, of being the Windows company,  it actually strikes me, I think I'm going to write about this for tomorrow as you're getting a preview,  like maybe now, maybe especially with Nokia on board, like this would be the time finally for to think about,  would it be better off being two companies?

Start time: 1048.44
End time: 1065.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Didn't Adela say pretty explicitly, I'm not going to get, despite the fact we're moving away from devices and services,  I'm not getting rid of Xbox.  I think he implied we're not getting rid of Nokia.  We're not going to spin off or stop Surface.  He did kind of put the kibosh on the mini Surface and Windows RT.

Start time: 1066.10
End time: 1077.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's hard to say, though, because he put those way down in the way down the memo and barely mentioned them.  And if you want to get into the kind of like corporate memo criminology that, you know, as a former...

Start time: 1078.88
End time: 1082.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're not on top. They're not drivers, but they're not gone.

Start time: 1083.86
End time: 1112.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true. But it doesn't suggest they hide... you can go either way on this.  Reasonable people can completely disagree.  I suspect Nadella personally is not a fan of this strategy.  I think he's very attuned to the incentive argument that I just laid out, especially with his background.  But it's one of those things like that's a pretty, you know, he's done a lot.  That's going to take more than six months.

Start time: 1113.36
End time: 1153.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, what might be most important to do is to change a toxic corporate culture.  It strikes me, and I'm not an insider, obviously, but when I talk to insiders,  they say that one of the issues for years with Microsoft was you had all these divisions that were really fighting against each other.  And the office division was going to make damn sure that there was no office in the iPad because that would undermine office,  regardless of whether it was a good strategy.  Nadella made sure office on the iPad came out even before office had a touch version for Windows.  He needs to... it strikes me that one of the things he needs to do is get rid of this toxic culture.  The way that they were stack ranking employees, things like that.

Start time: 1154.76
End time: 1163.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that was Windows not letting office be on other platforms because they wanted that to differentiate.  That's right. Right. Right.  Because that was a reason to buy Windows. Right.

Start time: 1164.54
End time: 1168.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. It's too bad they didn't break up the company about 15 years ago.

Start time: 1169.94
End time: 1188.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what Dvorak always called for. He said there should be three Microsofts.  You'd have you'd triple the value because each company has value, but they have disparate goals.  And there's no sense in having it all be one.  I suppose Nadella could still do this, although it seems like that moment has passed.  Yeah. Well, I don't know.

Start time: 1189.28
End time: 1217.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm more it's funny because I'm I'm sympathetic to both arguments on that.  You know, back when the Justice Department thing was, you know, they're having their legal troubles.  Even then, though, like it was still a very cohesive, like positive feedback cycle for the company.  Windows supporting office, supporting servers, supporting office today, though.  I mean, like what is Windows really doing for for Microsoft's cloud services?  It feels like Windows is legacy.

Start time: 1218.60
End time: 1223.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Nadella recognizes this, that he's putting he's saying we're going to be cross platform.

Start time: 1225.28
End time: 1238.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem, though, is like you can say that the CEO can say that.  And this gets into the whole the memo stuff and changing culture stuff.  But to actually have that trickle down through the bureaucracy and to actually have that my question act differently.

Start time: 1238.36
End time: 1243.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is he prepared to reinvent this toxic corporate culture that has held Microsoft back?

Start time: 1244.54
End time: 1250.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, the saying that's pretty true, which is that culture eats strategy for breakfast.

Start time: 1252.97
End time: 1265.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, totally. And the thing about a toxic corporate culture is it's not usually toxic per se.  It's more it's more like rancid.  Like it's like food that was very good.  I think that's much more apt.  Yeah. Microsoft's not toxic.

Start time: 1266.04
End time: 1268.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's rancid because it's it's gone bad.

Start time: 1268.44
End time: 1290.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's gone bad. Yeah, it's not it's not appropriate for the current environment.  And and to me, that's what that's the worry is the everything that support Windows, everything that support our platform and support phone.  That's that's the Microsoft that's worked for them for 25 years.  And now that's exactly what they need to not do.  And I'm not sure that that can be done by Fiat.

Transcript:  I'm suffering still suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome from listening to that call.  And you do this now.  Dan Gilmer is also here.  Great journalist and writer at The Guardian.  But now professor of some lucky students at Arizona State who are getting him in the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism.  But first a word from our friends because I'm going to go to a commercial.  I don't care what you say from Citrix who do go to meeting Citrix.  Go to meeting is the way if you're doing if you've got a team that's spread out, who doesn't now we have people all over the world who work for us.  If you've got clients, people you're pitching spread out, of course, because you're a global entity.  There's really no way to meet with these people in person.  You still got to meet.  You still got a pitch.  You still got to present.  You need Citrix go to meeting.  The number one way to do this.  You share the same screens here all on the same page.  Literally, you turn on that HD video conferencing.  You're literally seeing each other face to face.  It's better than meeting in person.  It's a lot better than a teleconference.  Whenever we're going to do a voice conference, we start to go to meeting because that way you have all of those features available.  You can even present from an iPad or you're mobile, too.  So you can be mobile.  You can be joining a meeting and be presenting.  Start your 30 day free trial of Citrix.  Go to meeting by visiting.  Go to meeting dot com.  Take a look at the features.  I mean, we're talking very nice HD video.  You can have those faces at the top of the screen on the side of the screen.  You can see the screen that the presenters showing the PowerPoint presentation, the spreadsheet, the document you're collaborating on.  It really is the best way to meet from the convenience, not only of your computer, but also your mobile device, your smartphone and your tablet.  And the best part is you pay one low flat monthly rate.  You meet as many times as you want, as long as you want with anyone from anywhere in a single virtual space.  I know teams that keep go to meeting running all day, share screens, present in real time, turn on those webcams.  You're going to love it. Go to meeting.

You know, one of the things and we've played this, you know, it all started, I think it was Monday or Tuesday.  I saw Veronica Belmont post on Google Plus.  She said I was on the we're moving and we wanted to replace Comcast.  Comcast with a stand, which they're lucky they live in San Francisco.  There are other choices in most of the country.  About 80 percent really only has choice between their cable company and their phone company.  So we called Comcast and tried to cancel.  Veronica is on the phone with him for 10 minutes.  Ryan, her husband's listening.  Of course, Ryan, we all know both of them have been on the show many times.  Ryan's listening and here's Veronica become increasingly frustrated.  Fortunately, he starts a recorder and the whole world heard the customer service call from hell.  I'm not going to repeat it because you probably all heard it by now.  You have to fill out your form.

Transcript:  You want to punch the guy now.  That's only minute 12.  It goes on and on and on.  Ryan says in his post on the SoundCloud post of the audio that he'd already given the guy the reasons.  It wasn't that he was withholding anything.  The guy didn't want to hear the reasons.  And what we've learned since and we've I've received Jeff Jarvis received.  Others have received messages, emails, posts from former Comcast representatives, current Comcast customer service folks, third party Comcast customer reps.  And all of them pretty much agree that the issue is the corporate culture that Comcast in effect pays these guys a certain amount.  And every time somebody cancels on their watch, they lose money.  And at some point they can get down to minimum wage if enough people cancel on their watch.  In fact, you'll hear the rep very early on say, can't you just go to the Comcast store and cancel there?  That's not because he's trying to keep Ryan from canceling.  He's trying to keep grinding from canceling on on this phone call.  But this is another issue that I didn't know about.  This was from a bin, a paste bin post that went to Jeff Jarvis.  The big issue Comcast is a guy who's a Comcast rep.  The big issue Comcast reps face the systems we use are broken.  As Comcast has essentially bought its way to the top, the computer programs haven't been upgraded.  You know what? I always thought this because you hear you're on the line with it and there's long pauses.  He says frequently I have to restart my computer with a customer on the phone, but I'm not allowed to tell them that.  Comcast doesn't want the customer to know that their systems aren't perfect.  Time is money. If Comcast can push the blame onto the customer as fast as possible, that's the best result.  He says the whole system, this is a toxic culture.  Comcast apologized to Ryan said we're going to look into this is never going to happen again.  Ryan Block, very, I think rightly so, said on Twitter, I don't want you to fire the guy.  I want you to reinvent yourself so that you're not a company that promotes this kind of behavior.  Who hasn't had this happen to them?  In fact, Ryan works at AOL, who is notorious for this kind of customer retention.  Have any of you, either of you had calls, customer service calls like this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, God, who hasn't?  Who hasn't?  It's, you know, getting a new customer is a lot harder than keeping an old one, or it should be.  And these guys, as it's quite clear, their incentive financially and otherwise is to not let anyone go if at all possible.  You know, we just speaking of San Francisco, we were getting the San Francisco Chronicle Sunday edition and finally decided after they killed a section we particularly liked reading that there wasn't enough to get it anymore.  And I spent 15 minutes trying to be polite to a guy who kept lowering the amount that I'd have to pay if we would just keep it.  And, you know, we're not.  When you make a decision, you've made the decision.  It's really odd.  And companies need to know how to take no for an answer to just move on.  They probably be better off not having people annoyed at them all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think you can.  I think there's ample evidence now that treating the customer better is in the long run better business.  Look at Amazon.  Here's a company that's customer first.  You call to send something back.  They're happily exchanging.  Zappos, another example, now an Amazon company.  I don't think I think the evidence is strongly in favor of having a better customer relationship and not worrying so much about customer retention.  You agree, Ben?

Right.  I don't I am happy to give this customer service or the benefit out and that he's a nice guy.  He's a great guy.  And he he goes out with his friends and he doesn't like insist that he buy them a beer like for 30 minutes.

Transcript:  The whole point is that this isn't natural human behavior, but he is being heavily incentivized to act in a certain way.  And that is not his responsibility.  That's Comcast responsibility.  And incentives are incredibly powerful things that act mostly on kind of a subconscious level.  And that's why like that's why I worry for Microsoft if they have misaligned incentives.  It's not because there are bad people there that are dumb.  It's because people respond to incentives whether they realize they're doing it or not.  And this is just an extreme example of that point.

And but you know what, Ryan, you did everybody a service and I this was the shot heard around the world.  David Letterman played it.  The networks played it.  It was on the news everywhere.  It got a lot of play because it resonated, I think, with everybody listening to it.  We've all been on that call.  And I have to think this is going to have some maybe some serious impact on Comcast, perhaps even on the Comcast Time Warner merger.  This is a company that, you know, maybe they're maybe they're not alone.  Maybe a lot of companies act like this, but it's pretty clearly a company that is mistreating its employees and its customers.  And really, should they be allowed to grow any bigger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so they have it's very the whole net neutrality thing and the competition thing is very complicated in the U.S.  But in Taiwan, it is like it is in Europe and lots of other countries.  The there's a separation between owning the wires and providing the service.  So there's lots of there's lots of ISPs that offer service over over the same wires.  I think, too, because it's much more densely populated is that DSL is actually more of a viable solution.  Because if you're within like a mile or two miles of a switch, then it can be very high speed.  But yeah, there's more competition on the cable wire and there's more types of connections, which which both of which make a huge difference.

Start time: 2137.28
End time: 2139.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 2150.88
End time: 2251.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So so this is one thing that so I've kind of I'm really torn on the net neutrality issue.  And this comes down to that.  A lot of people, including Alexis Ohanian, many of people, EFF and others, think that the solution is for the FCC to declare telecommunications broadband providers  covered as titled by Title 2 of the Telecommunications Act, that they are common carriers or utilities, hence should be regulated by the government.  This should be regulated by the FCC.  On the other hand, I've heard from a lot of people that's the last thing you want.  Of course, and even even at the EFF, I know I've talked to John Perry Barlow says there's dissent among the board at the EFF because while yes,  we want a free and open Internet, many of us feel the worst possible thing you could do is have the government start to intervene on how the Internet is run.  A title two could be, in fact, the worst thing that could happen to the Internet.  And it's hard for us to know ahead of time.  I think something, though, that everyone agrees on is that the real key to this is having true competition.  And one way to do it is to have the government own the infrastructure and then open up the Internet providing on top of it to a total competition.  And one of the reason we have monopolies or a duopoly is because it's so expensive to put the cable in the ground that the FCC said to the cable companies,  you can have a regional monopoly to, you know, pay for the cost of trenching.  Maybe the time is to give that up.  I don't know. But I do feel like competition is a solution.  Is that even viable in the United States?  We've got such a mess going on right now.  It just seems like it's better than Title Two, which has huge inherent risks.

Start time: 2254.43
End time: 2289.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm very I'm very mixed as well for for many of those reasons.  I mean, there's a lot of stuff going on here.  I mean, first off, the government did give and they started with with Community Access Television, which was basically a shared antenna.  So you got started. Right. Yeah, exactly.  And in this case, like government because government didn't want to pay for all the installation.  They made a deal. And so the people.  Yes, government provide lots of lots of value, particularly an eminent domain and things like that.  But the actual cost of putting that cable in the ground was borne by shareholder.

Start time: 2289.88
End time: 2306.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, almost every show for the last six months, it's ended up descending into this net neutrality discussion.  I'm just more and more coming to the opinion that competition is a solution.  Whatever we can do to foster competition, that's going to be better than having heavy handed government regulation the Internet because all of a sudden I don't want to I don't want to have to adhere to FCC rules at Twitter.  And I think that that would be the worst possible thing to happen.

Start time: 2353.71
End time: 2374.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's a little overdone.  But what you're right on is it's another incentive issue.  Like we need to have the right incentives in place.  And the incentive is also to keep building infrastructure.  I mean, Mark Andreessen had the best one of the best statements in this whole thing, which is that the problem with comparing the Internet to the sewage system is we don't, you know, crap 10 times more in 10 years.

Start time: 2376.84
End time: 2477.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, Comcast has there is some legitimate concern from the Internet service providers that we're using a lot more bandwidth all the time.  You know, there's a back and forth over Netflix right now.  Verizon released a very deceptive diagram that clearly shows using colors that the problem is all Netflix's because it's Netflix is red.  Everything else is green, but Netflix is red.  I think a lot of people looked at that diagram and said, oh, yeah, it's obvious.  Level three kind of chimed in said, yeah, that's a little bit misleading.  The real issue is not how much bandwidth inside of Netflix network.  How much bandwidth inside of our network?  How much bandwidth inside of Comcast?  In all three cases, there's plenty.  It's the interconnects.  And what level three, who is one of Comcast's backbone providers, has said again and again, we are willing even to give money to Comcast to upgrade their interconnect.  Their interconnect is not fast enough.  We're providing them with huge amount of bandwidth, a giant pipe.  They got a little bitty pipe and they consistently refuse Verizon, Comcast, five of the five big ISPs in the U.S. refuse to upgrade that pipe.  We'll even pay for it.  And they won't do it.  And the reason is they want to put the screws to Netflix and say, oh, you see, it's all Netflix fault.  But it's really that little bitty pipe that Comcast and in this case, Verizon has attached.  Anyway, it's a mess.  It's one of those subjects that you have to have expertise in technology, in politics.  You have to have inside information out of the backbones working.  No one really certainly no senator, no congress member could possibly fathom this.  No member of the court system and no technology journalist.  It's something so so hideously compact complex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not, though, actually, Leo.  It's good.  It cut through this.  It's a lot of the technology in the back is complex.  But the you had it right the first time you separate the provision of the access, which is a service from the the content inside the service.  That's not easy to do at this point because we've let these people create these mega companies that combine it.  And we've given them permission to make decisions about what bits get delivered.  But that doesn't have to be.  They they can make plenty of money by being the providers of the pipe and selling access to people who then provide it in turn to the rest of us.  It's it's really you know, title two is a problematic thing to do, but it could be done with a very light touch that would just encourage competition.  I think we're sometimes trying to think about the horribles that might happen when we can see right in our face the things that are going on and that are going to get much worse in the very near future if we don't do something.  I agree.

His he says local communities should use eminent.  This is boy.  This is controversial to use eminent domain to take over these infrastructures that the cable company, the phone companies have put in.  Say look, thank you very much.  Nice job.  You've amortized your investment.  Glad about that.  Now we're going to take it over and we will lease them back to providers as many providers as we possibly can to provide competition that these are.  This is public infrastructure.  This is the gas, the sewer, the water, and we'll run it and we'll let many companies float over it.  And and for sure, if you do that, there'll be one company that says and we're not going to we're not going to in any way restrict what you do.  We're not going to we're not going to packet sniff.  We're going to I mean, that's all you need is competition.  One company, Sonic.  That's a good example of a company, Dane Jasper.

Transcript:  Are you?  If you are managing a giant project, a giant software project, and you are daunted by the challenges posed,  surely you have heard of Atlassian and their great product Jira.  If you haven't, try it right now.  Jira is one of the world's most powerful, customizable issue and project management systems.  We're talking about the how important the software systems are in a company like Comcast, where they just the systems don't work.  That means the reps can't do their job.  That means customer service suffers.  Having great systems can transform what you're doing.  And Jira is an example of that.  It will capture and organize your workflow.  You could prioritize what you're doing, take action on what's important, stay up to date with the activity going on around you.  You can capture, organize, prioritize all the issues, all the tasks, the features, the bugs in your giant project.  It gives your team a very easy to use interface, lets them collaborate in real time.  Actually, you play the video on the Atlassian Jira site because it really is...  If you're in this situation, you know you need this.  You can integrate all the documents from all the different places, your backlogs, your issues, your cold repository.  It works with Git, of course.  In fact, that allows teams to follow the code all the way from development to delivery.

You're not a programmer.  No, but Minecraft's bug tracker has been a Jira product they're using.  And it's just wonderful.  And I have intimate knowledge of everything because I've issued a few bugs.  Is that awesome?  Yeah, and they do these amazing things with it.  See, there's the activity stream on the right.  You can see this is kind of amazing.  These are the bugs that are created versus the bugs resolved.  Isn't that good? That's looking good.  And then it shows off the known issues.  Is this something Mojang uses?  Yeah, this is something Mojang uses, the creators of Minecraft.  There's lots of really nice features like you can merge if one topic is posted and then it's posted a second time by another user.  You can merge topics.  You can easily add screenshots and crash reports.  And there's comment history.  You can close and open tickets.  It's just amazing.  I had no idea.  Is that funny that you've been using it?  I've been using it for years and I had no idea.  And I kept thinking, gosh, this is such a good system.  Whoever built this system is so good.  And it was Jira this whole time at Lastium.

It's flexible, simple, easy enough for a five-person startup, but reliable enough for 100,000 people.  That's why NASA uses it.  70% of the Fortune 100 use it.  25,000 companies, apparently, including Mojang.  If you haven't tried Jira, you can now go to atlastian, A-T-L-A-S-S-I-A-N.com slash twit for more information.  Monthly plans, very affordable, as little as $10 a month for up to 10 users.  But we've got it free for 30 days.  I think you'll be pleased.  Systems make such a difference in large projects.  If it's just you, you don't need it.  But if you've got a team at lastian.com slash twit, try it for free 30 days.  And we thank them for their support of this.  We can take the obviously feel that many big, big, big thinkers are watching the show.  That's good news.  Okay, we're not going to talk about net neutrality.  It's screwed. We're screwed. It's over.  No, I don't know what's going to happen.  We'll find out.  You mentioned that you expected, I think it was Dan mentioned, that you expected to see the Microsoft board change to a little bit to reflect Satya Nadella's goals for the company.  Google's doing a little bit of that.  I see that Alan Mullally, who just left as CEO of Ford, one of the most respected CEOs in the U.S.,  truly a genius who not only I think turned Ford around, made sure it was protected.  They never took government loans when all the other big threes did.  They don't have the problems that GM's going through right now.  Mullally retired as CEO.  He was for a briefly considered or at least mentioned as considered to be CEO of Microsoft.  I don't think that was ever in the cards.  He really wanted, I think, to have some time and wanted to be with his family.  But he has taken a job as a Google director.  He's going to be on the board of Google.  In fact, I was looking at the Google board of directors and there's an example of a company that has created a board of directors that very much signify the direction the company's interested in.  Of course, Larry and Sergey, the founders, are on it, as is Eric Schmidt.  He's the chairman.  John Doar, investor, and I think probably as part of the investment, they got the seat.  Diane Greene, who founded VMware.  So there's your cloud and your software, folks.  John Hennessey, who's president of Stanford.  There's actually two academics on the board, the president of Princeton as well as on the board.  And then Paul Adelini, formerly CEO of Intel, is on the board.  This is all Google.  Anne Mather is on the board.  She worked at Shutterfly.  She worked at Netflix.  You've got a board that really reflects kind of all.  And Malali going on the board is, of course, automotive.  All of the interests that Google has.  Former Amazon guy, Ram Sriram.  Right now, Microsoft's board is really kind of a hodgepodge.  You've got Ken Thompson's very active, former IBM guy.  And you've got Bill Gates.  You've got Steve Ballmer.  You've got Satya Nadella.  And the rest almost seem like just kind of placeholders.  I can imagine a reinvigorated Microsoft board that would not only help the stock market understand what Microsoft's up to,  but help Satya Nadella forge his vision.  I don't know where I'm going with that.

So the board is really just a... they're there, but they can't actually do anything.  Which Facebook is the same way, which is... it's interesting for lots of reasons.

Transcript:  Apple has teamed up with IBM.  I got to find the picture of Steve Jobs flipping off the IBM sign.  Back in the early days, here's the image.  He very famously when he was... they were just starting out. They were young.  They were full of vim and vigor.  He went to the IBM building, I think in New York, and very famously flipped it off.  In fact, for many years, IBM was the hated evil empire.  In the 1984 commercial, it was pretty obvious who the woman holding the hammer was throwing it at.  It was IBM.  Well, things have changed a little bit in the modern era.  IBM and Apple are teaming up for a huge enterprise push.  Ben, I figured you'd understand. Is this a big deal or is this just PR material?

Start time: 3314.00
End time: 3491.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a huge deal, and it's a really brilliant deal.  It really came out of left field, I think, as far...  I mean, I haven't heard anyone talking about this previously.  The reason it's a big deal is, I mean, Apple is kind of succeeding in the enterprise in a way they never have, almost by accident right now.  They have done work on the product side for iOS to make it work well in the enterprise, especially in iOS 8.  For the first time, iOS 8 actually had a... or the WWC keynote had a section devoted to the enterprise.  Previously, they'd have a slide.  They spent a little bit of time talking about it.  So, obviously, it's a very big market.  Blackberry has traditionally dominated it, but iOS is kind of becoming the default device there.  So, from that perspective, they're well-shaped from a product perspective.  But what Microsoft knows and is good at and what lots of enterprise companies know and are good at and why it's hard to build an enterprise company is that enterprise, the product is one very small piece of the whole puzzle.  It's the support. It's the... especially support.  It's the working with IT. It's developing needs. It's developing all the applications that are specific to the enterprise.  It's working with their systems, with their backend systems, with their cloud, whatever it might be.  And all that is messy and it's dirty. And you go in, you listen to the customer, and you tell them what they want to hear, and you respond to their needs.  And it's very, very counter to Apple's philosophy and way of developing products.  And this is why Apple has always kind of disdained the enterprise, not because there's not money there.  There's a ton of money there. But because it would poison the sort of culture that they have around building the best possible products.  But in some ways, it was also the enterprise disdained Apple, right?  Well, absolutely. And for good reason. I mean, there was mutual hatred on both sides and both well-deserved, to be perfectly frank.  And now what Apple is basically getting is IBM is going to do all that. They don't need to develop that.  They don't need to develop all that messiness and worrying about it.  And I would imagine from IBM's perspective, actually, IBM is probably getting a very good deal out of this.  Like I would imagine Apple's going to get the device money, which is all they ever kind of really want in the end anyway.  And they might get a little bit extra for support. But IBM, you know, in an enterprise deal, the product is only a small part of the total cost.  Like the whole service on top of that is where most of the money is made.  And so I would imagine for both companies, it's a massive win-win. Apple can sell much more effectively, way more devices.  And IBM has a marquee product to kind of base their enterprise strategy around.  It's a brilliant deal. It's very hard to see any sort of downside to it, to be perfectly honest.

Transcript:  Yeah. It's not the first time IBM and Apple have worked together, though.  They go back to the PowerPC, the intelligent project, things like that.  But Apple was a lot smaller in those periods.

Transcript:  No, it was classic vaporware.  There was a joke in the 90s when people were talking seriously about Apple and IBM.  And at one point there was a rumor that IBM was going to buy Apple.  And I remember that. So there was a riddle that came out of that, which was, what do you get when you combine Apple and IBM?  And the answer was IBM.

Transcript:  Well, that would change today, wouldn't it?

Start time: 3540.54
End time: 3575.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the difference is, the difference is those both PowerPC and intelligent were products and they were working jointly on a product.  In this case, the lines of division are very, very clear.  Apple provides the product and IBM provides the service.  And because IBM doesn't really build products anymore.  And so to me, that gives the partnership a much greater chance of success.  I mean, going back to incentives, like the incentives are very well aligned for this.  And that's kind of the key to making any sort of partnership work well.

Transcript:  Interesting story coming out of Hope, the Hackers on Planet Earth conference in New York City this week, a slide deck from Jonathan Zizayarski.  I hope I'm saying your name right, Jonathan.  Identifying back doors, attack points and surveillance mechanisms in iOS.  We had talked quite a bit on our security show.  Steve Gibson had looked into the the white papers Apple had put out about security first on iPhone, particularly on the newest iPhones,  and was came away quite impressed. I don't know. I forwarded this document to Steve.  We'll talk about it on Security Now on Wednesday.  But holy cow, if you read these PowerPoints, I guess the big takeaway from this is that Apple has all sorts of services.  Well, well, this is it. Apple's worked hard to make iOS devices secure against typical attackers.  But they've put all sorts of stuff in to allow law enforcement access to this data.  And in fact, all iOS devices are currently running packet a packet sniffer that allows these devices with the appropriate software to look at everything that's going on over the network entirely.  That, in fact, the iPhone is terror is terrifying.  There there are undocumented services that bad bypass encryption.  If you know, you may assume if you've got an iPhone that when you shut it off and you've got the lock screen on that your data is encrypted.  Not in fact the case if the device hasn't been rebooted.  All the data that has been encrypted can be accessed easily with, you know, all of Apple's software gives up its information completely immediately easily.  It's really kind of a surprising now we haven't heard Apple's response to this, but I most particularly would like to hear about this lockdown D and this packet sniffer that is apparently running.  Running. I mean, P cap D is a Darcy asked, why do we need a packet sniffer running on 600 million personal iOS devices?

Transcript:  I don't know why anyone trusts any of the major technology companies when it comes to things like this, because the laws are basically against us ever finding out.  They get served with these national security letters or other secret government orders they can't tell us about.  I think they need to do a better job of fighting for us.  But this is going to take a while to fix.  This is this is what Jonathan says.  He says com dot apple dot P cap D immediately starts lib cap on the device dumps network traffic and HTTP request and response data traveling into and out of the device.

Start time: 3909.40
End time: 3962.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It does not require developer mode.  It is active on every iOS device.  It can be targeted via Wi Fi for remote monitoring.  So you can't have a lot of traffic.  It can be targeted via Wi Fi for remote monitoring.  So you can use Wi Fi to get into somebody's phone and then monitor the network with it.  There is no visual indicator to the user that the packet sniffer is running.  And it's on every single iOS device.  Now, again, this is Jonathan's presentation.  He is a very credible security researcher.  He does offer an example from iOS 7.1.2, the current version of iOS of a hex dump that he got from a machine from a phone.  It's a it's a it's pretty terrifying.  You tie that with Edward Snowden's conversations.  Most recently with Daniel Ellsberg at Hope X. Hope was a good conference to go to.  I'm sorry I missed it.

Transcript:  Snowden's been saying some interesting things.  I have to say, for instance, he says, if you want privacy, don't use Dropbox.  Dropbox is the most anti privacy of all the services.  He points to the fact that Condoleezza Rice, who the former Bush official security advisor,  who was, he says, very instrumental in privacy reversals during the Bush administration,  is on the board of directors.  He recommended an alternative, which we've recommended as well before.  Spider Oak.  Spider Oak. Yeah, I use Spider Oak for some time.  Your data is encrypted prior to its transfer up to the servers.  Dropbox, as we know, encrypts your data, but everybody at Dropbox has access to it.

Start time: 4077.08
End time: 4112.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, as he points out, you can get Wi-Fi access to the phone and then sniff it.  And law enforcement can turn it on.  You know what? I am not an expert in security.  You might want to go to Jonathan's website, ZDZIARSKI.com.  He says he published this in a paper months ago,  but it wasn't until he put it in PowerPoint slides at Hope that anybody even talked about it,  which doesn't really surprise me.  But we're talking about it now, and I think it is worth probably paying some more attention to it.

And I've just moved my two phones to Cyanogenmod,  which is a third-party Android variant that has a much better privacy built in.  But I don't take for granted that even that is going to be sufficient.  And this is a problem that I'm not sure the market itself is going to be able to solve  because in part of the concentration among a few carriers  that are practically married to the government when it comes push-to-shove.

It doesn't mean it's secure.  It just means that they have access to your source code.  And we're all – those of us who are unable to look at the source code and really truly vet it  are all kind of just hoping somebody's doing that.

But even – I mean, they basically said don't trust any of them.  That's the implication.  Yeah. They've given up.  Well, there's a project that may come together if they can find a way to do it  to get the TrueCrypt Linux code and work with that for a new project.  But there are ownership issues.

I think probably – there is, I think, a silver lining here though,  which is law enforcement now, according to the Supreme Court,  does need a warrant to access your phone.

That's right.  And all the traffic goes.  And they're making deals with the manufacturers to keep it secret.  And the government's ordering – the federal government has ordered  in several cases that the locals not tell anybody what they're doing.

So maybe you can tell us a little bit more about it, Dan, when we come back.  How about that?  Our show today brought to you by audible.com.  I want to talk a little later on about Amazon's new Kindle Unlimited.  That's nice, but I tell you what, I like to listen to books.  Hint, hint, Amazon.  Right now, I'm a huge fan of audible.com.  You know that.  I have been since the turn of the century.  I think I got my Audible account in 2001, and I've got over 500 books in my Audible library.  It's one of the neat things about Audible is that once you buy a book on audible.com,  it's yours forever.  It's in your bookshelf.  You can go back and listen to it.  150,000 titles.  They've got fiction, nonfiction.  They've got wonderful thrillers.  Mark Krasinovich's Rogue Code.  In fact, the trilogy, the Jeff Aiken trilogy is all on Audible.  Wonderfully read by Johnny Heller, if you like.  This is kind of cyber.  This is a new style of fiction, kind of a cyber thriller.  Zero Day, I think, was the first one.  Trojan Horse, and now the latest.  Just came out, Rogue Code.  I'm going to tell you how you can get two books free.  So that's why I mention Audible and maybe mention a few titles.  There's so many great choices.  This is one I keep getting recommended.  I don't know why audible thinks I want to read The Art of Fermentation.  What could an in-depth exploration?  Actually, I can't wait.  I want to, I do want to read this book because bread making, beer making, a lot of what we do.  Kimchi making involves fermentation.

I'm going to get you in trouble for your address.  You already are.  I tell you.  No, no, no.  No rancidity here.  Just pure fermentation.  One of the great things about Audible is they have books for young adults and children, too.  You might say, well, I like to read my kids.  Of course you do.  You know, one of the studies have shown that kids who listen to audiobooks read faster, read earlier.  They want to pick up the books and look at them.  How about The Wind in the Willows read by Shelley Frazier, the classic Kenneth Graham book?  Oh, what a great book that was.  Little Women, Treasure Island read by Alfred Molina, the great actor, Alfred Molina.  Audible has the best books, but also the best readers.  They bring these books to life.  And I think more than any movie, more than any play, more than certainly reading a novel, listening to a novel, there's something that happens.  It just comes alive in your brain.  And sometimes I'll go see a movie that I've listened to on Audible and I'll say, I already saw this and actually it was better.  It was better in my brain.  Visit Audible.com.  Pick a couple of books.  There are many to choose from.  The latest Stephen King, Mr. Mercedes is out.  I finished some months ago Michael Lewis's Flash Boys.  That's fascinating.  I read a lot of nonfiction and technology fiction on Audible.com.  Go to Audible.com slash twit2.  You'll be signing up for the platinum account that'll give you two books or two credits a month.  Most books are one credit.  Plus the Daily Digest of the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal.  You can cancel anytime in the first 30 days.  Pay nothing, but those books will be yours to keep before you see Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.  Listen to the official movie novelization.  Actually, you know, there are movies like MASH, which started as books and became movies.  And I got to tell you, if you haven't read the book MASH, and I bet most of you haven't, it's great.  If you love the movie, you'd love the book.  Hot Lips Hoolahan, Trapper John, they're all in there.  Audible.com slash twit2.  Get you two books absolutely free.  You will thank me later, I promise you.  At the gym, in the car if you've got to commute.  Walking the dog, doing the dishes, I listen to Audible all the time.  Audible.com slash twit2.  Actually, Lisa and I, it was kind of fun.  Listen to a book together.  Listen to The Martian together.  Actually, Brian Brushwood inspired that.  And it was so much fun.  We say, okay, we're going to listen now.  When we were driving in Hawaii, we would listen.  It was so much fun.  So it's something you can do with a friend, too.  Audible.com slash twit2.

They've really done it without being demeaning in any way.  I hope it's not demeaning to say that.  But we don't want it to be a boys' club.  That's a bad thing.  Amazon has decided it's going to do a Netflix for books, $10 a month.  It's called Kindle Unlimited, and it is launching.  I've seen it on the front page of Amazon.  I briefly considered it, and then I saw that none of the books I wanted to read were part of it.  I mean, I like the idea, but it's not the entire Amazon bookstore,  and I'm sure as long as publishers have anything to do with it, it won't be.  What do you think?  The Verge says Amazon's Netflix for books might be doomed before it's started.  Is this a good idea, bad idea?  It's not the first Netflix for books.  Oyster Books has been doing this for six months or so, maybe a year.

Transcript:  You know, first I have to do a disclosure.  I own a small amount of Amazon stock,  but I have to agree with you, I'm not going to pay for this.  It's too expensive for not enough.  I suspect, and I have absolutely no knowledge or further insight into what they're doing internally,  but I've got to believe they're going to end up with tiers of service like other companies,  and that maybe it'll be $3 or something for the catalog and onwards.  So if you want to read all self-published books, it'll be a lot cheaper than stuff.  Well, that's how Netflix handled that, right?  But they don't want to be part of it yet.  And it's very unclear, by the way, as an author, I have to tell you,  it's very unclear to me whether this is a good deal for me as an author.  I'm not sure.

Start time: 4885.82
End time: 4983.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think there's a few, there's several problems why,  one, this is interesting, and two, I don't think this particular one is going to work.  First off, for Amazon specifically, I mean, it doesn't seem,  it's probably not the best idea to be breaking over the publishers  and trying to extract every last penny from their pocket,  even while you need their support to launch a new kind of service.  You know, there's perhaps as part of these notorious negotiations  that Amazon is undergoing with the publishers to get the support,  but regardless, you need publisher support to do this.  And right now they don't have it, and I don't think it's compiling for that reason.  Two, though, I think there's a very interesting way where they're actually,  the publishers ought to figure out someone or among themselves a way to do this,  because I think it is very compelling to have a Kindle alternative.  Like a big problem is, because they insist on DRM, the publishers do,  that locks everyone into Kindle, and there's no real alternative,  and that's why they're kind of behind the eight ball in these negotiations,  and it would be very interesting to see if they could,  if there could be a real alternative to Amazon,  to kind of break the Kindle's kind of power over e-books  by using this model as an alternative to the Kindle model.  The problem, though, from the publisher perspective is there's a few whales in the book.  When I was at Microsoft, I worked on the publishing category for the Windows 8 store,  and one thing you want about the book industry is it's very much a whale sort of industry.  There are few people that buy a ton of books.  Oh, is that true?

Start time: 4984.46
End time: 4993.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I always thought when you said whale, I thought, oh, you're talking about Daniel Steele.  You're talking about either big publishers or big authors, but you're talking about big readers.  Yeah, no, for sure.

Start time: 4993.00
End time: 5044.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I worked on the Kindle app for Windows 8,  and what was a big thing was you had to test consistently  for people that had like over 10,000 titles in their library.  Like, it was insane.  And again, it wasn't very many people,  but there are a few people that buy multiple books a week, and these people support a lot.  Really? Do they read them or what?  Yeah, no, there's voracious readers that just are reading constantly,  and they support a lot of the industry.  And so, particularly in reading where it's a smaller market than it is for music, for example,  where everyone listens to music, a lot fewer people read books,  and that makes this much more fraught,  because if those people move to the subscription model,  you've just given up a whole lot of revenue,  and it's not clear you're going to make it up on the other side.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I look at this in Oyster Books, and it's actually very much the same list.  Amazon's claiming 600,000 titles, Oyster Books 500,000,  but if you look at the titles on one, it's very similar to the titles on another.  Both of them have the old but still probably valuable seven habits  of highly effective people.  The big bestsellers, I was looking, you know,  the thing that I use is the Litmus Test is a book I'm reading now by Donna Tartt,  a Pulitzer Prize-winning book called The Goldfinch.  Neither store has that, and that would be frustrating.  If you wanted to read the current bestsellers, you wouldn't find it on either store.  So in that case, in that respect, it's very much like Netflix streaming  or Amazon Prime movies.  It's got movies, it's got books, it's not the ones you want to watch or read.  I do think it could end all ends in tears, as Scotland Calling said,  in the sense that maybe if you pay five bucks more, you'd get more.  But I wonder, I do worry about authors.  Do you think Amazon really wants to basically be the publisher?  They've already offered, for instance, and I don't think any of the publishers took them up on it.  They said, look, if we can't get a book from you, can we just print it  and send it to our customer?  A print-on-demand service for publishers, I don't know how they're taking to that.  Isn't Amazon just want to get the publishers out of the business entirely?

Start time: 5146.66
End time: 5196.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think Amazon sees, and they've actually been very vocal about this,  they see the publishers as being dinosaurs and kind of a,  and what's the word, something of a past era that doesn't need to exist anymore.  Relic of a past era.  And there's reasons to be sympathetic to that.  I think I mentioned briefly the whole upheaval in publishing that blogs have done.  Well, you could argue there's no reason e-books shouldn't have a similar effect.  I think that's where you get lost between questions on DRM,  around all the sort of issues that go into digital.  And yeah, you can see Amazon's point in a way.  Then again, Dan might have a different view.  I've not a part of that.

Start time: 5197.02

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, how do authors feel about that, Dan?

Start time: 5200.22
End time: 5264.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It depends what author you talk to.  The ones who are the big selling ones, they're going to stick with what works for them very well,  which is the traditional model.  But the economics of it have stopped making sense for all kinds of reasons.  And the whole idea that we should all as authors be forced through this orifice  of five big publishing companies that increasingly are indifferent to the finding of excellence  as opposed to things that will sell.  I'm just ready for some big changes.  And the fact that Amazon took such a giant market share has a lot more to do with the publishing industry  letting it happen without having any counter response at all  and certainly fighting it every step of the way in one hand and then working with it on another.

Start time: 5272.14
End time: 5321.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and the production costs, there's different costs in publishing than in music,  but there's some similarities.  And again, I'm not a typical author partly because I put my work out under Creative Commons licenses  so that people can download them anyway.  And by the way, that does not hurt sales, which people think is counterintuitive, but it's not.  There's a whole new ecosystem emerging that we're still just getting glimmerings of.  I think my hope is that Amazon will not dominate it as much as they've dominated it so far  because that's just not healthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a gatekeeper thing, though, too.  I mean, if you're already a published author, you're already in the club.  So of course you'd love to see the club continue.  I mean, it's the same thing.  Once upon a time, I wanted to be a columnist for the New York Times.  That was my...  I didn't want to be put in my...  No offense to the journalists in the room, but I didn't want to put in my years of covering City Hall  and covering school board meetings.  Sorry, kid, but you got to.  But what's so marvelous about the web and about blogs and all this sort of stuff is I don't need to ask permission.  I can start something up and nothing is granted to me.  I need to earn an audience.  I need to earn people trusting me and then not just to read, but then to also give me my...  I don't have to ask anyone permission to do it.  And that's what's potentially exciting about e-books as well is we can get to an area where an author can sell himself.  And yes, some authors who are happy with the current system, of course they don't want to do that because they don't want to do the work.  Just like a lot of journalists don't want to do all the social media stuff because they just want to do their work.  But that's not the world anymore.

Start time: 5412.00
End time: 5474.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you don't need permission to write something increasingly, though you need access to the new form of distribution,  which is not manufacturing and putting in trucks, but rather having people know it's there.  Which is much harder.  It's much harder and harder to do.  And that's one issue.  And I worry a lot about that in the net neutrality ballpark.  But the thing that really is poisonous right now, I think, in publishing when it comes to e-books is the incompatibility by design of all the formats  and the fact that these guys all want to, or at least they give the appearance of all wanting to own the ecosystem for themselves.  And there's resonance there with some of this control stuff that we're seeing in other parts of the tech and communications ecosystem.  We really need to fix this.

Start time: 5475.40
End time: 5503.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's the thing with the publishers, right?  The publishers have given Amazon the hammer with which they're being hit by insisting on DRM.  If there were no DRM for e-books, Amazon would have a whole lot.  They would still have the actual hardcover book power because they're such a huge distributor.  But they would have one of their arms tied behind their back, as it were.  It's more than just DRM.

Transcript:  It's not just DRM.  Part of it is the file format that sometimes are, well, you know from Microsoft, they're difficult to translate.  But there's a lot of books you can buy on Amazon, Kindle now, that are not DRM.  But you can't read that file in anything else.  I think we need to, if we had some standard formats that we do have a few standards.  The problem is they're not great yet at working in a variety of devices.  And if the big publishers were smart, they would be doing, you know, they'd get together to do their own things, but also continue to work with Amazon.

It's for Amazon's fans.  The other thing is that it's an experiment.  They're figuring it out until they can innovate in more interesting ways, particularly when it comes to pricing and things like that.  The problem that I have is actually very similar to the Microsoft one in that I think it's problematic for Amazon from an incentive perspective.  The last thing they need to do is worry about supporting a device ecosystem that has a fraction of the market when their bread and butter needs to be killer on all the platforms.

Netflix now has a private surfing button.  So I can watch My Little Pony videos and not get busted.  You know, it's been a problem because you watch one My Little Pony movie and that's all they recommend now.  It's kind of embarrassing.  Actually, it was only a matter of time. I think it's kind of a good idea.  They won't necessarily be on your Netflix account right now.  They're rolling it out, testing it. But a private viewing mode on Netflix.  Everybody wants a little privacy.  Yes, I'm a brony.

Transcript:  I think there's lots of ways you could take this piece of news.  But I think it is for anything that depends on a recommendation algorithm,  I think this is particularly welcome.  Although perhaps there's some funny thing about recommendation algorithms.  They tend to know what you say you're interested in.  It tends to be very different from what you're actually interested in.  It goes way back to TiVo.

Start time: 6010.18
End time: 6049.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Remember the thumbs up, thumbs down in the article, TiVo thinks I'm gay?  I have the modern TiVo, Romeo, Pro or whatever it is.  It records. It's such a big hard drive.  It records daily, every day, 20 new shows based on what it thinks you want.  I actually had to take the Spanish language channels off the channel guide  because it kept recording shows in Spanish for me for some reason.  I don't know. I don't understand.  So you're right, recommendation engines.  It's the dancing.  I shouldn't dance in front of my Xbox One.  It's sending that information back.

Start time: 6052.84
End time: 6070.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got to ask who is this private from?  Clearly Netflix knows what you're watching anyway, right?  Is this private from your spouse and kids or what?  I wasn't clear on what that gets you.

Start time: 6072.83
End time: 6090.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a very good point.  I guess it's private from the recommendation engine and that's that.  Well, that has value.  It doesn't go in your log.  You're right. It's not private from Netflix.  It's not private from the NSA.  It's only private from your wife.  That's who it's private from.

Transcript:  It's actually important to think about the cheapening of the word private.  What does private mean?  There's lots of things.  I think Chrome has a private browsing mode.  We certainly know that nothing Google related will ever be private.

Transcript:  Rupert Murdoch put Time Warner in play.  I think he just does it for fun.  He bid $80 billion on Wednesday to buy Time Warner, the content side of Time Warner.  He wasn't bidding for the cable company.  Time Warner seems to have rebuffed that, but now that has put them in play with a lot of other companies, including ESPN, Warner Brothers.

Start time: 6178.54
End time: 6188.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the reason Time Warner just spun off Time, which is all the print publications, which Murdoch just also did as well.  Nobody wants to be in print anymore.

End time: 6237.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  But I think you mentioned ESPN.  I think what's interesting about this is Time Warner has a decent sports portfolio.  And that's something that...  Fox is very interested in developing.  It started Fox Sports 1.  It's not doing very well.  And that has a lot to do with ESPN.  ESPN drives like 50% of Disney's profits.  I mean, it's incredibly lucrative and very resistant to a lot of the, quote unquote, disruptive things when it comes to television because it's live.  It commands a big premium.  But no, that whole arena is certainly interesting for that reason.

Transcript:  I should say, Warner Brothers did not put in a bid to buy Time Warner.  That would be weird since they are owned by Time Warner.  That was a misstated.  Dell is accepting Bitcoin for online purchases.  This is just publicity, right?  Because they immediately cash it in for American dollars.  Or is there something here?  Is there something going on?  You can buy your Alienware gaming machine with your Bitcoin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would do the same thing where it converts instantly to cash.  I mean, if people want to pay in it, by all means.  I think probably the more interesting Bitcoin news is getting into things like 51% attacks and stuff or potential and things along those natures.  But as far as I think companies supporting it are exactly right.  I think it's mostly good PR.  They get an article written about them.  They immediately turn it into dollars, right?

Start time: 6308.00
End time: 6362.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I don't think it's just PR.  I think that's probably a large part of it.  But it's really worth it for these companies to be learning what they can about the new forms of currency that are coming along.  And more than that, the Bitcoin story, I'm increasingly convinced, is not about currency, but about the protocols.  And what they're doing is pretty stunning when you look deeper into what Bitcoin means.  I'm saying this without sufficient depth on it.  I'm studying this hard now and I've become convinced that Bitcoin is a huge thing, not so much because of the currency, but because of the architecture.  I think this is profound and important.

Start time: 6364.21
End time: 6384.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree. I completely agree.  I completely agree.  And it is worth noting, by the way, that from Dell's perspective, the lowered fees make a huge difference.  I mean, I've paid enough in credit card fees to appreciate that there is a financial benefit to this as well.

Start time: 6385.00

Transcript:  What does Coinbase take?  Because basically what happens is I think the transaction goes through Coinbase, they turn it into US dollars immediately.  You're saying they take less than a credit card company would.

Start time: 6395.08
End time: 6411.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yes, significantly less.  Obviously Bitcoin theoretically could be free.  Usually to get it processed in a timely way, you could pay a very small fee.  But relative to a credit card, which is a few percent, it's practically zero.

I guess there was one question I had for you, Dan Gilmore.  Did Newsweek ever recant its cover story about discovering the creator of Bitcoin, hiding in plain sight in Los Angeles?  I think everybody pretty much agrees that was not Satoshi Nakamoto they found.

Start time: 6463.40

End time: 6509.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not these. It's A. We never said it was the Satoshi Nakamoto.  Just some guy named Satoshi Nakamoto.  I mean, this was when Newsweek in March went back to the newsstands with the they had stopped publishing paper issues.  They the first paper edition in a long time.  They had a cover story, the face behind Bitcoin.  Leah McGrath Goodman wrote the story said she has sources.  Newsweek said we stand by this story.  And at this point, it's pretty obvious.  Yeah, they got it wrong, completely wrong.  But nobody's just going to mention it.  It's just that's it.  We don't think the march is so often news cycle now.  We don't care anymore.

There was all that debate about disruption and like I agree in parts.  I'm more of a skeptic.  James is probably more of a defender.
