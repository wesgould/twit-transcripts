Transcript:  Today. Yes, sure. All right  So you got your Apple TV I got my Apple TV  I've been playing with it. It does do that thing where you go  What did he say and it skips back and puts the closed captions on I love that  So good. I can't tell can you tell Christina what services it's searching cross service search?

Start time: 291.36
End time: 324.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, so it does Hulu Netflix HBO go or HBO now Showtime at work Showtime anytime and  iTunes and that's pretty good now and that's just to start  They're gonna be opening up an API for  It to be broader and I mean, I'm not hoping that other services, you know, like like watch ABC watch ESPN  And some of those will join it too, but out of the box  I have to say and that's one of the big things because I have every device  The universal search is is definitely the best out of the box. I think yeah

Start time: 325.02
End time: 327.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, cuz fire TV has it but but it only searches

Start time: 327.96
End time: 409.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Amazon's on stuff it only does Amazon for the voice stuff the new fire TV to which I haven't had a chance to really review  Yep  It's got one that I haven't had a chance to spend a lot of time with it will search more services  But only from certain menus so you can do voice search  You know to define things and it will show it to you on on Hulu or not  Not who on HBO or on Netflix  But if you're in one of those other apps then you're your SOL you can't use voice search or search universally  So what I like about the Apple TV is that I can be literally in any app and I can say show me  You know scandal and it'll bring up scandal everywhere or I can say show me Tom Cruise movies on Netflix  Even if I'm inside Hulu and it will take me back out to that place  So to me that makes it a better overall experience than like Roku's universal search is good  And Tivo's actually is really good  But you've got to go to a universal search main search page to actually access that whereas with the Apple TV  You know you just talk into it or use the search function at the top and it'll go across all those places  My big hope is that when the plex official client comes out  There's a an unofficial client that works pretty well when the official client comes out  That will coincide hopefully with some sort of you know  API for the Siri universal stuff and then you could bring in your plex results too. That would be really ideal

Start time: 409.46
End time: 435.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But we'll see cross-platform searches is in many ways the holy grail  But I gotta say I mean the Apple TV doesn't have Amazon  No, and I feel like that's a big hole in its offerings, but don't you know TVs have Amazon?  Yeah, almost everything has Amazon and nothing has Apple except iTunes except Apple right right so but I prefer to buy stuff on Amazon  Or Google and Google Play and neither of which are in the Apple TV

Start time: 436.74
End time: 496.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the nice thing is you can use airplay from your iPhone or your iPad and  Connect that to the Apple TV and watch the stuff that way which is kind of the workaround  It's weird though because I I mean I've spoken with a number of Amazon employees  Like in these are high-ranking people over the years about the fact that you know Amazon wasn't on the Apple TV  And I know that the day even as recently as like a year ago really wanted that to happen  It's weird that now they're not there and it seems to definitely be Amazon's choice because they could build an app and not only are  They not there, but they've pulled you know the Chromecast and the Apple TV from  Amazon.com so you can't even buy the competitors products  And so there's a lot of questioning and I don't know what the answer to this is which would be if  Let's say Amazon did build an app for TV OS which wouldn't be very hard  They could take their existing iPad app and make a couple of modifications and bring it over very easily  Would they be accepted in the app store, and I don't know

Start time: 497.38
End time: 577.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This though is the screensaver and it's what it is is a photo video  Aerial video from all over the world moving very slowly, but it's real  You could see the leaves blowing the trees and the water move and it's stunning  That's just gorgeous, and now I'm running this not on my Apple TV  But as you mentioned somebody has extracted all the screens savers how kind of and made an Apple  Macintosh screensaver you can get they put it up on the code up on github  Yeah, love this screensaver  No  I have flying toasters on this machine, but not in this I should turn off the  The time because that's annoying isn't it?  What is my issue with this is it's 200 bucks  It's in pretty it's an improvement. I think the the talking to Siri is useful  Especially the cross site search I think an app store is important. It's certainly important us at twit  There are not one two, but three twit apps already in the app store  Which is pretty good since they're only a little more than 60 apps total  But I don't you know I played Rayman for a little bit last night played Crossy Road  I got the joy I bought a joystick or a game controller to go with it  I just didn't feel like I don't know if it's worth 200 bucks. I don't know if it I know about right now

Start time: 577.86
End time: 618.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't gotten mine yet. Yes, it's coming  But I think that when you look at the opportunity of all these iOS developers, and you know it most people have ecosystem  It's an ecosystem and most people have benefited  Pretty dramatically over being first movers in the iOS environment  So I think we're gonna see an X and pretty big explosion in app development  For this for this platform and not just for I think for entertainment  but I think that the Apple TV is you already see a lot of these in schools in  Corporations for a variety of other reasons and that was before the apps were available  So I think that there is a lot of markets beyond just the home that this is gonna be very useful for I should point

Start time: 618.32
End time: 636.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Out 200 bucks for the 64 gig version  150 bucks for the 32 gig the 64 it strikes me you'd be kind of nuts to get the 32 they say Apple says well if you're  Just gonna stream video you're not gonna download a lot of apps. You don't need 64. So how do you know that?  Right, how do you know don't do that? It's not like you can upgrade it. No, well, that's the thing, right?

Start time: 636.68
End time: 684.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And and it they don't make it that easy to manage your storage space  I mean you can you can choose what apps you want to install and uninstall  And that's pretty easy. You can see what's taking up the most space  But you can't really manage how they do their caching for different stuff  And so early on a lot of people were concerned with the games. They were saying oh, well, how are these games?  Going to be able to show up on the Apple TV because they can't download stuff  You know the way that we we thought that we could  They're limited to a certain size, but that's only for for the initial. I guess like like code side. You can then download  Assets in greater sizes. So if you if you download Crossy Road or asphalt eight or other games  You know, it'll take a little bit longer and download that stuff and that takes up more space on your device  You know  So yeah, I tend to be one of those people who whether it's from from Apple or Google or Amazon or whoever  It's like I buy whatever the most spaces that let me buy

Start time: 685.68
End time: 707.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm the same way although, you know, they have this app thinning idea that you don't have the whole app  You just have the stuff you absolutely need and then download or and delete as needed. I still feel like I  Don't know. I think Apple does this they have a 16 gig version of the iPhone 2 they don't expect to buy it  They just want to be able to say it's only 150 or starts from 150 bucks

Start time: 710.74
End time: 713.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If they had made 128 gig version I would have gotten that I know

Start time: 715.66
End time: 727.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Deal though with 4k we talked about that a lot Apple says absolutely not it will never be a 4k device  Doesn't seem to be any reason why it couldn't be hardware wise it it's there's some chip issues

Start time: 728.49
End time: 732.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was gonna say I think there are some chip issues  Go on. Yeah

Start time: 744.90
End time: 775.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I feel I feel like if they did to the a9  then they would be  Which is what's in the six and the six the success and the success plus right around me a nine  I feel like then they probably would have been able to do 4k more easily. I think it's probably as a chipset thing  I also think it's probably like and you have to think I mean  You get the distinct feeling that they would have liked to have maybe brought this out six months ago, right?  Because of just various things mean feel like this this was something that was ready to go maybe from a hardware perspective

Start time: 775.90
End time: 801.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They wanted to make deals with their networks in the local stations. They weren't able to make those deals  They weren't able to make so they said let's release it. We're gonna have to release it  You know to be if you're gonna be cynical it also gives them something they can do next year  Right with an updated Apple TV when there are more people with 4k displays. Well, and when there's more 4k content  There's a lot of 4k cut I don't know how good it is, but there's no voodoo and there's a Netflix

Start time: 801.32
End time: 838.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a lot of 4k content. No, but I've never actually looked at what content is available on Netflix. It's like six things  It's like Breaking Bad, which is actually 35 millimeter  Converted to 4k where they do like the scanning process. Okay, then you've got I think you know  House of cards the second season and the third season  There are a couple of movies that are that are 4k conversions and are  For their part. Okay  There's a lot of nature films. I mean, it's like it's still like HD TV. So was remember? Yeah  Bikini TV HD net it's like all that. It's just like TV. Yeah, yeah, by the way

End time: 873.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Roku gave up on games, you know Roku started  And then they said, you know not to keep it at a good price point to make a convenient small box

Start time: 873.46
End time: 881.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're gonna stick with streaming and not worry about gaming. Well, I think it would have been hard for Roku to do it  I mean, I think that the difference is is that there's already an enormous number of games that have been built

Start time: 881.76
End time: 891.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know Android TV I could play all those games on my shield my Nvidia shield and watch 4k video  It's not very compelling. If you got us if you care about gaming you have an Xbox or PlayStation

Start time: 892.82
End time: 906.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. This is more like a we I feel like even even down to it, you know the controller stuff  Which is not a bad strategy, but I feel like gaming at least I think the gaming part is like a nice to have  But I feel like you buy this maybe for other types of apps

Start time: 907.06
End time: 917.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They could eventually come out. What do you think about Amazon though saying?  They pulled all listings for Google and Apple TV devices on Thursday. They're gone. They yanked them

Start time: 918.02
End time: 923.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're gone. I think it makes them Amazon look petty look at you look at me. They spent all this time  Go ahead. Go ahead

Start time: 925.31
End time: 948.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just a really bad precedent  You know Amazon's obviously interested in moving into other areas and other market categories  And if they're gonna pull the competitors products from every category that they move into it's obviously a pretty bad thing  It's also interesting that they haven't pulled competitors smartphones or tablets off of there and even gaming platforms  You can see that being a competitor  So yeah, it's it's really just a petty ugly thing that Amazon's done  And I hope it's something that they don't continue to do for other countries

Start time: 949.20
End time: 964.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They spent all this time trying to say no, we're really not that company that was that the you know, that was rich  You know, we were we weren't hacked. I mean that wasn't that was a hatchet job  We were you know, we are really a nice company and now we're gonna do something that is really small-minded and petty

Start time: 964.84
End time: 981.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and then the excuse they give which I find  Strange credulity to say the least is oh well  They don't have Amazon streaming apps on Chromecast and Apple TV and we don't want to support that  Well, whose job is that to put exactly job is that exactly Amazon?

Start time: 981.88
End time: 984.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's because Amazon doesn't agree with the rules not good

Start time: 985.60
End time: 1031.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If they wanted to add it to their app like because they already had the AirPlay support, you know for  The Amazon apps on iOS literally enter in one line of code and then it would work on the Chromecast  So I kind of understand the Apple TV argument a little bit  Maybe they're saying we don't know if Apple will accept this and we'll try we don't know build this fine  But but but with Chromecast it's complete  Yes, because it would literally be like one line of code the existing Amazon app and keep in mind Amazon ops  Not to offer their apps in the Google Play Store  Like you've got to download them directly from Amazon and that's fine  But Google has even told me just because it's not in Google Play doesn't mean that it couldn't have  The the the cast API stuff like that wouldn't matter at all  So it seems like mean there's no way you can view this as anywhere other than like Tim was saying just a really petty move

Start time: 1031.36
End time: 1035.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That has a really bad precedent. Well, Google's made an open platform with Chromecast

Start time: 1035.72
End time: 1068.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, they have and and I mean they developed the original API is and SDK stuff with Netflix like it's you know  The the Teebo from a couple of years ago had it early on, you know  Like there are other companies who support this stuff  It would be very easy for them to support it if they wanted to I so I feel like that's like the worst excuse  If you don't want to support it. Okay, I get that if you don't want to carry your competitors products. I  Don't love that but fine, but don't try to pretend like you're the victim in all this when actually you're not you know because

Start time: 1069.74
End time: 1101.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's also not even good business  I mean the the the issue is you have people who the kind of people who are buying these right now are the kind of  People that probably spend a lot of money on Amazon  I spent a lot of money on Amazon  And one of the reasons that I spend a lot of money on Amazon is because I always know I can get everything at Amazon  I don't have to put my credit card stuff in again or my address  I just I just know that I can just go up and get it and it'll be there in a day and it's easy  And as soon as they make it hard  Find it somewhere else and then maybe I'll start ordering more stuff from somewhere else, you know  And and and it's just it's just so bone-headed

Start time: 1102.08
End time: 1128.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did I mention though what a great set of screen savers that your point your point really is here now  We're going over London. It's great.

You don't even want to think about it  It happens faster than you think and you got to start saving now the sooner you start saving the better  The question is as you save how do you manage that? What do you invest in? What do you do with your money?  Do you hire an advisor? You know, they're gonna take between 1 and 3 percent every year of what you've got under management  Not to mention hidden fees for transactions and changes you have to do awfully well to overcome that  That's like that's like starting a race with a millstone around your neck. Of course, you could do it yourself  That's what I always thought I'll do it myself five years later. I wonder what's happening to my investments  I don't and then I don't want to look right? I don't want to look I got a great solution for you  Wealth front wealth front makes it easy for anyone to access world-class  Long-term I want to emphasize this.

You'll see what they're doing  You've got an app that you can see exactly what trades are making on your behalf at all times  It's not a surprise wealth front has has grown  2,000% in the last two years 20 20 times growth.

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean to I'm pretty excited about the prospect here  I'm just a little bummed out that it's as expensive as it is  You know $300 more than an iPad Air to start seems like seems like quite a premium  But I definitely think that there could be potential for for big sales here  I keep reading surveys that show like 90% of tablets never leave the home and if you're looking for the ultimate couch surfing device  You know 12 inches is better than 8 or 9 inches or 5 inches  So I think it makes a lot of sense but that you know that cost simply pushes it up to the professional  Market and I'm wondering how many pros are gonna go out and dive on these things and start using it for  Sketching and design and that kind of thing. I'm curious to see the adoption there. Well, you don't have to guess too much longer

Transcript:  I'm holding in my hand. Wait a minute. Don't show that Windows logo  Something very similar to an iPad  Pro this is the surface book but a surface Pro would be very similar with it. And of course Microsoft says  This isn't a pencil. It's a pen and it has an eraser  So there you go. Take that  Apple I have to say this of course is not gonna be like the pencil where you can do the edge and is low  Latency, you know zero latency. This has very little latency, but it's maybe it's a little late  I don't know. Does that look latent to you? It looks pretty fast to me

Start time: 1911.82
End time: 1925.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've just found that even even with the surface I have a surface three  Even with that I find it hard if I sit down and this is what I'm interested to see what happens with the pro  Is that I want to be able to take notes on you know, just like take notes on the screen and like when I'm at a location

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and I just find that I the text is still not as  Like and maybe the pro won't be any better, but I just find that it's not like writing on paper yet  Well, it's slippery, right? There's a little is that it's yeah  You know when I'm drawing like little diagrams of you know  I'm usually doing site surveys and so I'm drawing diagrams of buildings and rooms and trying to do stuff

Transcript:  It's close. Yeah, I take a lot of notes on my s pen on my  Samsung Galaxy Note which which I've become hooked to I've had the last three generations and I use that constantly so for that  That's a huge boon for me to be able to take notes on there and export them into Google Docs as a PDF and just  Pull them up on my laptop. That's fantastic  Samsung's done a lot of work to get the feel of that down. So, you know, it's still not the same as writing on paper  Obviously, but it is still it's pretty good  I'm definitely curious to see what the writing experience is like on the probe  But but even so, you know taking notes on a 12 inch tablet  That seems actually seems like that's a little bit too big in that case because you know  You want to hold it one hand and then write with the other hand if you're not sitting  That be able to bit too much for me. The note is the perfect size for that  I can hold it easily in one hand and scribble with the other hand and I do scribble

Transcript:  My I have a note five and I really like I have to say the pen is very well done in that  But I rarely use it. I really and then and I and this is a surface book and I rarely detach this  You know, the only thing it's really it's actually is a little bit good for is a crossword puzzles  You can do the Sunday Sunday. This is a nice Sunday Times crossword puzzle  Device and you can handwrite but it will do the recognition in there. Let me just load a  puzzle that I've been  I like touch. I wish Apple put touch on the MacBook. I really like I do too  Yeah, this is just such a natural way to work. And so you you can write in here, you know, I  Don't know what my I don't know what the word is  But you can actually write in by hand and it'll turn it into into text and you can I like having an eraser  I have to say Apple should really consider that as well  It's it's actually really a natural thing to turn the pen upside down and start erasing  This is the surface book  This is the one with a crazy hinge and I have very much in love with this and I'm not as you know  I am NOT a Windows guy, but they they've done a lot of things quite nicely  I think I will say that I do like my surface three a lot and I do use it a fair bit

Yeah, we're still using my mom's cause a flip phone  Yeah, if you have an income of seventy five thousand dollars and up eighty seven percent have a smartphone, but what's interesting is tablet adoption  desktop computer adoption  You know not great desktop computers actually starting to drop laptop computers to  Tablet computers have basically leveled off in the last couple of years as have game consoles as you might imagine mp3 players dropping slowly  Ebook readers taking the biggest dive.

That's my that's my real goal. You've made it. Yeah, I kind of made it  And that's all I it's all I ever wanted it's all I ever asked  And now actually now I'm going the other way. I'm going no, I don't have to buy another cell phone  I just got four. I don't want another cell phone. It's actually painful now  I'm sorry about the materialism. It's just that we feel we need to review these  So that you at home don't have to buy four new cell phones. You can buy whatever the the one that's the best is  Perspective is very important. Yes. I need to play with them all  mp3 players and  But and computers declined by double digits among the 18 to 29 year old set. They're not buying computers. They've got a computer  It's called a smartphone  And let's see here cell phone  Penetration including smartphones is 98% among adults under 30  smartphones 86 percent  But the computers are dropping in 2010. It was 88 percent penetration now. It's 78 percent  So it's dropping mp3 players, of course going from 70 in five years from 75 percent to half  game consoles  Dropping 2013. It was a 71 percent penetration  2015 only two years later 56 percent  It's a big drop there  There's tablet computers really flat  There of course it went up when the iPad came up because there was nothing really before that there was some really bad tablets  But it's flattened out over the last few years  And that's why Apple's doing the iPad Pro. They've got to find some way to get people back into the marketplace  I don't know if that's the one that'll do it, especially considering the cost  again, they make a  What is the smallest this 30 it's only two memory sizes 32 and 128 right?

Knock him do that. That's not okay, and it's not okay  So I feel like but if they made a 64 option, I don't feel like anyone would buy the 128

Start time: 2562.58

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because in 32 is like, okay, we're not we're gonna put this out as a fleet  Some for a large company, you know, some people exactly, you know  and and it's mostly cloud-based that they're gonna be using Salesforce or Google Docs or whatever and  And I think 128 is people are actually gonna be roaming around and expecting to keep their their content

Start time: 2580.94
End time: 2609.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's like the 128, you know, that's where it could go into laptop replacement category  Whereas like you said, you know  if you're running out of fleet of something if you're you know, where most stuff is gonna be based to the cloud or  You've got even virtual machine stuff happening or whatever then that's fine  But if you want to actually use it as a potential laptop replacement, you've got to have 128 and and if we're being honest even  128 you know, that's like the minimum level you have in a MacBook Air  So, you know, that's that's fair.

Start time: 2631.30
End time: 2741.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, this is oh this is like it's probably two years on of declining  Yeah  And I have to wonder if some of it is because they don't yet still know like what the life cycle of an iPad is  I think this is one of the biggest problems, you know  When when you and I Leo are talking about the fact we don't know if we want the new iPad, right?  Like that's an issue when I'm going, you know  If I didn't have if I wasn't given an iPad Air 2 as a gift. I  Wouldn't have gotten I wouldn't have gone from the iPad Air to the iPad Air 2. I would have waited  That they're now not even releasing an iPad Air 3. They're literally gonna keep it around for another year  So I don't know what they know what the life cycle or the upgrade cycle on these devices still is, you know  Because there's still an awful lot of people who have iPad twos and an iPad minis  And and I've had threes so they're not even on the air kind of cycle yet  So it's like okay, and then the apps still work people use it primarily as a web browser. It's good enough  What's the point of upgrading it if you're mostly gonna watch video play games and surf the web, you know  And that's I think in their biggest problem is that for a laptop you've known okay, you maybe have like a three to four year life cycle  Maybe more or less depending on what people are doing with it  but with a tablet where's a phone, you know that basically everybody wants to upgrade every two years because as those services are showing  This is the device we use the most, you know  You use your phone more than you use anything and so there's some of us who upgrade more than once a year  There's some of us who have multiple phones, but I think the average person is probably that that kind of two-year lifecycle, right?  But with a tablet we don't know and as a product that's only five years old  I don't think Apple even knows yet like what's the lifecycle is and that makes it really hard to then kind of I guess  Extrapolate numbers because I I've said this before I feel like in the beginning everybody underestimated the success of the iPad and then they way way way  overestimated it and  that's

It's not nobody has no one's fingers. It's not fast enough, right?  Right, I mean you I you can feel the difference like the new iPhone is much snappier than the last version  But you would miss it plays everything. Yeah

Transcript:  Right, and we like you said, you know, the web browser is where I think  It's weird. That's now kind of the bottleneck and that  Right, so so then so, you know that was kind of the bottleneck  But the apps are kind of written to go how they go and a lot of developers optimize  For the lower level hardware because they know that they still have a lot of users on that stuff. So yeah, it's like, okay  What's gonna happen where on the phones you kind of can make the excuse that well  We can't push things too much further because then battery life would be non-existent  But on tablets it's interesting that we haven't seen anybody really try to kind of like really up the ante and kind of make  It be like you can't have this experience unless you have this  Device but I almost have to wonder if that then becomes an issue for developers where they're going  Do we really want to force people to upgrade to the latest tablets and risk not having any users?  So I don't know. It's kind of a catch-22. I think there's a tension between

Transcript:  Don't think they can move things forward would be a focus on gaming like what really accelerated PC growth back in the 80s and 90s  But ultimately, you know the hot games on mobile are very simple games at this point  They don't require Apple TV for a lot of graphics. That's last year's technology  so if indeed  You know as consoles continue to decline if there is still a strong demand for that kind of gaming and if indeed mobile devices  Can step in and fill that demand and maybe there's an opportunity there for these things to grow and at that point you can  Start to make a case for annual upgrades as graphics get better  You need more powerful processors and all that good stuff  But by and large, you know  We've seen the mobile industry and the gamers in the mobile industry be very happy with very limited graphics and very limited gameplay  And so, you know whether or not that can work  I don't know but that seems to be the only hope I think that could help push things into a very saturated market

Transcript:  well, and the question really comes down to whether Apple should be  investing in  You know pushing ideas whether they're developing or paying developers to do some of this where they're  What we're looking for not is not just people developing stuff but people that are gonna push the outside envelope of what an iPad can do  if Apple spent  100 million dollars a year investing in those things it would definitely make that back if it created things that you have to have  the new iPad for you know  Because I think that right now a lot of people are very comfortable with how do I develop something for the widest number of?  Possible use cases, you know, so it's gonna work every I get frustrated when someone released an iPad only thing  I really would just want to use my phone, you know, you know  So, you know I so I get you know  So I think that a lot of people develop for the widest market possible

There's nothing special about it  But I think the very fact that when they're releasing something for the beats product line that beats people know that  There still needs to be an Android app  shows that that Apple  Recognizes at least for some parts of their business that they can't be completely iOS only.

Transcript:  Was just gonna say that I think that a lot of this has to do with the fact that YouTube had to find  It's not so much YouTube needing to make more money or I mean, I'm sure they'd like to but the big issue is is that?  the ad based  revenues for the creators was too low and  You think you have to find a way I think I think in the long term  I think that's what they're I I believe that they're really looking for how do they?  To stay competitive as more and more like as Facebook starts doing its own thing as everybody else is doing they have to be more  Competitive they have to find ways because especially in  Highly vertical markets. So you have a small number of people who are interested in what you're doing  Advertising doesn't work at all. Like really advertising doesn't isn't even viable in YouTube  If you have less than a million views per per unit in my opinion and so

Start time: 3566.16
End time: 3589.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it's not I mean it the bull especially since since YouTube will let you sell your own ads exactly  Let's be real if YouTube really wanted creators of all sizes even big ones to make money from advertising  What they would do is they would say  You can sell your own ads not you have to put our ads in front of this  But you can actually go out and have your own salespeople do it and maybe we'll take a cut off the top  But you can sell your own ads, but they don't do that

Start time: 3589.74
End time: 3596.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I do believe they will let you run you  That you can get into agreements where you can sell your own ads and give them a cut but no one wants to do that

Start time: 3596.54
End time: 3625.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Either and so they don't they actually make I mean maybe at the very very top they do  But that's been one of the long-standing things why we haven't seen a lot of commercial programming on YouTube  Is that they won't let the big studios make those sorts of deals and I think the studios would be okay with giving them  A cut even if it was less than what YouTube might want because they could get so much more  And it could be so much better targeted  But that's why instead you have the PewDiePie's of the world Michelle fans who have to off to you like, you know  Sponsorship things they have to have that's where they make their money don't they?

Start time: 3630.64
End time: 3704.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that's the people who have the most right those the people the absolute most  Used are having to use these other sources  So clearly I mean I think that it's it's great to want to blame it on ad blockers and everybody then that that makes a  Really kind of catchy headline, but the reality is that Google and YouTube really cared about making a better, you know  income for or making the ad situation better for for their creators and they would let them have more control over the advertising process  But they don't and so this I agree with you Alex  I think in the long run has the potential to give them more money, but I still feel like if you look at it  You know, why why are ad rates so much higher on?  Traditional television than they are on on online video even things like the the Super Bowl or even like NFL games, right?  Like an NFL game spot that the Yahoo was able to sell  Went for way less than what it would sell for on TV  Even though the potential size of the audience in in the targeted size of the audience is in some ways better why?  There are a lot of reasons behind that but if YouTube is really serious about  Making the ad play work. They would let their creators or the the companies that do you know the  maker  studios of the world  Actually make their own ad deals, but they don't we

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I believe that's what they're calling it  Which is great that they make it they make it seem like this is actually something that the fans are saying  Patreon, please. Yeah  Like fans really want to watch PewDiePie do a show that he's getting paid money for let's be very clear about that  His his PewDiePie is scared show. He's not paying anything for that  He's getting paid lots of money for that and then if they pay $10 a month  They can watch people scare him which no one is going to do that for the original content  But I do feel like people might subscribe for the ad free experience. I don't feel like the original content will  Make anybody I don't care who you are want to pay for it on YouTube stuff  I mean, maybe once they have a transparent or a house of cards or an orange is the new black  It'll be a different story. Do you think they will?  No, I don't because I feel like the people who are capable of making those sorts of programs are not going to use  Going to other places that frankly do a better job of monetizing and let them advertise in a better way, right?

Ultimately, I don't think YouTube needs to do that  They've obviously shown that they can do really really well with user-generated content make a whole lot of money that way and I think  Forward this you do the premium content market. They could does YouTube make money  That's a good I should make sure they've been successful whether not the profit of revenue. I don't think they make any money

I remember Dana Burnetti was telling us he's the producer  He said, you know, we were all set to do a deal with a big cable company HBO  We were all set and I got a phone call the night before  And  They said a hundred million dollars  You can launch all the episodes of season one all at once if you want complete creative control

Is this like the UP in launch from 1995?  Like it's some terrible stuff, right?  Like it's seriously terrible stuff that no one's going to pay for but that doesn't matter  They don't necessarily have to pay for the originals if they're paying even ten dollars just to get rid of the ads whether it's parents  Or people who have the I mean you have small kids

Transcript:  I was gonna ask if anyone else is optimistic that this could spread across other areas of the internet as well  You know Google already has the option to buy a certain number of ads on web pages  And I'm pretty excited by the opportunity for people to pay for ads to go away and making that a bit more of a visible  Thing I think this is a great way to move that idea forward  Ultimately, I think that's the way that the internet grows going forward  you know, we've already seen the continuing battle between ad blockers and banner ads and  How banner ads just getting uglier and uglier and users want to opt out of that?  I do think that we need a major player to come in and really make it a viable option for  For people to be able to pay money to make ads go away or a significant number of ads go away  And I would like to think that maybe this sort of thing could grow into that kind of thing where you pay not only  $10 a month to make YouTube go away or YouTube ads go away  Maybe you pay $15 a month and every Google ad that's anywhere goes away  Maybe you pay $20 a month and that extra $5 and goes to other ad networks and their ads go away  I would love to see that kind of thing. I think Google is the only one who could really make that happen

Transcript:  We were early NDA partners. I couldn't talk about it, but we now that it's public I can so we're one of the launch podcasts  They aren't gonna launch though. They say for months. I don't know why months but they they there's right now  They're getting podcasters to submit feeds  But I it's my understanding that exactly what you just said Christina. So the what songs so here's my Google  Music interface what songs it does is it says it's Sunday evening play music for working out making dinner  Game day hanging out relaxing at home and then within relaxing at home you choose  Classic rock relaxation and within that there's three three radio stations  Podcasts will be in there. So if the example Elias gave is I'm I need to cheer up  Play some upbeat fun podcasts for me. So discovery will be a part of that and that's a big deal for podcasters  Not it's funny less. So for me, I think but if you're a new podcaster a huge a huge thing  So I'm thrilled to see this and this will be installed by default on Android phones. So it's the first podcast app  you know, they've always been podcast apps on iOS and  And on Windows phone. This is the first time they've done this on Android.

That's only a browser  Right I was convinced kids  Most users nowadays don't need a full-blown operating system and a lot of school's and security  Yes, well I had to the Chromebooks. This is the right solution. It's secure. I mean really secure  Deep down at its roots secure  It does like everything that 99% of people want to do. I mean most people all they do is internet and email  It'll do that. No problem. I don't understand why you want to add an app store the security issues that are introduced by more than a million apps  It it surprises me

Transcript:  Can't you provide the same experience through Android though effectively by creating a custom version or some subversion of Android that effectively?  Only runs Chrome so that effectively you have basically the Chrome app running within the Android operating system and so any  You're limiting your developer pool any extensions that are made then to the Chrome browser there  Then get ported back to Android as well. It makes your life a little bit easier  Without having to support these two completely separate operating systems

Transcript:  It's a small difference because really both are based on Linux, right? You know, I mean I  Guess the biggest difference is Android is Java  Sitting, you know in a special Java virtual machine Dalvik or the new one  Which is called art?  Chrome is not it's a direct you just direct code, right?  so I'm I  Don't know. I mean John feels like going going to Java is going backwards, but I might I might be wrong on that  It is credible it's coming from the Wall Street Journal they usually seem to get these stories, right  This they say that  Android was an almost retro approach within the company because it focused on devices that only worked when software and apps are downloaded onto them  And Google is a is a is a is a cloud company  Chrome OS is a cloud OS, you know, right most of what you do is in the cloud  Most of what you do is in the cloud

Transcript:  Mean I would think that too  I mean a big part of the the reason you would want to do this would be I mean  Obviously Chrome is worse is more secure and and can have those benefits  But why would you give up the app ecosystem, right?  Why would you give up some of the off, you know the the offline caching stuff because you know  That is still one of the big things with the Chromebook is you do need to have a connection and if you pay for you know  They're ridiculously priced Wi-Fi or you know LG LTE things and that's fine  But a lot of people don't want to do that  I think that it'll be interesting to see how they implement apps and if maybe apps can run on their own kind of you know  Like you know like Linux, you know, like like instances  So that it doesn't you know potentially conflict with the more secure stuff on on your system  I think they could do some interesting things with it because fundamentally I mean there it's a Linux kernel

Transcript:  For both would be part of what Android would give you as well sandboxes for each app, you know, the sandboxes are perfect  We've certainly seen  Exploits and all sorts of problems there but in theory, you know each each app would indeed be running within its own sandbox  It would be secure environment, you know as secure as Android is and can be anyhow  So it's not perfect but you know, you can provide that within there and again  I think the main benefit would be any then extensions any moves forward that you make then get ported back to Android automatically without having to  Have two developer teams working in sync and trying to keep the same browser in parallel on multiple platforms

Transcript:  And I'd be really interested if what they did in this regard ended up being the kind of thing where you know  Android's great on smaller screens  Chrome OS I have to imagine would not be great on a very small screen  But we know that it sings that it's that its comfort zone is like in that laptop kind of style category Chrome OS as a  touch only interface period kind of doesn't really work either  It's nice to have the integrated touch, but it's not perfect and no I really touch as we were talking before the show

Transcript:  so it kind of this kind of I was a little afraid of it when I first heard of it if we got this and it was  The kind of thing where when it's in tablet when it's pulled out as a tablet you're working in Android when you pop it  That keyboard it knows all right. This is productivity mode  Let's switch over to Chrome OS and give you give you an environment that's tailor-made for that. I'd be really into that actually  I think that's the best

Start time: 5741.30

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean all you do is you open Chrome on this  Device even though you're an Android and now if the Chrome has all the capabilities of Chrome OS you're in Chrome OS  I suppose so. Yeah, the thing about  Android doesn't have is all of that security the power washing  You know Chrome OS does some amazing things with boot  It actually has two kind of versions of the firmware and it validates one before it will use it  I mean it's just it's just so many brilliant things  It's totally devoted to making a secure system. Now if we could bring that to Android  That becomes a very interesting play because that's where Android is starting to lose some ground iOS is in security, right?

Start time: 5783.19
End time: 5818.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe that's the goal  Maybe the goal is to basically take those resources that are at this point maintaining  Chrome OS and bring that that that smarts it into it and then also as Jason is suggesting  Bring the desktop usability of Chrome OS to Android which he definitely lacks  I mean even if you do put it into a laptop environment the buttons are too big the topography isn't great for  What you would expect from a desktop environment  So if it could do the best of both worlds and learn a lot from Chrome OS, I think would be pretty great  It would be an interesting move for Google to start moving into the laptop world, too  You know, they've had laptops in the past, but they've never been a mass-market machine  This could be if it were low cost enough and it probably would be

Start time: 5831.90
End time: 5884.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, moving that way. I mean, but I think to Tim's point. I think that you've got to have  Your resources best executed in a lot of ways you're trying to reinvent the wheel twice, right?  Like it seems like they're trying to do the same thing in two different places  So, you know, I think we all expected this to happen this conversions to happen which are which one would win  Maybe there was a difference of opinion  I always expected Android would win because it's bigger and it's it's obviously way more widespread they use but I mean  Just because they're going in one direction  This way, you know  They're converging doesn't mean that the Android implementation on the laptop would be exactly the same as it is on the phone  You know, there would be nothing to stop them from from kind of maybe making this hybrid thing  But it was still fun to only be Android base makes the pixel see a lot more interesting. It does  It does I mean it makes it kind of look like the future. Yeah crap one more thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That was kind of led by people who were  Associated with gamer gates more on the pro gamer gate side  And then one that was was dealing not specifically with gamer gate  But more with over idea of harassment and gaming of which gamer gate has obviously been a part and so they were both going  To be part of South by Southwest  South by Southwest didn't really do a good job of explaining how the the pro gamer gate panel  Which the circumstances from what I understand of how it was even allowed into the into the process and how voting took place  seemed a little sketchy  Was was going to be there and when people found out people on the other panel and people in general obviously were upset  And then South by Southwest made the decision to say okay  well  we're gonna take this criticism aimed at us and just  Not have any panels on this at all and then people got really mad and and vox and buzzfee threatened to leave South by Southwest all  together and and and it became this  Complete PR nightmare and frankly still is for them a PR nightmare and now they're saying they're gonna have this harassment  Summit like this whole day talking about harassment  But now it turns out it looks like the pro gamer gate panel might actually be part of the harassment summer at summit  So or at least the panel, excuse me  Not the pro gamer gate panel the panel that is made up by people who are largely  on the side of people who are in support of the gamer gate movement will be on this panel too, which then makes  people on the opposite sides feel like how can you have a harassment panel when  one of the or summit when when people who are  Again when people who we perceive as being part of our harassment are going to be in the same room with us and be part  of the same, you know set of  Events and so it's kind of it's kind of an nightmare.

Now. It's marketers spring is CNN spring  Honestly, it's marketers spring break and and I say this is someone who's been going to South by Southwest interactive for the last eight years  Who my husband and I went from being co-workers to like he's now my husband at South by Southwest

And so I understand from South wise perspective, but they're like, you know, it's bad for business  But the people at Coca-Cola really don't want to deal with the drama and I totally get that and I totally get that their  Reaction to just canceling both panels outright was not good  Then the blowback started and they couldn't just cancel level up

So first they tried to get rid of both now  they're doing this you know this summit on harassment, but by including people who have  some of the people on other panels are saying our leading campaigns are involved people who are  Part of the harassment it makes it a difficult

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm sure she would and it sucks that that she can't and that other people who are involved with this can't that literally their entire  Identities whether you're pro or against it has to be led up into this  Let's face it very small movement that is very, you know politically charged that has a lot of emotion on both sides  But it's a very small thing in the big scheme of things  My big my big issue was South by Southwest and I say this is someone who is gone  Like I said and been part of that community for years is that you can't this is not this is not an issue where you can  Pretend as if you're going to be neutral and not take sides on because they already took a side  You know that they approved the safe point panel and that's fine  But if you're gonna do that, then you need to acknowledge that this is not a place where you can you know  the  People's safety does kind of come at issue  But also just you know  You can't having a harassment summit in response to the criticism they were getting for not being  You know, I guess sensitive enough just seems short-sighted  especially when  Some of the people that were you know victims of some of the harassment immediately after the panels were pulled are saying hey  You know, I'm now getting even more harassment because you're now doing this anti harassment panel thing  I don't know the whole thing is a mess and and I'm not really sure what the reaction is going to be  But it doesn't look like South by has handled this  Correctly in any way at all, which is ironic considering  You know that the amount of panels that happened at South by Southwest every year  Explained to people how to you know handle social media crises. Yeah, they didn't handle it

Start time: 6500.26
End time: 6527.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah on Monday. They canceled the panels by Friday the the pain point to become great enough that they created this  Day long online harassment summit. I have to say that seems like a good response  It is clearly something that needs to be talked about and inviting all the members  mean I guess  inviting  Trolls to an event like that may not be the only thing I'd say best thing to do

Start time: 6527.72

Transcript:  It just depends on how good the folks are on the other side of actually having in debate because because you know the hard  Part was saying that they're not right. Well, but the thing is is if they're chaotic, but done  Well, they can pull the trolls out and make them look absolutely insane  You know like a good person on the other side who knows what they're doing can tear these guys apart by letting them just talk

Start time: 6548.16
End time: 6645.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Agreed and I also but I feel like it's a it's a thing too  Where you know, there are certain gatekeepers that kind of come up to this thing  You know, you've got to pay to attend this festival unless you're speaker your press or something and it's not a cheap event to attend  So yeah, I wonder if I believed it in the beginning  They thought that that in and of itself the fact that there is you know, what kind of a border to entry, you know  Having to pay a lot of money would prevent a lot of you know harassers from showing up in person and maybe it will maybe  It won't but by streaming this online, which I think is important  I think the debate and having everybody involved in the debate no matter what side they're on is important, too  I don't think you can just have a conference with one side of this  I mean if they're not gonna choose sides that they're really gonna try to be neutral then they need to be you know  They need to set ground rules though that say we're not going to in any way support that if we find out people associated with one  Panel and I don't care what side you're on  But if you're on one panel and you're hurting you're supporting behind-the-scenes harassment or doxing or you know, just general  You know like trying to make people's lives miserable. You can't be involved with this event  I think that should be one thing and and I don't know if some of the people on you know  We're potentially involved with this feel like South by has their back because of the way  They felt like they were treated when they brought up the fact that hey, you know  It's kind of a problem that this panel was approved alongside our panel  And now we're getting you know  It was already hard enough for for one of the panels which wasn't approved even get there because of the harassment and South by didn't  Seem to take that seriously  I understand why anybody would kind of go into this skeptically  I'm a little skeptical that this thing will actually end up happening at all. I don't know

Start time: 6725.86
End time: 6841.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it could be a separate thing  No  because it's not because I don't believe it is because it started with the their idea of ethics and gaming journalism was the fact that  An ex-boyfriend of a game developer started talking about other people  She was maybe maybe not involved with and then drawing conclusions and correlations that weren't even true saying the whole reason she got her game  Reviewed on this website was because of this relationship with someone else  That's what they're talking about when it comes to ethics and in journalism and it's not ethics and journalism  It's slut-shaming is what it is. That's honestly what it is  Okay, that and and and if they have broader ethical concerns with the gaming press, that's completely fine  But much of the conversation about it was never divided between  Like the conversation of someone's personal life and something else, you know  They're and if we want to have a cop talk topics about conversations about ethics and journalism  That's a fair conversation to have there's certainly ethical lines that every type of business journalism including gaming  Struggles with and one of those is how close you become with your sources?  How you know what what what do you go through?  I mean Tim and I know this, you know when you're you know people as its friends  But also, you know, they are potentially people you write about, you know  It can be a tough line to hoe and that's an interesting discussion to have I don't necessarily think that  For all the the banner they've been putting it under  It's the  That's really what they care about and I would I wouldn't be opposed to having or even seen a discussion or a debate between  Both sides if it was moderated correctly and if it was  There was respect on both sides  I think that some of the skepticism comes into place with just the fact that people who have been  Genuinely harassed whether they're from people who are really part of the movement or not  Whether it's people who are involved with these other panels or not  They feel like they've been genuinely harassed and targeted and they don't necessarily like the idea  That people who have been targeting and harassing them could now be part of this same anti harassment summit and and and it's it  I think that the only way you solve this is by being transparent which South by Southwest and hasn't been

Transcript:  Did you see it? I get to drive it as a matter of fact yes  So how does actually made a prototype fuel cell car since I think 2008 they had this car called the FCX clarity  Which was available in very limited numbers basically just for testing people in standards of bodies that kind of thing  But they're actually going to make a production version of the car and have it available for sale in Japan starting in March  This spring called the clarity fuel cell is the formal name of the car  But it's basically a normal four-door sedan. It's kind of got some funky styling so maybe not all that normal  But ultimately instead of running on gas or plugging it in the wall you chart it up with hydrogen  There are two fuel tanks you can see in that picture there  There's a big fuel tank in the trunk a smaller one underneath the rear seats, and it gives you  About 400 miles of range which is pretty  And you can recharge it in less than two minutes because it's again  You're just pumping in gas and the thing effectively and the only emissions from this car is water  And it's drinkable distilled water effectively that comes out of the tailpipe in the thing it drives very nicely very quiet  Just like driving an EV, but instead of having the electrons coming from a battery

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a small battery pack underneath the front seats  But basically that just serves kind of as a buffer for the fuel cell  The electricity comes from the hydrogen through the fuel cell into the battery and then out to the motors  So that way you can kind of store up some electricity  But yeah, it does make the cost a lot lower and you know  it solves a lot of the issues that people have with EVs with range and and ultimately it kind of in theory could give  Gas stations a way forward to into the future without them having to disappear  But of course the big problem is availability there are you know  Maybe a few dozen hydrogen stations in the US that you could drive your car up to and fill up  And you're gonna need a lot more than that before before this could go forward  But Honda actually had a solution for that too. They have a thing basically a fuel cell generator  It's about the size of a shipping crate a little bit bigger  But basically you can point that down anywhere uses solar power and a source of water to generate hydrogen  Which is which is kind of neat so in theory, you know, there's an easy solution forward for the hydrogen generation, too  I just want to see if that ever takes off

Transcript:  I mean obviously  In any motor vehicle what you need is a source of a lot of energy that could be easily stored and then released on demand  You'd like that a source of energy to be renewable the problem with fossil fuels is there no more dinosaurs  So you want it to be solar would be nice, but there's other ways to do this  And if you can then somehow take the solar energy convert it to this compact  reusable form of energy  Then you've got then you've got something how highly compresses the hydrogen in this stuff.

End time: 7136.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think so. No, I mean ultimately, you know, we've got to get more on the road and see how things go  But they certainly been very thoroughly crash tested and there are systems in the car that will for example if they detect a leak or  Problem in the system will shut down all the electrical systems in the car to reduce the chance of a spark or anything like that  So, you know, they're being pretty smart about it  But you know based on the I saw those tanks they look pretty beefy and they've actually in crash footage where even if that car gets  We rented in a very serious accident. The tanks don't don't rupture. So I'm pretty a gas tank ruptures. You got a problem

Transcript:  Yep witness the pinto. I mean, do you think that do you think that given the fact that you know  Evies are starting to really take I mean like electric cars and plug-in and everything else is really taking off in the US  Do you think hydrogen has any chance at all?

Start time: 7149.14
End time: 7201.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's hard to say  The the big thing about hydrogen and the nice thing about this is that any development that goes into EVs making more efficient motors  Making more efficient batteries that also helps the hydrogen market as well because these are effectively just EVs  But instead of having a big battery pack, we have a small battery pack plus a hydrogen tank and a fuel cell  So those those two developments can go very much in parallel  Ultimately, I don't think you're going to get to a point where you can have really fast charging and have those stations everywhere  Even through all of the very rural areas of the US for you know decades and decades to come  Hydrogen is in theory a much easier solution in that regard that you can make a hydrogen powered car  You can in theory make a hydrogen powered car that you can plug in if you wanted to and charge it for short range  Then top up the tank you want to go for large range  And again, it would be a relatively trivial thing to convert a gas station into a hydrogen station if you wanted to  This is the question. So I'm making the investment to do so  So, you know, it could be a stop-gap measure, but I do think it has has an opportunity

Transcript:  And I think in the grander scheme of things when we think about the environment and everything else  I think what we really need is ever all the cars to move to electricity because then as we change the central way of generating  Electricity, you know to a more, you know an environment friendly  We don't have to keep on changing all the little things  You know the big the big thing that keeps us stuck with burning gas is all those stupid gas stations  And so the thing is is that if we you know, if you move to something that's centralized then it's just easier to  This is an electric car. It's just that you it is except that we still have to have little like we're filling it up with

Start time: 7270.92
End time: 7330.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean of means of creating electricity or no effectively one kilogram of hydrogen is very similar to one gallon of gasoline  Actually, so they're actually very very close. It's not super costly energy-wise  I mean that is a somewhat difficult thing to do depends on what you're starting with if you're talking about pure  Electricity and then and purely water I don't know what are the exact efficiencies, but it's pretty low  But then again, you know if we get to a point where indeed we do have free or cheapy electricity  Then it doesn't really matter at that point  You can make them at hydrogen as you want to and you could even in theory do that at home if you want to  You know, it's not that difficult to make hydrogen from solar power and from from water  So, you know again, I see this is something that can very much go along in parallel having hydrogen development going on doesn't really detract from  Having EV development going on and they mean that we have extra stations going on  But I'll tell you there's no way that pure battery EVs are gonna make sense in upstate New York within the next  Exactly certainly not the cold weather  Enough charges, but I just don't know enough state need to drive a long way, but I just don't know

I'll admit but yeah, it felt very much like any other Honda from the inside  You really wouldn't know the difference if you didn't look in the trunk and then the trunk is so much compromised  Which is a bit of a shame, but that's that's really the only drive by that I saw well  They're going they're putting them on sale next year

It is now passed  That doesn't actually protect your cybersecurity. Yeah, and really  And really, you know makes it hard for you to stay private  It's it's gonna go to the I guess they have to reconcile the house and the Senate bills and then it goes to the president  Who's already said he will pass it the privacy flaws have not been fixed. I think more than one, you know  company in Silicon Valley  secretly in public while in public said oh this CISA bills a terrible bill secretly in the  Privates that it can you pass that bill because which is alert alleged Facebook's did  Because it let the companies off the hook. They are no longer reliable  For giving government information about us. We can't sue them. We can't do anything about it  It just lets them off the hook and I think that's you know, if I'm a if I'm the guy running Google or Facebook or Microsoft  Or Apple I would say hey, that's good. I like that. I I don't want to be sued  So I suspect there was kind of secret support for this in Silicon Valley well it remains to be seen if we're any less  Protected than we were I feel like at this point

Transcript:  Right. There's been a lot of discussion about this  Of course with all the various hacks that have come out over the past six months or so  And that problem is only going to get worse of course going forward  So there's been a pretty strong case made that ultimately these systems would be more secure people were able to see better into the  Systems and ultimately, you know, I think there's a lot of pros and cons to that argument  Definitely the automotive industry is definitely taking the the stance that a lot of operating system makers and others have taken in the past  That ultimately everything should be locked down because things will be more secure that way  I think we've seen a lot of steps forward in the mobile industry and elsewhere as things get more open things do get more secure  And I think that there is an opportunity for that in the automotive side  It's gonna take a long time to get you know  The traditional automakers on that front but this at least does give people a back door to be able to go in  Now look for these exploits and you know, hopefully do good things with them report them through the correct channels and make sure they get fixed  but if anything  It'll definitely help to keep everybody on their toes and and you know  It'll make me feel a bit better about this.

Yeah, if this will had been changed  So, you know making these things legal giving, you know, ultimately whether or not these are legal is not going to stop the people  Want to do bad things?  I think that's the most important thing if this is illegal if you're trying to hack into someone's car to do something  You're already breaking the law doesn't matter  But if it is against the law for a researcher to look for problems  Then that will stop some white hat hackers from doing the right thing and ultimately I think that that would have been a problem
