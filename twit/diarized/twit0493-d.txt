Start time: 502.98
End time: 541.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  you could run out the entire quarter and I guess this is a speed run because  yeah Jackson touchdown there you go Bo knows football and baseball oh boy so I  you know I know I figure out a way to distract so that Ben could continue to  watch the game I'm just gonna ask Ian about hey what about that David Cameron  huh I'm sorry I am so sorry British Prime Minister David Cameron which  actually should get the video of this he's speaking at something called shame  the future but now he's he's there's an election coming up yeah there's an

Start time: 541.40
End time: 559.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 568.46
End time: 586.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  UKP UKIP will only take supporters really from conservatives because they're  kind of like the rabid wing of the conservative party whose attitude  towards foreigners is standing at the English Channel and shouting just leave  the wine and cheese and bugger off so I hypothesized that maybe he's feeling

Start time: 586.62
End time: 592.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  some heat from UKIP and has to take and has to kind of be strong yeah he's this

Start time: 592.38
End time: 606.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is very much I mean he's seen as a very sort of limp character if you like and  he needs to try and sort of beef up the the toughness of the conservative party  to try and hold off UKIP on this he's barking completely up the wrong tree so

Start time: 607.78
End time: 636.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  he he said that he believed that it would be a critical for a law enforcement  and this is in in the wake of the terrorist attacks at Paris that there  that there be no communications that law enforcement can't read yes in other  words no crypto or crypto must always have a back door for law enforcement and  he said there's nothing to fear here because the Home Secretary will have to  sign a warrant yes so which why what's all the worry about this well that's part

Start time: 636.12
End time: 699.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of the problem the Home Secretary is the truth is Theresa May who is let's just  say she's technology challenged would be a nice way to put it and when it comes  to human rights she's was famously criticized by her predecessor in the  position as being as making remarks that were described as childlike and  incompetent and when he was forced to apologize she was conservative and the  fellow conservative he said I regret the language that I used and does that mean  you regret the words the language the language I used it was and yet he was  careful not to call for a new law well I think to be honest he's calling for this  but he must know deep down and I see that this isn't gonna work the security  services would love something like this he would introduce a new law in the next  session of Parliament is what he's saying to ban encrypted applications  whether or not you get it through and whether or not you might see sense  before then remains to be seen but it's electioneering so there's a certain  flexibility and what you say you will do and what you'll actually do  because it's it's really just at this stage gunning trying to garner as many

Start time: 699.44
End time: 713.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  votes as possible it does seem to me and I got a lot of emails from our UK  viewers showing real concern it but it does seem to me that almost impossible  to enforce a law yes that prevents encryption well this is it I mean Apple

Start time: 713.60
End time: 732.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and Google and Microsoft are going up against their own government about this  so if they honestly believe that their former colonial masters are going to be  able to say actually you're gonna have to do what we want you to do not gonna  happen so it's one of those things that sounds like a great policy idea but in  terms of actually getting into working practice just it really isn't gonna work

Start time: 732.76
End time: 746.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  we're gonna have to keep talking about this because they're now going into  overtime  playing I didn't even have to know that I didn't even have to know the score to

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  see to know that because I saw Ben go I mean the thing is with the the all the  dead space yes I fully admit it's a problem in most games but you get in a  game like this where it's you know it's just unbelievably tense I mean it's like  exciting it's in with with baseball I mean I personally am not a huge baseball  fan but when you get to the postseason it's just like every pitch is so much

Start time: 770.42
End time: 782.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 795.72
End time: 840.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  it's like what is there it's like what is there to say we it's crazy it's well  the only thing I would say is just like a weird and I've read about this  previously is I think like there's some aspect of we intact you know like it's  clearly these people have no idea how how this works I mean because you can't  you know it's so obvious to us that if you put in a backdoor for law enforcement  you're by definition putting in a backdoor for everyone else in the world  and that clearly at least it seems to be clearly doesn't resonate or doesn't make  sense to people and I mean at some point part of it has to be beyond just like  going nuts about this stuff actually trying to help people understand like

Start time: 840.76
End time: 867.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  how all this stuff works Cory Doctorow wrote on boing-boing what David Cameron  just proposed would endanger every Britain and destroy the IT industry he  says if they understood the technology they'd be shocked to their boots that  this and he gives actually a list of why this is a terrible idea he says Cameron  is proposing first all Britain's communications must be easy for  criminals voyeurs and foreign spies to intercept yeah put a back door in well

Start time: 867.66
End time: 878.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean particularly if you put a back door in and you tell people you putting  a back door in it it's gonna be like the sort of the Manhattan Project to find  this back door exploit it and you know the whole thing's toast it's a

Start time: 878.60
End time: 964.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  ridiculous process it's worse than that too because if you think about the  incentives and what the addressable market is to use like business terms  like for the government they are trying to prevent something from not happening  which is already kind of problematic from an incentive perspective and a  challenge perspective and two they're looking for the proverbial needle in the  haystack if you're a criminal just looking to skim off credit card details  or whatever or personal information wherever it might be and like the world  is your oyster now you can attack everyone and not only that but there's a  very high incentive from a monetary perspective to do so so like almost by  definition there's gonna be way more break-ins and successful ones by their  criteria by it but not at all like terrorist bad guys just run-of-the-mill  bad guys or voyeurs there is people who want to snoop no totally and and so like  just from a pure kind of incentive in like theory perspective it's clearly  going to fall very heavily on on the vast group of people that aren't even  involved and we haven't talked about the most obvious thing which is like how  many people have died of terrorism in the last 10 15 years and how many people  have died from car accidents or alcohol or all this sort of stuff it's just it's  a total lack of perspective that is a a gets gets back to kind of more more  more fundamental questions about like society and like what what motivates  people and and like what's what's the incentive here and who's really

Start time: 964.84
End time: 975.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  benefiting we should we should point out that the the ministers and parliament  have encryption that it has no backdoor oh yes there's no issue no no no I mean

Start time: 975.80
End time: 986.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  them yes if you look through the numbers people who are actually using PGP and  standard encryption techniques they're all using them that's fine but you know  if it goes to the general populace and things could get rather than you have to

Start time: 986.16
End time: 1001.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  go to Apple and say messages has to either have a backdoor you have to leave  your iPhone at the border exactly you're gonna have to go to Microsoft to say  BitLocker has to have a backdoor or no windows sales in the UK it's just it's  unenforceable and clearly Cameron must know that what scares me a little bit is

Start time: 1001.46
End time: 1028.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that thing is I've got a worrying feeling that he doesn't I got that's  really I get that's worse he came up with this idea and thought right okay  that'll show I'm tough on on cyber crime as he likes to call it but I mean the  fact is if GCH Q which is our from the NSA wants to get your encryption keys  they could do it either by physically breaking into your house and it's you  know and give me your private keys do by hacking your system so there's no real  need for this yeah but I mean GCH Q are pretty damn good at this. Here's what

Start time: 1029.04
End time: 1068.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  scares me because he is in the United States Cameron is in the United States  meeting with Obama and he and the president had a press conference two  days ago in which it sounded like Obama was sympathetic. Yeah I read that and I  was just like wow that's he said we're still gonna have to find ways to make  sure that if an al-qaeda affiliate is operating in Great Britain or the US  that we could try to prevent real tragedies I think the companies he's  talking about the technology companies want to see that as well their patriots  they have families they want to see protected. He does mention that there are  technical issues. Does he say think of the children? He practically says think of the children think of the women and children.

Transcript:  I was gonna say we were fighting this battle decades ago with the  initial crypto battles and we thought we'd won it but they keep on coming back  with this and it's just designing good crypto is hard enough designing good  crypto with a back door that no one else can exploit just forget about it it's

Start time: 1117.28
End time: 1173.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  intends for such a thing to happen? I think yes and no I mean on one hand you  do definitely have the both the president and the prime minister  basically probably having a certain amount of pressure from security  agencies and from you know national security basically saying hey you know  if you put your voice behind it this would mean a lot more you know it's a  more wait maybe the public is more receptive than the big mean you know  overarching security agencies being like we really need this. But the fact of the  matter is I really the the lack of understanding is that which Ben  mentioned is the real danger here where I just I really don't think of the  majority of people on the Hill in in DC and not in Britain or Europe either  really have any good idea of just how how ridiculous trying to put a back door  is into a high cryptic system it's just it it's baffling to me and like I just

Start time: 1174.58
End time: 1191.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it just doesn't work. What's fascinating is at the same time in the Guardian had  this story there was five years ago a secret report on cybersecurity from the  United States I think it was the DOD in which it said that strong encryption is

Start time: 1215.58
End time: 1322.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  impact there I mean for one I mean these companies are all serving people all  the world and there's obviously an implicit you know valuing of some  country's lives over others and as someone who lives abroad and is married  to someone who is not a US national that certainly is frustrating to hear although  it's obviously common sentiment. The other thing though is if they're talking  about even if they are protecting about protecting citizens this is making as  Cory Doctorow wrote in the piece you noted this is making citizens less safe.  I mean not to get if we're gonna get all cold and analytical about this if  you take the kind of expected value of a terrorist attack like the minute  percentage that's gonna happen and the chance that you or someone any of your  loved ones are going to die in that terrorist attack and compare that to the  expected loss per person of having bad encryption or these quote-unquote back  doors then the reality is is you're actually you are you are you are hurting  people and so you ask is this politics or is this a knowledge I mean I think it  it's probably both I suspect like Serenity said it's not really  understanding how this works and that you're asking for a  unicorn here but it also is is that and this is endemic in our politics is that  terrorist attacks are scary standing up against them is brave and it's easy it's  easy in that it doesn't really require meaningful sacrifices from a political  perspective even if it is hurting us in all these other ways and that you know  it's it's it's all it's all it's all very frustrating and it's frustrating in a

Yeah it's the same idea of calling for  like yes we need to be safe from all attacks okay what are you or or we need  to bring down the national debt okay how and and the world is putting it back  door yeah you know that doesn't actually work we'll do it it's fine well let me

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  terrorists are always going to be able to communicate they can't stop that not  really no without banning telephone mail and and access to the internet right I  mean the fundamental problem is that mass surveillance brings you such a  deluge of information the chances of picking an actual terrorist conversation

Start time: 1429.48
End time: 1463.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  out of that but I'll give you an example and maybe this is a spurious example but  after the attacks at Charlie Hebdo one of the things that we heard was ah the NSA  is now going to go back through this massive pool of information and try to  make connections because now we have the end point and backtrack from the end  point to prior communications which they would not have had they not been  collecting this information all along but that's perhaps figure out who planned  this attack who are co-conspirators where other attacks may be coming from  isn't that valuable information that comes from the mass collection of data

This is a positive I think for the for the US is the fact that we're even having this conversation I was actually gonna say something similar you know along these lines is you know the  relative freedom we have on the net or anywhere else is light years ahead of a  place like China where where everything is tracked everything is is looked into  there's a you know I think the other issue is because these companies are  based in the US because our technology industry is so strong that's where the  pressure can be applied I mean the if there are services that don't come it's  very it's a very it's a very questionable if there are services that don't comply  China China can just ban them they certainly you know they've obviously  banned Google they've banned Twitter they've been Facebook they've banned  other messaging services like wine for example and then when it comes to ones  that do work there like say WeChat it's kind of assumed among everyone that  lives there that the government is tracking everything on there so I mean  relatively speaking if you compare somewhere like China our freedoms are  still far ahead and the government is being far more egregious in violating you  know whatever privacy you may or may not have so in that I mean I guess

Start time: 1832.20
End time: 1955.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  is the patriotism is a very challenging one because the reality is is that the  these revelations particularly snow revelations have have hurt US tech  companies full stop and we're only just now seeing that hurt manifest itself  because the lots of countries including countries like Brazil bar particular  countries like China undertook significant efforts to extricate  themselves from dependence on US tech companies in order to to avoid this I  think one company in particular that's been hurt or will be to be hurt is is  gonna be like Cisco for example which you don't really think about but China is  well underway and has been really been accelerated by the stone revelations to  to devort to building having their entire infrastructure be completely  homegrown and and that's that's literally dollars and cents that are not  flowing into the US they're not flowing the US economy and that's just one  example of many where this says this has hurt the US and has hurt US tech  companies so it's a little rich for the US to be the reality is is it is US tech  companies that have borne the greatest cost of the snow revelations to date  and it's and it's a little rich at that kind of they're going back to the well  as it were and so I again you the whole patriotic question is certainly a  little fraught you cannot make you know I know people make the argument that  these US companies were established and thrive because of you know being in the  US and the in the environment there and all that sort of thing at the same time  you know their customers in many cases a majority of their customers are not are  not in the US and there's a lot of tension here it's I don't think it's any  company's charter to further a particular country and so there's a lot  of tension there for for companies as well can we can we then safely conclude

Transcript:  different in here well for one thing they've greatly improved in terms of  the motion sickness and the field of vision is much better resolution higher  because it was 720 I think I believe the resolution is slightly higher or at  least I mean to my eyes it felt like a full full-frame HD but I'm not I'm not  I I'm not personally qualified to be able to be like yes it was this many  pixels but it does it's it's very immersive and one of the great things  about about this prototype is that they've added in stereo sound so they  have like headphones on yeah a little tiny half speakers you just put on when  you put on the headset and it really does it absolutely immerses you I mean  you talk about you know people filmmaking 101 the sound good sound  design and good sound experience is the thing that makes or breaks you getting  sucked into a movie with the oculus having a stereo sound experience both of  the sound effects and the music that they chose for each segment completely  immersive absolutely this is as saying before the show there's a there's one  segment in the six and a half minute crescent Bay demo where you're standing  on top of a building of an 80 story building and you can hear the city like  you can hear all the words you look up and you can hear a air balloon like a  Zeppelin passing over by you hear the traffic the city noise the rain like  it's it's incredible what they've been able to do it really is I think sounds  interesting it is it's an extra step on to the VR experience that I wasn't  really expecting and especially this was my first time being able to play with an  oculus prototype and I know you know they've been at CES the past couple of  years but I had been taking a quick like CES break and so when I when I saw  that they were at the show this year I kind of jumped at the chance to try it  but sound adds such a such an interesting additional experience to  virtual reality because again like there's only so much that your eyes can  trick you into believing like I can stand on the edge of a virtual building  but without the sound I still hear like the humming of my you know say my air  conditioner or something right in my in my room you add speakers you add  headphones and not only is it you know not only do you have background sound  but you have immersive sound and I think it's the difference between you know a  stereo sound system that you get in a theater and something that's actually  being piped directly to your ears that's encasing you almost fully in this world

Transcript:  question right the thing that I think is really important for for a bigger  company sort of putting in development resources into oculus Facebook had me a  little bit worried just because Facebook you know I mean it says it's not exactly  your first choice if you're saying oh a VR game development company perfect  perfect yeah and then also with all of Facebook's you know myriad  concerns but um but I actually it makes sense from me from a wider perspective  if you take away if you take away oculus just being for video games and movies  right and you consider it more of a world-reaching help like general  day-to-day help tool you think about you know there have been tons of books  written about this over throughout the years but I think about ready player one  and I think about the idea of you know people being able to have virtual  classrooms who can't necessarily get to college and actually being able to  interact with students you think about retirees who maybe have some kind of  disability that prevents them from getting outside the house and being able  to put on a headset and interact with someone who may live you know down the  street or a hundred miles away in the same sort of recreational center being  able to talk to a therapist or something like that without having to you know to  leave your house I mean yes in some respects this this sounds maybe very  antisocial but for people who legitimately can't leave the house for  one reason or another people with disabilities yeah autism like any anyone with that I'm

Transcript:  really I think fundamental question here I think I mean first off no I haven't  used oculus I don't think this would when you hear what I said I don't think  they would change what I have to say but I'll have that out there from a gaming  perspective or from an experience perspective or from some of the great  examples that that's trying to just listed things like you know going to a  classroom or going on a trip I think that for sure it's the future it's very  compelling but all those are destination sort of activities you know they may be  more immersive they may be more there but they're still you are deciding to  put in the very action of wearing one of these you have to go get it and you have  to put it on and then you go have an experience and I think that there  certainly is room for this and we see that right now we see amazing video game  systems we do see you know traveling through things through the internet  obviously a lot of it sucks now because it's not fully immersive and it will be  way better when virtually comes along so from that perspective I think it's  interesting where I question Facebook in particular is when when they bought it  Mark Zuckerberg said I'm quoting here strategically we want to start building  the next major computing platform they'll come after mobile there are not  many things that are cancer the next major computer platform this is a long  term bet on the future of computing and that's where I'm a little more skeptical  and the reason I'm skeptical comes back to kind of just a a fundamental  philosophy I have about computers and about computing and that is I don't  think that I don't think that for most people computers are a destination  computers are a means to better live their life to accomplish the things they  want to accomplish to talk to the people they want to talk to to waste time they  want to waste whatever it might be I think most people view computers as a  tool to steal Steve Jobs words as a bicycle for their mind but the point the  point is still the mind the point is still what you're doing and so I think  Oculus is interesting and will and absolutely has a future but I see that  future as being more of a a additive destination type future as opposed to  the controlling feature in our day-to-day lives which mobile very much

Transcript:  read strategic every week the trend is to be more more personal like is to be  more in like and yes when you went from a mainframe went to a PC what was  compelling about that was that it was excess yours to more people yeah and  then from a desktop to a laptop it was not just accessible people but it was  accessible in more places right mobile and now and now well that's what's that's  what is so meaningful right about mobile it's not just you say like mobile first  Facebook is the best example we're gonna be mobile first and they've done a  fantastic job of actually executing and doing that right but mobile first is not  just about apps it's not just about services it's about it's about how every  single aspect of a person's life and every single business in the world is  changed by the fact that people have a computer with them all the time like and  so you see everything from the way small businesses will market themselves or the  way that they'll that they'll do services or the way that they'll reach  customers or do orders you go to a place like China you pull out your mobile  phone and you can go on like on WeChat the chat map application you could  literally just order food from the dumping place down the street you can  order tickets like all this stuff that people are announcing here in the US  like their way ahead there and part of it is because for so many people this  smartphone was their very first computer and but but but what's what's  what's key about this and what makes the mobile so compelling is that the  smartphone goes with you into your actual life right like and yes there's  an aspect of on the subway I'm looking at my smartphone am I really present  but but the fact of the matter is we we're becoming more engaged with the

That's actually my pitch for the Apple watch is the idea and connected  technology in general part you know wearable computing the idea that not only  do you have computers that you can put in your pocket but contextual computers  computers that are smart enough to know what you want to do when you want to do  it or sometimes even before you want to do it where you're you know Google now  is a little bit of a creepy version of this and of course there's there's that  line to walk right because a computer doesn't want to be you don't want your  your service to be so intelligent and so predictive that it makes you feel  unsettled about using it but at the same time having something that's keenly  aware of what you like to do and you know what you're interested in and  presenting you with the correct options and something that you can  communicate with constantly you know my ideal my ideal future computer is  something that's so like a combination of something like a like a mobile tablet  or a watch and and a connect where you know you have you have an ability not  even minority report style but something where you've you've got the ability to  create whatever you want wherever you are I'm sitting on a subway I can you  know pull up a pull up a screen or tablet and instantly start sketching  whether or not I actually have a physical implementation in my hands you  know that would that would be really really cool the idea that you can just  pull things from wherever wherever they're stored in your life now let's  you know that may be super future talking but we do have a very a variety  that already existing in our current technology you know on my on my phone I  can pull up almost every book I've ever bought digitally which is most of the  books that I have physically in this room as well you know I can pull up my  social life I can doodle I can sketch I can pull up files from my computer I can  pull up my computer screen I can share with my media server you know we have  all these connections it's just a matter of building the right the right tools  that can actually help us interact day-to-day and I agree with you but I  don't think oculus in its current form is something where it's you know snow  crash like where we're gonna be constantly using it all the time

Transcript:  in as we walk around I know if you think about you think about the internet of  things and what's compelling about that it actually fits with this personal  thesis I mean what happened with with gadgets for lack of a better word is  they all got subsumed into the smartphone right there's a picture that's  been floating around for ages of like all the stuff that is now in our  smartphone right one fan that's been the process of the last six seven years is  going away but you think back where those gadgets come from those gadgets  were all like video recorders mp3 players like all these things were meant  to plug into a PC because the problem with the PC is a PC ultimately wasn't  mobile not even a laptop isn't mobile at the end of the day you have to sit down  you've put on a desk you've turned on and use it and what a thing like an mp3  player did was it took a specific function of the PC in this case listening  to music and it made that specific function mobile or a video recorder took  a recording function made it mobile you could bring it back to the PC you could  plug it in and you could you could do stuff with it what's what's been  compelling about the smartphone is it it took all that stuff and it also made the  computer mobile so that was all in one you didn't need to there was no point in  having something separate and plugging it in and this by the way is why I think  a no port MacBook Air makes a ton of sense like it's all it's all on your  phone anyway but if you go if you think about the I don't know why my printers  going crazy but if you think about the Internet of things why I actually think  gadgets are getting more interesting now it's not because it's because well  previously gadgets made a immobile PC mobile now you can assume that everyone  has a mobile computer with them all the time and now what's interesting is all  the objects that can't move can become smart in a meaningful way so your garage  door can become smart your door your lock in your door can become smart your  car can become smart and it becomes smart not independently I think in the  long run it becomes smart because it becomes smart when a smartphone gets

Transcript:  the US or the rest of the world rest of the world yes not the US and probably  not Western Europe at least for a while huh and yeah well they're kind of they're  kind of core thing to date has been to offer very well-specced phones that are  that are nice for a price that's half the cost of a top-of-the-line Samsung or  iPhone they do TVs too they do tablets right well that's I mean that's what's  interesting is it's kind of been a question is is how is how is this  company going to make money and you know the whole thing is all they're gonna be  playing on services but the problem is that doesn't really add up because when  it comes to services in China the all the money is being made by by ten cent  with their WeChat application so made by by do who dominates search there and  there's really not a lot of money left over to be made in services the way we  traditionally think about them and so that kind of leaves the money the Xiaomi  just raised which just raised another round at the end of last year value that  46 billion dollars 1 billion larger than uber to take the title and and the  question is like well where where is this valuation coming from how are they  going to make money and that's what makes the company so so interesting I  actually think there is a like any startups not guaranteed but I think there  is a very compelling opportunity here and it actually gets back to what we're  just talking about which is which is the Internet of Things and what happens if  you start a company with the assumption that the smartphone is the center of  everything and what Xiaomi is doing and it's it's an interesting that you know  about and you mentioned things like the TV or they sell things like an air  purifier or they say like routers and at their last announcement on Thursday  which I was in Beijing to attend they opened it up by talking about their  partnership with media which makes air conditioners and things like that

Transcript:  raised air conditioner and everybody certainly is an air purifier it's an air  purifier it's a very it's big business yeah yeah but what's happening here is  the way I wrote about this couple weeks ago is it's it's incomplete to think of  Xiaomi as a smartphone company right they're much more of a of a lifestyle  company and their last company for a specific set of customers there is  customers that are can't afford an iPhone care about things like specs and  features and stuff like that and tend to be young and about to move into their own  places about to buy their first homes interesting so this is really their first  computer right what's the first computer it's the center of their existence and  and and Xiaomi has has to a very impressive extent in a way that few  other companies in technology broadly much less in China have have built a  very strong brand in a meaningful brand a brand that people like ascribe to and  are proud to be associated with it's very Apple like in that in that way now  you have this these people that are moving out there gonna start buying  things and what kind of things are gonna buy they're gonna buy the Xiaomi air  purifier they're gonna buy the Xiaomi TV they're gonna buy the Xiaomi air  conditioner in a lot of these will show me not gonna make even the majority of  these that they're gonna be wet labeled or they sort of partnerships but you  think about this what's happening now they have all this stuff and they're all  smart they're all tied together but via software through Xiaomi software where  the MIUI what you actually have here is an Android maker that's actually  building meaningful stickiness in a meaningful moat around their products  because they have actual physical products that are tied together by  software in and now it actually is different to own a Xiaomi phone than is  to own something else and and it's it's very and so you think about it's really  almost the first Internet of Things company they're selling you the whole  house they're selling you the whole lifestyle they have home automation too  no exactly and and so it's the sort of company that that can only make sense if  it was born with the assumption that the phone is at the center and that's  the advantage of being a startup it just started four four and a half years ago  right and and now you have this week they had a new announcement that the  MeNote Pro or the MeNote MeNote Pro an unfortunate name to be sure that we  talk about that in a moment but it's a it's a excellent phone it is not a  copycat of anyone it the build quality is a significant step up from the me for  which was already you know it was it was good I like to be for and battery life

Transcript:  looks different and there's lots of skins you can apply to this is something  that's very popular in in Asia of deaf broadly is to do this sort of  customization so it's a little complicated with within China it's a  OSP Android and it has all their own services as by do services I think it  has Xiaomi Xiaomi app store no Google services well you can download the  Google Play Store I mean like it just doesn't but no they don't come  pre-installed right and so outside China like in India where they're making a  really big push right now they they greatly exceeded their expectations  anyway at least according to Hugo Barra in the last four months of the year last  year there they outside China they do run Google Google's version of Android  with I mean you can do quite a bit of customization and still stay in bounds  you see that with with with Synergy mod and you'll see that oh yeah Xiaomi's  external version absolutely but the but it's okay there and I think this is  really hard for people to understand because people people are so stuck on the  Android versus iOS battle that's kind of self-contained within the smartphone and  where Xiaomi's differentiation isn't the smartphone it's the ecosystem of stuff  that is tied together by the smartphone do they sell music do they have a music  store they do they have a music store they have a video store they have all  that all those are asserts so they are looking to make money from those types  of services but I think they're you have to look at them with a different from a  different frame of reference to kind of understand what they're doing what

Well there's a there's a couple reasons one just from a from a  business perspective the US market everyone has appliances everyone has  their homes right and it's not that big of a market if China and India combined  which are their two main markets right now are 12 times the size of the US

Transcript:  what in one size and two it's people that are buying this stuff now they're  buying appliances and there's people that are getting their first computers  and it's already very mobile first in a way that the US isn't the US has much  more of a PC hangover as it were and and if you if you go from no computer to a  smartphone you're gonna buy into that mobile lifestyle in a much more  substantial way than if you're going from a PC that you've used for many years  to a smartphone which is more mobile and better but you still have a lot of old  habits and ways of doing things that's number one number two is IP they have an  IP problem that for some of its legitimate some it's not legitimate

Transcript:  Well that I mean that's the I tend to fall on this side of things when it  comes to Xiaomi and it was like Apple Apple Apple PR is an excellent job of  framing Xiaomi I think in the tech readers conscious yeah I think people in  media are probably familiar with that the on one hand I'm uncomfortable with  with technology patents in general and the reason is because the whole a  patent is a is inherently a bad thing it is a government granted monopoly right  and monopolies aren't aren't great there's a reason why patents exist is  because they're meant to spur innovation to to make it worthwhile to invent to do  things in technology no one needs a spur like there's so many gains from being  first to being you know to making the market that I feel pretty confident that  if there were no patents there would be no very good slowdown in innovation and  if you've questioned the fundamental premise then it's like well yeah you're  right why should why should shall we be living in this perspective so I do have  a problem from the we have to pay license fees perspective from a copying  perspective that's something that Xiaomi quite frankly needs to do better at it  I think it's a cultural thing in some respects the idea of copying isn't  nearly as frowned upon or even thought to be a bad thing in China and a lot of  this is very much a cultural thing and you look back through history and the  way art was valued copying is is it's not it's not considered a bad a morally bad  thing like it kind of is in the West and as long as I'm on my soapbox and  monologuing the fact of matter is when the US came to power we stole a whole  lot of IP from England and lots of other places that and it's a little it's a  little hypocritical for us to be on our high horse now it's understandable but

Transcript:  interesting I it's a little I think it's a little more complicated that I think  that Apple and has been active pushing the line that Xiaomi that  Xiaomi rips off Apple and I mean Johnny I have said something very explicit that  regard and how he was outraged and offended and and I think I agree that  particularly with the most recent generation the Mi 4 Xiaomi took way too  many design cues from Apple and that said from a from a business model  perspective they're already very different from a software perspective  they're very different to actually use a device is completely foreign compared  to an iPhone but I think it's justifiable and I think that it's a  problem for Xiaomi from a hardware perspective that said I think Xiaomi is  aware of this and this new product again the names unfortunate they've had a note  for a while for what it's worth almost all big phones in China by all the  no-name manufacturers are all called notes like that's kind of the name for  fablet now but I mean we all know where that came from and it's just it's a  stupid move to be perfectly frank but that said the hardware is totally unique  it's it's it's glass on both sides and when I say glass both sides of me it's  like an iPhone 5 it's it's it's curved it's it's it's it feels unlike other  phones that I felt and that's a that's the price for them so this is what's  really interesting the regular note is 270 I think which which that said I think  is still more expensive than any Xiaomi phone has been they also did a top-of-the-line  one but they don't expect to sell many but it's basically the best of the best  it's got the Snapdragon 810 it's got four gigabytes LDD DRAM or something like  that which is like brand new to market it's super expensive but that's selling  for over $500 which is still half what Apple would charge yeah it's it's  interesting it's both really cheap and really expensive it's really cheap  compared to other manufacturers it's really expensive market to Xiaomi yeah
