Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  episodes and I thought I can do without this. It's a good show. Keep watching. All right I'll give it a second chance.  All right. So you know more serious note of course. Yesterday a plane crash in in San Francisco 1130 by 1135.  Twitter was alive and I'm watching CNN at the same time. I was doing the radio show. Nothing for 20 minutes. But boy anything you wanted to know you could find out.  In fact even a picture on path by a Samsung executive. That's the picture David Un posted on his path. And then it was really fun to watch mainstream media say that he tweeted it on path.  They just didn't understand what path was. It didn't end up on Twitter of course. It passed on. There's the tweet. I just crash landed at SFO. Tail ripped off.  Most everyone seems fine. I'm okay. Surreal. We did learn of course that two young Chinese girls were killed in that crash. Tragic crash. But amazing.  306 people did get off the plane. Some with serious injuries but they survived.

Start time: 343.88
End time: 364.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People should know that David Un is actually a huge honcho. He's like one of the top guys at Samsung. And he's been sent to America to reinvigorate the company.  What a way to arrive. I actually thought of him when I found out that it was coming from Korea. I thought I wonder if David Un is on there because he's constantly this guy's like back and forth all the time.

Transcript:  And then the weirdest thing was Sheryl Sandberg posts on Facebook. She's the COO at Facebook. I and my family were going to be on that flight and I needed the miles or I wanted to use miles so we went United instead.  She's got a lot of money. I don't know why. I'm glad she's cheap. I thought that was odd. But anyway, good. So she wasn't on the flight.

Transcript:  I was actually scheduled to be at an event at the World Trade Center on 9-11. It was an HP event and at the last minute they cancelled it and decided to have it here on the campus. So it's like a lot of that kind of stuff going around.  But yeah, she was lucky. But she wrote a lot about it.

Start time: 404.12
End time: 420.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Also amazing that somebody would get off the plane, slide down the slide, walk 100 feet away and then turn around, take a picture and put it on path.  Yeah, I wouldn't have waited that long.  You know, it's great in his picture. There's another person taking a picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe that's the person who posted to Instagram with a filter. My plane just crashed. I'm going to post to Instagram. Which filter should I use?  With a filter.  Black and white maybe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just amazing.  Well, I'm glad that they are okay. I'm sorry about the deaths and certainly hope everybody gets better quickly.  There's nothing else to say about it except that it was an experience that we had on social media far more quickly than on mainstream.

Start time: 452.18
End time: 470.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I first saw a video, the first thing I saw was a video well before this picture hit and long before CNN or any of the other mainstream media got it.  It was a video taken from inside the terminal and some people were speaking, I think it was Mandarin or something like that, but you could see it off in the distance, smoking and on fire.  It's amazing.

Start time: 471.58
End time: 491.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There are people staying at the airport hotels that are across the water from the runways.  And you know, basically anybody who used to be an eyewitness is now an eyewitness with a camera phone.  And so all of a sudden immediately a friend of mine was actually staying right across there and he was tweeting within a minute with some pictures of the plane on the runway.  It's amazing.

Start time: 492.30
End time: 522.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It made me nervous. I'm on the air, I'm doing the radio show, so I'm actually talking to a fairly large audience.  I notice this is going on. I notice that none of the news channels are covering it.  And there's also this concern, it was pretty obviously happening, but there's this concern about rushing in to talk about stuff.  So here I am on mainstream media thinking, gosh, I don't know what to do at this point.  Should I repeat what I'm seeing on Twitter, on social media? Should I wait until CNN confirms it?

Start time: 523.52
End time: 567.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's one of those things where, yeah, you can do it spur of the moment, but at the same time, if you want to be a journalist about it, you also need to add some context to it.  I mean, look at any kind of news event within the past five, six years when people tweet and post images, often it's without any kind of context and people tend to draw conclusions without necessarily seeing the entire situation.  And the whole Trayvon thing, that's one of those things where people will just kind of post comments and stuff without necessarily being, oh, I'm a journalism student or I'm someone who comes from...

Start time: 568.24
End time: 580.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does this anointing by a journalism degree somehow make you more accurate, more likely to follow... are there rules that the unwashed masses don't know?

Start time: 582.23
End time: 624.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's kind of the tricky thing at this...  We're the original sources, right? We're the original materials.  Yeah, but at the same time, we're at this kind of this threshold where, yeah, technology has allowed a broad group of people to effectively be the eyes, ears, and voices for a bunch of people.  That's a broad range of differing viewpoints.  If you come into a situation with, oh, that's a really bad idea, that's something stupid, I'm going to tweet and take a photo saying, that guy's being a jerk and he's hitting on this woman or whatever.  And someone else says, well, that woman was jacket caught on fire and the guy's hitting on her to put it out.  You need to be able to...  There's facts and there's opinion.

Start time: 624.96
End time: 654.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's what the journalist should be doing.  There's always context to be explained in a situation like that.  The most immediate one is what do we know and what do we don't know.  For example, if one of the first things that Twitter formed a consensus around was the idea that the plane flipped around on its back, which didn't happen.  Which is wrong.  And so a good journalist who wants to participate in this enormous stream of information should jump in there and say, okay, well, here's what we actually know.  We know that somebody has posted this picture.  And yet...

Start time: 655.36
End time: 714.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm listening and watching...  It was very interesting for me as kind of a case study, the mainstream media, and they were very reluctant to say, for instance, how many deaths or injuries there were.  Unconfirmed, unconfirmed, unconfirmed.  And this is hours into it.  Whereas on Twitter, I'm seeing quotes from emergency radio, which turned out to be accurate.  And I feel like...  Probably the best way to do this is to give the people the facts and let them decide.  But give them the facts in context.  So what I ended up doing on the radio, and I actually said for our affiliates down the line who are taking this live, there's a big story coming across Twitter.  You should probably pay attention to this.  This is what people are saying right now on Twitter.  The context being this is from Twitter.  And I think that all of us need to learn, as we all consume social media directly, how to read this, vet it, know enough not to...  And I think as we use it, we start to realize them.  There have been plenty of cases where Twitter's just been wrong.

Start time: 716.20
End time: 743.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it makes all social media users having to build up the muscles that I think a lot of journalism students had to learn.  That's never going to happen.  We're all not just reporters of what we see.  We're also interpreters like a reporter of old used to be, about who is this person and do I trust them?  Are they a reliable eyewitness and are they retweeting something or were they actually there?  And there was a time when people just said, oh, regular people can't do that.  That's too much work for them.  Well, too bad. Here we are.

Start time: 743.38
End time: 784.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They can, but they never will.  Actually, the risks to media, the best example of the risks, are a case that happened like two years ago or a year ago, some time recently,  where there was a local news TV show in Chicago reporting on a plane crash that landed on, I don't know, one of the major streets in Chicago.  And they reported this emergency for 20 minutes before they were informed that it was a movie set.  Or a movie set.  Yeah, they were filming a plane crash.  And then they started blaming the fire department and other people, the movie people, because they should have informed the journalists.  And that was wrong.  That's the fear. That's why CNN takes 20 minutes, because they don't want to do that.

Start time: 785.10
End time: 787.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's more embarrassing to get it wrong than it is to be late.

Start time: 788.10
End time: 803.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think it goes even beyond embarrassing.  I mean, CNN, you have a certain amount of reputation at stake.  And if you leverage that and you're wrong, especially if you're a news outlet, that kind of shoots you in the foot as a business.  Long term.

Start time: 805.46
End time: 812.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then there's David Lazar, whose relationship was severed with CBS after tweeting incorrectly that Steve Jobs had died.

Start time: 812.46
End time: 821.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what they need to do is, the CNNs of the world need to figure out how to leverage very quickly the camera phones and the on-reporting and get those feeds coming in.

Start time: 821.54
End time: 847.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is what I saw very quickly. This is the PATH post of David On. This is the original post.  And I looked at that and I said, that's not a fake post.  This is a fake account on PATH, which kind of inherently makes it a little bit more reliable, because it's a small network. People don't make fake accounts on PATH.  The picture was clearly somebody who had just gotten off that plane. He was very close.  So this gives it a lot of weight when you see this.

Start time: 847.98
End time: 851.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And big props to David On for not saying, and this was taken with a Samsung Galaxy S4.

Start time: 854.61
End time: 858.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although, has anybody looked at the EXIF? Because it would be funny if it were an iPhone.  An iPhone, right.

Start time: 859.38
End time: 891.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's also the question of timeliness, right? We said CNN might want to harness this stuff and get it out there faster.  There is also, if you're a news organization, that question of what's the public value in getting that report out five minutes earlier?  For something like a Supreme Court decision, maybe there's a little bit more of it.  For something like this, to say a plane is down, it's on fire, we're trying to figure out more.  You know, if you're CNN, if you're the New York Times, if you're the San Francisco Chronicle, waiting five minutes to get the details instead of being wrong, it's probably okay.  Relaying what people are saying on social media isn't the same as endorsing and confirming it.

Start time: 891.70
End time: 907.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As long as you qualify and you give the source and you explain how it might not be the full story or it might be inaccurate, but this is what we're seeing right now.  The reporting really isn't of the event, it's of what's happening on Twitter and giving people that background information that might make it useful.

Start time: 908.06
End time: 918.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I think part of the problem is that news, especially broadcast news, is now more entertainment than information and as a business, that's what they leverage.

Start time: 918.94
End time: 950.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  CNN actually, to be fair, had a difficult choice. They were covering the Canadian train explosion at the time.  And that is, in some respects, a bigger story. I mean, the whole town blew up.  And so, I don't blame them for not jumping to this story.  On the other hand, I was on the radio in San Francisco at the time, so it is relevant to tell people who are in the area, don't drive down 101,  because that's being blocked off now by emergency vehicles. There's stuff going on. If you see that smoke, that's what is going on.

Start time: 950.46
End time: 979.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The thing that bugs me about CNN and the general coverage on TV news is that they devote the amount of time they have, not based on how much information they have,  but based on how big the story is. But if they have no information about a huge story, then they sit there and tap dance for half an hour.  They covered Zimmerman for a week.  They should go ahead and cover the Quebec story and then jump in every two minutes with, here's what we know now, here's what we know.  And they don't do that. They're trying to get rid of it.

Start time: 979.66
End time: 990.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I think the bottom line on this, and we'll move on, is that you should incorporate social media into your own.  I mean, this is how I learn about stuff now, frankly. And you just have to understand how to use it and how to develop that muscle.

Start time: 992.80
End time: 1020.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One more thing, though. What somebody was going to do one of these days is they're going to turn on Hangouts on Air on Google+,  and they'll instantly have a larger audience than CNN.  They'll have a larger audience than CNN immediately, ten times bigger than CNN.  So it's like, what do we need CNN for? Ultimately, if you have somebody standing next to the plane broadcasting live video.  Amazing.  Somebody just didn't think of doing that. We already have it in our... almost everybody on that plane was capable of doing that. Nobody thought of it.

Start time: 1021.84
End time: 1040.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why CNN has iReport, and they fired a lot of reporters so that they could build up their iReport capability.  But I think that's going to be a big shift in how we perceive news.  At that point, CNN's got to do what we've done, which is say, look, our job is not to bring you the stories fastest, but to bring you the analysis and the understanding of the story.

Start time: 1040.42
End time: 1054.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And some context. And somebody aggregating all these photos and clips and making something that makes more narrative sense for the person who's not tuned in in five minutes,  but is looking at this three hours later and wants the bigger picture. That's a place where you can add value.

Start time: 1055.46
End time: 1066.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I bet I did what most people do, which is I saw the feeds. I turned on CNN.  So it's a mutual thing. But you're right. If David's standing there with glass and Hangouts on Air live, that's what you're going to watch.

Start time: 1067.96
End time: 1085.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you're exactly right, though. I mean, even after all the time we spent on this, watching the story since it happened, I think most of us still don't know very much about what happened.  Right.  I mean, the list of facts that we actually know, the number of deaths, few injuries, tail fell off, a couple of other facts. I think that's the extent of what we know.

Start time: 1086.12
End time: 1106.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had a commercial pilot, a guy who flies jets in studio at the time. He was the one who told me about it.  Lucky.  And because I guess he got a feed or something. And he was very reluctant to say anything.  Sure.  As rightly so.  Right.  Because there's no information.  Right.  So it's all speculation. That's one thing that the news networks have no trouble doing.  It's just speculating.

Transcript:  All coming up in just a little bit on this week in tech. Mike Elgin, Jason Snell, Roger Chang. Glad we have you along.  Nice big studio audience. Thank you all for being here.  Our air conditioning has now failed. So if you want to strip down, please be my guests.  Our show today brought to you in a very timely fashion by proxpn.com.  You probably know that if you are in an open Wi-Fi access spot, if you're at a hotel, if you're on a shared internet connection, that everything you do can be seen by everybody else on that network.  It's not unusual in cases like that for people to try to use a VPN solution.  Proxpn is open VPN implemented right. We had Steve Gibson look at it. He gave it its thumbs up.  But it is so much more useful than just at an open Wi-Fi hot spot.  It's a great way to give you complete online privacy through a 512-bit encryption tunnel via open VPN.  If you're using a mobile device that doesn't support open VPN, a lot of them don't. PPP as well. You get to choose.  If your ISP is monitoring what you're up to, and I think they are, you can protect yourself against them.  The six strikes rule. You can keep your internet usage private at work. You can bypass internet filtering and blocked websites.  Bypass geographic restrictions for internet content.  Proxpn has servers all over the world. Los Angeles, Dallas, Seattle, London, Singapore, Amsterdam.  You can use it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android.  Keep your stuff private. Protect yourself, especially nowadays.  We now know that keeping yourself private can require a little extra effort. A little encryption.  There is a free version you can try out. But if you visit proxpn.com slash twit, we've got a special deal on the pro version.  Normally a pro account in Proxpn is either $9.95 a month or $75 for an entire year. $74.95 for an entire year.  But when you decide to buy at Proxpn, if you use our offer code twit20, you'll get 20% off not for the first month of the year, but for the lifetime of your account.  This is a good time to take advantage of this. That means less than $5 a month on the yearly plan for absolute security with the best solution.  OpenVPN running on Proxpn. Try it today. Proxpn.com slash twit. Use the offer code twit20.  You probably heard, this actually is a story as much as it is part of the ad, that the credit cards have started to refuse charges to pay for VPN accounts.  And we asked Proxpn about that. They said nobody has contacted us from MasterCard or Visa to this point.  But that is something. And I got to think that MasterCard or Visa are being prompted, I don't know whether it's by the recording industry or if it's by the NSA.  But I don't think it's in any way fair to say, oh yeah, anybody using VPN is up to no good.

Transcript:  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  Anyway, you can still use your credit card at Proxpn.com slash twit.  Very sad to see that Doug Engelbart passed away.  88 years old. He was the guy who created pretty much modern computing at SRI.  I remember having him on tech TV. Were you there, Roger? We had him in.  Potentially.  Yeah.  It's been a long time. There were a lot of shows.  It was a long time ago.  He brought the original mouse, which is made out of wood.  Remember that? A big red button on it.  Pine. It was pine with two metal wheels.  Amazing. He did what do they call it? The world's most amazing demo?  The mother of all demos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't believe what you're looking at when you see it even today.  We should probably watch a little bit of it.  It looks futuristic.  Because this was in 64?  It was 68 when he did the demo. He invented the mouse in 64, 65, something like that.  The other thing that I think he doesn't get enough credit for is he invented the concept of hypertext.  So every time you click on a link, click on a picture that links somewhere,  the whole world wide web is built on the concept of the hyperlink.  He came up with that concept. So that's a pretty foundational idea.

He was very friendly and grateful.  And I think at that point he'd come to terms with the fact that he was never going to...  His patents all expired and all of that.

They came out with phones in the past year but they were already in the pipeline.  So this will be the first real Google phone.  The Moto X. We don't know anything about it.  Mike and I have been invited to an event at Google this week.  Guy Kawasaki is now working for Motorola.  All I can say is I just got an email from them saying, here's what we're going to talk about.  And you can't tell anybody.  It's embargoed for a while.  I probably can't even say when the embargo ends.  You'll have to advise me on this.  I'm not a journalist.  I'm just some guy.  By the way, Google denied after these reports came out.

End time: 1896.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, he's really into changing lives.  But to me, the darkest horse, the long shot here,  is that they would build in mesh networking.  So you know this Project Loon thing with the balloons?  This is mesh networking where they relay, where each WiFi net node is also relaying it in both directions.  So imagine if a cell phone could be a WiFi hotspot or a connectivity option.  It's very unlikely.  Don't quote me on this.

Start time: 1925.72

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  Whatever the boundaries are of your connection and whatever that connection is, you extend those boundaries.  Maybe you're inside of a parking garage  and you're having trouble getting some kind of signal, it would extend that.  Effectively, you'd blanket everywhere with signal.

You've seen so many Nexus phones that are sold unlocked without subsidies.  Hasn't really taken off.  I'm wondering now that Google is rolling out, it seems like the Google products from Motorola and not what was in the pipeline.  Are they going to try to do some other end runs around carriers or are they going to play ball?

That's not what I'm saying.  Maybe T-Mobile would be more awesome if there were mesh networks everywhere you went in Petaluma.  It would be in their interest to do that.

You'll change your tune when a church is blown up or a building is blown up by terrorists.  I think the majority of Americans support the NSA spying.

If you don't jive with that particular set,  then you're the enemy and then we'll do anything to hurt you  even if it hurts our community.  We're at that point where you just turn on any news program  and you get a bunch of incredibly juvenile and sophomoric debates going on.  That's why I don't do it.  That's what people are trained to do.  Kids watching on TV also, that's how adults talk to each other.  They talk like five-year-olds.  You're an idiot. Your plan's stupid. It's going to kill the world.  It's one of those things where it's great for ratings,  but it's also great for the kids.

I'm thinking that down the road somebody's going to realize  that searching through all your files on your laptop  or reading your email is no different from breaking into your house  without a warrant and searching through your stuff,  which we would never allow and is clearly unconstitutional.  The problem is that the people who want to do that can get away with it now  because everybody else doesn't really understand what's going on  because they're not thinking of it.

What gave them the right to say that  the war on terror and making it more convenient  and giving us more abilities in fighting terrorism  is worth sacrificing the credibility of Silicon Valley?  Europe is outraged that Americans are like,  we're protected by the constitution, not supposed to be spying on Americans.  Europeans are like, wait a minute, we all use Facebook too.  So you're not even arguing about whether it's okay to spy on us.  What really bugs me is the false analogy with social networking sharing  and social security.

The fact that the US government stops a lot of people at the borders,  American citizens coming into the country, and says,  we are going to look at every file on your hard drive  and you don't decrypt with your passwords, we can hold you  or not allow you back in the country.

Transcript:  Maybe it will.  That's right. That's why I think Google, and to a certain extent Facebook,  the models that they have in terms of showing you what they know about you is a good one.  So for example, if you use Google Attitude, you can go there and say,  show me what you know about where I've been.  And it shows a map where you've been.  You can take action, turn stuff off and do things.  Same thing with Facebook. It tells you what apps you're connected with  and what those are doing, and you can just sort of opt out of those in the spot.  We need something like that. I mean, I think it's never going to happen.  But that would be a good first step.  To know what it is that they know.  Because right now, it's who knows.  The other thing is, everybody's talking about, you know,  Apple made a big deal about the fact that they can't, or the claim,  and everybody's like, yeah, the NSA can't decrypt that.  And my first thought is, really? You know that?  How do you know that?  This is an agency that exists to decrypt things secretly in ways that nobody knows.

And there is no big data than all communication.  Storing it and saving it for later.  And then harvesting the...just to be very, very clear in case people don't understand what's happening.  The harvest metadata, the metadata is a very, very important one.  The harvest metadata of everybody, everything you do, every email, every text, every phone call, everything.  Who you're calling, how long the call lasts, all this metadata.  And they're hunting for suspicious activity.  When they find it, they go back to their recording of your actual phone call.  They get a warrant.  And then they bust you.  This is like an Orwellian nightmare.

I don't know if you know more about the Tim Cook talk.  I think there's people in the audience who might have been there.  Watch them carefully.  Maybe we can collect some metadata.  Meanwhile, I had the worst call on the radio show.  Oh my gosh, I almost...  She burst into tears yesterday.  She said, my dad passed away  and I had been sitting at his bedside writing down  everything that he said for a couple of years  and Microsoft Works lost it.  I said, oh yeah, Microsoft Works? Yeah, it works.  I inadvertently saved a blank document on top of it.  And I said, did you back up? She said, what? No.  And I just really, every time I get a call like that, it just hits me  how important backing up your data is.  And so many people don't do it because it's hard.  Sometimes you do it. I asked my dad, do you back up?  And he said, yeah, every once in a while I'll take a USB key  and I'll put it into my phone or whatever.  How often do you do that? He said, whenever I think of it.  And I can guarantee you, whenever you think of it  is right after you lose all your data.  So what you need is a backup solution and what I've got for you  is really the right way to do it. It's automatic, so you don't have to remember it.  It's continuous. Whenever you're on the internet, it's backing up.  It is, by the way, and I want to emphasize this,  if you want, it is trust no one.  You can use your private keys and encrypt your data  so that no one, not even Carbonite, has that key.  Now you lose some capabilities as you would have to  if you do something like this, and I just want to emphasize that.  One of the things Carbonite does let you do is look at your cloud data  from any computer. You can log on to your Carbonite account,  get individual files, email those files to somebody else.  They have apps for the smartphone and the tablet and the Android.  That won't work if you use the TNO encryption,  and that's the point. Carbonite is safe, secure backup.  It always uses SSL,  so even if you're at an open access spot,  the backup is completely secure,  and best prices. It starts at $59.99 a year.  That is less than $5 a month for everything on your hard drive.  If you're a business, there could be no more important  thing to do than backup your data.  Imagine a fire in your place of business.  You lose your data, you lose the backup sitting next to the computer.  Now do you have your accounts receivable? Do you have your client list?  Do you have your supplier list? Can you get back in business?  How long is that going to take? You've got to backup to get it back,  so do it right with Carbonite. Flat rate plans  for home, for office, for business,  for Mac and Windows, and it starts at $59.99 a year.  I want you to try it free for two weeks.  Use our offer code TWIT, and you'll get two weeks without a credit card.  Try it. If you decide to buy, only at that time  will you use the credit card,  and then you'll get two bonus months with purchase.  14 months for the price of $12. You've got to backup to get it back.  Please, I don't want to get a crying phone call.  It was heart-wrenching from anybody saying,  I lost my data, because I've got to give her the bad news.  It's gone.  And then I really don't want to spank her and say,  I should have backed it up.  I'm thinking, why didn't you have a backup?  This is so valuable to you. I got a call once from a guy who lost his phone.  He said, my dog died three years ago, and the only pictures I have of that dog  were on that phone, and I lost the phone.  I can't help you. Too late. Back it up.

He brought in from all over the world  Apple's retail store leaders from across the globe  for a secret summit at Fort Mason Center in San Francisco.  Of course, immediately everything he said leaked right out.  He spoke for three hours.  During this time, according to a 9-5 Mac,  he expressed satisfaction with the way  Macs and iPads have been selling.  So much so, they said, let's put those on the back burner.  You don't have to push those anymore.  What I'm not happy about is that 80% of all iPhones  are purchased from someone else, AT&T or Rogers.

I can't remember the last time Apple did release a product  that was lousy and cheap.  The 3G and the 3GS both had polycarbonate backs too.  People didn't get the pitchforks and torches out  and go to the Apple stores.  I think maybe their goal here is to come up with something that feels new  and doesn't feel like it's two years old.  I'm concerned about the overall trend because the leaked images

I will agree with you, this is kind of a weird story for Apple  although selling two-year-old models for zero dollars  but the subsidy is also weird and Apple is doing that today.  And I think you're absolutely right that the problem in the US  we don't see it because it's below the waterline of the subsidy  but the problem is everywhere else in the world, Apple does need to make a phone  if they want to reach that is cheaper than two-year-old zero dollars.

This may actually be a phone that has higher margins  than selling the four for zero subsidized  because they may re-engineer it to be a little bit cheaper  and if it doesn't come across as being a cheap product  then that might actually not be an Apple's margin.

Another element of the iPhone sales push according to 9 to 5 Mac.  The upcoming launch of an iPhone trade-in program.  I think this is smart for Apple stores.  I think there are a lot of people out there with iPhone 4s, 4s.  Who might want to say,  I can get something for it if I bring it to the Apple store.  It also brings them to the Apple store where they'll buy.  One of the things he doesn't like is that 80% of iPhones are bought  outside the Apple store, but 50% of returns and fixes  come to the Apple store.  He's not happy about that one.

They demonstrated iOS to the Apple retail store leaders.  I'm just looking to see if I'm getting any eye contact from those guys.  Coupled with the new iPhone and iOS sales strategies,  Apple will focus on opening up a few new major stores in Europe,  including a new store in Italy.  Rumor to be working on it at low cost,  they didn't talk about that.  Store leaders, according to the people briefed on the talks,  reportedly left the summit feeling confident about Apple's fall product line.  Expect, and here's the interesting quote,  Apple will have new products this fall.  That's the weakest rumor ever, right?

Transcript:  I think the larger story with the watch  is the number of companies that are announced for shipping or rumored.  That shows how strong Apple is.  There was an article on this that gave the list  of everybody who's doing a watch,  major companies that are not.  The list of the companies that were not was four companies.  Nokia, a couple of other companies,

Start time: 4047.58

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  every other major technology company is working on it.  It's a new product category that no one has their big toe in.  This is one of the things that I've noticed,  especially with large electronic conglomerates,  is that they saturate each of those product categories  to the point where they have the low, middle, and ten.  It's a lot of people to keep buying stuff.  It was very telling that when I was at the LG,  and the Japanese electronics manufacturer,  one of the things they were touting were a lot of home appliances.  LG, smart refrigerators.

When you get the Apple iWatch, that's going to be like,  work only with the iPhone, it's going to make you need an iPhone,  you're going to love it because it's going to be really fashionable.  Google's probably going to do something similar.  Samsung is going to do something similar.

Transcript:  Well, why not do it?  I don't think it's a confirmation of it, but why not do it?  I do wonder when you talk about everybody doing a watch  if some aspect of that is this paranoia about Apple getting the jump on them.  There are all these rumors that Apple is working on a watch  and what's it going to be.  That happened with tablets and everybody had those slates at CES  that didn't actually ever come out because the iPad came out  and they're like, oh crap, we can't do that.  And the game is a little different now, and I know Samsung is looking at this aggressively  and a bunch of other manufacturers are, but I've got to think  that part of it is that they don't want to get caught flat-footed  by whatever Apple does this time.  We'll see if Apple does what we all expect them to do  or surprises everybody.

His specialty is exactly what Apple wants.  His specialty is to take something that's  high-falutin, design-y kind of a thing and make it a mass market product.  That's what Apple does.

But if you are in the business and feel that you need to keep it.  There are a lot of books that I actually listen to because I have to.  Silicon Valley, history books and stuff like that.

You can change passwords, control any function, send text, make phone calls.  Turn on the microphone. Turn on the camera.  Almost 900 million Android devices are vulnerable.  99% of all devices according to Blue Box.  Now we haven't been able to vet this because they haven't released the hack.  They say they will at Black Hat which is in late July.  So you've got a couple weeks.  This is a real problem for Android phones internationally

You see these huge numbers of how many Android phones are out there.  These aren't the most common.  They're not the most common.  These aren't people in the US and Europe for the most part.  These are mostly third world countries, China.  There are people who are not really playing ball with Google and Android.  They don't give you Google stuff. They don't give you the Play Store.  The vast majority of Android users have never heard of the Play Store.  The two-bit no-name company that makes the phone creates their own Play Store.  That's how they make the money.  They don't vet stuff.  Furthermore, there's size.  They don't vet stuff.

Transcript:  Furthermore, there's side load capabilities.  You have to check a box in your settings, but a lot of us do.  Google was notified about the bug in February, according to Blue Box.  Google then notified their device partners.  That's part of the problem.  I imagine if you're on a Nexus phone that you've been fixed already, I would hope.

The other problem in the Android universe is...  This has to be updated by Samsung.  One has to be updated by HTC.  They've got to make the modification. They've got to push the fix out.  Then they have to get the carriers to agree in most cases.  The carriers may slow it down too.

Part of me thinks it might be a good thing.  If they just put a little bit of apple juice in there somewhere.  Close it up a little bit, control it.  According to John Keester...

I don't know if Lookout's been given that hack by Blue Box.  I don't know who knows what.  There's a lot of mysteries about all this. Google says no comment.  If you are using Google Play  as an application verification tool, I didn't know you could do this.  You can go to your apps menu  if you're using 4.2 or later.  Tap Google Settings, verify apps.  Or in Settings, security, verify apps.  That's a great tip.  I had no idea. I'm going to have to see if that's on here.  So that's like Lookout. Lookout does the same thing.  It scans each app as you download it.  But apparently there's a built-in Google capability to do that.

Transcript:  The thing that people need to understand about the global market share numbers  is that the biggest thing that's happening in the world right now  is that people who used to have feature phones are getting smartphones.  They're getting computers.  My wife and I have been traveling around the world for like 10 months or something.  It was shocking how many feature phones are out there.  In significant European countries, some of them.  A lot of people are just using feature phones.  Everybody's going to have a smartphone within 5 years or something.  All this growth in smartphone markets,  this is a lot of people who don't really even want a smartphone.  That's just what they're selling.  You have to take it with a grain of salt.

End time: 5488.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't know exactly what those users look like.  There's a big movement afoot by Google and also Facebook  and a few other companies to go make deals with carriers  in places where people are paying for every bite of data.  The way that works is, in the case of Google,  you have a lot of data that's being used in these countries  to make deals with the internet.  If you use Gmail, Google Search or Google+,  you don't pay for the minutes on that data.  That's favoring the usage in these countries  to using these Google services.  Why they're doing that, I'm not sure.  This is one of the big things you see in the third world  and the second world, where if you want to use the internet,

Start time: 5489.30

Transcript:  I'm a little concerned about that.  It depends on how we're doing it, but a lot of these smartphones  that are going to people who use feature phones before,  are they going to use those features?  I see this a lot in carriers, especially in the US.  They're pushing these phones on people who might not use many of the features.  Oh, it's got the internet on it, and it's free.  But what they're really doing is getting them to buy that expensive data plan.  That's very profitable for them.  But you may end up with a lot of people who are paying for a data plan  that they don't really use, which is wasteful.  That's my question. If all you're doing is some email  and the occasional web browser, do you want to spend  a lot of money on a data plan on that phone?

Tim Cook said, I'll write it, but you're gone.  They said, Dom, would you like to write that letter?  And he said, I would, but he's still gone.  I don't know if this is the booby prize.  He is now the CEO of Zynga.  That's not good.  That's not good.  They probably gave him a lot of money.  So Mark Pinkus, who ran Zynga, finally realized,  I guess I'm not the right guy to run this company.  They were at the top with Farmville and all those Facebook games.  They had poker, right?  It was the big winner for them, some sort of head-to-head poker.  They bought words with friends and all the words with friends thing.

But Microsoft's done some really interesting things over the last few years.  And I feel like the more I look at it, the more it's opportunities,  and it's kind of wasted.

Transcript:  Absolutely. I think the biggest one is that they had the Microsoft Surface Table  before it was a tiny little thing.  First of all, switching the name over to the laptop thing was a big error.  I don't know. I think that was a good name.  Well, the Surface Table and the future of the desktop  is going to be these big screen, giant things, I think.  And Surface is a great name for that.  But branding aside, they had the Surface Table  in that space, which was...  Yeah, Perceptive Pixel.  And so now they've got both of those, and I've been trying to love them.  That's the 85-inch touchscreen.  I've been trying to write about what great things they must be working on,  and I want to talk to them, and I contact Microsoft,  and they get back to me and say, we don't want to talk about it.

Transcript:  So you can't do too well in one area because the office division's going to say,  hey, wait a minute!  I think you hit the nail on the head there, which is there's something  in Microsoft politics about protecting Windows and protecting Office.  And yet what they're doing is, interesting ideas kind of get squashed  or they get bastardized.  If the Windows phone interface had gone on the tablets directly  instead of being this weird half-baked Windows RT tablet strategy  that they did, but it's really Windows 8 underneath.  But it's just got the smell of good ideas  that were then kind of screwed up by somebody protecting their turf.

If you look at the difference between what Apple did  with introducing iOS and the iPad compared with what Microsoft did  where it came in and said,  we're going to give you the future, which is touch screens,  plus we'll give you the past, and then we won't give you so much future,  we'll bring back the button, blah-bitty-blah.  It's like this wishy-washy, they don't have any vision at all.  Apple came out and said, here's the tablet, this is how it is.

Then at the back end of it, he was like,  if we flip the switch, you're in the Windows desktop,  and you're going to run Office with them, and you can attach a mouse.  I'm like, oh, so close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do they think so little of their innovations, though,  that they figure unless they call it Windows  and make it very much like an old PC,  people aren't going to want it?  Because that's what it sounds like to me,  and it's too bad, because I think a fully-fledged  Windows phone-based tablet  that wasn't this weird combination of Windows 8 and Windows Phone  would have done better.  I don't know if there's anything they could have done.

Start time: 6535.42
End time: 6563.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think this is the innovator's dilemma.  I do not think there's anything they could have done.  They're trapped.  You either say, okay, we're going to give business what it wants,  which is Windows 7, you know, continually,  in which case people like us will say,  well, they've lost their ability to innovate.  They're just going to kind of coast into the distance,  like IBM,  or you do what Jason says  and you go full-bore  into the new Windows 8 touch world  and you say goodbye to the desktop.  Well, you don't say goodbye to the desktop,

Start time: 6563.92
End time: 6576.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but tablet, smartphone, you can see what they did with the Xbox.  I feel like they could have...  Where does the desktop go in that world?  So I think part of it is that you can't sit there in businesses  where you can't do that.  You can't sit there in businesses for a while.  You continue to sell Windows 7,

Start time: 6578.02
End time: 6579.94

Start time: 6579.98
End time: 6599.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I mean, they did it with Xbox.  They created an entirely brand-new platform  that, until recently,  had a really good mind share  among the audience.  And it was something that wasn't...  Yeah, they had the NT kernel as the basis for it,  but it wasn't like you hit the start button  and you go through it and you work it like a Windows machine.  I think it's very tough.

You lay it flat.  You plan things.  But there's no vision in it.  They're expensive.  That's another reason why they're good for enterprises.  How much does Microsoft charge for their software in enterprises?  But this is something that they make that's hardware.  This should be the new model.  They should be more Apple-like  because they're not doing the same thing  with the hardware and software they're doing on the low end.  There's nothing there.

Start time: 6636.72

Transcript:  I also think it's just a broader  industry-wide dilemma  because you are shifting from  a desktop,  a computer format  that people have been using for the past 20 years.  The ground has come out from under them.  And everyone's literally scrambling  finding out what the next  kind of computer model will be.  But that's when I bash Microsoft

Start time: 6659.06
End time: 6684.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  about this.  Leo, you said what happens to the old PCs.  But that's what I mean when I say  does Microsoft think so little of their products  that they have to yoke everything to Windows?  Because if they think that their tablet technology  and their phone technology is so great,  they should be pushing that as far as they can  and not worry. Windows will take care of itself.  It'll be around for a while. Eventually it'll go away.  I just don't think they believe it.  PCs are in decline.  They're going in the opposite direction.

You're so successful.  It's very difficult then to go to your next stage  without cannibalizing  your existing business.  I don't know what you do.

The boldest thing is to destroy Google Reader.  That was a bold move that Eric Schmidt  would never have been able to do.  But this is part of the house cleaning thing  that Larry is doing because he's a founder.  Because he's this person who can make those hard decisions.  So it's very difficult.  Maybe Bill Gates should come back.  I've often thought that would be a good move.

Transcript:  Well, that's how you succeed.  You become a different company.  Apple became a different company  after Jobs came back.  Google is becoming a different company.  In some respects, the opposite company  that they used to be.  Maybe IBM is a bad example, because they really did in a way.  And they're successful.  It was a successful transition and a radical one.  HP may very well become a very different company.  So I think that's exactly what I'm saying they need.  They need to just get over this like, silification.  They need to say, here's a clear vision of the future  and let's drive it.  Let's essentially do what Apple does  and force it down everybody's throats  until people get it and realize that this is really...  The most breathtaking thing that Apple ever did  was they introduced a phone without a keyboard.  And not only did they not build a physical keyboard to go with it.  They banned other companies from making a physical keyboard.  They said, we're going to give you two years  where there is no physical keyboard  that you can use with a computer.  That's called being able to use it.  That's called being all in.  They're all in.  And they trained us all to use the on-screen keyboard  and they never looked back.  That could have backfired.  It could have.  It takes guts.  It may backfire more for the Microsofts of the world  than it would for the Apple.  But that's what it takes.  You have to really believe in the future that you're giving people  and just give it to them and take your knocks and move forward.  Because otherwise they're just going to be a...  They're just quickly becoming an irrelevant dinosaur.

They bought it from Steve Perlman in 1997.  They rebranded it MSN TV.  $425 million they gave Steve.  Then of course, remember, he went on...  First he retired to his house in Tahoe.  Remember this?  And then he created Moxie.  Because he was trying to figure out a way  to get all his television in all the rooms of his mansion.  And then Moxie got sued out of existence pretty much.  I think they got sold to somebody.  And then what did Steve do next?  Does anybody know?  Something pretty big.  But I've forgotten what it is.  Only there was a search engine.

And nobody used it.  They had 1500 people online at a time.  But they could have had capacity for millions.  And they were paying for that.  And then put them out of business.  And then you could probably do it  by spinning up instances on Amazon Web Services.  Well, Sony's going to try the same thing.  Sony's going to do it with Gaikai, right?  Anyway, Web TV, if you count one.  Pour one out.  You have until September 30th.  And then they're going to shut down the service.  I actually had a caller on the radio show today.  Herpa.

Mike Elgin, Jason Snell, Roger Chang.  Smart people.  It's nice to have smart people around here.  Get that Dvorak out of here, he's driving.  Just kidding.  Actually, I asked because I wanted to have this Cuban cigars.  But since he's not here, I didn't bring him.  We're brought to you today by our friends at Citrix CITRIX.  You know them, of course, if you're in the business.  As the kings of remote access, Ed Iacobucci, who just passed away,  likes to be here.  And he's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  Ed Iacobucci, who just passed away last week,  a great guy, who really created Citrix in 1989.  Because he understood better than anyone how Windows worked.  He'd written much of the kernel for NT when he was at IBM.  Citrix has a lot of great solutions we've talked about before  to make it easier to get your job done.  Go to meeting, so you can have your online meetings.  Go to MyPC.  I don't talk enough about this one.  It's one I use probably more than any other Citrix tool.  It's called Sharefile.  And it lets me share the audio I do the radio shows with.  Any time you're in business, you want to share files.  The temptation is to attach it to an email.  But nowadays, these files are way too big.  They'll bounce back.  And of course, email, as we know now, is far from secure.  If you're in, for instance, the medical industry  and you want a medical business and you want to share patient records,  you can't do it via email.  That's illegal.  HIPAA won't let you.  Well, Sharefile, good news, is HIPAA compliant.  Compliant with regulations in many industries.  It allows you to share your files.  It allows you to share files securely, to keep control of the file.  When I send them to radio stations,  I can say this can be downloaded by whom, how often,  how many times, for how long.  You don't get bounce backs.  You complete access control.  You even can store these files in the cloud.  They have a synchronization program,  which means all my Sharefile folders are automatically stored  in the cloud and on other computers.  And that way, I can use my Sharefile app on my smartphone  or my mobile laptop,  my tablet, and share files,  even if I don't have them on the tablet.  I want you to try it free for 30 days.  Sharefile.com.  There's a special link here.  Don't click the green  Try It Free button at the middle of the page.  Go to the top.  See that little teeny weeny green microphone?  They're hiding it.  It says radio listeners. Click here.  I know, we're podcasts. That's alright.  It's close enough.  Enter the offer code TWIT, and you'll get 30 days free.  Do choose your industry so they can customize it.  Dozens of different industries, everything from accounting,  legal, video, software, retail, publishing,  and of course, medicine.  Sharefile.com.  Use the offer code TWIT to get 30 days free  at Sharefile.com.  But click that link at the top of the page, if you will.  That's how I send audio to the radio stations.  And it works really, really well.  I was using other services.  Didn't work so well.  Do you see those ads, the Google Bing challenge?  We came to Seattle, or wherever.  Home of the Bungie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I used to have one. Remember that?  The number one reason I bought it was to live with it for a while  and think about what a smart watch might do.  It's sort of like the cost of doing the business that we're in.  It is fun, though.  I'm a believer, because everybody always said,  you can just take your phone out of your pocket,  and you don't need a watch.  It's like, I'm really interested in this.  I'm really lazy. I would much rather do this.  And now I can do this for text messages, too.  I hate that argument, too.

Start time: 7345.70
End time: 7369.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not your argument, but the argument that people say that is...  To take your phone out of your pocket?  Because, first of all,  everybody understands the value of a bigger screen  on your phone, right?  This is more screen real estate.  Second of all, it's an additional filter.  So the good smart watches are going to give you  notifications, limited ones,  going to tell you who's calling and stuff.  And it's not everything on your phone.  I get a text, I can look at it

Transcript:  and see if I need to respond.  And if I don't, I literally press one button  and I move on, and I keep talking  to who I'm talking to, and I don't break it  by getting out my phone and going, oh, yeah,  and putting it away.

Transcript:  I noticed, though, you replaced the crappy plastic band with a nice leather one.

Start time: 7384.10
End time: 7395.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, the vinyl band it comes with is awful.  But it uses standard watch bands, so yeah.  Actually, at an Apple's developer conference,  there were a bunch of people with Pebbles,  and I think there were about 10 Pebbles,  and nine of them had replaced the band with a leather band.

Start time: 7397.17
End time: 7400.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got it for the same reason as you did.  I just call it your prior art watch.  Sure.

Start time: 7402.52
End time: 7422.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple actually has a patent that puts little batteries in the band.  So if they use that patent,  then we're going to see the band be irreplaceable,  unreplaceable in the iWatch.  It's very Apple.  It'll have batteries in it, yes.  So curved glass and batteries in the band.  Ask for it by name, the iWatch.  I'm so skeptical.  I almost don't even think they're going to do it.

Start time: 7422.56
End time: 7430.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They might not.  I think they'll do it.  Everybody seems so convinced they're going to do it.  I just don't buy it. I don't understand why anybody would want it.

Start time: 7430.78
End time: 7439.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think they'll do it, but there'll be a spin.  Like with the iPad, there'll be a little bit of a spin  that nobody's necessarily expecting.  Maybe it's more of a fuel band than it is a watch.  Exactly.

Start time: 7440.94
End time: 7442.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did buy a fuel band and a Fitbit.

Start time: 7443.35
End time: 7446.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. Maybe it's more  fitness and activity related than it is.  OK.

Transcript:  Dvorak isn't here, so I'll be the one to bring up  the conspiracy theory type things.  You're wearing the tinfoil hat today.  Foxconn is  showed at an investor meeting  at a Fitbit-like  watch.  Foxconn. You guys  have been around. Do you ever remember Foxconn  coming out with prototype devices?  No.  They don't client directly at all.  I'm wondering if that's the Apple iWatch.  Why would they show it?  Who knows? Maybe they want to deflect  the rumors because this  is going to be floating around.

Start time: 7483.50
End time: 7485.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Foxconn thinks we should make something.

Start time: 7485.50
End time: 7502.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The thing is it's very Fitbit-like  and Tim Cook is a big fan of the Fitbit.  He wears a Fitbit. He's on the board.  There's something there  where that could  indicate a direction for the iWatch.  Here's the most interesting  thing about the Foxconn thing. It has a  fingerprint reader. I wrote a column.

Start time: 7503.50
End time: 7506.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love that column and I wish Apple would put the fingerprint reader in the iPhone.  I was thinking they would put it in the iPhone.

Start time: 7507.76
End time: 7527.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The iPhone becomes your identification device.  The mother of all identification devices.  It's not just a thing to secure the phone.  It's your passport.  What if they did it in a watch or both?  A watch would be a great place for an identification thing.  Tell it to get stolen.  You bolt it on your wrist.  It can get stolen but  without your fingerprint it's useless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no.  Modern, good fingerprint.  The cheap crappy ones.  The good fingerprint readers know if it's a live finger.  They can't be fooled by Play-Doh.

Start time: 7544.22
End time: 7548.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, I think it's very suspicious  that Foxconn is shocking around its own device.

Start time: 7548.32
End time: 7558.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's got an infrared. It can tell.  There's blood pulsing through that.  You'd have to build an entire  pulsing hand, blood flow finger.  What if it was just like a bandage you put on your own thumb?
