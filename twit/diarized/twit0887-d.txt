Start time: 165.24
End time: 178.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should because there'll be spoilers if you don't already know.  Some people do because they're just there.  Like I watch a show and then I go through the psychology of the show.  So when we do, sorry, black noir, I think I said en noir because there's a restaurant that I love in Montreal.

Transcript:  Close.

Start time: 180.18
End time: 196.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's close.  It's similar.  Not the same.  But yeah, so you should, some people watch, just watch it for the psychology aspects because that's what I deal with.  I just go through what is the psychology and I usually choose a certain aspect of psychology to be able to deal with through a character on a show.  So it's a funner way to be educated on.

Start time: 196.52
End time: 212.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you find, I mean, I would guess this is probably true for people who write TV shows that they have to understand, at least intuitively have to understand psychology.  Do you find that the psychology is, there's black noir by the way, that the psychology is pretty accurate?

Start time: 213.40
End time: 247.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For a lot of shows, it's exceptionally accurate.  I think that they do a really good job.  I think that a lot of shows hire people like me to make sure that the psychology matches up.  And there are some shows that the psychology, like it's spot on, like they're kind of hitting all the marks and I can really go through different sets of,  like the actors are doing a really great job at portraying the feelings and there's even some animations that they've just done such like arcane.  They've done just such an amazing job at making sure that all of the emotions come through and they understand why their character is doing what they were doing.  And for what reasons for it.  And then there's some other kind ofness.

Start time: 248.28
End time: 262.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're watching a show and somebody does something that's psychologically wrong, you know, somehow doesn't match up, you probably make, you may not know why, but you may go,  that doesn't feel right.  Like that's not how somebody would really behave in real life.  Yeah.  Something like that.

Start time: 262.62
End time: 287.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And for me, it really bothers me, right?  Yeah, well you.  Like if someone has some sort of an issue with something and then they forget it in between and I'm like, they wouldn't be touching that.  They're already, they're germaphobic.  They wouldn't be touching this.  It doesn't fit with all of the mythos of their character and it psychologically kind of pulls us out, right?  It causes that disjoint in our minds to be able to be like that doesn't really fit and that cognitive dissonance kind of stops us from being fully immersed.

But yeah, no, I mean at least this is this is better.  We're working on I'm working on my office at some point in the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amazon.  All right.  This is a really interesting story and I think there are a lot of ramifications on the  surface of it.  Amazon's going to buy Roomba.  iRobot.  They make the Roomba vacuum, robot vacuum.  1.7 billion dollars seems like a good business.  But there was a very good article I thought in Wired that maybe it's conspiracy theory.  I'd like to know what y'all think.  iRobot deal would give Amazon Maps inside millions of homes.  It ain't the dust writes Carrie Johnson.  It's the data.  Christina.  Is there more to this acquisition?

Start time: 467.96
End time: 489.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I definitely think the data is part of it, right?  Like I don't know if that was the impetus between why they were buying iRobot.  I have to think that they were also I mean, because Amazon had been kind of in this  space too and to try to sell competitors.  Did they have a robot vacuum?  They did.  Yeah.  They definitely did and definitely I mean, you know with their big IoT push and with

Start time: 489.20
End time: 515.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  like, you know, like sidewalk and the ring doorbell.  In fact, that's what Carrie says.  They bought the Eero in 2019, Ring in 2018.  Of course, they've got in most homes, they've got an Amazon Echo or two with microphones  right and cameras.  But so it does look like maybe it's a coinkeying.  Kind of looks like they're putting together some sort of portfolio of data about me.

Start time: 516.28
End time: 544.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I mean, certainly I could I could see areas where it could be interesting  if you had even just some ancillary data about, you know, the layout of people's houses  and whatnot.  Like if you're in the business of maybe wanting to sell furniture, I don't know or  selling electronics or selling other things and and wanting to, you know, Amazon wants  to be like the store for everything.  I don't I don't think that there's an argument that you can make that having this data  wouldn't be potentially useful.  I don't know though, if that's the only reason why they're buying this company, if that  makes sense.

Start time: 545.36
End time: 552.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Abraha, it makes me though think that Amazon is not the innocent internet storefront  that we've thought it was.

Start time: 553.10
End time: 581.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's it's so fascinating to see how it's gone from a place where you  can kind of conveniently buy things at a lower price to oh my God, they know everything  about what I'm buying, what I'm watching, what I'm reading, what I'm listening to.  And they're in so many different facets of our lives now.  And I think we kind of like woke up one day and we're like, oh my God, like, you know,  I think most people didn't really realize how quickly it all kind of ramped up.  And now it kind of feels like it's spiraling out of control and to think, oh my God, they  would know the layout of my home just feels incredibly intrusive.

Start time: 581.40
End time: 615.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remember that Roomba got in or I robot got a little trouble when people realized that  Roomba has to make out of necessity of, you know, where the dog dishes, where the sofa  is, you know, where your kitchen is so that it can navigate those spaces.  We're getting uploaded to I robot.  And that's when people went, wait a minute.  Why?  I don't know if I robot ever sufficiently explained it.  They certainly didn't stop doing it.  But then I guess the question is, well, what I mean, so what if Amazon has a map of my  house?  I mean, what are they going to do with it?

Start time: 618.88
End time: 654.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It becomes one more piece of information that a company has that did not disclose it  beforehand.  Like I think Facebook has taken a whole brunt of like damage control on like misusing all  of our information.  Amazon's kind of like like been really quiet about it.  Just taking the information, not really said anything because when you put that like put  all of that information together, they really know.  I won't say almost everything about us, but like almost everything about us.  Yeah, what don't they know?  They just bought one medical for 3.49 billion.

Start time: 657.38
End time: 658.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That one bothers me more.

Start time: 658.18
End time: 743.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They get all those health records.  I'm sure they're protected somehow by HIPAA, but still it looks more like it does not  look like Amazon is building a portfolio of products it can sell.  And in fact, you know, so when Amazon first started, that was kind of the idea was in  fact, I think they said like the world's largest bookstore or something like that.  The idea was we're going to be the best retail ever.  But then and we've got more mature in our thinking about it.  And I think Brad Stone's books about Amazon got me thinking about and at one point I  think Stone says well what Amazon really wants to do is own a small piece of every  transaction like a couple of pennies.  Every time you buy something online, that's a good living.  Then they became an advertising company.  In fact, their quarterly results show that they're very good at that.  They make a lot of money in advertising and what's their biggest business AWS, which  is network cloud stuff, you know, selling cloud access to people.  I don't know how that fits in.  But then all these acquisitions, it really looks like Amazon isn't necessarily a  bookstore, isn't necessarily like a Visa card, a transaction collector that they're  somehow building.  I don't know.  It's unclear in my mind, but they're somehow building a dossier about everybody.  What would they use that for?  What could that be?

Start time: 745.68
End time: 816.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a lot of information that isn't shown.  Like it's the rooms that we choose that we want to clean.  It's the rooms that we use the most of.  It's where furniture is placed to be able to sell things.  It's where people usually travel to.  It's economic status because larger houses, larger spaces of where people are located.  It's how much people purchase in certain sized homes.  Yeah.  And I think that my biggest issue though isn't even the data.  It's that when you sign a privacy policy for a company that you trust and you're all  comfortable, but then they get bought out all of your information that you believed  was secure because you trusted the company now is in whatever some nefarious company  or non nefarious company's hand and it changes everything and we don't have a right to  say, you know what?  I now want to, you know, there's no sandbox around my information.  It's just kind of given away and it's like we've been sold off to the highest bidder,  whoever that person might be when we actually signed a contract with someone else.  And there is no contract law that really protects us and allows us to revoke access to the  data that we've already given away in a trusted situation.

Start time: 817.74
End time: 821.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I don't know how much people trusted Roomba to save those maps anyway.

Start time: 821.54
End time: 831.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I don't think anyone knew that they were being mapped.  Right.  I didn't know that when I had my Roomba.  I mean, if you think about it, you realize that's how, that it has to do that, right?

Start time: 831.42
End time: 833.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It has to kind of, it has to upload it.

Start time: 833.20
End time: 854.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It has to know itself because what they say when you read it, they say that the Roomba  takes a look at the area and then goes back and forth and kind of remembers.  It does not tell you, at least when I had my Roomba, it did not tell me.  And I actually read privacy policies because I'm nerdy that way that it did not tell me  that it's uploading and saving that data and could sell that off to a third party.

Start time: 855.94
End time: 884.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I remember Amazon was, I think they did sell a few of them, built this robot  Astro that would know where your kitchen is.  So you could say Astro go to the kitchen.  I mean, really, I mean, if they're not intentionally trying to build this very  complete map of everything I buy own do am, then they by accident they're doing  this, but it sure looks like it's intentional.  So what is that?  Is that a problem?

Start time: 885.96
End time: 937.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's, you know, I think the thing that a lot of people are growing,  growing increasingly uncomfortable with is that, you know, George, I love that  you read the privacy policies of these companies.  I think a lot of people don't necessarily do that.  And I think, you know, they use these products or services and then realize how  much am I giving away with all of this?  And I think we're kind of feeling inundated with the fact that any platform  you use any service you use, you're giving away so much more information than  you would feel comfortable with.  And you kind of feel helpless in the sense that like, you know, there is a  beauty to having a sense of privacy and not feeling like your data is being used  to sell products or services to, you know, get more of your money.  It just kind of feels like this endless spiral.  So I think just just knowing how much they know about you is incredibly  uncomfortable.  And, you know, companies like Amazon will only continue to grow and only continue  to glean more information about each of us.

Start time: 940.20
End time: 987.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry, I just sneezed.  Bless you.  Yeah, I mean, I'm so I go back and forth on on privacy and on the one hand,  if all Amazon's going to do is use this to put better recommendations at the  bottom of the Amazon.com page, I think that's, you know, relatively harmless.  But then I also start to look at stories about, for instance, the government  buying information from data brokers that some data brokers are selling for,  you know, 150 160 bucks, a list of all the people who went to visit an  abortion clinic in the last six weeks, that kind of thing.  And I start to realize that potentially.  This becomes harmful.  I don't think Amazon is thinking what could we sell the government?

Start time: 988.06
End time: 1090.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yes and no.  I mean, like you look at like what the fact that, you know, ring and some of  this might have had carve outs before Amazon acquired them, but you know, ring  will give your data over to the police and which bothers me on a lot of levels.  It even if you opt out, the you know, the police can can still kind of get  into these programs where without a search warrant they can get access to  this this ring data would bother me about that is if you as an individual  want to offer some of your camera information, fine.  But ring is taking video footage of people who are in your surrounding  area and is also collating things with people who haven't opted into that.  So I have very, very big problems with that happening at all.  I think that if the police want to get information, you know, from someone's  security system, regardless of whether it's cloud-based or local, I think they  need to have a warrant for that period.  I don't think that you should have companies like the ring and Amazon by  extension just passing it over.  I think that that is a massive violation.  And so if you if you look at that perspective and you're saying, well,  they'll do it in this instance and we know that they also will without  warrants in some context give Alexa information over to law enforcement.  Then I do have concerns about what other information they have collected on me  and how willing they will be to provide it to people under whatever, you know,  like justification they want to give it to.  And personally, I think that is more troubling in some regards to say we're  going to give it to law enforcement without warrants than we would be to  sell it to advertisers.  Although I do think that selling it to advertisers and selling it to  government entities is a massive problem too.  But the fact that you have a very large company like Amazon, but you could say  the same thing for Google.  You could say it for Microsoft.

Start time: 1090.62
End time: 1093.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Google does by the way the same thing 100% you can say for Meta.

Start time: 1093.94
End time: 1132.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the fact that they collect all this information about us and that it  exists anywhere where it is regardless of what they say, there's a way that  they can have it tied to an individual identity and that can be tied to a  person.  I think that should cause us to have concerns even if we are resigned as I  basically am that like privacy in a lot of regards instead.  I still think that we should have concerns and should be asking questions  about why does all this information need to exist and why does it all have  to be tied and controlled by these very large companies that are acting as  data brokers but not always having to take the same responsibility that other  data brokers might.

Start time: 1132.60
End time: 1186.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if you think about it, if you wanted to build an Orwellian surveillance  state, you would do all of this.  Right.  So in a way what's happened is private corporations have done it for the  government and all it's missing is the government saying, okay fine, great,  we'll take it from here.  The requests that go to ring and Google for their camera footage are what's  called emergency requests.  Most of the time you do need a warrant.  But if somebody, if it's something that is time sensitive, you know, somebody's  getting murdered or something and we could stop it if we got the footage.  So that's the theory and I think no company, I don't think it's just Google  and Amazon, I think no company wants to be the company that says, oh, we could  have stopped that abduction if we had just given footage to the law enforcement  when they asked for it.

Start time: 1187.14
End time: 1236.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but there's also, if there are really life and death situations, then  you can get judges and you can have warrants issued usually very quickly.  So I don't buy that as an argument.  I really don't.  Yeah, I mean the Constitution says there needs to be a warrant.  I was going to say, I'm sorry, but like I said, I think that this is a  Fourth Amendment issue fundamentally and I'm going to come down in favor of  the Fourth Amendment over what other, like what scenario you want to put for  some place.  I just am.  I'm going to say I think the Fourth Amendment is more important and I also  think that there are things and clauses in place within the court system to  get judges to sign warrants almost immediately.  I have a big problem with the fact that companies are just willing to oblige,  especially since when you look into these data situations, many of these  circumstances aren't necessarily these life and death scenarios.  So I don't know to me.

Start time: 1236.88
End time: 1243.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and also there's been hacks.  So you could pretend to be law enforcement and get this footage.  Exactly.

Start time: 1244.34
End time: 1254.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That has happened, which is a big problem.  And so yeah, I just, again, I'm personally going to be more in favor of  the Fourth Amendment versus whatever, you know, what if terrible scenario  you have, but that's me.

Start time: 1254.84
End time: 1269.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's actually really an excellent point.  You have a constitutional protection.  It says you have to have a warrant to do that kind of stuff.  And let's, yeah, let's make that possible.  Let's at least go to a judge and say, hey, we need this information.

Start time: 1270.46
End time: 1322.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a problem though when these large companies, they have all of this  lobbying and us as regular people, we really don't.  We don't have the amount of protections that are in place.  Companies do because companies are now people.  So they get the all of the handouts that they get for being a big company  and the lobbying and the amount of money, but also they get all the  protections as a person and yet as people, us being all single, we really  don't have much of a stake at being able to make huge changes and we're not  protected.  So I fully agree with you, Christina, that we really need to make sure that  protections are in place because there isn't transparency.  There isn't any accountability if anything happens wrong.  And it's pretty much just like, oh, well, another breach.  Sorry.  Your information is out there.  Hope nothing bad happens and that's it.  And then their hands are washed of it and then they go on and it happens  so often we become complacent to it.  We just become like, oh, that's just life now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think that it's that big that they should block it, but I do think  that they should make sure that they should have protections in place to be  able to ensure that all of our information is shown.  It's written in a way that's really easy to understand because it's not.  It's really filled with legalese.  No one reads privacy unless you really have a lot of time on your hands.

Transcript:  And also there's competition.  There are other companies that do this.  It's not sowing up the market.  So maybe there isn't an antitrust reason.  It's really about privacy.  I don't know if the FTC has a mandate to do that.  We know Lena Kahn, their chair, does.  You know, she wants to, I'm sure, but she may not be able to.  So what is our recourse?  We just have to sit and take it or not by a Roomba and not by an Echo.  By the way, let's not forget.  And again, I'm not convinced that Amazon is doing this out of any nefarious  intent, but they have set up using ring doorbells and Echo devices,  a low power, low low rod network called Sidewalk that is intended to  cover the entire country every square inch.  Because if you have an Amazon device, the chances are you're already  part of this network sharing a little tiny bit of your internet so  that lost dogs can lost keys can be found.  But that seems also to be a very big surveillance tool.  It's too much of a coincidence.  And I just wonder what they're up to.

If you're a foreign offender in the UK, you know, one of them immigrant types,  they're going to require migrants convicted of crimes to put on a watch  that takes a picture of them five times a day and does face recognition.  Make sure it's them and then sends a GPS so they can in case they're up to no good.  Those obliged to wear the devices will need to compete complete periodic  monitoring checks throughout the day by taking a photograph of themselves on  the smartwatch with information including their names, date of birth,  nationality photographs stored for up to six years.

Transcript:  No, I would see it can because they we end up doing this thing of like us and them they'll do it to a them.  We try to separate do it to my with a other and because it's an other and it's not us people say,  okay, and so you give up a little bit of your rights for your safety,  which is the fastest way to make someone right your rights and then after we're comfortable with it happening to them.  It happens to it's bad people right like it's just them and then it just happens to people that have like  sense offended whatever done something that's wrong and then slowly it becomes just mainstay.  And so it's not something that's going to happen right away and it becomes like oh,  but child predators like they put it on to something that's really hard to be able to say no,  we shouldn't go with this because then you become a horrible person that's on the side of predators or you know abusers  and then it's just this insidious sliding over of our rights.  And unfortunately, I would love to say that I'm not I'm just wearing like a aluminum hat right now.  And this isn't something that happens.  But this is exactly the psychology of what happens when governments want to grab more power.  They find something to make us afraid and because we're afraid we give up our rights faster than anything else  because it works on that limbic primal part of our brain that safety is more important and we're at danger  though we've never been safer the amount of crime in the world in again first,  you know world countries has gone starkly down from the 70s yet.

I would say though is that but I think what happened in the US in addition to kind of this like,  you know, like a small slide of starting with one group and then slowly expanding to others  and then it becomes mainstay is that we will just corporatize it which we've already done  where it will be part of a private company doing these things and then it becomes kind of the norm  and then it becomes part of government programs like I'm part of clear which which is like a way  where you can get through, you know, like the airport faster.

But one of the exceptions has always been okay, but if a private company is doing it,  then that's a little bit different because I've chosen to opt into this  and I think that that's one way you kind of get around that as you start with the private companies  who all of a sudden are partnering with the government entities  and then the line between the two is sure nonexistent.

Milne character and can also put it into horrific situations.  Like there's a horror film that's coming out in October with Winnie the Pooh.  It's awful.  Don't do that to Winnie the Pooh.  Thank you.  It's like I'm a huge like fan of like, you know, fixing the copyright system and then  something like this happens and I go this is why we can't have nice things because this  goes into public domain and instantly you want to do some horror core like Winnie the  Pooh stuff, which is just not.

She is perfectly symmetrical.  Thank you.  Thank you, Georgia.  All three of you.  Great to have great to have you here.  Lots more to talk about our show though today brought to you by Blueland.  We really are happy.  I got we Lisa is my wife is on a crusade against single use plastics because she likes Turtles  and whales and she doesn't like seeing all this plastic in the ocean.  She does the same plastics now in our bloodstreams.  So she we've gotten rid of plastic in almost every aspect of our life.  This is the latest and I love it.  It's called Blueland.  Did you know that an estimated 5 billion plastic hand soap and cleaning bottles end up in landfill every year?  And of course, they never degrade.  They'll be there for a million years.  Most cleaning formulas are mostly water.  So you're transporting 90% water in trucks across the country.  There is a better way.  Plus those products are often filled with nasty ingredients chlorine ammonia.  Look, it's it's a lose-lose all around but Blueland solves the problem.  Eco-friendly products with bottles designed to be reused again and again.  We replaced our cleaning bottles.  We replaced our hand soap.  You know the soap dispensers.  We placed our laundry soap our dish soap all with Blueland.  You get you start with a beautiful Blueland bottle Instagramable bottle that you use.  It's a forever bottle.  All you have to do is you fill it with your own water.  So you don't have to transport that water and then Blueland sends you little tablets little fizzy's you put in the warm water that is off.  And now this is the this is the multi-surface cleaning stuff.  You've got a great multi-surface cleaner.  I have it in all the bathroom sinks in the house here at the office.  We have Blueland and when it runs out you just put warm water in there put one of the tablets you can even subscribe to these so they come.  These are easy to ship.  They come in paper pouches so you can recycle those.  This is eco-friendly done right.  And the only thing you're going to lose is your outdated notion that eco-friendly products are too expensive or less effective.  Blueland is on a mission.  I'm a hundred percent behind to eliminate single-use plastics by reinventing home essentials that are good for you in the planet.  Their innovative tablet refill solution takes up to 10 times less space than a traditional bottle.  Their powerful formulas keep your home clean and smell amazing.  Refills start at two dollars and you don't buy a new bottle.  You can buy a new bottle when you want to but you don't be you're going to refill it.  They last for a long long time from cleaning sprays to hand soap to toilet.  Oh the toilet cleaner.  I love it.  Oh, I love it.  In fact, they sell out of that.  So while they're in stock at it, you just drop it in the toilet.  It's amazing laundry tablets.  They even sell when we use these.  I don't know wool balls you put in your dryer.  We put three in there things dry faster.  There's no you don't have to use dryer sheets anymore.  There's no it's anti-static.  It's kind of magical.  Start with I did this when my daughter moved.  I gave it to her as a as a house warming.  The clean essentials kit everything you need to get started and the scents are fantastic.  You can get holiday scents.  I mentioned before I got the Christmas scents.  I still have some gingerbread soap in my bathroom.  So I smell like gingerbread house when I come out Iris agave fresh lemon eucalyptus mint for a limited time.  They've got some hand soap scents for summer that you're going to love strawberry rhubarb citrus patchouli and coconut palm.  But here's you don't have to but you if you want you can order these.

The Department of Motor Vehicles in our fine state of California is accusing Tesla of falsely advertising autopilot.  It's about time it is not an autopilot is driver assist.  Tesla loves you to think that you know it's a self-driving vehicle.  But DMV says that's false advertising you misled consumers claiming in advertisements that vehicles equipped with autopilot and full self-driving were autonomous.  They have complained to the state's Office of Administrative Hearings and the potential risk for Tesla is the license to make and sell vehicles in California.  They do both could be suspended or revoked.  Wow.  No response from Elon.  I'm surprised he hasn't tweeted about this.  He tweets about everything else.  What do you think?  Is this fair?

And I think you know I think sometimes people might that that term autopilot can be incredibly misleading or saying that something is fully self-driving when it's not.  I mean I have friends who have Tesla's and maybe get a little too comfortable when they do turn on autopilot.  And so yeah so you know they'll be like completely on their phones the whole time or like working.  It's just absolutely reckless.  But but I think it is fair to bring this up as a concern and it'll be interesting to see how this plays out.  And if Elon weighs in I'd be surprised if he didn't at some point.

Transcript:  National Highway Transfer Traffic Safety Administration.  And it's a has been investigating all this.  In fact there were two crashes last month in which Tesla's collided with motorcycles on freeways in the dark.  Both were fatal.  I'm sorry to say.  And the concern is that maybe the Tesla's didn't even see them.  You know that they couldn't.  The one was in Riverside California.  There's another in Draper Utah middle of the night.  And of course one of the things Tesla does which I think is a little slimy is.  And then it's a wants this information.  They they will turn off autopilot right before the crash.  And then they can say oh autopilot wasn't involved.  It was off when they when the accident happened.  That's one of the one of the things that it says been saying.  Yikes.  I you know I had a Tesla loved my Tesla.  I don't have a Tesla now.  But even when I had a Tesla with autopilot.  I was vigilant.  And there were times when the thing would start to veer off to the you know to the shoulder or even into a barrier.  There were times when I you know I had lane merging where you'd signal and it would go into the next lane automatically.  It would do it.  And it was really close to a car behind me and I was like stop.  You just don't want to fully trust it.  So advertising that is full self-driving is maybe you shouldn't.

Go to sleep take a nap turn around like already.  Unfortunately like you want to think that we're like a higher formed organism and we think all these things but you just tick tock videos people getting out of the car and dancing while the car is driving and they're actually doing it.  It's not that someone's actually taken over driving which is what happens in most of the videos.  But you know are there on the roof the car like no you probably should be driving.  It's your your it's thousand like you know hundreds of pounds of steel probably or you know aluminum and you know it's just a dangerous thing to be able to do.  But when you say autopilot people will believe that because we're not as involved as we think we are and then we'll do things that we shouldn't do thinking that the car will take over.  And even if it does a lot of the time that means that there's a whole bunch of times when it won't.

But if it said just driver assist then it was like it's there to help you.  It's like cruise control right.  If they said something that was more similar to that we're like OK we still have to pay attention.  It's going to be keeping the same a certain distance but we have to pay attention because it doesn't deal with every single situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is probably what they'll say.  I don't know how well that works though because because to your point like you know marketing words have meaning and they clearly shows autopilot  because they want to push things to be being fully self-driven like that that that that that that's in Tesla's best interest.  That's where they want to push the technology.  And I've said this many times over the years on this show and others.  I mean I think that the biggest thing that's going to hold us up on on self-driving is actually the regulatory aspects more than the technology itself.  But putting that aside you know it's not a fully you know self-driving thing but people still treat it that way and a big part of that is the name autopilot.  So no matter what they're doing like they are in inherently with the way they promote this feature no kind of letting people know.  Oh you you can actually treat this as if it's a fully autonomous driving solution when and that's not the case.  And so I don't know how well that I'm sure that's the argument will make but I don't know if that argument actually you know changes reality  because if you're advertising something as being one thing you can't be angry when people actually use it the way you're advertising it.

Transcript:  Well one thing Tesla will be celebrating is the return of the tax credit about five hours ago the Senate passed that sweeping $430 billion bill  which fights inflation flights climate change lowers drug prices and restores the tax credit in some circumstances for electric vehicles.  Tesla GM had already sold more than 200,000 vehicles that was the cap so they lost that $7,500 tax credit.  If this if this bill passes through the House intact and then is signed by the president that that credit will be coming back to promote EV sales.  By the way you also get a $4,000 credit on used electric vehicles which is good I think.  Do we still need though to subsidize EVs?

I think anything you can do to encourage people to adopt more EVs and to get more in the ecosystem is good.  I'm actually a bigger fan of the credit for the used EV sales than even like the first time thing.  I think that's a really good thing to you know encourage people who might not have the money or the inclination to buy a new car to at least okay if I'm buying  something used I can still benefit from this credit.  I'm a fan of this personally.

But it but it is at least some tax credit and I guess when the smoke clears we'll know exactly what the details are.  But that's also that bills a big deal for climate change.  It's Bill Gates last Sunday in the New York Times wrote a an opinion piece saying we're on the verge of a remarkable moment for Congress in the country asking  the Senate to pass this bill the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.  He said it might be the single most important piece of climate legislation in American history because of the subsidies for alternative energy.  He says many of the technologies will need to reach net zero emissions don't exist or are in early stage of development are still too expensive to scale up  without new and expanded tax credits government support.  Many of these technologies won't be developed the incentives provide the private sector with the confidence to invest for the long term.  So I guess Mr.  Gates must be happy today.  27 hour session including the Voter Rama that happened overnight as as different amendments and modifications were proposed most of them voted down.  So good.  I think good news.  I'm willing to say good news.  I know that's a little partisan but I'm in favor of clean energy.  Yeah.

And like this is where some you know billionaires are actually doing some good like Mark Cuban started his drug company where he's you know giving to a little bit over cost for I think it's like was 200  different drugs.  And like that's something where we can you know get behind and be able to say you know what we could we can do this better because really if we're not taking care of people then what does any of this matter?

But in this case, yeah, maybe I don't know is I don't know anything about it.  I've read about it.  It's a public benefit corporation, which means that you know, it's not a for-profit operation and they're selling drugs at just slightly over cost just to cover the costs.  He says I could make a fortune from this but I won't I've got enough money.  I'd rather f up the drug industry in every possible way.  I think you know what now I'm a Mark Cuban fan.

You probably shouldn't tweet you shouldn't call you shouldn't talk to anyone until you've kind of calmed down.  But the problem is when you're so powerful who's going to take away your phone.

I hate to give sort of a little bit of bad news, but I think there's no way to sort of have there's a lot of sort of in here to sort of have anticipated quite the inflation that we've seen.

We'll get through this.  We'll get through this someday.  Somehow our show today brought to you by podium.  I have to say one of the one of the really interesting changes in society.  Thanks to covid and quarantine is we've gotten really used to text messages communicating  via text getting a text your foods on the way or getting a text.  You could pick up your groceries now and and you know, it's the best way to do business.  It is better than email better than phone calls better than anything.  If you own a small business and you've survived the last couple of years and I know they've  been hard not just supply chain issues demand you didn't expect and you got to you know,  they're all that stuff businesses that thrive right now are the ones who you know in recession.  You got to plan for growth.  This is an opportunity and the businesses who are planning for that are doing are thriving  Podium helps your small business stay ahead of the curve with modern messaging tools.  It's kind of remarkable.  We have a few businesses in our small town that use podium and I love it.  For instance, I leave the dentist's office before I am two steps away.  I get a text saying how was our service leave a review for us on Yelp or Google business.  It's amazing every once in a while and I don't like this one.

Washington Post.  Great article by Jeffrey Fowler.  Here's why your gadgets die so quickly.  Electronics are built with death dates.  Let's not keep them a secret.  And he actually put together a gadget graveyard, which I thought was really good.  The hidden death dates on popular devices.  These are devices that the batteries cannot be replaced.  As you know, lithium ion batteries have a certain number of charge cycles.  After that, you can't charge them anymore.  If you've got AirPods, after two years, in most cases, you're just going to have to throw  them away and get a new one.  Apple sells has a quote replacement deal where you pay 49 bucks for one AirPod.  But they don't, and I don't know, maybe they recycle it when you send it back to them.  But I suspect there's quite a few AirPods in the landfill.  Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet.  Amazon won't disclose how many recharges it can take.  Amazon offers no battery replacement service.  You can go to iFixit, I think, and get a battery.  While it's not easy, you could, I guess, replace it.  But I would guess most Amazon tablets end up in landfill, like AirPods.  iPhones, good on Apple.  They will, for 69 bucks, replace it, the battery.  Same with the MacBooks.  Not so much with the Bose QC35 noise-canceling headphones.  No out-of-warranty battery replacement service.  What do you think?  Brar, you cover consumer technology.  Do you ever talk about this as an issue?

Transcript:  Yeah, I think this conversation around electronic waste is something that's really ramping up.  And that's one side of it.  And the other side of it is also we don't feel like we are ready to let go of our devices  as quickly as we have to.  And it's really annoying that it is like, OK, I'm approaching the two-year mark of how long  I've had my phone.  And I know I have to replace it.  And there's nothing I can do about it.  And so I think I love that this article is like, let's discuss the fact that this is  not something that we should just be accepting.  And I think that one of the things that it brings up that I think is really interesting  is the marketing angle.  In order for us to make your phone as slim and waterproof as we want to make it, sorry,  you're not going to be able to access the battery.  And we've kind of just gone along with it.  OK, in the name of innovation, sure.  OK, these design changes are something that's going to make it better.  But it is really unfortunate and wasteful and a pain for consumers to have to constantly  feel like they have to switch out their devices also in the name of keeping up with trends.  And I feel like Apple does a really good job of making people feel like it's time for them  to upgrade to a new device, not because they feel like they want to, but because they have  to look like they're on top of it.

According to Apple, about 70% of the carbon emissions come from manufacture.  So it's not just throwing it out.  The longer you can keep it in service, that's one more phone, AirPod, something that doesn't  have to be manufactured.  And that's a big source of emissions.  Yeah, I think, look, it's not going to go away.  But it's important to be aware of it.  And that's just to kind of unconsciously say, oh, yeah, let's get it.  I wish, honestly, I really wish, you know what?  My battery never dies on my wired headphones.  I wish they never will.  It just drives me crazy that it really looks like Apple and Samsung and others.  It's just because they want to sell Bluetooth headphones.

Transcript:  Because here's the thing, like AirPods are good enough and some of the Bluetooth stuff,  even though there are those frustrations that I totally agree with the convenience for a lot of us,  we would still use like I would still use AirPods.  I would still use, you know, like over the ear.  Like maybe I'd have them plugged in.  Maybe I wouldn't.  It would depend.  But I would probably still use wireless more often than not.  Like that's not going to be changing just because my phone has a headphone jack on it.  Like if you are, in my opinion, like if you're somebody who's choosing to spend $200  on a pair of AirPods, it's because you appreciate that convenience.  Not so much because like that's the only way you can connect them into your phone.  Except that it is.  You have to buy some sort of Bluetooth.  Or use the stupid wired headphones that come in the box.  But like, you know, that have the lightning connector.  I'm just saying like $200.  Do you think anybody does that?  Yeah.  Last year it became like a trend to be.  It was like an aesthetic thing where there were a number of like very big fashion influencers  who were doing that.  So Georgia, you're like on trend actually.  Yeah.  It's kind of like a weird throwback to, you know, like 2000s, you know, like aesthetic.  I don't know.

Transcript:  So MoFi, M-O-F-I, is a company that's been around for decades.  They're actually up our way in Sebastopol.  And their claim to fame was they're selling vinyl records that are  mastered from the original digital, non-digital analog masters of classics.  Asia from Steely Dan, or even Thriller, which was mastered to tape.  And they were selling it this way for a long time until a record store owner,  Phoenix Record Shop owner, said, according to pretty reliable sources,  MoFi, Mobile Fidelity, has been using digital files instead to create these vinyl records.  They are not analog masters.  And then a number of people spoke up and said, you know, that makes sense,  because if they're making these vinyl records from analog masters,  they have to keep rewinding the tape and playing it, rewinding the tape.  Nobody's going to allow them to do that.  So in fact, it's now come out, engineers, MoFi didn't want to admit it,  but engineers from MoFi have started to say, yeah, we started using digital stream.  It's called Direct Stream Digital Technology.  In 2011, on a release of Tony Bennett's I Left My Heart in San Francisco,  and by the end of 2011, 60% of their vinyl releases used digital sources.  You're laughing because of the hipsters.  I am laughing.

I bought all of the variations of Taylor Swift's folklore album on vinyl,  all seven versions, right?  I've got them all.  So I'm laughing at myself in terms of this too,  because I had looked at maybe getting the Thriller album that they have up for pre-order,  which is like $100, which they're claiming came from the analog master.  I was like, oh, well, maybe that would be really cool.  Now I'm like, you absolute idiot, because they're just sourcing it from a digital master.  And they can say, oh, well, it sounds this good and whatnot.  Okay, well, no, this is just more proof that people who buy into audiophile stuff,  which again, I'm absolutely one of these people,  we're basically flushing money down the toilet for minute things that we claim,  differences we claim we can hear that we absolutely cannot hear  for the aesthetic and for other things.  So I love this.  It's also hilarious that the initial response from the community  was to attack this record store guy and be like, you're wrong, you're wrong.  And then like the company admits it and it's like, oh, yeah, sorry, are bad.

But I prefer the experience, even though it's much easier to read it on my phone,  where I don't have to like have a light and can't see the letters because the light's  not bright enough.

I want to hold her hand as a there.  It's not about the sound quality.  That sounded like crap.  But there is an aesthetic to taking an album out of the sleeve.  They've got the liner notes.  There's a whole thing.  You clean it with the dishwasher, three drops.  That's all.  And you put it on the thing.  You gently lower the needle on there.  I understand the aesthetic of it.

Start time: 5039.40
End time: 5110.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they might actually have like a better master because a lot of times the reason people  get mad about digital masters isn't because digital, there's anything wrong with it.  It's because the mastering process or the remastering has been like crunched and compressed  to the point that it sounds terrible.  And you can actually hear like, and this isn't a BS audio file thing.  You can do like A-B sampling where there have been conclusive differences where you can  take like a CD that was pressed in like 1990 and one that was pressed in 2015.  And it's the same album.  They sound very different because of the way the mastering process works.  So it's possible that they still do a superior job with mastering and that they still have  a better source material they're doing from this vinyl.  But since a big part of their, you know, like whole thing has been like, oh, we're coming  from like directly from the analog, which is especially with the fact that like vinyl  plants are almost impossible for people to even get time on.  Like things are backlogged so much that the additional time that you're adding to that  would be untenable to do, especially to do like a large batch thing, like the thriller  album where they said they do 40,000 copies.  Like they, there's no way.

So yeah, I mean, I think that some of it is probably much to do about nothing, but it  is funny to see people who are still trying to convince themselves that it's better.  That said, like they also sell, I wasn't aware of this.  They sell super audio CDs.  I'm super excited to see that the SACD market is coming back a little bit.  Is it?

They had a very, it's famous, a very famous theater in there with really good rebel speakers.  I mean, just a really nice setup.  And he played an AB comparison for me between it.  Now it was admittedly with Steely Dan.  It was not a very complex piece of music, but between an analog and a digital, I think  it was an even MP3 recording.  Might have been an AC.  But remember, Dolby was very much into these digital compression technologies and it was  indistinguishable.  But, and then I've also had people say, now listen carefully and you can hear, you know,  there's some loss of fidelity in like the symbol here.  And if they teach you and tell you what to listen to, you can kind of tell an MP3, especially  a 128 kilobit MP3 isn't as good as say, you know, a lossless version of the CD.

So if you go to like the R slash vinyl, like separate it and stuff, you have a lot of people  who were wanting to get turntables and other things.  And then one of the first questions they ask is, okay, so how do I listen to this with  Bluetooth? How do I connect this to my sonos?  How do I do other stuff?  No, no.  And you can do it.  Like I do actually have my turntable connected to my sonos.  But I'm, I'm primarily when I want to listen to vinyl, I have like my very expensive,  like headphones plugged in directly to my amp, plugged into my turntable.  And that's how I'm enjoying the experience.  But it is very funny that people will want to, on the one hand, take on the aesthetic,  but on the other hand, immediately want to be able to listen to it wirelessly.  And it's like, okay, you do understand what you've just done here.  You've just completely given up the entire thing.  Like I get it.  It's nice to be able to drop a needle on something and do that.  But anything you want to try to claim about like audio fidelity is completely out the  window as soon as you are using an analog to digital converter.  Bluetooth is so compressed.  Bluetooth, but even just doing an analog to digital converter.  Because in that case, in most cases you're taking, okay, something that was digital  became analog.  Now it's becoming digital again.  Like, come on.

Transcript:  See, we're okay.  Don't mind that.  Speaking of gadget graveyards, Epson, a little bit of hot water here.  This is from the Fight to Repair Substack Newsletter, citing danger of ink spills.  Epson programs end of life for some printers.  We've seen this with other printer companies where the printer just stops working.  In this case, and it's particularly the L Series Epson printers, which are not the cheap ones.  They're not the cheap inkjet printers.  There is an ink pad in there, which Epson describes as a porous pad in the printer  that collects, distributes, and very importantly, contains the ink that is not used on printed  pages.  Over time, these pads wear out and there's actually a counter built into your printer.  And when that counter reaches a certain number of print jobs, your printer will just stop working.  It just won't print anymore and you got to buy a new one or maybe you can recycle it or get  Epson to replace the pad.  It turns out the pad replacement, a number of people have done it themselves, is very simple,  very inexpensive.  Epson doesn't sell those pads.  But the reason Epson says that they disable the printers once those pads are full of ink,  this is the quote, the printers are designed to stop operating at a point where further use  without replacing the ink pads could create risks of property damage from ink spills  or safety issues related to excess ink contacting an electrical component.

Transcript:  You got to wonder, is this really to protect people from ink spills or is it really to make  a little extra money on a printer because you've been keeping it in service too long?  This came up when a lecturer at University of New Haven in Connecticut,  Mark Tavern, tweeted, my wife's very expensive Epson printer just gave a message saying it  had reached the end of its service life and proceeded to brick itself.  Apparently she can pay to service it or buy a new one even though it was working fine.  Outrageous.  This 4500 likes, 800 retweets.

If not already, it's just one of these ridiculous things where you buy something,  you're supposed to own it, and if it happens, the battery dies because the battery actually dies.  I'm already a little bit salty about that.  But to have some arbitrary idea that we're going to protect you from  ink damage because that would be so horrible.  If anyone's ever changed ink on a printer knows that they really don't care about  ink damaging anything and everything in the print.

Of course then you have to hack the printer to say,  hey, new foam pads in there, new ink pads in there.  So you can do it yourself.  Epson doesn't really want you to do it through them or do it yourself.  They want you to buy a new printer.

Transcript:  Epson userway.org.  I'm talking about making your website ADA compliant, accessible.  Not only is it the right thing to do because you're opening up your website to a much larger group,  60 million plus people.  You have a responsibility to make your site accessible.  It's a public entity.  So you got to make it accessible.  And with user way, it's easy.  That was my biggest concern was, oh, I can't afford it or it's going to be too hard.  No, user way is really affordable.  And it's really easy and incredible.  It's AI powered.  It tirelessly enforces all the accessibility guidelines, the WCAG WCAG guidelines.  And I love this.  So to our engineers, it's one line of JavaScript.  That's it because user way is so good.  It's used by more than a million websites, including the big guys, Coca-Cola, Disney, eBay.  These are companies that really have to be accessible.  And user way can do that as you get bigger.  They scale with you.  If they can handle Disney, absolutely they can handle you.  They make best in class enterprise level accessibility tools available to you,  your small or medium sized business.  And then as you scale, you need user way and you're ready.  It just makes business sense.  Some of the biggest problems, nav menus, very difficult.  So the way this works, if you're blind or you're using accessibility tools,  there is what they call an accessibility layer.  That's what the screen reader sees.  So really what user way does is make sure that all the information available to the front page,  to the sighted user is available to the browser in the accessibility layer.  It changes colors.  Now you've got your Pantone color for your business.  Of course we do too.  It doesn't change that, but it adjusts hue and luminance.  So it's easier for people with vision issues to read.  So user way will generate alt tags.  That's one of the reasons it needs AI.  It can actually see the picture and generate an alt tag that matches the picture automatically.  You can go in if you want, you can modify it.  Of course it fixes violations like vague links, fixes broken links,  make sure that your website uses accessible colors.  And you'll get a detailed report of all the violations that were fixed on your website.  So you know exactly what it did.  Plus you can work with it.  User way integrates seamlessly with your site builder software.  Let user way help your business meet its compliance goals,  improve the experience for your users.  User way can make any website fully accessible, ADA compliant,  and everyone who visits can browse seamlessly, customize it to fit their needs.  It's a great way to show your brand's commitment to the millions of people with disabilities.  It's the right thing to do.  User way, it can make any website fully accessible and ADA compliant  with user way everyone who visits your site can browse seamlessly,  customize it to fit their needs.  We've got it on our website.  Go to twit.tv, go to the lower right there,  click that accessibility symbol.  You'll see all the things it does with one line of code to our website.  And you know what I really appreciate?  It's a great way to showcase your brand's commitment  to millions of people with disabilities.  You wouldn't want to lock them out of your site.  Of course not.  Go to userway.org slash twit and you'll get 30% off user ways AI powered accessibility solution.  Just book a short call, get their accessibility guide.  They're there for you.  We had a fun week this week and I think Benito has a little movie to show us showing us why.  You know what?  The chip business is in a big turmoil right now.

Transcript:  Yeah, it was.  That's how long ago that was.  As you may know, there's concern about quantum computing and encryption,  particularly encryption keys.  And so the National Institutes for Standards and Time has set up a competition to come up with  new public key crypto that will survive quantum computing.  There are four contenders.  Well, there were four contenders.  One of them is now out of the running and it only took a single core PC and an hour to do it.  This article from Dan Gooden and ours, Technica, leave it to mathematicians to muck up what  looked like an impressive new algorithm.  One of the reasons they have these competitions though is to come up with these  improved crypto techniques and then let people bang on it to make sure it really, really will work.  The new attack breaks the algorithm called SIKE.  S-I-K-E.  This is one of the four replacement algorithms that NIST says need new testing.  The attack has no impact on the other four algorithms selected by NIST  as approved standards.  So we have four that are approved and then four they thought were interesting,  but let's test them.  Well, SIKE is out.  Super Singular Isogeny Key Encapsulation.  Researchers from the Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography Group at KU Leuven  wrote a paper called Efficient Key Recovery Tech.  Used complex mathematics in a single traditional PC to recover the encryption keys in an hour.  By the way, they are now eligible for a $50,000 reward from Microsoft.  Nice work if you can get it.  But I think we are coming along with post-quantum computing.  Now if we could just invent some post-quantum computing computers.  None of them are really that impressive yet.  Pearson wants to make a little more money on its textbooks which are already really expensive.  Pearson, which is I think the world's largest textbook publisher and my former publisher,  and my former publisher I might add, has decided here's what we do.  We sell our book for $100, but we'll also include with that an NFT so that we can  recapture some of the resales in the used book market.  CEO of Pearson, Andy Byrd, says in the analog world of Pearson textbook where it's resold  up to seven times and we could only participate in the first sale.  Oh, the move to digital helps diminish the secondary market and technology like blockchain  and NFTs allows us to participate in every sale of that particular item as it goes through its life.

It's so very greedy when, and these are students, like it's just like no thought at all or care  about what happens like we want to educate society and I think education should be free  and then we suddenly start to gouge students like just oh you can't get behind when they're  just trying to like even reselling of textbooks was really expensive for students to be able to  deal with.  They didn't make a piece of it so now oh poor them.  The world's smallest violin crashed and burned.  I'm sorry, nothing.  Nothing for me.

End time: 6373.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I was talking about this on my podcast Rocket and I did actually think of the only  possible good thing that could come from this.  If they decide to put this on the blockchain or whatever under some sort of DRM, that DRM will  be cracked instantly in which case we could then just have a very easy way to right click  on all the textbooks.  So a part of me is kind of like yes please do this and lead to the destruction of your  own business because that I would be down for but yeah, I'm with you Georgia.  Like they're greedy.  The textbook market both used and new is completely predatory on so many levels.

Start time: 6374.84
End time: 6391.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know if what they did then is that well because we're going to recoup some of the  money from used book sales we will lower the cost of textbooks.  Okay, maybe but the textbooks are $100, $200 because you know oh it costs us so much to  create so we have to charge you this money.

Start time: 6392.62
End time: 6403.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But and then and then if there are too many of them in circulation they will issue a very  small update that then becomes a new addition that then your professors require you to get.  Yeah, because they've always hated this resale market.

Start time: 6405.18
End time: 6447.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was going to say so they do everything they can to suppress the used market and to be  clear the universities like the official bookstores and even like the unofficial ones like  they're predatory as I'll get out to and the way that they handle used bookstore sales  where they'll give you $20 for a book that they then sell for 85 right.  The whole system is a scam but you're exactly right.  They do everything they can to get away from the used book market and they can't partake  in those sales because of the first sale doctrine.  So they're like yes we'll just find a way to avoid that here and then to make updates  you know incrementally.  Yeah, like I said the only good thing about this would be that they would have terrible  DRM.  We know it would be cracked and then we could you know like right click and share with everyone.

Start time: 6448.06
End time: 6469.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the unintended consequence of this.  When you start to lock staff down like this professors start Xeroxing textbooks.  People start to crack the DRM.  That's always that's DRM drives me crazy because it never stops pirates ever.  No.  Pirates just go right around it.  It stops normal users.  It's just sad.

Duck Duck Go has finally has changed their tune.  You may remember they got a lot of trouble because they claimed their deal with Microsoft  for the Bing search engine required their privacy browser to allow Microsoft trackers  through after an uproar.  Duck Duck Go now says their privacy protection will apply to Microsoft scripts as well.  Except it's not quite 100 percent 100 percent.  VP of communications for Duck Duck Go told The Verge that most Microsoft scripts were  already being blocked by the browser's other protections.  Camille Bazbaz said we ran a test to see how much more blocking is happening as a result  of this update.  Based on the top 1000 websites the increase is only 0.25 percent.  But it won't block scripts for bat.bing.com  which is a script used on advertiser sites to measure effectiveness.  So I think that some permanent reputation damage because Duck Duck Go kind of didn't  mention this exemption for Microsoft scripts.

Transcript:  Yeah and the flip is actually kind of it's actually the more popular one I think because  it's nice and small and you can everything people love that clamshell kind of style and  you can fit in your pocket really easily the fold the thing about the fold is that  it looks beautiful when you open it it's like a nice big tablet but then when it's closed  the screen is really thin and awkward and so I think that's something that Samsung has to figure  out and that's something that we're hoping if there is you know the next iteration of it that  we kind of figure out a better use case for that but the flip is really popular and it's really  cute and snazzy but you know the thing with these phones also is that if they want people to you  know buy into them more they're going to have to get the basics down like okay cool we have a  foldable phone foldable screen that's really cool but battery life isn't great the cameras are okay  but they're not great there's design issues and so I think you know once they really get that down  maybe we'll see more people kind of out in the wild with foldable and flippable phones.

Transcript:  of go away merge with Discovery Plus next summer yeah um so there was a lot of uncertainty around  what was going to happen without there was a rumor that basically they were going to get rid of the  whole thing now it seems like based on the earnings call I literally listened to and was a very  interesting earnings call I have to say first one under Warner Brothers Discovery David Zaslov  and some of the other execs gave things there's going to be a new service they don't know the  name of it yet but it's going to basically combine everything that's in HBO Max and everything that's  in Discovery Plus but they admitted and I appreciated this that like both apps kind of suck  and they have to have to make one app that sucks twice as well well I mean I think that this is  actually this is where I'm a complete nerd on a level that some of the audience will appreciate  I started thinking about like the technological like the like the requirements of how you would  actually design an app like this that's combining the things from the different services and what  like you know like how you would do this as a greenfield app to kind of build a new streaming  thing with all these disparate um you know service points that actually was kind of exciting to me  but yeah in theory maybe they'll actually get it right and they'll have like a strong you know  technical back end so that when you watch Euphoria the app doesn't crash but that remains to be  determined but uh they are making some changes in terms of what types of content different brands  will have and it seems like you know the reality tv stuff is all going to be under Discovery and  building off of that and uh they're not going to be doing the day-and-date streaming of films  both in theaters and online anymore which they already said that was very controversial both

Start time: 7356.90
End time: 7409.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  work um and and i think that at this point it's probably not wrong to say if you're going to do  theatrical you need to be pure theatrical if you have shorter windows you know if you have 45 days  or whatever that's better and i think that gets you to a service faster and i think for a lot of  people that's a good um compromise versus like what the old window used to be but you know um  the the reality is for and i think this is for worse but the only films that really succeed in  the theater are these big like tent pole films and so smaller films could go directly to streaming  and that's okay but you do then you have the circumstance which got the most controversy  which is you know Batgirl which was done with principal photography it was in the editing  stages it had already been screened um in front of test audiences and it's cancelled it's not  going anywhere they are refusing to invest even one more cent in it they spent 90 million dollars

Start time: 7409.28
End time: 7419.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  on it yeah uh is you think it was because it was a terrible movie or do you think they decided that  they couldn't make money on it that spending another 100 million to market it would be i think

Start time: 7419.82
End time: 7500.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's probably both yeah i think it so so i mean there was a there was some good kind of intel  that was coming in that you know there were tax reasons to do this they have until the middle of  august to get certain tax write-offs based on the previous owners of warner brothers so they take a  90 million dollar loss exactly which which would be good for their tax purposes i do have to say  though i think if they thought there was a way where they could invest in another 10 or 20 million  to finish the film and sell it to foreign markets uh where where you know you could still sell it  and then release it directly to hvo max even without any um you know publicity and they could  make some of their principal back i think they would have done that but it seems like and i i'd  heard from a couple of people who would heard internally things that you know that it was just  hot garbage that is just an absolutely irredeemable film and so at that point if you're talking about  extensive reshoots which is different than just finishing the edit and adding the special effects  at a certain point you are at a subclass fallacy right you're throwing good money after bad and  maybe yeah the best decision is to just say okay you know what another another administration so  to speak made these decisions we didn't agree to it we wouldn't have greenlit this film it's not  testing well we're not going to put it out because it is bad financially but also probably because

Start time: 7505.82
End time: 7520.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  this is no no this is fairly unprecedented for a film to actually be done with principal photography  and and almost fully edited and almost exactly for it to be at this stage and then for them to  shelve it and for it to be a hundred million dollar film that is fairly unprecedented i can't

Start time: 7520.30
End time: 7531.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  think of another time it's also usually in an era where marketing is a huge i mean it's going to be  more than 90 million dollars so once it gets to that level then you really have to say is it worth

Start time: 7531.98
End time: 7631.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  spending money to market a film that's going to tank right right i mean to me my my kind of thing  and this is why my initial thought was this must really not be a good film was again if it was just  about trying to recoup some of the money which again i this is before i found about the tax  element which complicates things i was thinking okay well again like if all you had to do was  was finish the edit uh not getting reshoots into it you could sell it into certain foreign territories  where that licensing money would would bring back a lot of it and then you could just release it  straight to streaming is not without any publicity right you could do that the thing is though if  it's going to require say even like a 40 or 50 million dollar commitment at that point i think  that completely changes the financial calculus and so especially if they're getting the tax write-off  i i mean it's unfortunate to see you know a film that you know was led by like an afro-latina like  you know that that that's it's like it's bad optically for them to get rid of the film  but i haven't heard anybody coming out of the woodwork being like no this was actually a really  great script in a really great movie like no one's saying that the best everybody's saying is oh no  it's not as bad as you thought that's that's pretty bad which which is kind of damning with  faint phrase right like you know so i don't know but it is fairly unprecedented which is why  i think a lot of us were shocked because usually like you see it with television pilots you might  see you know films going you know shelve or go direct to dvd but usually not hundred million  dollar films that are part of the big franchise they did also cancel scoob holiday haunt which  yeah see see that see that makes total sense right that's the sort of thing happens all the time but

Transcript:  but that was not wait it was 95 finished i know i'm not the audience for it but the the creator  said the audience has liked it and this is kind of a no-brainer for making money because it's the  time of year that it would appear which is after halloween before christmas  all right who knows you know it's not my business it's their business they get to do whatever they  want i wonder if the merging of discovery plus and hbmx is an acknowledgement that there are  too many streaming services the people are tired of spending so much money on separate services

Start time: 7669.34

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well that's sort of been david's whole thing like this was actually one of the reasons why you know  he shut down cnn plus basically as soon as the company took over like they killed it  because they basically he'd said like very publicly that he thought that having all these  individual streamers and these individual services was a problem and that you should just have these  big omni services because discovery had tried and and he's like been public about this like they'd  tried to have many different sub streaming networks for a long time and it wasn't successful  and then they were like okay we're just going to do discovery plus what's discovery plus i don't  know what's on this so it's so it's basically everything from the various discovery channels  so like and but but that includes tlc and some of the other stuff so you see some originals all the  housewives shows all no no no no that's on peacock that's uh it more be like the 90 day fiance
