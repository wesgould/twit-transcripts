End time: 279.42

It's just here in the Bay Area where everybody has AT&T iPhones that that you just can't get anything done at all.  So that's why Trey Ratcliffe has emigrated to New Zealand.

Start time: 363.22
End time: 374.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's because the climate's warm and nobody wants to be out in the day in the hot afternoon.  So you go to bed in the afternoon, you get up, you finish your work and then you start.  The evening begins at eight or nine.

Transcript:  For some reason, Trey Ratcliffe, I get the feeling that you get up at dawn and milk the sheep or whatever it is you do.  No, that's not milking.

Start time: 400.72
End time: 419.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She told me she was milking it.  There's this expression where you say, no, no, I was just helping the sheep over the fence.  Are you in sheep country?  I am a sheep country, but I do get up every day and I chop wood.  I chop my own wood with an axe.  Do you really lumberjack?  I might do some Instagram topless photos sometime.

Start time: 419.70
End time: 422.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that's another.

Start time: 426.64
End time: 469.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is Queenstown for a reason.  All right.  Now, let's begin the enough, enough silly, bad single entendre.  Ryan said he's getting ready for the event.  The invitations went out as true to form.  Apple waited till one week before the event to say that they are having event.  Long rumored as September 12th, this Wednesday at Urbibuena Center.  There's the invitation.  It's got a big 12 on it for the September 12th.  But the shadow, its casting is a five.  Which is interesting because it is not the fifth iPhone.  It's the sixth iPhone rumored to be called the iPhone five.  What do you think, Ryan?  Is it?  Yeah, it'll be called the iPhone five.  I guess so.  Now that we've seen the number.

Start time: 469.44
End time: 493.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the, the, the, you know, the four S was not the fourth.  Right.  It was the fifth.  I mean, who cares?  It's the five is what comes after four or is what's out now.  Five will be with.  I mean, I think, I think when, when that invite went out and everybody really started, you know, getting, I think, pretty irritated on Twitter that, that it might be called the iPhone five.  I mean, who cares?  Who cares?

Start time: 494.78
End time: 496.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they won't just call it the new iPhone.

Start time: 497.07
End time: 502.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I doubt it.  They wouldn't put the five in there.  They wouldn't put the five in there if they were going to call it the new iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sure.  Macrumors.com app.  They have a countdown.  Two days, 18 hours, 45 minutes.  And this perhaps the most bizarre article I've ever read.  Aren't Kim?  He's talking about this is the, the staging of Urbana Gardens.  This Urbana Center where they'll do the event.  Apple's already hung rainbow curtains on either side of the Apple.  If you do a little photo processing and squish it down.  Apparently I find this so bizarre.  According to Rooster Nugget and others in the Macrumors forum, you can see icons.  Is that ridiculous?

Start time: 541.42
End time: 542.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody did that.

Start time: 543.00
End time: 549.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody ridiculous because, because the basically it predicts that the iPhone will have icons.  Well, it's an extra row.

Start time: 549.52
End time: 578.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The icons are stretched.  Okay, let's I'll give you the semiotics BS or not.  You can see the game center icons upside down that I don't understand.  That's why that you see iTunes.  You see a music icon.  We don't know what the blue one in the middle.  They think it might be the stock icon.  Then there's a mystery green blue icon.  Pandora.  It's their Pandora.  Yeah, that's the rumor that Apple might be doing a music radio.  Yes.  Maybe that's what that is.

Start time: 578.48
End time: 581.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, if they had lost the Samsung suit, we might see totally different icons.

Start time: 584.19
End time: 591.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, this is this is taking this way too far, but it just shows you how heated the rumor mill gets the day before the Apple event.

Start time: 591.54
End time: 660.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think what's interesting about this particular season of rumors is that all of the information we all feel like we know what this can look like.  We've seen the cases coming out of China.  We've seen videos of this thing.  It's it's the same width.  It's longer.  It has a doesn't have glass on the back.  We know a lot about the shape and the case.  And we really there are certain things we don't know anything about.  For example, we don't know is this thing going to have NFC and a huge play for some kind of Google Wallet competitor.  There's also speculation that it could have fingerprint fingerprint reader in the button.  Apple.  That's just cool.  Yeah, that's cuckoo.  But but if you think about the logic of a big when they do do a big play for a digital wallet, it will probably have some kind of biometric component to it.  And they did buy Authentic in an awful big hurry for an awfully big price.  And so that how long ago was that?  May, I think.  They started it.  But I mean, they went in authentic authentic makes fingerprint readers.

Start time: 660.50
End time: 662.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They make fingerprint readers, NFC stuff.

Start time: 664.41
End time: 704.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They make all kinds of digital encryption things.  But the speculation is that there's particularly interested in the in the in the fingerprint readers.  But Apple approached them in a very unusual way.  Usually they make very small acquisitions if they do make acquisitions.  And usually they kind of hardball and get a low price on stuff.  Apple went in there and said, we're going to give you way more than your company's worth.  We don't want you having anybody else bidding on this.  No counter bids.  It's take it or leave it.  And we were really in a hurry.  So so so make up your mind.  And it was a really an unusual acquisition that was characterized by a great deal of haste,  which kind of makes you think, well, they're they're really trying to get something into products at the end of the year.  So, Mike, you know, I don't know about that.

Start time: 706.42
End time: 760.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think part of it for Apple is they they like to do acquisitions quickly because I don't think that they like to get into bidding wars.  And it's also a lot harder to keep it secret who they're trying to acquire if the talks get long and drawn out.  It kind of reminds me of the Anabit acquisition they did.  I think it was earlier this year.  Maybe it was last year. I can't remember.  But it was a half billion dollars.  It kind of came out of nowhere.  Nobody had heard about it.  Nobody really knew who Anabit was.  And it was just done.  And, you know, it was kind of over.  I think the timeline for getting their technology for forgetting the technology into an iPhone is still too early.  They couldn't make that happen in just a few months.  You know, these products get designed a couple of years out.  I mean, it's possible.  I think that it would maybe be if they were going to have something in there with finger print reading to be their next gen or maybe the gen after that.

Start time: 761.66
End time: 810.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're probably right.  Every time you think that Apple is going to be extremely aggressive about something like this, it turns out that they're not they're not.  You know, they're very conservative and they're very slow with it.  However, you know, I think I think it's interesting that they that they paid such an enormous price.  I think it was one of the biggest things they've ever paid.  And there's also a lot of movement in the digital wallet stuff.  So I think it's it's a it is a it is a long shot.  But but it is an interesting development and a very uncharacteristic one for Apple.  And so we'll see.  We'll see what's going to come out of it.  But but it's an example of the kinds of things that we just have no idea about, despite our feeling of familiarity with this iPhone.

Start time: 811.86
End time: 828.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Apple paid what seems like a ludicrously small amount, even though it's the largest acquisition Apple's ever made.  But in like things like Facebook buying Instagram for a billion, three hundred sixty five million seems like chump change.  That's that's that's not the largest one they've ever made.  It says, according to a Guardian, it's the.

Start time: 829.62
End time: 846.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, they they bought they bought and a bit for five hundred million.  They bought Next, I think, for six hundred million or seven hundred million.  So, I mean, it's it's a big one.  It's clearly it's clearly not for Apple.  It's big. Yeah, it's you know, they don't they don't buy a lot of companies.  They're not a company known for acquiring.

Start time: 846.42
End time: 857.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I should point out that the sale doesn't close until after the twenty first.  So it's not possible, in fact, that they'd be well, maybe it is.  I don't know. But it just they could still be licensing the tech.

Start time: 857.42
End time: 875.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What I'm really hoping for. So since we you know, as what are we going to have?  What are we going to? Well, what I'm really hoping for, as Mike said, is, you know, we've seen so many leaks with this phone.  We've seen every component from inside.  Now, now the latest thing is it's supposedly not going to have NFC, that that thing was just a speaker that a lot of people were speculating was going to be an NFC.

Start time: 876.66
End time: 880.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The thinking is that a metal back would make it impossible for it to be NFC.

Start time: 881.00
End time: 905.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe. I mean, you could do the front or, you know, you could do the antenna because supposedly there's the the plastic,  you know, antenna port up at the top. Here's my hope.  My hope is that this whole thing has been a masterfully played ruse on the part of Apple and that the phone that they're going to unveil looks absolutely nothing like what we've been seeing.  I doubt that will be the case, but I would love if they did that.  If they pulled the wool over everybody's eyes like that, that'd be amazing.

Start time: 906.10
End time: 918.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, in fact, they have to there has to be some wool somewhere over somebody's eyes, because if this thing is just another phone running IOS six and it's just longer  than this will be the worst Apple announcement in history.

Start time: 919.32
End time: 930.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but remember, Mike, we thought that with the iPhone 4S, this was such an incremental and, you know, I was among others saying, oh, this is sad and all the punnets are disappointed.  And of course, it's the best selling iPhone.

Start time: 930.62
End time: 932.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they really bumped up the camera in that one. That was a big.

Start time: 932.60
End time: 935.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they added Siri. I mean, Siri was or was that one the four?

Start time: 936.16
End time: 937.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, Siri. No, that's the essence.

Start time: 939.06
End time: 946.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so they threw like something in there that was huge.  And so far, there's not a lot of rumors about anything really significant.

Start time: 947.06
End time: 955.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  An extra row of icons is not huge, especially since the rest of the world's already doing for rich and more supposedly this will have LTE.

Start time: 955.64
End time: 957.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know about that. I'm still a little skeptical about the LTE.

Start time: 957.84
End time: 967.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really? Don't they have to have LTE?  Doesn't that? No, no, not necessarily.  Does that not hurt them?  I mean, even Verizon has said we're not going to sell gadgets that don't have LTE anymore.

Start time: 967.88
End time: 973.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure Verizon's going to stop selling the iPhone.  Positive that they're going to do that.

Start time: 973.52
End time: 984.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, if Apple doesn't put LTE in it, they don't put NFC in it.  It's almost to me, it's almost Apple saying, hey, we don't really care.  We know you'll buy it no matter what we do.

Start time: 985.72
End time: 989.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But isn't that is not the case? Oh, we don't care.

Start time: 991.42
End time: 1016.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We don't care. We don't have to wear Apple because I mean, there is a lot of competition now with Apple.  I mean, the Galaxy Note 2 was announced last week by Samsung.  We're seeing and we'll talk about all of these new Nokia phones, Windows 8 phones that look pretty interesting.  I'm not going to say that the new Razr from Motorola is that exciting.  But, you know, and of course, we're waiting to see what HTC is going to do after the Apple announcement.  It's gotten very competitive.

Start time: 1016.42
End time: 1025.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Android OS gets better and better and better incrementally.  I think Jelly Bean has reached parity.  The maps are so good on Android and that has a long way to go on Apple.

Start time: 1025.62
End time: 1038.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Apple's dumping the maps.  You've hit it on the head.  The thing that's really exciting about all this competition, besides the larger screens, it's software.  So we really don't know what Apple's going to announce along.  Yes, we do because we've seen iOS 6.

Start time: 1039.42
End time: 1041.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We've seen apps like the podcasting app.

Start time: 1045.00
End time: 1055.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've seen iOS 6, but we don't know what kind of sort of you know, that is separate from application software that could go in there.  I mean, we've seen passcode and things like that.  We haven't seen the apps.

Start time: 1055.87
End time: 1057.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're right.  It could be apps.

Start time: 1057.74
End time: 1063.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they could throw in some crazy good apps.  You know, go ahead, Ryan.

Start time: 1063.58
End time: 1101.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Apple also likes to sneak in stuff at the last minute for a new phone launch as they did this before.  You know, Siri.  When when iOS 5 was announced last year, WWDC, you know, there were betas in people's hands.  Everybody had it.  And then they announced the 4S later that year.  Exact same pattern as this, where they announced the 4S running the new OS.  And when they announced that, they also announced the ship date for iOS 5.  And oh, there's Siri inside, right?  This feature that nobody had seen in any of the betas.  So they, you know, they like to slip pretty cool stuff in there.  I wouldn't assume that just because we've all seen iOS 6 that that is what is going to be the launching feature set.

Start time: 1102.68
End time: 1131.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, a tip of the hat to Jason Calacanis, who tweets he's listening right now over AirPlay in his Tesla Model S.  OK, that's a little bit a little bit of geek cred there.  Yeah.  Somebody in the chat room said, and I think this is probably accurate, that no one knows what NFC is.  So not having NFC is not going to be a minus.  But from my point of view, I would love to see Apple jumpstart NFC by putting it in iPhones.  Wouldn't we?

If Apple is going to do it, they'd have to go real big on it.  And you better believe that if they were going to commit to it, it would be something that you get in, you know, nationwide retailers.  Not not at the scale of Google Wallet right now, which is actually pretty small still.

Transcript:  No, I can pay at Pizza Coffee.  And that's it.  That's all you need.  In fact, there are more people in town that use Square and pay with Square than use NFC.  I just I think I would like to see the NFC jumpstart because I think the idea of tapping your phone, maybe it's just me against a little pay point and paying by entering a pin is a great thing.  It's cool. That's that's the way things.  It's just probably will go cool or is it valuable and convenient?  It's both because that's cool is not is enough for us.  It's not enough for them.

Transcript:  Well, if Apple wants to do it, they'll have to do it the same way they did with HTML5 and just say, look, this is the future.  And they kind of did change a whole sub industry by making that pronouncement.  Now Flash is really effectively dead.  And they could do the same thing with NFC if they say this is the standard.

Start time: 1221.58
End time: 1262.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the other interesting thing about NFC is that unlike all of Apple's competitors, Apple has the credit card of every single customer.  They're kind of like Amazon in that respect.  I mean, Google, you talk about the number of users that use Google.  Huge number of of of activations every day that they brag about.  Most of those in China, they're all over the world.  And even in the US, most of us have not given our credit card to Google.  So so getting Google Wallet off the ground is very difficult for Apple.  They just throw a switch.  There was even some speculation that they would use Bluetooth 4.0 instead of NFC.  But they just have to throw a switch and they've already got people signed up with credit cards and ready to roll.

Transcript:  The way that Google Wallet's implemented, you enter a four digit pin, right?  I think it's a four digit pin.  I've never used it.  I don't know.  Well, let's get the Apple stuff out of the way and then we'll go.  I really want to talk about Amazon's announcements.  Ryan, do you want to make predictions?  Do you think you mean is there some secret sauce?  And if there is, what do you think?

Start time: 1303.94

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I think I think you should be prepared for a very straightforward announcement.  I doubt there will be NFC.  I'm still a little bit skeptical on the LTE, mostly because the chipsets just chew up so much power.  I'm not saying it's not going to happen.  It could very well happen.  It's just LTE right now is still a little bit immature on the chipset side.  They burn off a lot of juice.  And as we know, Apple is obsessed with managing the power usage in their phones.  And if this phone that we've seen leaked does have the battery that we've seen leaked, it's only going to be just a shred more battery capacity than we have now.  So a really power hungry LTE chipset could could really blow up in their face in terms of battery use.  So I'm a little skeptical on that one.  We'll have to see.  Yeah, otherwise, I think it'll probably be pretty straightforward release.  1136 by 64 inches tall.

But they'll probably take out YouTube.  You know, it's interesting.  We'll get to this, but the Kindle Fire uses Bing.  No YouTube, but there'll be in both cases, Google will offer a maps in a YouTube app you could download.  Apple will replace those.  Siri, maybe some big improvements with Siri.

Transcript:  I personally think one of the coolest things they're going to announce is a new nano.  I think they're going to really go aggressive and turning the nano into a wristwatch.  I think they could add Bluetooth to it, making it an iCloud device, enabling you to control, you know,  you know, I TV and Apple TV and stuff like that with the nano with the nano.  Well, who knows?  Bluetooth could enable all kinds of things.  Playing music from the nano out through a speaker would enable you to interact with your iPhone,  look at your watch to see who's calling, to see texts and stuff like that.  Talk to Siri when your wrist like Dick Tracy.  I think there's a lot of cool things they could do if they really went aggressive,  turning the nano into a better wristwatch, making it the form.  Right now it's a clean, you know, they have wristbands you can buy, but they're bulky and clunky.  They make it small and thin.  You could buy an Apple wristwatch.  Maybe even glass. Absolutely.

I thought maybe we had some confirmation here.  I thought this was unlikely. You know, John Gruber, John Pachowski and all things D,  the laconic Jim Dalrymple in the loop all think that there'll be an iPhone announcement  and then later an iPad mini announcement in October.  Mark Gurman in the nine to five Max says, Nope, we're going to get new iPods, new touches, new nanos,  tweaked shuffle Wednesday. You think that's true, Ryan?

Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's definitely possible.  They're not going to do three events.  And traditionally they've done one fall event where they launch all the stuff  that is going to go out over the holidays for people to, you know, buy up in droves.  And either look, either they're going to launch the iPods on Wednesday with the iPhone  or they're going to launch it at a at an iPad event in October.  I will say if they don't launch any iPods this Wednesday, then that is an absolute tell.  Right. They're going to have another event. Right. With an iPad mini.

In a move that could shake up the growing field of Internet radio,  Apple plans to develop a service to compete with Pandora.  Sending streams of music customized as the user's taste.  Three people briefed on the plan said late Thursday.  Interesting. Pandora stock tumbled when this came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why would Apple do radio?  Spotify does it. Mog does it.  RDO does it. It's a path to revenues. It's a path to more music.  Is it a path to revenues? I mean, Pandora spends as much as 60 percent of its revenue  sends it to the music industry.  Of course that means they keep 40 percent.  It also requires, as this article points out, a lot of feet on the ground.  You have to have the ad sales for Pandora. A lot of local sales. It's like almost a Groupon model.

Start time: 1597.42
End time: 1622.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think Apple wants ad sales. I'm not sure they're interested in that.  I think that if they were going to do it, they would do it as a kind of a premium service for iCloud users.  Something to encourage the iTunes in the cloud functionality that they've been pushing.  A compliment for Match maybe.  Yeah, that's $25 a year. So maybe if you sign up for Match, you also get the ability to stream customized music based on what's in your Match library.

Transcript:  Apple's plans first reported by the Journal on Thursday evening.  The Times says Apple's service did not seem to be imminent given how long it takes to negotiate labels.  So don't expect an announcement on Wednesday. It could be months away, according to the Times.  I'm sorry. Go ahead.

Start time: 1638.50
End time: 1716.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the most likely scenario is unlike Pandora, which basically doesn't even care what you own.  Just plays. You pick a radio and create a radio station and it brings you all these songs.  I think Apple could integrate listening to using the Genius feature and stuff to listen to your own music that you own.  Throwing in a minority of the songs being related to that or based on what you already own and what you like to listen to as a way of discovery.  Because Ping, if you recall, Ping was supposed to be a way for people to discover music and nobody uses it.  So right now there's, how does Apple facilitate you discovering new bands, new music?  I mean, they really, other than browsing their store visually, it's really not a good way to do it.  Whereas a semi Pandora type thing that occasionally threw in a song you didn't own.  And again, the secret sauce here is Apple's ability to negotiate deals that Pandora can't negotiate.  And so this could be a really cool thing, but I don't think it would be a separate service like Pandora.  I just see it as a way for them to legally throw in songs that you're likely to enjoy as a way to get you to discover new music and buy more music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wonder if Apple feels threatened by the unholy triumvirate of Pandora, Spotify and Amazon.  Because at least maybe that's just me, but that's how I get my music. If I want to buy it, I'll buy it from Amazon.  If I want radio, I love Pandora. I listen to it all the time.  If I want to listen to an album that I don't want to buy, I use Spotify. I don't need iTunes. Am I unusual or is that kind of the trend?  What do you do in New Zealand? You squeeze a sheep?  I listen to Pandora, but it's only in the US, so I have to...

Start time: 1747.42
End time: 1782.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you have to fake it.  Yeah, I have to fake it to pretend like I'm here. But Pandora is great for finding music.  And I think Mike is exactly right that it could be the music publishers that could be putting pressure on Apple.  We need to increase our sales. There's no way for you to discover our music.  Currently, the only way to discover music is to laboriously go into the iTunes store and click through categories and listen to samples.  And that's no way to buy music.  And I think it's only people in the know that use Pandora and these kind of specialty services.  I don't think like the average person...  Normal people don't. Oh, I disagree.  How do they discover music? They still listen to the radio in the car.

Start time: 1782.52
End time: 1792.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's one of the things the article says is that they will be a little more liberal in their terms than Pandora.  Pandora, as you know, you can only skip a few times a day. You can't repeat a song. The Apple service person won't be able to do that.

Transcript:  What's more powerful though? Is it a customized radio service like Pandora or is it listen to any music all you can eat for X dollars a month like RDO or Spotify?  I mean, for me, I love Pandora and I still listen to it and it's a great discovery tool.  But that's not how I listen to most of my music.  Most of my music I listen to because I want to hear the full album from this artist that just came out last week.  What do you use for that? Spotify?  I use RDO.  Same thing.  I also use Spotify.  Yeah, same thing.  Six in one.  Exactly.

Start time: 1848.42
End time: 1851.34

Start time: 1851.94

Start time: 1855.82
End time: 1882.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the current iTunes, I mean, I think the iTunes model is much more easier to adapt to something that looks like Spotify or RDO than it is to something that looks like Pandora.  Pandora is a very different model and once you start bringing in ad revenue and stuff like that, it becomes totally tricky.  I think if Apple wanted to do the streaming all you can eat service that we've been talking about for so many years about them doing, they're in a great position to.  Right now, I don't think they're being threatened by Pandora. I think if anything, they're being threatened by Spotify.

If I look at my kids, yes, you bet. They watch YouTube Vivo maybe, you know. But radio is still the dominant way that people discover music according to this Nielsen report.  48% radio, tips from relatives, friends, 10% YouTube, 7%.  But teens, when you go to younger people, and that's going to be the harbinger of the future, 64% of teens listen to music on YouTube.  Followed by radio, 56%, iTunes, 53%, CDs, 50%.

We have our whole engineering and ops team at Rackspace who are watching and making sure that we're not crashing.  It's a serious business. It is really serious. And I mean, you do not. Well, maybe you do understand that the crush of traffic that comes through on Apple Keynote is just I do insane.  It breaks the Internet. I mean, it is one time at a well way back in the day when I was still, you know, the editor of a gadget and I was doing one of these things.  We actually took out an entire a well data center because of so much traffic. It crashed. And as I understood, completely physically destroyed a twenty thousand dollar layer to switch.

What we do is we watch the live blogs, Tom Merritt, Sarah Lane, I as Actar and I will be watching.  We've got Andy and not co in the event and Jason Snell from Macworld and they'll be joining us afterwards for Mac Break Weekly.  And we're doing something a little different, Ryan, because we you know, I like the idea of us carrying the stream.  And in the past, we've carried kind of pirated streams.  And there's always somebody who, I don't know, sits there with a laptop and points it at the stage.  And I feel kind of guilty rebroadcasting those pirated streams. So we've decided to do something different.  I've commissioned puppeteer Brian Hogg of Toronto. He's going to do a Tim Cook puppet.  We didn't have time to do Tim, Phil and Scott next time.  I also wanted to Statler and Waldorf, which would be me and Dvorak.  But we haven't we didn't have time for that either. But he's going to be reenacting.  So you can kind of get the feelings if you were there, reenacting the event on green screen and we'll put the images up behind him.  And I'll make sure he's reading your immortal words and will credit will credit science.

Becky Warley did it for us at the Back to the Mac event.  Unfortunately, Steve Jobs wandered by and she jumped him not physically, but she said, Mr. Jobs, Mr. Jobs, asked him a couple of questions.  She's never been invited again.  So I'm not sure I want to put anybody in that kind of harm's way.  I think puppets are really the way to do it.  So so we will also be beginning our coverage and you can watch along with us.  You know, we're going to do Trey and Trey is the master of this.  You the guy who turned me up. We're going to do a Google Hangout.  We've started doing Google Hangouts.  So what I do is I open it to my check journalist circle, which is several hundred tech journalists and whoever gets in there, those nine people become our kind of Greek chorus, if you will, Mike.  You know, as the as the event goes on, it's a good idea.  Yeah, it'll be fun. Yeah. Yeah, we've done that before and that's worked pretty well.  We're just like you, Ryan.  We are mastering this new medium, the streamless keynote.  By the way, I'm getting a lot of hate on the puppet.

And then they'll they'll realize how hard it is to do and they'll inevitably go down.  It costs too much. Is that why they don't do it?  Because I mean, yeah. Oh, yeah. Apple doesn't.  They're really lacking for money right now.  Apple, they're so cash strapped with their like, what is it like, eighty two billion dollars in the bank?

They invite people who who type whatever they want in real time.  That's not the best way to control it.  But there might be actually getting more buzz.

Right.  The second thing is that they get all the journalists to really, really pay attention to the announcement and all the fans and the public is paying attention.

Transcript:  But here's the here's the funny thing.  I've been live blogging these Apple events for I mean, it's almost coming up on 10 years.  It's been doing for a long time.  And early on, you were not allowed to do this.  If they caught you doing it, they would shut you down.  And sometimes they would throw you out.  This is this is not like they have not always been, you know, really embracing this this phenomenon.  I mean, at a certain point, they realize they couldn't stop it anymore.  And so I think they just stopped trying to.  But for a long time, many years during engaging, we would have to try to do it on the sly when we got invited because they were not into it.  They did not like people live blogging their events and they would ask us not to do it.  And of course, what do you do?  I'm there to do it.  There's no mystery about why I'm there.  Right. Like, of course, I'm going to live blog.  Like, if you don't like it, well, then I guess you shouldn't be inviting me.  And, you know, they came to their senses, but it hasn't always been this way.  They haven't always been super progressive about people covering their events.  They are, as you said, they really try to keep very tight control over their message.

Transcript:  Leo Rocks the offer code, one word, on those three items.  Also with us from the Peloponnese, where it is the middle of the night and yet the party has just begun.  Mike Elgin of Elgin.com.  And Mike, you've actually won the award.  You have both been called an Apple fanboy and an Apple hater within five minutes in the chat room.  Yes. Welcome to my world.  I figure you're doing something right.  Our show today brought to you by Citrix, the folks who do go to assist.  If you're in the IT business, if you do manage support services, go to assist is a must check out for you.  Our friend and IT guy here, Russell Tamini, is actually a contractor.  His company, Exponencia, has 800 plus clients.  800 plus companies and three people.  And he does it with.  Well, I have to say it wasn't go to assist until recently.  He was using another very expensive tool.  He says, I'm loving this go to assist.  We set him up with it.  So go to assist you've known about, I'm sure for years, it's the best known remote support choice.  But now they've added monitoring and this makes it a really useful tool.  If you're an IT professional or you want to get in the managed support business, go to assist monitoring.  You put the crawler on their client network.  It finds all the hardware, all the software, every network attached device.  So you've got a great inventory.  And now you set up your dashboard to track performance on your network, key stats, even things, simple things like hard drives getting too full or toner cartridges running out.  You get alerts, customized alerts via IMS, SMS or text message.  So you are proactively paying attention to how that network's performing.  It's how you can magically handle so many clients so efficiently.  Then you fire up the unattended support module, the live remote and boom, you fix it.  Well, obviously for toner cartridge, you probably have to come down.  This is a really fantastic tool and you could try it free, both the remote monitoring and the remote support right now.  Just go to the website, go to assist dot com.  Right in the front page there, you'll see a try it free button.  Click that blue button.  If you use the promo code, we'll get credit and you will become a support here.  I'm telling you, this thing is amazing.  We've been using it here so I don't have to come in if I have to restart servers, things like that.  It's just fantastic.  Go to assist dot com.  The offer code is twit.  Boy, Apple hasn't even had its event and we spent 45 minutes talking about it.  And yet on the sixth on Thursday, Amazon had, I think, a very interesting event.  Let's talk a little bit about the new Kindle's five new Kindle's paper white, which is an E ink technology, I guess, higher contrasts.  Paper white implies a white background.  They always had that kind of gray green background.  It's supposedly faster, better battery life.  In fact, they're still selling the least expensive Kindle.  They dropped that in price, gave it more battery life and faster page turns.  But most important, I think the new Kindle fires.  The Kindle fire seven inch, eight point nine inch and then the eight point nine inch with LTE.  Ryan, it seems to be, you know, the real question on this was how low can they go?  And these prices are very aggressive.  Yes.

Transcript:  It struck me that it's almost a new era in computing where what really drives it is not hardware, not even software so much in the sense of Microsoft Office or Microsoft Windows.  But in fact, the store, it's all about the commerce.  It's all about the ecosystem.  And Amazon is absolutely the best position.  They not just not only sell books, magazines, newspapers, movies, TV shows and music, they sell refrigerators and tires and toilet paper.  And this this device, they're going to make money on.  In fact, Jeff Bezos said he said, we don't want to make money on the device.  We want to make money after you buy the device.  Right.

Start time: 2905.56
End time: 2931.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's why their strategy is fundamentally different.  They they there's there's the store, which is what Amazon is.  And then there's the app store.  They are not a very good app store.  No.  Apple is the best app store.  But Amazon is an amazing media store and store for just about everything else.  So if you're looking for a great media experience, you know, that's what Amazon is banking on.  I mean, they're clearly not going to win on apps right now.  And I think they know it.  So they're going to try to win on price and they're going to try to win on media.

Transcript:  One thing we don't know, by the way, the seven inch comes out soon, like before the iPhone comes out.  It comes out on the 14th.  The Fire HD.  The HD seven inches.  The specs are good.  IPS.  It's 1280 by 800.  The 8.9 is even higher resolution.  1920 by 1200.  The speed is dual core, one point two gigahertz processor with a fast graphics processor.  I mean, on specs, it's funny because it almost seems like the hardware is secondary.  And yet Bezos did talk a lot about specs.  I think more to say we're at parity than anything else.  But but they must be selling this at no more than cost, right?

Start time: 2976.53
End time: 3023.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think they're making very much money on it.  I mean, I think they had to talk about the specs because with a price as low as that, right, your assumption is going to be that the specs suck.  But people, you know, people don't buy tablets based on specs anyway.  They did. Then the iPad wouldn't be, you know, wouldn't represent 70 percent of the market.  So, I mean, the specs don't really matter a ton.  I think that they're smart to, you know, get it out there that here here are what the specs are.  You know, we're not we're not two generations behind and we're certainly not in the place we were with the original Kindle Fire, which just sucked.  But, you know, they were still able to hit the price points.  I think it's going to be really about the experience, though.  And, you know, with the forked version of Android, I'm just not entirely sure that they've got enough value proposition.

Start time: 3024.01
End time: 3041.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I agree. And it's a real unknown.  I mean, the hardware looks great. The ecosystem obviously is good.  But is that software the kind?  And I think the only thing that really sucked about the Kindle Fire, the original, was the software.  It was sluggish. It didn't feel snappy. It didn't look great.  The other thing that I noticed.

Start time: 3068.64
End time: 3081.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and the other thing that's really relevant to the right side of the table is, like the original Kindle Fire, this is a U.S. product.  Although I understand they are going to sell it in the U.K.  But can Amazon even hope to compete if it's not international?

Start time: 3082.28
End time: 3096.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think international markets are going to go for these Android tablets.  Right. The Nexus 7.  Yeah, they are international. And it is a huge part of the market.  It may not be as much of the purchasing after getting the tablet activity, but the tablet itself.  Yeah.

Start time: 3101.11
End time: 3179.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's almost certain that they're losing a lot of money.  I mean, the word on the street for the original Kindle Fire was that they were losing about 50 bucks per unit and then making it up in the long term, you know, through by selling your tires and toilet paper.  But I think that this one, they're probably losing even more.  That's probably one of the reasons why they offered advertising, which you can get rid of for 15 bucks.  But I think ultimately it's a losing strategy because as the prices go down and down, OK, so now they have one at this price.  What happens when tablets are below $100 routinely, when they're below 70?  At some point, you're just going to be attracting the super cheapskates.  And those aren't the people who are going to be the big buyers on Amazon.  So I don't think this is a good long term strategy.  That's an interesting point.  Yeah, because these aren't the right customers.  Exactly. If you look at why Apple is such a rock star in terms of profits, it's because they go after the premium customer and they make money on the hardware.  They make money on the software. They make money on the content.  They make money on every part of it because the person they're attracting the most is the deep pocket, highly educated, big spender.  And if Apple, if Amazon is going to go after the cheapskates, then that works OK for now.  But in the long run, that's not going to be a good strategy.

Start time: 3179.42
End time: 3237.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Mike, I agree with everything you said, except that Apple only goes after the deep pocketed, highly spending individuals.  So we know that that's not true. It's just a slightly different.  It's a variation on that, which is they make their money upfront.  They make sure that whenever they sell something, they make money.  A lot of no huge profit margins.  There's no we're going to make money later with that. Right.  They don't make money upfront. They don't do it.  So, you know, look at the iPhone 3GS or any of the iPads since their introduction.  Those are products that are not premium products.  3GS is now the free iPhone and the iPad has always been extremely price competitive.  And now with the iPad 2 selling for three ninety nine, you know, in its class, it's still a pretty damn good deal.  Do they do a mini at two fifty?  I think so. But the difference is they will make money if they cannot make money on that iPad mini seven inch.  They will not sell it. Right.  They're not going to wait until later and hope to make it up on iTunes media and stuff like that.

Start time: 3237.42
End time: 3296.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just not how they do. And that's a direct opposite of what Jeff Bezos said.  He said we can we don't have to make money up front. We don't want to make money up front.  We want to make it long term over the.  This is that long tail, isn't it?  The long tail for Amazon is selling you products day after day on this device for the next couple of years.  And I have to say that this is a strategy that the other big players, the other four horsemen of the Internet apocalypse,  are paying attention to because you look at Google and all of a sudden the emphasis on the Play Store.  We didn't maybe understand it until now.  You look at Apple, of course, the ecosystem has always been a big part of it.  And even Microsoft is really paying attention to the idea of putting together content, music, TV, movies and books and magazines to somewhat less degree.  Games and apps.  And I think everybody's acknowledging that the hardware is going to take a backseat to content services and apps.  Right.

Start time: 3298.78
End time: 3406.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think the way to look at this is that if you look at it from Amazon's perspective, Amazon is in competition with none of these people.  They win. If that's the if that's the game, they win.  But what they're doing is they're using the means, the tablet concept to compete with all the other electronic retailers.  They're they're in it against Walmart and others who are selling things online.  And they're using tablets as an as an advantage in the same way that they use overnight shipping and some of the other things that they do.  And they are they going to you know, are they going to compete with Samsung?  Are they going to compete with Apple? They're not even thinking about those companies.  In fact, they want to sell those products through their through their Kindles.  So so they're really not even you know, they're they're not a gadget maker.  They're not in the consumer electronics industry.  They're an online retailer and tablets are basically the if you if you look at when you order something from Amazon, it comes in a box.  The box is the physical manifestation of what Amazon sells.  They look at a Kindle as a box for digital content.  That's all it is. It's they're not in the box business.  Right. They're not in the tablet business.  They're in the sell you stuff. Is that a bad strategy?  It's a great strategy because it helps them to some degree in combination with Amazon Prime and in combination with overnight shipping and all the other things they do to compete against the best buys and the Walmarts and all the other online retailers where people would alternatively buy the tires and the toilet paper and everything else.  So it's an advantage against other online retailers.  They're kind of like the the Apple of online retailers in the sense that they always they're thinking really big.  Yeah, and they're thinking really ironically, they're not thinking internationally.

Transcript:  If you look at if you look at any of Apple's unit sales charts over the years, when they start to hit that like really aggressive spike upwards that moment, you can always pin to them launching internationally.  It's just you can't you can't sell in the US only right that kind of a product and expect to, you know, be a market leader.

Start time: 3442.78
End time: 3472.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's why Amazon only made eight million dollars last quarter.  It's not a big high profit business.  But but Jeff's always been willing to take a to take a hit on near term because he's playing the long game.  And this this is a long game product, is it not?  It's not a content creation device.  And I guess that's the other question I have.  Is he saying doesn't matter?  Nobody really wants to create content.  The iPads account you can on the iPad.  You could do a lot of what you do on Lightroom.

Start time: 3473.03
End time: 3504.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you could do some of it.  I think most business professionals that create content don't really use an iPad.  We have big trucks like these maps.  But that's a small, tiny market.  Me included.  I use this for content consumption and really ninety.  So is that the market is consumption, not creation?  Ninety five percent of the world consumes the content that's made by about five percent of the world.  It's changing a little bit.  Now anyone can create content.  We see everyone creating photos.  We see people creating more and more all the time.  These are still largely content consumption devices.

Transcript:  You know, I actually if I can, I want to touch on something that you just mentioned, which is Bezos playing the long game.  I think that's a really interesting point.  And I don't think a lot of people know that or think about how Bezos operates.  And you know, he funds projects based on, you know, a 10 or 20 plus year vision for things.  But I think the interesting thing about that argument that, oh, he's playing the long game is that it's really easy to just assume that that we're kind of dumb and that he's, you know, an incredibly brilliant visionary who's looking at things 10 years out.  And, you know, therefore his current strategy, while it doesn't make sense to us mere mortals, will all be revealed in five or 10 years.  And I think the reality is that, you know, that's a tricky way of thinking because, you know, their strategy is actually not great right now.  And for many of the reasons that Mike already said, for many of the reasons we've already talked about, just because he's playing the long game and he's taking long bets doesn't mean that their strategy is good.

Transcript:  Right. Although the example is in the stock market bust where Amazon really was a dog in the 90s up to 2000 because they were investing all their proceeds into distribution facilities all over the country.  Now that gamble's paying off.  Quite an asset.  Yeah. And they survived when a lot of tech com, stock com companies busted in the bust.  I just, I wouldn't bet against Jeff Bezos, but I agree it's a challenge and I think the biggest challenge is he's not international.  So there is no, just as you said, there's no bump in that curve.  He's got to solve that problem and that's tough because all the content companies are very much anti-global.  They want, they're national fiefdoms.  You know, if you're a publisher in New Zealand, you got the rights and you're not going to, you're not going to deal with...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is really hard because so much of the tech journalism is based here in the US.  Right. And I'm trying not to be biased about this.  Now that I actually live in New Zealand and I'm trying to get US content, I always knew that it was hard for Europeans and people outside the US to get this content.  I mean, we have money, we're willing to pay for it, we're ready and it's just ridiculous that we can't get it.  It's insulting and it just reminds us that the world is really run by attorneys in the United States.

Transcript:  The problem is that, well, I don't know about content, but for a retail operation, it doesn't scale like a gadget does.  Apple can do an iPhone, they tailor it to the primary markets and then they just roll out the same phone.  You know, everywhere with little tweaks and little changes here and there, but it's very, very scalable.  You want to go into Italy or you want to go into China or someplace like that with a retail operation.  You're talking about tax issues, you're talking about all kinds of shipping.  The shipping abroad is not as developed as it is in the US.  There are all kinds of bazillion little problems that require a bazillion people who are expensive and so on.  So it really doesn't scale internationally as easily as a hardware product does.

I'm more excited about the Paperwhite than I am of anything else that they announce.  Tell me why.  Well, so I've been using the Nook with Glowlight, which is the Nook version of the Barnes & Noble's version of the Kindle that has the backlit screen.  They were the first ones to launch a backlit screen ebook reader.  I love it.  I don't love everything about the Nook, but I love the backlit screen.  I can't live without it now.

Like I was getting spa ads and it was like, you know, like a woman's foot on my Kindle.  It's like the woman she was like topless on like, you know, not topless like from the front, but you know, from the back.  And, you know, it's like a spa and like, why is there this naked lady on my Kindle?  And you have to explain, no, it's just an ad.  It's kind of irritating.

They'll never, I don't see them ever touching the iPad or some of the better tablets that  are coming out from the real consumer electronics companies, but they, but I agree, you know,  having that second device as a real reading device for somebody, you know, when you're  on the road and traveling a lot too, the other huge thing that they can do is battery life  in addition to all the other benefits of a more dedicated eReading reader.

Transcript:  There is a tracking privacy issue with Amazon's Silk browser.  I'll talk about that in just a second.  And why the Apache Foundation is going to ignore you if you're using Internet Explorer  But first, a word from Fresh Books.  I love Fresh Books if you're a small business owner.  It is the way to- really, it's more- we talk a lot about invoicing, but really at this  point, it's more than invoicing.  It is the tough part of your bookkeeping done.  It is about getting your invoices out and getting paid faster.  It's cloud accounting.  Five million people now use Fresh Books to make their billing painless.  I started using them in 2004.  I was bitching to Amber MacArthur saying, oh man, I got a bill in Canadian dollars for  Rogers and US dollars for my other clients I never remember and then I don't get paid.  She said, hey, Leo, try Fresh Books.  And I did.  And I was amazed.  This was one of the first Web 2.0 services I used back in 2004.  It is easy to use.  And now with their iPhone app, you can actually do- you can- Fresh Books, you can do everything  you could do on a desktop from your iPhone, including keeping track of your hours, your  billable hours, sending out invoices.  When the invoices arrive at the clients, there's a button on the invoice that says, pay me  now, so you get paid faster.  It automatically will send out ticklers if they don't pay on time.  You could do this all now from your iPhone.  This really, I tell you, this is the future of business.  Go to the coffee shop, get work done, track your hours.  And when it's tax time, your bookkeeper will love you, your accountant will love you because  all of that data just goes right into their automated system and it's very simple.  They'll even print physical invoices for a small fee.  If you've got one of those clients, it's kind of old fashioned.  FreshBooks.com, you could try it free for 30 days, everything, everything for 30 days,  unlimited use at FreshBooks.com.  If they ask, say you heard it on Twitter, save time, get paid faster with FreshBooks.com.  Highly, highly recommended.  It's funny because they got the squirrel with the umbrella.  There was a survey, Citrix did a survey and something like 35% of the people they surveyed  thought that cloud computing didn't work as well when it was raining.  Tornadoes maybe, but rain, I don't think so.  Amazon's Silk Browser, which is in all these Kindle devices, the Fire, the HD,  they're getting an updated version of the cloud accelerated mobile browser.  I haven't noticed, to be honest, a big improvement in Silk, maybe because the original Fire was  on impressive hardware, but apparently Amazon is going to be tracking user behavior all the time.  They're watching for breaking news based on your behavior.

Start time: 4257.78
End time: 4264.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do they do it anonymously or is it tied to your Kindle account?  No, it's anonymous.  As long as they don't track your IP, I don't care.

Start time: 4264.42
End time: 4304.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The browser detects which websites a user tended to visit more often, pre-caches the content.  That's part of how it speeds things up.  But at the same time, by watching user behavior across a large number of sites,  Amazon says, quote, our browser is capable of detecting these aggregate user behavior patterns.  That's the anonymous part, it's aggregate, and detecting the next page you need before you even know it.  And we'll even know apparently when Morgan Freeman dies.  So they're going to have a start page including a trending now section that's the stuff that's trending from other Silk viewers.  I think it's kind of interesting.

Transcript:  That's fine.  What's new about this? Google's been doing this for years.  With what? Their search?  When you click on an entry in Google search.  Oh, yeah, sure. Search does that, sure.  In fact, it factors into the results and then the results get reshuffled based on what people are clicking on,  especially if you're logged in and you have friends.  The things your friends are clicking on bubble up to the top.  So, yeah, absolutely.  This isn't really that new or interesting.

Start time: 4337.23
End time: 4356.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think there's any other major reason for them to even have a browser.  Harvesting data.  Everybody's doing it.  There's no downside to it.  And ultimately in the end, you could have some really good contextual advertising.  So I think this is really why they have a browser.

Start time: 4356.96
End time: 4439.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me talk a little bit about tracking cookies because this is similar.  First of all, I think the whole problem with tracking cookies is the name.  If they had just named it ad personalization cookies or ad personalization customization or something,  people would not be so upset about it.  But nevertheless, there is now a do not track standard.  And all the new browsers except for Google's browser will allow you to click a button that says,  I don't want to be tracked and websites are expected to honor this,  except that Microsoft's Internet Explorer 10 will have it turned on by default.  And that is not the standard.  The standard is that do not track should only be an explicit choice by the user.  In other words, the default should be unset, not either on or off, but unset.  And if a browser doesn't do that, then websites have the right to ignore the setting  because the user hasn't expressed an opinion.  Apache Foundation, which makes the most common web serving software,  I mean, I think 90% of the web users Apache says, yep, that's right.  That's why we're going to ignore the IE 10 do not track setting.  We in fact shouldn't. It breaks standards.  Discuss.

Start time: 4443.04
End time: 4462.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this goes back to the last millennium.  You know, I was involved with a startup that was doing tracking with cookies.  And it's not just a matter of serving ads.  It's all about correlating your online identity, which is supposedly anonymous to a real world identity.

Start time: 4462.44
End time: 4469.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you set a cookie as an ad server. You set a cookie that is unique.  It doesn't say Doug Kay anywhere in it, but it's unique.

Start time: 4469.64
End time: 4505.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. But it's relatively simple to ultimately correlate that with other things about me.  And there's a whole industry that does that.  And once that link is made, then my behavior is in fact known non-anonymously.  I think it's a big deal. It's an old discussion.  We've had it on Twitter before. But it's real.  I don't like it.  So you would turn on do not track.  Well, I would. But I'm also in the Scott McNeely get over it.  You have no privacy.  Privacy is dead. Get over it.  I'm in that school too.  Just because I know I can't really stop it.

Start time: 4505.78
End time: 4528.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I feel I have some standing to talk about it because we don't use tracking and none of our advertising uses tracking.  So I don't really have a dog in this hunt.  But I also worry that we get a lot of free web services based on the ability to advertise effectively and that these tracking cookies, I think, are a way to do that.  Ryan Gadget depends on tracking, I would presume.

Start time: 4529.82
End time: 4533.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Transcript:  Your advertisers don't track?

Start time: 4536.67
End time: 4554.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't say for sure.  So our ads are sold through a third party network called same media.  So we work with them closely.  They're kind of like our external sales team.  There may be some tracking.  I can't say for sure.  I don't directly benefit from it.  If they do anything like that, it's outside our zone.

Start time: 4556.04
End time: 4579.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, what if they said to you, look, we pay the rates we pay are based on our ability to target ads.  And those that ad targeting requires targeted ads.  Actually, it's not been proven, but the theory is targeted ads are more effective and the rate we're paying or we're charging depends on our ability to do that.  And if people don't track, then we're not going to be able to pay you as much.

Start time: 4581.04
End time: 4616.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, so first of all, I know that contextual advertising, so advertising based on a tracking cookie is not what we have on our site.  So if same media is doing it, they're not doing it on Gadget.  But if they theoretically they came to us and said that they wanted to do that, I'd say no.  And fortunately, we have the ability.  Not everybody can, but we have the ability to say that because we have multiple different revenue streams.  So we have our events and we have our affiliate stuff and we have our API stuff.  So we're making money a number of different ways.  We're not necessarily only dependent on advertising.  Advertising is just kind of another natural way for us to make money.

Transcript:  Ryan, are you indirectly benefiting from cookies from Google?  When you go look at your Google Analytics and they give you a breakdown of the kind of people that come to your website,  I assume that that all comes originally from cookie data, even though it might not be your website that's leaving the cookies.

Start time: 4635.83
End time: 4679.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, Google doesn't.  As far as I know, Google doesn't host individual and unique data in Google Analytics.  Analytics is all aggregate and anonymized.  There are some services that we use.  We use tracking analytics to understand user behavior on our site.  So we use a service called Kissmetrics.  And that is it doesn't necessarily track you as a human.  It tracks what you do on the site, though, so we can see, OK, if you started on page A and then went to page B and page C,  you know, what are the actions you took to get there so we can understand how to build a better product for you?  And that's obviously a completely different thing than what we're talking about, which is trying to tailor ads and offers at you.  Right. What do you think, Mike?

Start time: 4681.54
End time: 4756.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's interesting that users are being steamrolled by both Microsoft and Apache.  And here's what I mean by that.  There are some users who might choose IE because they have been told or they understand that it's more secure for technical reasons that they don't understand.  And one of those reasons might be this this whole thing that they turn this thing off by default.  And so what Apache is doing is they're saying we don't care about user choice when it comes to choosing a browser.  We're going to eliminate the benefit that they chose that browser for behind the scenes without asking.  So that that's one way they're railroading users.  Microsoft is also railroading users because essentially this this thing can either be on off or neither in the sense that most browsers, as I understand it,  you're supposed to have on set as the default.  Exactly. And so by setting a default, Microsoft is kind of ignoring user choice as well.  So I think that I'd like to see both these companies try harder to give users what they want and not assume that users are dummies who can't be trusted to control their own settings.

Transcript:  Right. Well, I again, I've learned from you, Doug Kay, because if you think tracking cookies are a bad thing, I'll have to change my I don't mind.  I don't mind ad customization. If that's what they're used for.  I think that's a good thing. I want to see more relevant ads.  I don't have a problem with that. I think it's a much bigger picture.  Well, what information are they gathering about me and what are they doing with it?

Start time: 4777.80
End time: 4805.42

Right.  Right. They have my location. So let's say they have my location.  The key here is to be able to correlate any of that with the known part of you. Right.

Speaking of the government, it turns out the FBI is pouring a billion dollars into a new face recognition project  that's going into effect soon. By 2014, you're not going to like this.

Let's do Stamps.com. Then I'll talk about backup.  You know about Stamps.com. Speaking of... You know, the federal government, you go into a post office, they are going to track you.  They're going to track you, right? No, they're not. But I have to say, it's not the best experience in the world going to the post office, finding parking, going in there, buying...  What do you need to buy stamps for when you could print stamps, legally print stamps with your computer and your printer? You can with Stamps.com.  Stamps.com has been around for a long time. I've been a customer for, I think, 10 years now. And the idea is Mac or PC, you get a USB scale.  It's part of the deal. I'll show you in a second. You plug the scale into the computer. You plop the letter on there. Stamps.com says, postage is this.  By the way, it can print right onto the envelope, which is cool. It could take... You could do invoices or billing and stuff from QuickBooks.  So it could take the data out of your QuickBooks, print the whole thing, print the whole kibosh on the envelope.  It can fill out forms. If you're an eBay seller or an Amazon seller, this is huge because it takes the data right from the website, prints out the label with everything you need.  If you're doing international mailing, really great. When you got a mail fudged of Trey, this is for Trey's mom, it'll fill out the international forms.  You do not have to go to the post office. And then the mail carrier comes and they pick it up and they take it.  In fact, you can schedule free pickups if the mail carrier came already. And there's no size limit, no weight limit. It's a great deal.  I want you to try Stamps.com. Visit it right now. See that offer? You only get that special offer and that smiling picture of me from about 100 years ago.  That's when I first started using Stamps.com. By clicking on the radio microphone in the upper right hand corner and entering the offer code TWIT, then you get the smiling face and the $110 bonus offer.  Yeah, we've increased it more postage. $55 in fact, a free postage. A free digital scale. You only pay the shipping and handling for that. It's about five bucks.  You also get a $5 supply kit to make up for that and the free month of Stamps.com. This is the best way to try Stamps.com.  Visit the website, Stamps.com, click the radio microphone, use the offer code TWIT and never go to the post office again.

It's called the Next Generation Identification Project.  It's already legal in some states and will go nationwide in two years.  It uses state of the art biometric identification services to provide a, quote,  flexible framework of core capabilities that will serve as a platform for multimodal functionalities.  Lockheed Martin is making this. And of course it's for public safety.  But basically they just want to put more cameras up and the cameras know who you are and where you are and can pick you out of a crowd.

Transcript:  I know it doesn't surprise me. I just want to tell them.  Yeah. OK.  By the way, this is the project page that says privacy considerations are built into NGI.  Oh, yeah.  NGI developed a privacy threshold analysis way back in June 2006.  A privacy impact assessment for the interstate photo system has been completed to assess NGI compliance with the Privacy Act.  A systems of record notices is being updated to reflect NGI capabilities.  They've also I don't even know what this means.  Basically, now they can. The FBI says it's legal.  And this is like when the FBI decides it's legal.  It's legal. Don't ask.  And what I want. The thing is that, you know, Google has this capability.  Yeah. So does Facebook.  Facebook does. Yeah. But they don't.  They don't turn it on. They don't turn it on for privacy concerns.  Well, if the government could do it, I think we should be able to do it.

Transcript:  Yeah, I think that just to clarify, because this is like a really complex, nefarious sounding thing.  And it is potentially.  But what essentially what they're doing is everybody is familiar now.  Everybody who watch watches CSI or whatever is familiar with the fact that the FBI maintains a fingerprint database.  So if you're a city police person, you find some fingerprints and you want to run it, you run it against the FBI's database to find the crook.  They want to expand that from fingerprints to all kinds of things, including tattoos, biometric ID, iris scans and face recognition as a type of biometrics.  And so what they really are, they're actually part of this billion dollars is going to put systems into local police stations so they can say, oh, look, we found a.  A tattoo and they can just run it or they, you know, here's we somebody robbed a bank, the camera in the bank got their picture.  And then let's do a comparison to see if these people, this person has ever had a mugshot.  Now, the problem with this, it's all legal and it's all fine is not just the slippery slope.  But once that database exists, then the NSA can get into it.  Yeah, the CIA can get into it. The China's China's NSA can get.  I mean, there's, you know, once it exists, then you can just do this big match.  And, you know, like right now, the facial recognition stuff is pretty good.  You know, it's 80 percent range, depending on the lighting and so on.  Come on, five years, it's going to be amazing.  They're going to be able to, you know, it's going to be like a minority report.  And as you walk down the street, they're going to be, you know, hello, Mr.  Anderton, you know, and it's can be able to pick you up like that.

Basically, these two guys are still kind of like superheroes.  But instead of superpowers, they have incredible hacking skills and a supercomputer.  And they track everyone and they listen on everybody's cell phone mics and they do all this amazing stuff.  And most of it is pretty plausible.  I mean, they do they do hacking much quicker than you could really do and stuff.  But most of the stuff is, you know, pretty reasonably plausible.  And there was a hilarious line late in season one.  By the way, season two starts in a couple of weeks.  But there was a late, late season one, they had this hilarious thing where the super genius who created the supercomputer, the tracks, everybody said, oh, yeah, I invented social networking so that I would have this massive database of profile pictures.  And they need to match and identify everyone in the world.  So his name was Zucker Markerberg.

So the Lumia's Nokia had an event showed off some new phones, including a top of the line Lumia 920 running Windows 8.  Mary Jo Foley, who does our Windows Weekly show, was there.  She said, I just begged them and they let me put it on an open palm so I could just feel how heavy it was, but they wouldn't let me touch anything.  It's just not a good sign.  Yeah.  And then to just kind of underscore this, Nokia does an ad in which apparently all the footage and the pictures were faked.

Transcript:  Well, you know, the funny thing is in the video game industry, this is totally allowed.  Right.  In fact, you know, it's almost unusual if you are showing something in the video game industry that is not pre-rendered footage that will look basically nothing like what an actual game or an actual game console will look like when it's released.  It's kind of, you know, standard practice in the gadget world, though.  This is a highly unacceptable and for good reason, because, you know, games are sold for their experiences, whereas gadgets are sold for their capabilities and what they can actually do.  And if you're selling a product, you know, at its launch based on photos and video that it's not going to be capable of taking, you're directly misleading people.  It's not good.  They made a huge bungle of this launch.  It's a boo-boo.

Transcript:  Yeah.  So I guess some of the speculation is that the hardware's not done, but even more telling perhaps is that Microsoft still hasn't released the SDK for Windows Phone 8, the Software Developers Kit,  which means maybe Windows Phone 8 is even more delayed.  Farhad Manju writing in Pando Daily says, you know, it's kind of over for Nokia.  Once again, Windows Phone is too little, too late.  You agree, Ryan?  I mean, everybody likes Windows Phone.

Start time: 5659.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, it's hard.  It's hard to say.  I don't think that we're going to know until they pull the plug or until they really start to win.  But the problem is the battle is not fought in the cell phone market.  The battle is not fought on features and on usability and oftentimes not even on price.  The battle is fought by what the cell phone sales representative at the store is telling you what to buy.  That's the reality.  Not everybody realizes that.  That's where the rubber hits the road.  It's starting to become a little bit more apparent.  But this is why when Palm, before they were acquired by HP and basically shut down,  they realized that they were getting killed not because the product wasn't good,  although the product was not the best product on the market.  I think we all know that.  It was a good product, though.  And they realized they were getting killed because the cell phone retailer partners were not selling them on the ground.  And they made a huge effort.  And there was a lot of press about this where they sent out Palm representatives to the stores  to basically hand train the sales representatives there.  And they even sent out a ton of tester devices for the for the sales reps to actually use and sometimes keep  specifically with the goal of getting the people on the ground, the boots on the ground, selling their phones.  And the reality for Nokia is, you know, Windows Phone 8 or not, it almost kind of doesn't matter  if people are trying to sell an Android device because that carrier decides it's got the best profit margin.  That's what they want to push this week.  Or because somebody walks in the door wanting an iPhone, that's what's going to sell.  So, you know, I don't know.  It's a very complicated question.  I wouldn't rule them out.  But, you know, things are not looking amazing.

Start time: 5761.16
End time: 5801.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Microsoft responding to this by I remember this was a few months ago announcing that they were going to start paying the sales reps,  I think, 50 bucks for every Windows Phone they sold.  This was something that's called a spiff.  Yeah, there were other companies were already doing the spiff.  And so if you went into a Verizon, for instance, they'd steer you first to the iPhone.  And if you didn't want that, they'd steer you to a Samsung Android phone.  And you could ask them about a Windows Phone, but they would say no such thing.  Even AT&T, which really featured the Windows Phone, people reported would just never tell you about it.  But on the other hand, I think people come into a store and ask for the iPhone.  They don't need to spiff.  Right?  Well, that's it.  Go ahead.

Start time: 5802.75
End time: 5851.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead.  Okay.  Well, I think that's the other part of the problem is that Apple has spent many, many years establishing itself as a very cool company.  The Apple stores help a lot, but it has just a fantastic brand.  It's just an incredible brand.  And Microsoft doesn't.  Microsoft seems like, you know, a company from the 90s and Nokia seems like a company from the past.  When you think of Nokia, you think of those old Symbian phones and, you know, all that stuff.  Neither one of these companies has got a lot of cache or, you know, a lot of, you know, it doesn't have the geek street cred of Android phones.  It doesn't have, you know, any of the feel-good things.  And the other thing it doesn't have is apps.  And that's really the thing that...

Start time: 5851.56
End time: 5854.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 5855.66
End time: 5863.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, look at how far ahead of Android and Apple are with apps.  And they're just nowhere.  You know, the too little, too late thing is a persuasive argument.

Start time: 5863.44
End time: 5909.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, one thing on that as well.  You know, Apple is succeeding in the market, succeeding at cell phone retailers in spite of the better efforts of some of these guys.  There's been a lot of press in the last few months about how AT&T is actually not really pushing the iPhone and how they're pushing a lot of Android devices,  especially because there's a lot higher profit margin for them to do so.  So, you know, Apple is still winning, although, you know, one of the topics on the rundown is how the Galaxy S3 is now supposedly the top selling smartphone in the US.  But, you know, Apple wins because of their brand, because people come in, they want that thing, not because the retailers are pushing it.

Start time: 5910.14
End time: 5929.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Apple is kind of unique.  I think, for instance, one of the reasons the S3 is selling so well is because Apple customers know there's a new iPhone.  I mean, Apple's customers are much more aware and alert than the customers of any other brand.  And so they, I mean, that's why the sales have tapered off of the 4S.  People are waiting. They know. They know what's coming.

Start time: 5929.80
End time: 5970.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and there's also another factor here, which is a lot more elemental, and that is I walk in the store, I say, give me the iPhone.  Right.  Now, what are you going to do? You're going to do the Nokia? Give me the Nokia?  I mean, it's like they totally shot themselves in the phone here.  I mean, OK, look, the Lumia, the gun, leave the Nokia, the Lumia 900 is not a great name.  Lumia is an OK name. 900 is a bad name. 920.  So you add plus 20 to the existing 900.  I mean, it just sounds like another commoditized piece of crap.  And even if it's a great phone, they're shooting themselves in the foot.  I mean, it should have just a real catchy spiffy name that people say, I want that thing.  Nobody's going to think, oh, I want the Lumia 920.  I mean, come on.

Start time: 5970.42

Transcript:  It's too bad because it's do you agree that the Windows Phone 8 is pretty sweet?  I mean, it's a nice OS, I think. It's snappy. It's innovative.  That camera, despite the the blot on the escutcheon that is the ad, I think the camera is going to be very good.

I theoretically like everything about it.  Never would I would never consider.  I think there is the problem.  Yes, that's the problem.  I think a lot of people feel the same way.  It's impressive.

Transcript:  So before I got before I got a Windows Phone 7 phone, I I went through quite a few steps setting up or updating my live account.  It's not too bad making sure it imported the contacts from Google and the calendar from Google.  And once you set it up, you by the way, this is also true of Windows 8.  You log into your account and everything's there.  But you've got to take the time to do it.  And I agree. It's it's difficult.  Microsoft does claim, by the way, that users prefer Bing 2 to 1.

And here we'll do we'll do a few that you understand.  So you're going to do I think you do five rounds and then you look at the side by side.  Let me do HDR photography since Trey and you do quite a bit of HDR to Doug.  I do. Yeah, I hear.  And then you look at the two results. We don't know which is which.  They've they've randomized it.  Trey's images appear on both both of these.  Well, these these are pretty close.  So I'm going to say it's a draw. So you go through this.

What are you going to rate it on the icons?  The only thing I don't like about this, and I don't know if it was my fault or something I clicked.  But by the time I'd gone through all five of these.  And by the way, for me, Google won, but like was really close.  Oh, wait a minute.

I think it's more accurate.  Yeah, let's say Queen's Town.  They can't both be right.  New Zealand.  Sheep.  Same results.  See, this is this is really kind of what's interesting about this is they're indistinguishable.  And I think actually that's the best result you can get out of this is that oh, Bing's not bad.  I don't know about the two to one.

So but but only by one vote, like you, other people chose Bing over Google two to one and blind comparisons.  So this is successful.  Now, the funny thing is, and I don't know if this is let's see if this happened because after that, all my searches were now on Bing.

I think art should be, it should make sense in the medium in which it's displayed.  Everyone consumes art in different ways now.  So this just seems to feel right.  Isn't that neat?  I love it.

Automatic, so you don't have to remember it.  Continuous, so it's always going on whenever you're online.  By the way, using SSL, so you don't have to worry if you're in an open access spot or anywhere.  It's secure.  You can even add trust no one encryption if you want.  So Carbonite is absolutely 100% private.  They don't have the key. You do.  And it's online, which means there was just a tornado in Queens on Long Island.  I saw it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Unbelievable.  That just means anywhere you are, you could be backing up to a hard drive next to your computer.  That's fine. In fact, I'd say do it.  Don't not do it.  I'm sure Trey has lots of different backups, but that's not enough.  If you want one that's offsite in case of tornado, it's Queens.  You don't want it to destroy your backups along with the originals.  That's where Carbonite is so great.  You don't have to think about it.  And it's very affordable.  $59 a year for everything on that computer.  They have plans for external drives, multiple computers for small businesses, so forth.  But try the basic plan. $59 Mac or PC.  Visit carbonite.com.  I just ask that you enter Twitter in the offer code so we get credit for that.  It's great.  Every laptop gets carbonite on it because that's it.  Carbonite.com, the better backup plan.  We thank Carbonite for their support.  I got to tell you this story.  We talked about this guy on Twitter a while ago, the guy who sells glasses and abused his customers.  That guy's a character.  And said that there was a New York Times article about him that said he actually improved his Google ranking.  He says, my name is Stanley.  It's not Stanley.  It turns out it's Vitaly.  With decor, my eyes was the name of the site.  I just want to let you guys know the more replies you people post, the more business and the more hits and sales I get, my goal is negative advertisement.  And he was just horrible.  He says he stumbled upon the upside of rudeness by accident.  I stopped caring.  Customers lied and changed their mind in ways that cost me money.  So at some point I started telling them off in the bloodiest of terms.  And the contention was because of the Google algorithm, Google can't tell about sentiment.  They just tell about links.  So all those links from all those angry customers.  Pulled them up in the ranking.  Pulled them up in the ranking.  Well, just so you know, this is a lesson to you all.  Crime does not pay.  He's going to jail.  Four years in federal prison, $100,000 in restitution and fines.  He was arrested shortly after that article about 16 months ago, pled guilty.  And today he's finally sentenced.  He says, as I stand before his name is Vitaly Borker, as I stand before you today, I'm genuinely deeply sorry for threats I made to say that I am ashamed of myself is understatement.  I had the big mouth and I could not control it.  Moose and squirrel.  Moose and squirrel.  Anyway, that's an update on a story.  Mark Zuckerberg is not going to sell his stock.  He's going to hold on to it, he says, for at least a year.  That helped a little bit, I'm sure.

End time: 6814.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Did you read what Mark Cuban said about all that?  No.  Yeah, he has a contrarian piece about that.  It was on TechMeme.  On his blog, Maverick?  I think I did see it.  Yeah, he took a contrarian view.

Start time: 6815.24
End time: 6841.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He says that Facebook did exactly what they were supposed to do.  Yeah.  Because people are whining about Facebook stock being half its price, its initial public offering price of 38 bucks.  He said, no, that's what the CFO is supposed to do.  Facebook raised $10 billion.  I thought, actually, I kind of thought this was right on.  The CFO's job at Facebook is not to manage shareholders' portfolios.  His job is to help Facebook succeed.

Start time: 6842.82
End time: 6856.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he says, as for all the poor employees that are going to have a bad strike price,  that they can do the same thing that Google did and just they can reprice those shares for the employee.  It's not the end of the world.  And he gives examples of when Google did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, those things are all true.  It is not Facebook CFO's responsibility to manage their investors' portfolios and all that.  But it is Facebook's responsibility as a public company to provide value, to create value for their investors.  And, you know, if they can't create that value, if their stock price just keeps going down,  they're not going to have investors, which means that they're going to be in a very poor place financially.  It's going to go down more and more.  You know, on the one hand, that's absolutely true.  And Mark Cuban's piece is dead on.  It's so smart.  But on the other hand, it kind of doesn't matter because, you know, like it or not, they are now a publicly traded company.  And they have to deal with that.

Transcript:  I mean, I've also heard people say, hey, if you invested in Facebook at 38 bucks,  you obviously didn't read Mark Zuckerberg's letter to the shareholders.  He said, there's not going to be any money here for a long time.  Or even the prospectus, which showed, I mean, if you paid attention, their revenues were dropping every quarter.  This wasn't a big surprise.  So, you know, I didn't buy any Facebook stock, so I don't really care.  But if you did, I'm sorry.  And I guess it's a long term hold.  Big copyright issues.  Big copyright issues.  This is something I've complained about a lot with YouTube blocking our videos.  Well, it even happens to the best of them.  YouTube flagged Michelle Obama's speech at the Democratic Convention.  This video contains content from WMG, SME, Associated Press, UMG, Dow Jones, New York Times Digital, the Harry Fox Agency,  Warner Chappelle, UMPG Publishing, and EMI Music, one or more of whom have blocked it in your country.  They did get it back up.  But this just shows you that the automated Internet, the automated copyright takedown requests are just out of control.

Start time: 6974.42
End time: 6982.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know why they thought it was a copyright infringement?  It's because these people say the same thing over and over and over again.  We've heard this speech.  They're infringing on themselves.

Start time: 6983.05
End time: 7024.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, there's a couple of reasons it happens.  I'm sure there was music in that Michelle Obama video that they showed.  So that's probably some of it.  But the other thing that happens, and I've seen this happen before, it happened to NASA.  Local news channels took NASA's footage of the Curiosity landing, embedded it in their local news,  and then the copyright, the robots saw the local news, said, oh, there's the foot.  Oh, there's that foot.  And they blocked NASA's footage, the original that was in the news channels.  Ustream did the same thing, shut down the Hugo Awards because these are the big science fiction awards  and they were live streaming it, the Academy Awards of the science fiction, where they show clips from the nominees.  Leo, I think we know why this happened.

Start time: 7026.52

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was a case where a guy made this goofy local commercial or something like that.  Jay Leno showed it and mocked it on his show.  And then the guy got shut down by NBC because he had posted the original.  I mean, it's a typical case where somebody makes something original, somebody else rebroadcasts it,  and then they crack down on the original content creator.

Transcript:  I think we know why this happened.  Our mutual friend Colleen forgot to flip the switch on that video that said ignore copyright claims.  There's a whitelist.  Yeah, this is the whitelist.  Colleen, please whitelist these Democratic National Convention speeches next time.

End time: 7112.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've been begging her to whitelist Twit and we still get taken down.  Brad Hunstable, who's a very nice guy at Ustream and a good friend, CEO over there, said,  we use a third party content management system, V-O-B-I-L-E, I guess, Voble.  And it was an automatic trigger.  He said, if you'd paid for a pro account, this wouldn't have happened because we automatically whitelist pro accounts on Ustream.  Do we have a pro account on Ustream?  We've never been blocked on Ustream, but we do get takedowns all the time on YouTube.  And some of it, I think, is like from Brazilian companies where I think that they really they're just trying to game the system, right?  They're just trying to get ads.  It's very rarely a takedown.  It's mostly, well, we're going to stick our ads in your content.
