And I don't remember where they did the iPad pro events the smaller iPad Pro event in March that might have been at Bill Graham might be one of the last events they do that's not at their new corporate headquarters because that should be open by early.  Yeah that should be open soon although I'm not sure if that will be big enough for them to bring in all the press that they want to bring in so I mean it's possible they could still do these you know in San Francisco but it's interesting they've they've you know basically gone away from using Moscone and just started using Bill Graham.

Start time: 426.78
End time: 474.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh come on with a headphone jar let's talk about it so.  Actually I keep I'm seeing conflicting rumors now which is good because otherwise it would be deathly dull since usually now by now we know everything that Apple is going to announce.  It's going to be some little thing like how many milliamp hours the battery has that will be a surprise.  Except I saw a couple of people run stories saying not Mark Gurman Mark Gurman has been consistent he's the course the.  Kind of the leader on all of this he's formerly at nine to five Mac he's now at Bloomberg he seems to have very good sources he says no no it's going to be an iPhone seven seven plus the seven plus left dual cameras seven plus will not have a headphone jack.  But I've seen other stories from other people saying there were going to be three phones there was going to be an iPhone.  Plus seven pro the pro camera model no.

Start time: 475.28
End time: 528.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  No I mean I think I've seen that story too I don't that never made sense to me I think what.  What's more likely and I love you guys as feedback what I gather is they were probably at some point testing.  Different devices and they probably were looking at maybe making an iPhone like having I don't even have three devices I think they probably just iteratively designed the larger phone and so.  Three different chassis leaked in one of them was presumably seven plus one of them what they were calling the seven pro which had that the smart connector and the dual camera system.  But I mean you know every leak that we've had from from from both a Ming Chao and from.  Mark Gurman has basically been pegging on this this dual camera system for for quite some time and so I saw this or I think for which was kind of like oh you know they decided not to release three models right there were never going to be three models.  I don't think I don't think they were ever going to be three models I was always the small on the big.

Start time: 528.46
End time: 548.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  This is I mean come on this is normally Apple does tick tock this would be a new design and we already know based on the leaked body.  Pictures and I think those are probably accurate right yeah I think so we know it's not going to be much of a new design effect this might be a very dull event this might just be hey we kind of put a new processor in there we added an extra lens.

Start time: 548.82
End time: 559.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At this point what can they do and you know again no matter what they do they're going to tell you that it's the greatest thing on earth and that you feel special about yourself and that you won't be whole unless you have the phone so you know.

Start time: 559.48
End time: 562.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think they're going to have trouble selling this one I'm going to go out on the limb here.

End time: 563.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah.

Start time: 565.76
End time: 576.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  First of all why do you say stuff like that you just don't have to agitate me.  It's not against an iPad they have problems selling iPads right now they don't have problems with these phones people want.

Start time: 577.80
End time: 581.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The growth growth rate of the phones is dropped considerably.

Start time: 581.74
End time: 593.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When they launch when the phone when a new phone launched in a series they don't usually have a problem moving the units of the phone now by the time they get to the S versions yes there is off of a cliff.

Start time: 593.44
End time: 618.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But this is an SS this is not much of a change.  How do you know we don't even see.  You're right we don't even know how much the.  Okay actually isn't this right about when Apple would have released articles to or you know source stories to the Wall Street Journal and other this is typically what Apple would have done by now to kind of lower expectations to say you know well but we haven't seen that this year have we have we seen those kind of.

Start time: 621.06
End time: 639.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I mean I don't know I mean I think the big news here is obviously going to be the camera on the larger phone and then the lack of the headphone jack those are the two things that at least from from what is leaked so far are going to be kind of kind of the big the big moment so I think I'm really interested in seeing how they're going to sell and convince this whole.  That's going to be no headphone jack thing.

Start time: 639.66
End time: 648.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That they're going to bring them in Chico there is going to be a lightning ear pods bundled in.  Yes.  And connector adapter through a light.  Yeah.

Start time: 660.52
End time: 669.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's good have gone as far as to say in a I've seen people say this in a couple of years you wonder why they ever had a headphone jack.

Start time: 670.94
End time: 690.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I mean I think if they can do wireless audio correctly and I don't know if now is actually the time but I think if they can I think that that could be for most people I think that that might be accurate.  We've seen this big trend and honestly I do because I floppy.  It's not.  Sorry.

Start time: 690.24
End time: 699.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Until we have no until we have good wireless charging for all these extra power sucking devices I think it's a mistake.  I don't want to charge my headphones exactly.

Start time: 700.18
End time: 718.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I have I have all Bluetooth wireless stuff but first of all think of children and one extra thing think of the children exactly think of the children.  And then on top of that I don't know if anybody's watched any kind of video watch Netflix with a Bluetooth headset and tell me you're not watching a 1940s Chinese film.

Start time: 719.54
End time: 734.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well I could use there's a newer Bluetooth spec I'm sure you're up on this apt X that supposedly is even higher fidelity and a to DP.  It's not the fidelity I worry so much about is the connectivity which drops and as you point out battery life.  Battery battery life.

Start time: 735.68
End time: 781.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  In addition to the newer Bluetooth spec there's something called an FM I which we're seeing from some other headphone makers people like a Doppler labs who are making you know that the here one wireless headphones which will be out later this fall.  This is hearing aid technology and basically and that's though they feel like they because I've talked to them they basically said that they feel like they've completely nailed near field magnetic induction.  Yeah so that means it's a wireless charging wireless.  Well I mean that that's for the that's for the the the sync issues for for charging I mean that's that becomes a much more difficult kind of scenario although if you can have I mean we've seen this with a lot of kind of the wireless buds that are out now where they have charging cases where you  can pop them in a charging case for you know fifteen twenty minutes.

Start time: 782.28
End time: 802.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And if we're charging cases right now and that's that's not I have the Motorola hint so that's one way Motorola solved it so of course a little thing in your ear doesn't going to have much battery life so they include a case that's a larger battery you charge the case and then that stays charged and gives you multiple charges on the little ear piece so you put your earbuds away in a case.  Right.

Start time: 803.52
End time: 859.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Let me ask you guys this so I mean look I agree I think that solving a problem that doesn't exist what's wrong with headphones.  Yeah I mean I don't know but but I guess to play devil's advocate because look I came to terms with the fact the headphone jack is going away like.  Ten months ago like nine months ago like as soon as the rumors really started kicking off like in January I was like OK it's gone I've got to come to terms with this not because I'm OK with it not because I feel like it's necessarily a good decision just because this is.  What the reality is going to be and I'm an iPhone user and my next phone will be an iPhone and so I need to get used to using dongles and deal with it.  But let me ask you guys this I mean they're going to be including these lightning ear pods in the box since most people most people do use the included headphones with their phone they don't use third party headphones even.  Like I wonder if a lot of this is kind of overblown in terms of everybody freaking out about it when most people are just going to use the headphones that come with their phone to begin with and they're just going to continue to use the phone the headphones that are there.

Start time: 860.90
End time: 889.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That sounds like a totally logical and reasonable explanation but then when you ask the reality of life how many times has a cable like this and a headphone set broken on you and how long do these lightning crap cables from Apple.  Because I'll tell you what they don't last very long so now not only do I have to pay 30 40 dollars for new dongle and then the earpiece that's already broken I've got Apple headsets that I have for five years now that still work I've got dongles that don't last three months.

Start time: 904.04
End time: 914.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They just work but but lightning headphones are not going to be cheap because you've got to pay the Apple tax on it.  By the way let's look at this in FMI.  Is this your opinion Christina that this will also be part of this.

Start time: 915.02
End time: 919.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I don't think it will necessarily be part of this but I do know that that's just a standard that people are using.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So it's interesting the company that makes this free link has a totally patent encumbered by the way you can only get it through free link.

Start time: 927.02
End time: 934.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I'm certainly not I'm not I'm not suggesting that's going to be something that Apple launches but I know for a fact that other headphone makers are looking at it.  So I feel like.

Start time: 934.72
End time: 954.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So it's kind of a replacement for Bluetooth it's another form of pan personal area network that uses magnetic inductance low power and duck.  I just I can see the people there are already people who think Wi Fi causes brain damage.  They're going to look at this so you're going to shoot magnets through my head.  No those people are wearing magnets.

Start time: 954.82
End time: 956.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_13

Start time: 957.22
End time: 984.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Just tell them it's good for their health.  Yeah it's a it's a secure wireless bubble around each user using a low power inductive antenna inside the bubble devices connect instantly outside.  They're invisible and FMI is the only technology that could be used where secure and reliable pan solutions are needed.  Apparently they use it in the armed forces on the battlefield.  So your tactical headset can't be broken into.

Start time: 985.38

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  This is really.

Start time: 1006.82
End time: 1050.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Because I know a company that's already working on on a product that it'll be out like this fall that will have that we use this.  So and I was talking to them the other day.  And so I feel like whether Apple uses something like that or not who knows.  But I feel like what's at least exciting about this even if you think that this is a worthless you know exercise it's it's it's stupid for them to get rid of the jack.  And that's that that's a valid thing to say.  But I think even if you accept that the fact that they are getting rid of the jack is going to force I think whether it's Bluetooth or NFMI or any of these other things it's going to force people to start taking wireless seriously.  And we haven't had a lot of advancement in wireless technology when it comes to headphones you know in the last 10 years or so we just really hasn't improved.

Start time: 1050.60
End time: 1066.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be interesting if Apple use this as an opportunity.  Because I agree with you that the the rhetoric that Apple uses on Wednesday will be fascinating to watch if they do remove the headphone jack.  They're going to have to have a story.  Right.  Compelling story why.

Start time: 1068.62
End time: 1089.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well the advancement of things that again that sounds great because again when I use headphones I can't watch video or like the audio just isn't as clear like when you plug in the physical line you just feel and hear the difference.  So if we're going to make great advancements at the push of Apple with their iron fist then that's great.  If that turns out to be the case giving me one more thing to charge.

Start time: 1092.66
End time: 1093.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  We always have one more thing to charge.

Start time: 1095.04
End time: 1116.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah we've been steadily going being conditioned to like lower quality lower resolution on all audio.  I mean think landline to cell phone.  I know I hate that though.  I hate streaming music streaming.  Yeah it's unnecessary.  So this may just be another departure from like not five nines because it's not reliability it's just quality.

Transcript:  There are a lot of people Neil Neil Diamond Neil Young.  Maybe Neil Diamond for that matter Neil Young who think that it's a terrible thing that musicians are making music that there's a whole generation can't even hear because they're listening on crappy earbuds.  That might make the case.  Apple loves music right.  Maybe they'll make the case.  Well those earbuds aren't good.  We're going to make you really good headphones and we can do it better.

Start time: 1146.04

Transcript:  It burns.  It burns.  We'll talk about that.  But first let's talk about Squarespace the place to make your next website.  I was talking to somebody the other day.  Actually was on the radio show who has a different hosting company.  I won't name names.  I don't want to shame anybody.  He said I don't understand.  I updated my Chrome and my site looks different.  The menu instead of going this way goes sideways.  I said oh yeah.  This is I don't know why that happened but let me tell you it wouldn't happen  with a Squarespace site.  You want to have you first of all if you're getting if you're going to have a  website and you should every company every individual it's your best way to  control your image your presence on the web is to have your own website and  you've got something to say you've got a unique point of view you need somewhere  to put it and putting it on Facebook with all due respect or Twitter.  That's not that's not enough.  That's not your page.  That's their page.  That's Mark's page.  Put it on your page.  So you want a web host that's going to give you a great looking page that  reflects your aesthetic that lets you do you know your stuff whatever it is  whether it's selling candles or writing about paint colors or whatever you love.  And it does it in a way that is that you feel good about it.  And that's Squarespace.  And by the way extremely affordable.  Every site looks professionally designed.  You could do it yourself by the way if you are a CSS JavaScript HTML guru.  A lot of people use Squarespace like that too because you can start with a blank  template that gives you all the under the covers engineering but you get to design  it exactly the way you want.  They've got templates for everything to brand new magazine style templates  include interactive features like grid style landing pages.  You know you see these on all the big you know online magazines infinite scroll.  That's all the rage now right.  You got related posts so people can explore more author profiles and all of  this comes with a basic account on Squarespace dot com.  You can try it free.  I want you to do that right now if you go to Squarespace dot com.  Just press the get started button pick a template.  Oh one of the nice things is you're not you know your template and your content  are completely separate as they ought to be.  So if you say I don't know let me try a different one.  You your your template can change with your mood.  Every one of them though mobile responsive so you don't have a separate  mobile site.  Your site looks great on every size screen.  When you upload images behind the scenes the Squarespace software automatically  creates nine different sizes so that they have an image to fit the screen it's on.  They they have e-commerce on every site so you can always sell something.  And by the way I think it's the only e-commerce that where your store matches  the rest of your site it matches your aesthetic.  That's really nice.  They now do domain names so you don't even have to go to a separate register.  That makes it very easy to get a custom domain.  In fact you've always gotten a free one with an annual purchase but now you can  purchase directly from Squarespace domains.  Register your domain.  And unlike a lot of these other places they'll give you a parking page that's  clean that's spam free that's gorgeous so that you have time to start building.  It's never been easier to sell online.  Power your business with Squarespace commerce.  They just introduced analytics for commerce which is really helpful.  You can see you know the traffic in real time.  That's kind of fun to put that up on the on the wall at your office.  You can see when people abandon your checkout.  That's important to know.  Device filtering how they come into your site.  And if you are and there are people who do this for a living.  In fact when Lisa wanted to create a site for her new agency she said would you do  it. I said no but Squarespace has these great people who work independently but  use Squarespace as their platform and she found somebody did it for a very  reasonable price did a wonderful site for her.  That's a artisanal agency dot com if you want to take a look at it.  Well that's another nice thing.  You could all go there at once and it wouldn't bring it down.  Squarespace sites just never go down.  Anybody who's built or contributes to three or more active websites gets access  to something new. This is the Squarespace circle.  It includes advanced guides optimized support and six month trial periods for  new projects. That's nice.  A million customers and growing and still going strong and yes they still can.  They never go down.  Squarespace dot com.  There's only one thing I'd ask if you decide to set up a Squarespace site for  free if you decide to buy after you play with it for a while use our offer code  tweet.  That way they know you heard about it here because I know Squarespace has ads  everywhere now right.  Even the Super Bowl.  But you'll also get 10 percent off as a thank you.  So there you go.  Squarespace dot com.  Don't forget the offer code.  We're talking tech three fun people.  Stacey Higginbotham just love having her on this week in Google every week.

And so and again I mean I think  that that's a bad sign right.  Yeah. And so I think it is.  And so you know I don't know how widespread this is.  I think it could be probably I think it's probably  was maybe one one a couple of batches probably  down to one supplier if they were to really  go back and see you probably.

Transcript:  They're not doing this in China and they say well it's a  different battery.  So you know we know what this is caused  by lithium ion batteries are you know anything  that contains a lot of energy is always  could be potentially dangerous whether it's gasoline or  batteries. In the case of lithium ion batteries  if you overcharge them and this is true by the way of other  batteries too if you overcharge them they can  swell up they can heat up  and in fact they can get so hot they can  burn and if they swell  even more while they're burning they can explode  and really it's like napalm.  I mean apparently it could get on your skin and it  caused severe burns.  It's not a good thing.

Transcript:  I'm not trying to detract from 35 because I feel like 35  is a large number but at the same time also  you know people get a paranoia in their mind of when they  think something's hot. My iPhone sets a blaze  when I talk on it for more than 20 minutes.  Most phones get hot.  That's true. It's like I mean when you think to yourself like  is it hot to the touch like every  phone when you talk on it or do anything on it  for more than 10 minutes it gets hot like literally like  it when you if you put it to your face you can feel it.

Start time: 2010.76

We talked a lot after the show last week.  He does. He's a researcher.  And he said heat is the enemy for  lithium ion.  It reduces the life.  He told me and I should tell you Stacey because you also  drive a Tesla. Don't park your Tesla in the sun.  Park it in the shade.

Same reason it'll lower the life of your  battery. But phone companies go you're only  going to have that phone for a couple of years.  It's never intended to be owned for longer.  So we don't really care for reducing battery life.  It's far more important that we have quick charging.

Because I'm usually streaming stuff.  I got movies streaming and all kinds of stuff.  Download my music so it gets really hot.  So I put it in the vent and it stays cool as a  cucumber and it stays happy.  And I don't have to like restart it as much because  I'm always like I use like 30 40 gigs a day that  month.

They immediately stopped shipments then they did an  investigation realized OK this is maybe more widespread  than we thought. And I are doing the full recall  working with the carriers doing the exchanges.  Yeah they're they're absolutely treating this the  way that it needs to be treated which is look at  least so far it hasn't been you know no one's been  been seriously hurt or anything and that's a very  good thing.

I haven't seen any reported cases in the United  States but that doesn't mean people have been hurt  but at least so far it looks like no one has which  is a very good thing.  No I think I think they've handled this the exact  way they needed to handle it.  And by basic I mean you know you can't force people  to come in and do a one to one swap but but by  making it as easy as possible and by the fact that  the carriers are sending out the emails that's huge.

Transcript:  Here's the email I got from T-Mobile.  Samsung notified us today they were calling Galaxy  Note 7 due to battery safety concern.  I don't know who wrote this but there have been 35  cases reported globally as of September 1st Samsung  has communicated to us they will have replacement  Note 7 devices that should be available in the next  two to four weeks.  That's a problem right there.  As a customer your safety is our number one priority  or making it easier for you to return and exchange  your Galaxy Note 7 free of charge.  Sign up. We'll let you know.  This is one option.  By the way Consumer Reports says this is a terrible  option. Sign up and we'll let you know when the new  phones available. In other words keep using it.  Or switch to a new device Samsung and at least  T-Mobile says and I imagine all the carriers will  will have something you can use until the new phone  comes or return the phone for a full refund.  And that's what Samsung saying is we will buy back  every one of them.  We don't care where you got it.  If you don't want it we will buy it back.  But the problem is if it's your only phone you'll  be no one wants to be without a phone for two to  four weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Right. Right. I mean and that's I mean that  puts them in a weird quiet position which I think  is why a lot of the carriers are saying look you  can you can swap it out for a different phone and  then when we get them in stock.  So I'll put back out again or you know some  some of the retailers are saying that they'll have  new stock next week.  You know I think it just depends on the person how  comfortable you are keeping it and for how long.  But I mean.  If you're really concerned there are going to be  alternatives that you can do and you can always  just swap it out with your carrier and say hey you  know I need.  Now that you have the Galaxy Note 7 in stock I want  to go back and get that again.

If it were an official recall they would go to the  C the Consumer Product Safety Commission the CPSC  and declare an official recall.  At that point it would be illegal to sell the Note  7 in the United States.  And according to Consumer Reports some retailers  are still selling the phone as late as Friday.  So Samsung has not gone to the full length that  they should if if at least according to Consumer  Reports they ought to Consumer Reports is kind of  turning into the cranky the cranky nanny of.

And that's by the way right where the battery is as  I remember it's a long battery and that's about  where it would be on the left side of the phone as  you're looking at it from the front.  You wouldn't want that to happen in your house.  I mean that's why Samsung's taking this series  seriously. 35 phones is enough to say.

Transcript:  Yeah.  And I do have to say I mean I mean Consumer  Reports might have a point in that maybe they  should do an official recall and make it illegal  to sell it or whatever.  But I also have to think that they're working with  all the retailers they're working with all the  carriers.  Maybe other than the maybe some some web  places I can't imagine any place after Friday.  I can't imagine any place continuing to sell the  phone just for their own liability reasons.

Transcript:  Yeah.  You're talking about the adapt sound that we  mentioned on Twig.  And I think a lot of people didn't know that  Samsung does this it buries it way deep in the  settings but you can actually do a hearing test  on the phone with your earbuds in and then have  the phone take the results of that and create a  equalization curve tuned to your individual ears.  That's awesome.  It produces a very good result.  I do that with every Samsung phone I get.  It's I don't know when they started as six maybe  but I love it.  It's called adapt sound it's in your sound  settings and they have a headphone jack as they  said.  Yeah.  In their announcement we have a headphone jack.  It's not the first Apple's not the first company  to abandon the headphone jack.  The Moto Z does not have a headphone jack although  that's not even out.

So when they released the first unibody Macbook  Pro they also released a unibody Macbook at the  same time.  And the unibody Macbook this was this was like  the successor to the plastic Macbook did not  have a Firewire port on it.  And people freaked.  I was one of the people who freaked.  I remember I was writing for for T.U.A.W.  at the time R.I.P.  And I was I was like this is insane.  And within a year within probably like six months  actually they re released that laptop renamed the  13 inch Macbook Pro unibody Macbook Pro and put a  Firewire report on it.

It's a it's a sort of device that even other  stylists that we were seeing for you know like  iPads and stuff like that.  It's a different sort of it's a different sort of  tool.  But yeah it's not the primary input mechanism  like it's you can still touch as your primary  input mechanism if you're going to use the Apple  pencil.  That's because you need precision for certain  stuff.  It's not as if it's not like a Palm Trio which is  you know who had a stylist.  That's who he was referencing or the Windows  mobile devices which you style I where you had to  touch their terrible non capacitive touch screens  you know to get stuff done.

Transcript:  Peter Kafka writing in recode from Walt Mossberg.  Remember that we in the Walter Isaacson biography  of Steve Jobs.  Isaacson said Steve told him on his deathbed  practically.  We've we've we've licked it.  I think he said he said TV.  We finally cracked it.  We finally cracked it.  Yeah there it is.  And then we never heard anything and there was a lot  of rumors from people that Apple was going to do a TV  set.  Well finally while Mossberg was sitting on this all  along he says Steve Jobs called him on the night  that he that he formally handed over control to Tim  Cook and told him I think we figured out a way to do  it TV and it's going to be fantastic.  And he says well I want you to come over and see  what we're working on.  But he died two months later and no one and Walt  never made it over and no one really knows what it  was.  The mystery passed with Steve Jobs.

Start time: 3063.62
End time: 3084.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So that was OK.  Jobs died and was it 2011.  Yes yes.  So that was a very different time for TV.  And I really want to emphasize that something  you were planning way back then even being Steve  Jobs I don't know if it would have a lot of  relevance today.  So maybe that's why we've never seen anything from  it.

Start time: 3085.78
End time: 3160.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'm also I'm the cynic in me and you're going to  hate me.  But it's OK.  The cynic in me says that Jobs played Walt Mossberg  like a fiddle and used Walt to basically get the  Wall Street Journal which he was writing for at the  time to tell the Apple story.  And Mossberg even says Steve wanted to clearly  communicate that even though he wasn't going to be  CEO anymore he this is the quote he was going to  still be involved.  Their press release made some vague nod toward that  but he wanted me to know that he was going to be  involved in big strategic things and also that he  was going to reserve one particular thing for  himself.  I said well what's that.  Steve said well it's television.  I think we figured out a way to do it and it's  going to be fantastic.  I want you to come out in a few months and I want to  show it to you.  That conversation I don't think necessarily means  that there really was anything significant.  It could just as well been Steve playing Walt one  more time saying hey just remember I'm still around.  I'm not.  I don't want you to think I've left Apple.  Can I ask you a question.  He was by the way at that point very sick and very  can I ask you a question.

Transcript:  Now Steve Jobs great man was he out here making  everything on his own.  No was he literally designing things.  They have a lab in the house working by him  soldering together the perfect TV.  So even if he passed away the team that was doing  everything that he ordained them to do is still in  existence unless they had like a trap bomb connected  to his heart.  Tired when he died.

It would have been the Steve Jobs in the world and  now he's passed and here is the first thing Steve  Jobs ever did.  It's also come.  This is like clickbait.  This is a clickbait story.  It sounds nice but don't tell me that he told you  that there was a magical wand and somehow this  magical wand disappeared to the ether.

Start time: 3204.14
End time: 3219.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Here's the other the less cynical interpretation  which is that he did have engineers working on  something very exciting and Apple decided after  looking at it.  Well it's not that exciting or it's not a business  for us.  There's a lot of reasons Apple does a lot of  things.  I don't think they're going to do a car even though  they spent so much money on it.

Start time: 3219.96
End time: 3233.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I think they're going to do a car.  I think they're going to back down on it.  I think they're going to do a car but I think to  Stacey's point I think that the TV industry has  changed so much and I think the set top box is one  thing that makes a lot of sense because.  Well there's a new opportunity now right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well yeah the FCC but also you know the whole the  whole rise of cord cutting and skinny bundles and  that sort of thing.  I think with the TV I mean as a lot of people have  seen it's become so commoditized even going into  4K it's become so commoditized that I don't know  if that would be if it would make sense for Apple  to be in that space because Apple loves their  margins right.  So if they're going to have a TV that also has this  built in set up box component and they're going  to want to sell for their price I think they've got  to realize that in 2016 or even 2013 even even  2011 it would have been harder to make the  argument.  It's going to be difficult to say people are going  to buy you an Apple branded television set but  you know a set up box is a little different.  But yeah I'm with a doctor I totally think they're  building a car.

I'm so embarrassed.  I have never backed up in my life.  He said I've been using computers for 12 years and  I've never backed up and I thought well you know  what.  Don't be embarrassed.  You're a lucky son of a gun because data loss  happens.  And of course it happens at the worst possible time.  That's why a good backup solution is so important  important enough in your home.  You know if you've got baby pictures or wedding  pictures or financial records or emails there's  got to be stuff on your computer you just do not  want to lose.  But imagine if you're a business and the computers  in your business they've got your accounts  receivables they've got your suppliers list they've  got your customers list those computers hold the  keys to your business if your business if that  building burns down you can you know you got  insurance you can replace all that stuff.  Do you have insurance for your data.  I bet not.  No point in buying insurance for your data after  the fire.  You get it before the fire you get carbonite right  now.  Automatic cloud backup.  They've got great solutions for business  including appliances.  They recently acquired a company called evil.  They make a really great solution if you're an IT  pro you certainly know the name.  These guys are great.  And you know one thing that should terrify every  business is ransomware.  Ninety percent of all the phishing attacks out  there now contain ransomware viruses.  That's the virus that when it activates on your  computer encrypts your data and then asks for  ransom.  Just send us three hundred bucks we'll  unencrypt it.  First of all even if you send them three hundred  bucks chances are you're not going to get a  decryption.  But if you've got carbonite you've got nothing to  worry about because carbonite does something  every backup should do but most do not.  It's called versioning.  It doesn't just save the most recent version.  Which might well be the version that's encrypted.  It saves previous versions so you can always go  back to that unencrypted version and say no no  no no to the bad guy.  Carbonite is kryptonite for ransomware.  Try it out for free.  You don't need a credit card.  That means there's no way they're going to you  know like say oh we're just going to auto renew  you know they really want you to try it free at  carbonite dot com.  But when you do try it where you see the offer  code put in twit.  And the only reason I say that.  Well two reasons one so they know you saw it here  but also so you'll get two months free when you  buy as little as five dollars a month to back up  everything on a Mac or a PC.  But they've got plans for servers networks and  more carbonite dot com.  I'm on a kind of a mission to get everybody using  carbonite.

They stole the iPads.  They stole my PlayStation and literally like you  know I'm a chill dude.  The thing that made me the most upset was thinking  the pictures of my daughter gone.  Where's my stuff.  And luckily you know most of my hard drives are  still here and I still have stuff but I have  everything backed up.  So if you don't have so backed up whether it be a  fire or a flood.  Somebody's coming in and taking it.  You know that that laptop whatever is the value of  it.  Three thousand dollars to get back from insurance.  That's cool.  You can't get back the pictures of your newborn  your grandfather your mother your kids first walk  in on video.  So everybody should be backing up everything and  five bucks to get you in the door is not that  much.  It's part of a larger strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That makes sense.  Did they tell you because we were wondering this Stacey Stacey and I and Jeff were wondering this on Twig.  If it would allow.  So with one of the things that's great about Sonos is you attach it to all your accounts not just Spotify but Deezer and Pandora and even Apple Music.  And then you can say.  Well you can't say but you can say on the app you can affect say choose something from Apple Music play an Apple Music.  Right.  Will do you think.  And Stacey's of the Pinnace will not be available that you would be able to say to your echo.  Play Apple my Apple Music playlist on my Sonos in the living room.

Start time: 4452.62
End time: 4463.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I wouldn't imagine why it wouldn't work because you're basically.  You know controlling the Sonos app the Sonos experience I mean I think that they're building the two things in together I wouldn't imagine why that wouldn't work.

Start time: 4464.60
End time: 4467.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Are you controlling the app or the speakers.  That's the question.

Start time: 4468.96
End time: 4515.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That's not clear.  So yeah that's a good point and that that would be the differentiator.  If you're controlling if you're controlling the app then then there'd be no reason you couldn't.  But if you're controlling the speaker then that that becomes a little bit different then you're probably limited to whatever Amazon is doing.  Although again you know Amazon at this point it doesn't have all the services that you can do with with Sonos Sonos supports more services.  But it is increasingly doing more and more of them.  And for instance if you've got an iPhone you can't control your Apple Music or your iTunes or whatever you know from that app experience it'll play from your phone and send it to.  To your Echo so I don't know that that that's a really good question.  I don't know they were kind of light on details which was disappointing.  I was very excited though just to see the integration all the way around.

Start time: 4535.96
End time: 4557.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And if they have that that would be a reason to buy home over the air because like my Echo still thinks we after Gene Wilder died.  This is I don't know why I'm so emphatic about this but it still thinks that he died at the age of 81 when he died at the age of 83.  And I'm guessing it's just a function of being but like there's like little things like that where you're like oh come on Echo.

End time: 4758.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why do they use.  OK.  So here's the thing about that.  It's universally female voice for things.  So if there's a woman like I would almost believe like hey men are more inspired to not punk out when a woman's around like oh you're blacking out if a female says get up you're going to do it because you don't want to embarrass yourself.

But you don't they're not trying in that case of course you're not trying to soothe somebody you're trying to get them to pay attention.  Yeah.  Early human factors research in aircraft and other domains indicated this is Wikipedia so you know it's true that female voices were more authoritative to male pilots and crew members and were more likely to get their attention much.  Now it says citation.  Need.  Somebody just made that up.  Maybe maybe even Leo put that in there.  Much of this research was based on pilot experience particularly in combat situations where the pilots were guided by female aircraft controllers citation needed.  They reported being able to most easily pick out the female voice from among the flurry of radio chatter citation needed.

Start time: 4827.72
End time: 4833.72

Start time: 4842.92
End time: 4882.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  What are you doing.  And by the way if we then go to actual studies a study at Plymouth University in 2003 and the defense research and development Canada in Toronto in 2009 in both cases a male voice rather than a female voice in a monotone or urgent enunciation style resulted in the largest proportion of corrected fastest identification of times.  Never mind.  I forget that there is no citation needed here.  There's an actual actual citation effects of talker sex and voice style of verbal cockpit warming warnings on performances from Human Factors volume 51 November 1st 2009.  All right.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Fresh Books.  The super simple cloud accounting software that changed my life  10 years ago when I was still a freelancer.  In fact, Amor MacArthur told me about it because I hated doing invoices.  And there's a problem when you're a freelancer.  If no one got and became, you know, nobody started their own business  because they love doing invoices so much.  I mean, that's that's like the worst.  So it come to the end of the month and I put it off.  I didn't want to fire up Microsoft Word and Excel and get all my papers, my receipts.  But the problem is, if you don't do that, you don't get paid.  And that's a problem.  In fact, there was a period when I was doing this,  I was going to Canada, doing the TV show that I did not invoice Rogers  for my travel or my time for like four or five months.  And then, you know, I'm starting to say, I really need a check.  So I put them all together and they were pissed off.  They say, how cool you're invoicing us for six months worth of travel.  We're not going to do it.  Amber said Fresh Books comes out of Toronto.  Great company, one of the first Web 2.0 companies,  and they've gotten better and better and better.  In fact, five million small business owners now use Fresh Books  for their invoicing, for their accounting income tax time.  You'll love the reporting.  Your accountant will love the reporting.  It literally takes 30 seconds to create and send an invoice,  including different currencies.  I was billing in Canadian dollars. No problem.  You could also brand your invoices with your logo.  I had a nice little, you know, Leo logo.  You could set recurring invoices,  so you don't even have to do it every month.  Attach receipts.  You can use the Fresh Books app to actually take pictures of receipts  and get them into the invoice.  Clients can pay you online, which most of the time means you get paid faster  because it turns out clients don't like paying any more than you like invoicing.  Not because they don't want to pay you. They do.  They just it's a pain in the butt.  So if they have a button on the email that says just pay them now, they'll do it.  You can even set up auto payment reminders.  It's so awesome. They have this new thing.  I'm not sure I really understand it,  but I think if you are I would have used this probably then  because you can invoice for a payment up front  when you're kicking off a project.  So a lot of times you go in to debt, basically.  You go comes out of your pocket until you get the expenses paid back.  Now you can use Fresh Books as a escrow.  Basically, you can also import expenses automatically.  So it's very fast, very easy.  And there's so much more.  It even has a chip EMV chip card.  So you can dip the chip or swipe the stripe that goes on to your smartphone  using their app.  So if you're if you're doing business in people's houses, you can invoice them.  You can actually give them an estimate.  All this with Fresh Books, give them an estimate on the app,  give them an invoice on the app, and then take their payment on the app all  at the same, you know, in one day, which is truly amazing.  You're going to love it. It's going to transform your life.  If you are invoicing people, get Fresh Books.  You could try it free for 30 days.  Fresh Books dot com slash twit Fresh Books dot com slash.  There's no offer code for this.  But when they do ask you, how did you hear about us?  If you would write in this week in tech, I would be eternally grateful.  Fresh, but they've been a good sponsor for us since I started using them  10 years ago. Really great company.

Transcript:  So if you're going to add the modem for the phone plus the battery,  you're going to move into like crazy, fat territory.  I mean, that's just that's hard.  But you can if it's like a normal smartwatch, like just Bluetooth  and it's going to use your phone for most of the stuff.  Totally could do something pretty.  I was so pissed that, you know, the initial pebble was just  so I picture of that.  They were like, it's like you're wearing a medical device and.  People are better.

Transcript:  If it's stylish enough, it has to be stylish.  It has to look like nice.  This is what's been a problem with smartwatches is they look like they don't look stylish.  If it's stylish enough, some people not I admit,  Christina, you're not you're not in the picture, but some people would.  I mean, I think that looks very nice.  Of course, the problem is smartwatches.  And this is an OLED, super AMOLED screen.  And it's a one point three inches is they always look better in pictures  because the screen always looks like that's real hands, that's real numbers.  And then you see it and it's clearly a screen.

Transcript:  I don't know. I'm going to be sitting on a board on a panel with design  and crews and all the smartest people in the world  could make a lovely wearable device for a female.  And it just needs to get done like just.  And again, you don't have to make one with every cycle of watch you make.  But make one once a year.  Give me an option.

Start time: 6394.58
End time: 6433.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yes. And I would say that women would be more willing to spend  a ridiculous amount of money on a watch if it's attractive and fashionable.  I mean, again, my Apple watch, I spent two hundred fifty dollars on the band  because it's an accessory.  It's a fashion thing at that point, not a tech object.  And so the way that I mentally am able to justify what I spend on something,  at least for me, I can't speak for all women, but at least for me,  I'm able to say, well, I'm now just fine.  This is a fashion purchase versus a tech purchase.  And so I can make allowances to spend, you know, eight hundred dollars  on something for my wrist because it's also a fashion item rather than just being  like, well, this is a gadget.  Couple of things I think you're dollars on.

Start time: 6433.92

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Oh, sorry. Costume jewelry.  I'm just thinking about because like one of the things I have  with a lot of the watch, I would.  Do you do you think your band will work with future iterations of the Apple watch?  I do. OK.  Because that's that's one of my things.  Yeah. I'm like, oh, you know, I have I have a Ringley.  I looked at doing the bracelets.  I've looked at a lot of stuff because I love having attractive things  that interact with my stuff, especially because my phone's always in my bag.  But a lot of it's really expensive for something that I'm like, yeah,  this is probably going to last like like a smartwatch is a no go for me  if it's more than like 200 bucks, because my God, it's going to get a year or two.  Yeah. Right.

Start time: 6507.34
End time: 6525.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah. And also, I think that the round, unfortunately,  if you know, it's harder to make a smaller round face.  So for me personally, I'm OK with a square because I feel like round  to get all the stuff there.  It's harder for them to miniaturize that.  I mean, I think Pebble did a nice job.  So where your Apple watch? I do. Yeah.

Start time: 6526.18
End time: 6540.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I think I like squares, actually.  I so I feel like round from a design aesthetic.  They just.  They look weird on someone's wrist.  It's like a it's a square.  It's a rectangular thing in the beginning. I don't know.  I've always worn square watches. Yeah.

It's fun.  It's a smartphone in your in your wristwatch.

But if you said, oh, here, put this watch on and I can at least text you  or call you when you're out the park or outside or over Suzy's house or something.  You can still communicate with them.  And they only had that one device.  They'd have to carry something in their pocket. That would be huge.

Start time: 6617.36
End time: 6651.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  which is touch to pay.  And it's going to do something the Apple watch doesn't do,  which is not only touch to pay, but Apple's I mean, Samsung smartphones  with Samsung pay work with card readers, swipe card readers,  because it sends out a magnetic signal that tricks the card reader  into thinking it's a it's a credit card being swiped.  The watch will do that, too.  You're almost sold on that watch now. That's interesting.  Well, you're a big guy. We're big guys.  We could wear this. We could wear a big watch.  And then I mean, here's my question, Mark.  Will it work with anything but Samsung's phone?  Because in the past, that's that's been a stopper for some people.  I doubt it. Probably not.

And in fact, explains why AT&T has been touting it,  which is that you will have a phone number on your phone  that's and the phone number on the watch that are different.  But you can tell the phone  that the watch phone number is now the phone number to ring when the phone rings.  So it's going to in effect spoof your phone.  So you will have one phone number.

Transcript:  Thank you, Leo.  This is a short week because of the Labor Day holiday in the US.  But the tech news never stops laboring.  I have two words for you.  Apple and Sony.  Wednesday is the big day with not one, but two companies  making big announcements.  First, there's Apple.  Will we see new iPhones?  Will they have headphone jacks?  Will there be a 256 gig option?  Is it OK for men to buy the new rose gold headphones from Beats by Dre?  Will you buy me the new watch that they announce?  These are the questions that everyone wants to know the answers to.  PlayStation also planned an event for this Wednesday.  We assume Sony is going to use this gathering to finally open  the kimono on the PlayStation Neo 4K capable upgrade to the PlayStation 4 console.  We might also see a PlayStation slim.  That's a thinner version that's rumored to be a pretty lackluster product  with few improvements to its predecessor.  T-Mobile's new unlimited ish plan.  T-Mobile one also launches this week on September 6th.  And finally, the XOXO Festival starts this week in Portland, Oregon.  That's a gathering of independent artists doing cool stuff on the Internet.  Headliners include Anita Sarkeesian of Feminist Frequency,  H.T.M.L. and CES expert Eric Meyer from Meyer Web, Sarah Jong from Motherboard and more.  We hope to cover some of these happenings and oh, so much more on tech news today.  Every day at 4 p.m. Pacific with Jason Howell right here on Twit.

Start time: 7008.70
End time: 7030.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Remember when E3 happened, you know, during WWC?  Yeah, no, this is I get it.  Sony might not have realized, although they should have,  because everybody had the rumors.  And when they were planning this event out, they're like  for nothing else, just the fact that like certain outlets are having to pick.  Do we cover Sony or do we cover Apple?  And in the right mind is going to choose Sony over Apple.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Wealthfront.  Wealthfront is a fabulous solution for anybody who is saving for the long haul.  And that should be you because of retirement, rainy day fun.  Maybe you're saving for a house down payment.  The kids college fund. Wealthfront solves a big issue.  What do you do with that money? How do you save?  You don't want to put it in a savings account.  That's not going to really grow at all.  That'd be like put in the mattress.  So you got to invest it.  But are you going to keep track of these investments?  I know a lot of us think I was cocky. I was that way.  Oh, I could do that. I read all the books.  And then you kind of forget about it and the thing kind of languishes.  And pretty soon you realize it didn't work out so well.  Or maybe you go to an advisor.  That guy down the street charges one, two or three percent.  Yes, every year of what they manage.  That means you have to make one, two or three percent more just to break even.  Not to mention the hidden fees, the transaction costs, all of that.  Frankly, some of these advisors, many of them are charging or are buying stocks  because they get a cut or they're or they get a fee every time you buy and sell.  So they make you do it more than you need to. Not with Wealthfront.  Wealthfront has no hidden fees, no commissions, no transaction costs.  And and you pay one quarter of one percent a year,  not one, two or three percent, but one quarter of one percent a year.  And that's because it's a computer.  Well, France's software that's designed not to pay attention  every quarter or every month, but all the time,  constantly rebalancing your investments  to maximize your return based on your needs, your your time frame,  your your tolerance of risk.  They'll even do things like tax loss harvesting.  It's kind of complicated.  Most advisors don't even know about Wealthfront.  I want you to take a look.  I don't you don't need to start.  Although you can get started with as little as five hundred dollars.  But I would like you to take a look at what they do.  And when you go to Wealthfront dot com slash tweet,  you can get their free portfolio review.  Give them your portfolio show.  It will show you what part is risk, you know, risky,  whether it's well diversified, what your fees are,  what your tax bill could be and how you could save money.  It's really useful information.  They'll even generate a portfolio.  The exact portfolio they'd invest for you after you answer a few questions.  It's really cool. And the software is based on the best books.  All those books I read,  people like Charles D.  Ellis and Burton Malkiel, they've got 200 years of  stock market experience on their board.  It's really, really well done.  They use ETFs, which is a smart way to give you a very low cost,  but very diversified investment. Read about it.  They just introduced their five twenty nine college savings plan,  which is like a Roth IRA for higher education expenses.  Great for kids or grandkids.  There is a reason Wealthfront is growing like crazy.  Three billion dollars in client assets.  I there you've seen the article.  I just saw one in Wall Street Journal where the traditional brokers  are moaning about the fact that this computerized trading  just does a better job, frankly, and cuts them right out of the equation.  Visit Wealthfront.com slash twit. Here's one more good deal.  If you sign up there, your first fifteen thousand dollars,  not for one quarter of one percent, but free for life.  So you can really get a nest egg started there.  Wealthfront.com slash twit.  All right. I mentioned some stories, but but let's start  with you, Dr. Your story of the week.

I'm sure they were.  He also says, look, I mean, countries, cities in this country  do that all the time. They do.  States do tax breaks to get the development, to get the country's  companies to come into the state or come into the city.  We'll give you some breaks because in the long run,  we're going to get more jobs and we're going to get more tax money  than if somebody else wins you.  So we're going to. And I think that's what Ireland did.  The EU said they did it illegally.  If the EU wants to fine Ireland, fine.  But to retroactively demand 14 and a half billion dollars from Apple.
